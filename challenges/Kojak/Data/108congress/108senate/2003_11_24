Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. 1, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Conference report to accompany H.R. 1, an act to amend \n     Title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide for a \n     voluntary prescription drug benefit under the Medicare \n     Program and to strengthen and improve the Medicare Program, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time until \n12:30 shall be equally divided between the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee or his designee and the Democratic leader or his designee, \nwith the last 10 minutes prior to the vote to be allocated between the \nDemocratic leader for 5 minutes to be followed by the majority leader \nfor the final 5 minutes.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to state the plan for \ntoday. Under the previous order, the cloture vote will occur today at \n12:30. The debate time until that vote is limited, and Members will \nonly be allocated short debate times. The cloture vote on the \nconference report will be the first vote of the day. It is the leader's \nhope and expectation that cloture will be successful. Once cloture is \ninvoked, the leader hopes we will be able to proceed to a vote on the \npassage of the Medicare prescription drug bill in very short order \nafter that.\n  On our side, we are obviously going to start with the Senator from \nNew Hampshire. But since the time is very tight, probably most Members \nwould be limited to 5 minutes or less, beyond that of Senator Gregg. I \nwould like to make sure people are very orderly as they come over here \nand ask me for time. I cannot speak for the Democratic side, but for \nthe Republican side, it is very essential for people to be here and be \nready to speak.\n  Does the Democratic whip wish to be recognized?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, if my distinguished friend will yield.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have, on this side, a number of people \nwho wish to speak. It is my understanding, to make this debate fair, \nthat on this side the time will be given to those who are opposed to \ncloture being invoked. So the people who speak on this side will be \nopposed to cloture. I want all the people who have asked for time on \nthis side to understand that. And we are--this is just for Democrats--\nwe are going to give 9 minutes to the following Senators, and in no \nnecessary order. Whoever is here can speak. They should all be alerted \nthat if there are quorum calls, they are going to lose time. So, Mr. \nPresident, I would, on our side, grant 9 minutes to Senators Akaka, \nLautenberg, Kerry, Lieberman, Dodd, Clinton, Mikulski, Pryor, Kennedy, \nwith Kennedy to have the last time before the Democratic leader speaks, \nclosing the debate.\n  Now, again, I want to tell those listening, this side is for those \nwho oppose cloture.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, could I make an inquiry?\n  Mr. REID. Yes. And I think it would be better if we alternated back \nand forth until 12:30.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. That is the point I wanted to make.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, today we stand on the threshold of a truly \nhistoric moment. Not for Republicans. Not for Democrats. Or for the \nHouse of Representatives. Or the United States Senate. But, for over 40 \nmillion American seniors and individuals with disabilities, who may \nfinally be getting prescription drug coverage under Medicare.\n  Saturday morning, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 1, the \n``Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of \n2003.''\n  Also Saturday, President Bush called upon the Senate, once again, to \nfinish the job. He urged us to send him legislation that will provide \nbadly needed prescription drugs to seniors.\n  For years, Congress has debated whether, and how, to provide \nprescription drug coverage to seniors and to strengthen and improve the \nMedicare program. Now, it is time for us to Act.\n  Mr. President, this generation of seniors survived the depression, \nfought World War II, and helped make the United States into a \nprosperous and thriving Nation. Time and again, they stepped forward to \nserve. Now, is the time to fulfill our duty to that great generation. \nNow is the time to answer their call.\n  What President Lyndon Johnson said in 1965 still stands:\n\n     . . . No longer will this Nation refuse the hand of justice \n     to those who have given a lifetime of service and wisdom and \n     labor to the progress of this . . . country.\n\n  Let us not stay that hand of justice now. Let us not turn our back on \nAmerica's seniors and individuals with disabilities.\n  There are nearly one quarter of a million seniors in my home State of \nTennessee who have no prescription drug coverage. There are millions \nmore across the Nation for whom this legislation, literally, means the \ndifference between life and death. They cannot afford to wait any \nlonger. I have treated thousands of Medicare patients. And I know \nfirsthand that, without Medicare, millions of seniors would not have \nreceived needed medical services. Millions more would have faced \nfinancial ruin. Medicare has helped save and heal lives.\n  But this cherished program has failed to keep pace with medical and \nscientific progress. Prescription drugs are an integral part of modern \nmedicine. They are as important as the surgeon's knife. Yet, they are \nnot part of the Medicare program.\n  In the nearly four decades since the Medicare program was created, \nthe American medical system has transformed from one focused on \ntreating episodic illness in hospitals to one characterized by an \nincreasing emphasis on managing and preventing chronic disease in \noutpatient settings with advanced medical technologies and prescription \ndrugs. Life expectancy has increased by nearly ten years. Death rates \nassociated with heart disease have been cut in half, and new treatments \nand diagnostic tools have improved survival rates for prostate, colon, \nand breast cancer. Our medical and scientific knowledge and, along with \nit, our ability to treat illness and disease has improved dramatically \nover the past four decades. Yet, Medicare itself has not kept pace with \nthese dramatic changes. It has been too inflexible and bureaucratic. \nDesigned for the 1960s health care system, it has been unable to adapt \nto changing medical practice. Medicare does not provide true preventive \ncoverage, disease management, or protection against catastrophic health \ncare costs.\n  As a result, we have today glaring and unacceptable gaps in the \ncoverage that is available to seniors and individuals with \ndisabilities--the most obvious of which is the lack of prescription \ndrug coverage.\n  Over the past three decades, for example, the death rate from \natherosclerosis has declined by over 70 percent and deaths from \nischemic heart disease have declined more than 6 percent, largely due \nto the advent of beta blockers and ACE inhibitors. During the same \nperiod, death rates from emphysema have dropped nearly 60 percent due \nto new treatments involving anti-inflammatory medications and \nbronchodilators.\n\n[[Page S15671]]\n\n  Today, over 600 medicines are under development to treat or prevent \ndiabetes, cancer, heart disease, stroke, neurological diseases, and \nother debilitating illness. Nearly 400 drugs have been produced during \nthe past decade alone.\n  But, under today's Medicare, these drugs simply are not available to \nseniors.\n  We must act to ensure that this generation of seniors, and the next, \nhas access to the healing miracles of modern medicine. And we must act \nto provide our seniors, and the next generation of seniors, with true \nhealth care security: quality preventive care, affordable prescription \ndrugs, protection from catastrophic health care costs, better \ncoordinated care, disease management, and access to modern technology.\n  As voluntary prescription drug coverage the bipartisan bill we are \ndebating today takes a major step in that direction. It devotes $400 \nbillion over the next decade to adding a new, voluntary prescription \ndrug benefit to the Medicare program. And it takes concrete steps to \nspeed less expensive generic drugs to the market to help make \nprescription drugs more affordable for all Americans.\n  Within months after this legislation is signed into law, seniors will \nbe able to get a voluntary Medicare-approved prescription drug discount \ncard that will reduce the costs of their drugs by an estimated 10-25 \npercent. Lower income seniors will get an additional subsidy of $600 on \ntop of these discounts to help them purchase needed medicines. Thus, \nseniors will get immediate relief even before the comprehensive drug \nbenefit is fully implemented, with additional help for those who need \nit the most.\n  Beginning in 2006, seniors will have access to the new drug benefit. \nThose who wish to add the new prescription drug benefit to their \ntraditional Medicare coverage will have that choice. The new drug \nbenefit is completely voluntary and available to all seniors. \nAppropriately, it provides the most generous help to lower income \nseniors and those with catastrophic drug costs.\n\n\n            substantial assistance for lower income seniors\n\n  Seniors with incomes below 135 percent of the Federal poverty line \n($11,648 for individuals and $14,965 for couples) will pay no premiums, \nno deductibles, and only a modest co-payment for their comprehensive \ncoverage. Beneficiaries with incomes below 150 percent of poverty \n($12,942 for individuals and $16,327 for couples) will pay only a \nportion of the premium and a $50 deductible. After that, the government \nwill subsidize 85 percent of their drug costs.\n  In my home State, over 430,000 low income Medicare beneficiaries--\nnearly half of all beneficiaries in Tennessee--will have exceptional \nprescription drug coverage under this bipartisan plan. One quarter of a \nmillion Tennessee seniors who today have no prescription drug coverage \nat all will gain access under this proposal, along with millions more \nacross the Nation.\n\n\n                  improvements to traditional medicare\n\n  The legislation also strengthens and improves the traditional \nMedicare Fee for Service program. It adds new preventive coverage for \ndiabetes and cardiovascular disease. For the first time, Medicare will \ncover initial preventive physical examinations. And this agreement \nresponds to the six percent of seniors with chronic disease who account \nfor about 50 percent of all Medicare spending. The legislation will \nlaunch a series of major pilot programs on disease management and \nquality payment incentives that could result in dramatic improvements \nin the care of the most ill and the most needy. This will help us \nbetter target health care resources to those who require it most.\n  The legislation also puts in place national standards for electronic \nprescribing, along with incentives for doctors to fill prescriptions \nelectronically. These reforms should dramatically improve medication \ntherapy management, reduce medical errors, and improve patient safety.\n  As the Senator from Montana, the Ranking Member of the Senate Finance \nCommittee, has said so eloquently during these past several days, this \nbill does nothing to destroy the existing Medicare program. In fact, it \nimmensely strenghtnes the traditional Medicare program.\n  As my colleagues know, this legislation has received broad support \nfrom well over 350 organizations, including from the AARP--which \nrepresents 35 million seniors. In its letter of endorsement last week, \nthe AARP also makes clear that, at a result of this legislation, \n``millions of older Americans and their families will be helped by this \nlegislation.'' In addition, AARP writes: ``The integrity of Medicare \nwill be protected.''\n\n\n                        new health care choices\n\n  Today, most seniors choose to enroll in the traditional Medicare Fee \nfor Service program. But this may not be the best choice for all \nseniors, and it may not be the choice of all seniors in the future.\n  There are about five million seniors who are covered by private \nhealth plans under the Medicare program today. Beginning immediately, \nthe legislation will strengthen Medicare's local HMO coverage. It will \nhelp stabilize and improve the coverage of those five million seniors \nin the current Medicare+Choice program. As a result, Medicare+Choice \nwill become a more stable, secure, and strong option for those seniors \nwho have already chosen to enroll in coordinated care plans.\n  This bipartisan plan also provides seniors with even more choices--\nthe choice to enroll in regional preferred provider organizations--or \nPPOs. The majority of Americans under age 65 get health coverage \nthrough PPOs. Most members of Congress, Federal employees, and Federal \nretirees also get coverage through PPOs. Employees covered by PPOs \nreport high levels of satisfaction with their coverage. PPOs typically \nprovide coverage for preventive care, chronic care management, disease \nmanagement, and access to a broad range of doctors and hospitals.\n  Under the bipartisan agreement, seniors will have the opportunity to \nparticipate in these innovative plans if they choose.\n  Moreover, beginning in 2010, we will test on a limited basis whether \nthese private health plans provide higher quality than traditional \nMedicare. We will also test whether Medicare private health plans are \nmost cost effective than traditional Medicare. All beneficiaries will \nbe protected during this test. And the demonstration cannot be expanded \nor extended unless Congress acts to do so.\n  Throughout, seniors will always be able to stay in the traditional \nMedicare program. And they will have the option of adding prescription \ndrug coverage. Meanwhile, tomorrow's seniors, many of whom are covered \nthrough PPOs now, may choose to continue private coverage when they \nretire. We are looking down the road to prepare for the baby boom \npopulation. We need to be ready now, not scrambling when it is too \nlate.\n\n\n               strengthening health care in rural america\n\n  This bill contains the most sweeping and strong rural provisions ever \nin a Medicare bill to come before this Congress. It also makes \nimprovements to payments for graduate medical education and takes \nconcrete measures to protect seniors' access to physicians.\n  For example, hospitals in my home State of Tennessee will receive \n$655 million under this legislation. Physicians, who otherwise would \nface real cuts next year of 4.4 percent, would instead see a 1.5 \npercent payment increase in both 2004 and 2005. I am very proud that \nthe American Hospital Association, the Tennessee Medical Association, \nthe American Hospital Association, the Tennessee Hospital Association, \nthe American Association of Medical Colleges, and the Alliance for \nSpecialty Medicine strongly support this legislation. The bill has also \nreceived strong support from the Rural Health Care Association, the \nRural Hospital Coalition and the Coalition for Geographic Equity in \nMedicare.\n\n\n                  controlling prescription drug costs\n\n  Some of my colleagues have said that this legislation does nothing to \ncontrol prescription drug costs. I respectfully disagree.\n  First of all, under this bill, seniors will be able to get a drug \ndiscount card right away. They will be able to present their Medicare \ndiscount card to their pharmacist and receive a 10 to 25 percent cut \nright off of the top.\n  This bill also works to contain drug costs before the drugs get to \nthe pharmacist's shelf. It does so in a number of ways. The bill speeds \ngeneric drugs to the market. It encourages competition\n\n[[Page S15672]]\n\nto lower prices, and it gives the Medicare recipient new power to \ncomparison shop.\n  Let's start with the generic drug provisions. In 1984, Congress \npassed the Hatch-Waxman law to encourage cheaper generic drugs to come \nonto the market. Under that law, generic competition has flourished. \nWhen the law was passed, generics drugs were less than 20 percent of \nthe market. Today, generic drugs represent nearly 50 percent of the \nentire market.\n   The Hatch-Waxman Act has been incredibly successful in allowing \nconsumers to get low cost alternatives. But there have been some \nabuses. Therefore, we are moving to close loopholes in the system \nthrough this bill. And the core of the provisions build on the work of \nSenator Gregg and Senator Schumer.\n   Under the new system, a new drug applicant will receive only one 30-\nmonth stay of approval of a generic drug's application. This is a major \nchange. Under the old system, drug companies could receive multiple \nstays of approval for generic rivals. Now, they will get one stay only.\n   The agreement takes additional steps to get generic drugs to the \nmarket faster--through which patients will get safe, effective, low \ncost generic drug alternatives to brand name medicines.\n   That is why this bill is supported by the Generic Pharmaceutical \nAssociation and the Coalition for a Competitive Pharmaceutical Market.\n   the bipartisan Medicare agreement also empowers drug plans to \nnegotiate discounts from drug companies. The Congressional Budget \nOffice says that this approach will enable drug plans to significantly \ncontrol drug costs for their beneficiaries.\n   Moreover, the savings they negotiate will not be subject to Federal \nlimits. They will be able to get the lowest prices possible, even if \nthose prices are lower than those negotiated under Medicaid. The \nCongressional Budget Office has estimated that this provision alone \nwill save $18 billion dollars.\n   Not only will the Medicare agreement help lower prices, it will help \ngive consumers more information about their medical options. This bill \nexpands Federal research into the comparative effects of different \ndrugs and treatments.\n   With this new information, seniors will be able to comparison-shop \nin the medical marketplace, just like they would for any other product \nor service. Patients and their doctors will be able to compare \ntreatment options and choose the course of action that best addresses \ntheir medical needs. And Medicare and health consumers will get better \nvalue for their money.\n\n\n                        Health Savings Accounts\n\n   I am also very pleased that this legislation will make tax-preferred \nHealth Savings Accounts available to all Americans. HSAs will help \ncontrol costs over time, and give individuals the ability to better \ncontrol their health care dollars and health care decisions.\n   I wish we could have gone even father. I wish we could have added \nprovisions from the House bill that would have allowed individuals to \nroll over some funds each year from their flexible spending accounts. I \nalso believe we must do more in the coming years to allow individuals \nto invest funds on a tax-free basis to meet their health care needs in \nretirement, just as we do with 401(k) plans and Individual Retirement \nAccounts. I am committed to coming back and addressing these issues in \nthe years ahead.\n\n\n                 Demographic and Structural Challenges\n\n   Our first priority must be to provide seniors with health security. \nBut, at the same time, we know that Medicare also faces serious \nfinancial and demographic pressures in the coming years. Between now \nand 2030 the number of seniors will nearly double from 40 million to 77 \nmillion; the program's costs will more than double to nearly $450 \nbillion annually, even before we add prescription drug coverage or \nimprove other benefits; the number of taxpayers paying into the system \nto finance health coverage for seniors will drop from 4 today, to 2.4 \nby 2030; seniors, who represent 12 percent of the population today, \nwill represent 22 percent of the population in 2030; and one last fact: \neach senior will be in the Medicare program longer. Life expectancy at \nage 65 will increase approximately 10 percent over the next 30 years.\n   The demographic underpinning has been defined: more seniors; each \nsenior living longer; and fewer workers to support each senior.\n   So, while we need to act to provide prescription drug coverage to \nseniors, we also need to do so responsibly. This legislation takes an \nimportant first step in linking Medicare payments to quality. It also \nrelies on competitive market forces to help control health care \nspending.\n  Moreover, for the first time in Medicare's history, we will ask those \nseniors who can afford to pay more for their coverage, to do so. And we \nwill put in place more accurate and more transparent measurements of \nMedicare's fiscal strength--as well as special procedures for \nattempting to better control Medicare spending growth in the future.\n  These reforms do not go far enough for some of my colleagues. At the \nsame time, they go too far for others. Overall, however, I believe this \nis a balanced, bipartisan bill that is worthy of the support of the \nUnited States Senate.\n  It is not a perfect bill. But, it is a meaningful step in the right \ndirection. It will provide substantial relief from high prescription \ndrug costs for millions of seniors. It will help rectify payment \ninequities for rural health care providers. And it will begin to inject \ninto the Medicare program new health care choices and much needed \nflexibility so that seniors will have the option to choose the kind of \nhealth care coverage that best suits their needs.\n  Today, America is one step closer to being a more caring society for \nmillions of seniors and individuals with disabilities struggling with \nhigh prescription drug costs and outdated, often inadequate medical \ncare. Today, we are one step closer to providing real health security \nto seniors all across the Nation.\n  As a physician, I have written thousands of prescriptions that I knew \nwould go unfilled because patients could not afford them. With this \nbill, that will change. As a senator, I have watched as a decades-old \nMedicare program has operated without flexibility, and without \ncomprehensive and coordinated preventive care, disease management and \ncatastrophic protection against high out-of-pocket medical costs. With \nthis bill, that will change also.\n  This legislation is historic. By dramatically expanding opportunities \nfor private sector innovation, it offers the possibility of genuine \nreform that can dramatically improve the quality of care available to \nseniors. At the same time, the legislation preserves traditional \nMedicare for those who choose it. It combines the best of the public \nand private sectors and gives today's seniors innovative health care \noptions and positions Medicare to serve tomorrow's seniors as well.\n  This legislation is possible because of the work and dedication of \nevery Member. I would like to take a moment to thank those whose \ncommitment was critical to this effort. First and foremost, Chairman \nCharles Grassley and Ranking Member Max Baucus deserve credit. As does \nSenator John Breaux who joined me six years ago on the Bipartisan \nCommission on Medicare and again on this Conference Committee. All \nMembers of the Conference Committee showed a degree of dedication and \nresolve seldom seen in either Chamber, especially Senators Hatch, \nNickles, and Kyl. But we wouldn't have reached this point without \nbuilding on the strong foundation laid by Members over the last several \nyears, especially Senators Snowe, Jeffords, Gregg, Hagel, Ensign and \nWyden. Finally, the Senate could not have done this alone. The House \nLeadership, Speaker Hastert and Leader DeLay, deserve special \nrecognition, as does the Chairman of the Conference, Chairman Bill \nThomas, and the Chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, \nChairman Billy Tauzin.\n  In closing, I would like to thank again every member of this body who \nhas worked so hard on this legislation--not just in this year, but in \nthe previous six years of our most recent effort to strengthen and \nimprove Medicare. I urge every Senator to support this bill. I implore \nevery Senator to avoid filibusters and other partisan political \nmaneuvers that threaten the prescription drug coverage, and health\n\n[[Page S15673]]\n\ncare security, our seniors need and deserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from \nNew Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire is \nrecognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to express my concerns about the proposal \nbefore us. I think it has to be put in the proper context. This is a \n$400 billion subsidy over the 10 years that it exists, but over the \nactuarial life of this program, it is a $7 trillion subsidy--$7 \ntrillion. It is not paid for.\n  Now, I have heard a number of speakers come to this floor and say \nthis drug benefit is paid for by the senior citizens. Well, unlike the \npast, where seniors paid into their HI accounts, their health insurance \naccounts, and paid for their Medicare, that is not the case with this \ndrug benefit. This drug benefit will be paid for essentially by working \nAmericans who are working at the time that the seniors who benefit from \nthe drug benefit receive that benefit.\n  The real concern arises when the baby boom generation, which is my \ngeneration, retires, because at that point we are going to have a \nmassive influx of seniors into our system, and the cost that we--my \ngeneration--is going to put on the system is going to be dramatic.\n  It is so dramatic, in fact, that any child born today in the United \nStates immediately arrives with a debt of $44,000, which is what that \nchild will owe during their working life in order to pay for my and my \ncontemporaries'--baby boomers'--benefits under Medicare, and we are \ngoing to take that $44,000 debt, which a child who is born today has, \nand we are going to add, with this bill, an additional $15,000--an \nadditional $15,000--on top of the $44,000. That is why I have concerns \nabout this bill.\n  I believe we need a drug benefit for seniors, for low-income seniors \nwho cannot afford the drugs which they are presently receiving. I \nbelieve we need a drug benefit which addresses the problem of a senior \nwho ends up, because of their drug costs, being wiped out of all their \nbasic assets; a catastrophic drug benefit, in other words.\n  But while we move down the road toward that type of a drug benefit, \nwe have to, at the same time, reform the underlying Medicare system so \nthat it is affordable, so that my children and the children of other \nMembers of the baby boom generation do not end up paying so much to \nsupport health care for us, the retired, that their lives are \ndepredated, that their quality of life is reduced.\n  Under the bill before us, unfortunately, although it has an attempt \nto address the low-income issue, and although it has an attempt to \naddress the catastrophic issue, there is no significant attempt to \naddress the reform issue. So the practical effect of this bill is that \nit puts in place a massive new benefit without any control over the \ncosts of the underlying Medicare system. And the effect of that is that \nthe children of the seniors of tomorrow--basically, my children and my \ngrandchildren and the children of anybody who was born after 1940--will \nend up paying a huge amount in order to support us in our retirement.\n  This bill, put quite simply, is the largest intergenerational tax \nincrease in the history of this country, and it should not be \nsugarcoated. It is a massive tax increase being placed on working, \nyoung Americans and Americans who have not yet been born in order to \nsupport a drug benefit for retired Americans and Americans who are \nabout to retire, without any underlying reform to try to control the \ncost so that tax is not so high that it overwhelms the ability of our \nchildren and our children's children to live the quality of life that \nwe have lived.\n  It seems incredibly unfair for one generation to do this to another \ngeneration, for us to use our political clout because we are in office \nto benefit our generation at the expense of our children and our \nchildren's children. Yet that is what, essentially, this bill does. It \nattempts reform, but it does not accomplish reform. It claims to have, \nin the year 2010, some sort of competitive model, but the competitive \nmodel is PPOs. It says it has cost containment, but it really does not \nhave cost containment at all.\n\n  Then, in one of the true ironies of the bill, it takes people who \nalready have private plans which are paid for by the private sector and \nmoves those people into public plans, so we end up paying almost $100 \nbillion to subsidize private plans to stay private. What an outrageous \napproach. First we produce a plan that is going to cost our children $7 \ntrillion over the next 10 years, and then we say we are going to pay \n$100 billion to the private sector to keep in place plans which they \nalready plan to keep in place. They call that ``reform.'' Very hard to \nunderstand.\n  The way the drug benefit is structured, utilization is obviously \ngoing to go through the roof because there is no incentive for people \nto be conscientious purchasers; there is simply an incentive to go out \nand purchase. I suppose that is because this is some sort of drug \ninitiative that makes it more likely drugs will be purchased. But to \nhave no cost incentives in place to control the rate of growth of the \ndrug plan through control utilization is foolish.\n  There are good parts to the bill. There is the savings account, but \nthat is $6 billion. There is a physician increase payment. That is $6 \nbillion. That is $12 billion over the 10 years. We could have afforded \nthat. There is the rural initiative, $25 billion. That gets you up to \n$40 billion. That is still only one-tenth of the cost of the whole \nprogram. We are spending $400 billion over 10 years to do what the plan \nhas valued at $40 billion of quality.\n  We could have gotten where we wanted to go if we had put in place a \nreasonable plan for low-income seniors, put in place a catastrophic \nplan so seniors would not have their income wiped out, assets wiped out \nby the cost of drugs, and at the same time put in place significant \nMedicare reform so that at the end of the day our children would know \nthat, yes, they were going to have to pay more for their parents' drug \ncosts but their parents were going to have to be more conscientious \npurchasers of health care and the health care system that was \ndelivering those drug benefits to their parents was going to be more \nefficient and of a higher quality.\n  But that was not the process developed. The process developed, \nunfortunately, was developed to get us through the next election, to be \nable to say in the next election, we put in place a drug benefit at the \nexpense of the children of tomorrow who will find during their working \nlives they are going to have to now pay $7 trillion of unfunded \nliability to support a program which has essentially no reform and no \ncost containment in it and, as a result, as I mentioned before, \nreflects the single largest tax increase in this country that one \ngeneration has put on another generation, a grossly unfair act and one \nthat should embarrass us as a Congress and certainly does not fulfill \nthe obligations we have as parents moving toward retirement.\n  This bill may well be well intentioned. I happen to think it is \npolitically driven. But in the end, the results will be the same, \nwhether it is well intentioned or politically driven. We will have put \non the books a program which is going to cause our children and our \nchildren's children to have a lower quality of life than we have had. \nAnd we, as the people taking advantage of that program, will have \nbeen asked to take no actions that are responsible in the area of \ncontaining the costs of our health care delivery system.\n\n  As Republicans, we should be affronted by this. It goes against \neverything our party has always stood for, which is that government \nshould be delivered in a responsible and efficient way--not in a way \nthat simply throws money at an issue for the purposes of political \ngain. Unfortunately, we have chosen that second path in this bill and \nin the process we will be passing a tax increase that will cause our \nchildren and our children's children to have less of a quality of life \nthan we have had.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I make an announcement to Democrat Senators. \nI have spoken and said this time will be set aside for those who are \nopposed to cloture, but I think that is too restrictive. We want to \nmake sure there is good debate this morning. Some people\n\n[[Page S15674]]\n\nhave not had an opportunity to speak, so our time will be for those who \nare opposed to the legislation, the bill itself. They can make up their \nmind whatever they want to do on cloture.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the names I read before--Senators Akaka, \nLautenberg, Dodd, Kerry, Lieberman, Clinton, Mikulski, Pryor, and \nKennedy--all be allotted 9 minutes, the amount of time on the \nDemocratic side that they would be entitled to, and no more. I ask \nconsent that that order be entered.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition to \nthis bill, a Medicare prescription drug benefit in name only that has \nvery few benefits for the seniors in my State. In June of this year, I \nvoted for a bipartisan Senate bill which, while not perfect, was a good \nstep toward providing our seniors with the prescription drug help they \nneed.\n  Let us be clear. This legislation does nothing to lower the cost of \nprescription drugs. The Congressional Budget Office says this \nlegislation will actually cause prescription drug prices to increase by \n3.5 percent. Under this legislation, Arkansans will not be able to \nreimport cheap FDA-approved drugs from other industrialized countries, \nand this legislation expressly prohibits the Federal Government from \nnegotiating with drug companies to bring down the high cost of \nprescription drugs.\n  This means that our seniors will continue to pay more for their \nprescription drugs than anybody else in the world. It means they will \ncontinue to pay much more for their drugs than do our neighbors in \nCanada.\n  This means that a woman in America suffering from breast cancer will \ncontinue to be charged over $90 a month to take tamoxifen, while the \nsame drug, made by the same company, can be bought in Canada for $22 \nfor a month.\n  This means that people in my State will continue to pay: 37 percent \nmore for cholesterol controlling Lipitor; 50 percent more for the anti-\ndepressant Paxil, and 58 percent more for the arthritis drug Vioxx.\n  For the last decade drug spending has been driving up the cost of \nhealth care and placing affordable coverage out of reach for many \nAmericans. We finally got our chance to help these seniors by lowering \nthe cost of prescription drugs, but this bill wastes that opportunity.\n  It is bad enough our seniors are getting gouged by artificially high \nprices in the United States. I strongly believe we need to fix that. \nBut now, with the passage of this bill, if indeed it passes, we are \ntalking about taxpayers' dollars. Not only is it the right thing to fix \nit, it is our duty that we fix it.\n  Under this legislation, thousands of Arkansans will be worse off than \nwhen they started. According to the CBO, 2.7 million Americans are \nexpected to lose their retiree health care benefits as a result of this \nlegislation. That includes 19,000 Arkansas seniors. In addition, under \nthis bill, 109,100 Arkansas Medicaid beneficiaries will receive worse \ncoverage than what they get now and they will face considerable new \nrestrictions on the drugs they can take.\n  Mr. President, 40,750 fewer seniors in Arkansas will qualify for low-\nincome protections against the assets test and lower qualifying income \nlevels. I, for one, do not believe that rural Americans living on a \nfarm should be penalized because they own a tractor or other farm \nequipment. And 11,020 Medicare beneficiaries will pay more for Part B \npremiums because of income.\n  This bill also starts us down the treacherous path to dismantling \nMedicare as we know it. It takes $12 billion away from Medicare and \ngives it to private insurers and then forces Medicare to compete with \nheavily subsidized HMOs.\n  This allows private insurers to cherry-pick the healthiest and \nwealthiest people to their plans while leaving the poorest and the \nsickest in Medicare to pay more in premiums. People need to know that \nthis bill was written to accommodate 400 corporate lobbyists, many of \nwhom work for the pharmaceutical industry. It amazes me that we would \nseek permission from the pharmaceutical lobby before we would do the \nright thing for the people we represent. It amazes me even more that \n400 lobbyists have more influence over Congress than the 40 million \npeople who are currently enrolled in Medicare.\n  People need to know that the pharmaceutical industry is going to be \nhanded a taxpayer-subsidized windfall with the passage of this bill. \nAnalysts at Goldman Sachs project the new Medicare benefit could \nincrease industry revenue by 9 percent or about $13 billion a year. And \nit is no coincidence that as details of this legislation began leaking \nout, pharmaceutical stock prices have risen steadily. In the last week \nalone, the value of Pfizer's stock increased by $19 billion.\n  I direct my colleagues to this bar graph behind me. The large bar \nrepresents Pfizer and the $19 billion they have increased in worth over \nthe last week. Now look at the other bar, this little bitty bar, this \nsmall bar that you may have to squint and look closely to see because \nthere isn't much there. This bar represents the entirety of the cost \nsavings provisions related to generic drugs and reimportation. Seniors \nwill save over the next 10 years $.06 billion. To reiterate, we have a \n$19 billion increase in the value of a company over 1 week, and a $.06 \nbillion savings for seniors in the Medicare system over 10 years.\n  It is very easy to figure out who are the real winners and who are \nthe real losers in this bill. Let me say in conclusion, there are some \npeople in this body who believe we need this bill right now because the \nseniors have been waiting such a long time. They have. But from the \nseniors I have talked to personally when I was home in Little Rock over \nthe weekend, to the hundreds who have called my office in the last \nweek, they don't just want to get it done. They want us to get it done \nright. There is a big difference in just getting this bill done and \ngetting it done right.\n  They want more than hollow promises that this legislation offers. My \nplea is simple: Let's get it right so that our seniors can finally have \na real benefit. The bill we are voting on today will wind up doing more \nharm than good.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nWyoming. I urge people who are proponents of this bill and want me to \nyield them time to be here. When there is not anybody here, I will use \nsome of that time, but I am very glad to quit and put my statements in \nthe Record to accommodate my colleagues. It is just a case of if we \ndon't want to waste any of this valuable time, get over here.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I would say the \nsame thing. We have a long list of people who have said they want to \ncome. When our time is called and we are not here, that time will run \noff of our time. So the 9 minutes people have, that time will be \nlimited. If people come and want extra time, I would have to object to \nprotect other Senators.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, first let me thank the chairman of the \ncommittee who has worked so hard in bringing this proposal to the \nSenate floor. Not only has this been a part of his activity lately, but \nalso the Energy bill. The Senator from Iowa deserves a great deal of \nsupport for what he has done.\n  I am very pleased to support this first real opportunity that we have \nhad to modernize and strengthen Medicare, the first time in over 30 \nyears. I am a little surprised at how negative some of our friends are \nin terms of being able to take this opportunity. Nobody suggests \neverything is perfect in this bill, but there is a lot of good in this \nbill. It is our opportunity to move forward and put in a program for \nthe future.\n  Congress has no greater domestic challenge than strengthening and \nmodernizing the Medicare Program and providing seniors with access to \nprescription drugs. Remember that the House and the Senate both passed \na Medicare prescription drug bill earlier this year. It has taken \nCongress years to get to this point. This bill is not perfect, but I \ndon't think we should miss this opportunity to take some good steps in \nbringing Medicare into line with modern medical practices. We can't \nallow the opportunity to pass\n\n[[Page S15675]]\n\nthat will give us a chance to provide seniors with prescription drug \naccess. We can't let that slip through our fingers because of partisan \npolitics. Access to new technologies in Medicare currently takes an act \nof Congress. That is no way to run a program that cares for our \nelderly. We need to have a modern program in place. We need to improve \nthe quality of care for our sickest seniors and ensure they have access \nto appropriate medications.\n  The current Medicare Program is outdated and inefficient. There is \nabsolutely no effort to coordinate care for seniors with chronic \nillnesses with the most expensive prescription drug needs. Over 90 \npercent of Medicare dollars are spent caring for folks who have already \ngotten sick, the most expensive type of care. We only spend 10 percent \nof Medicare dollars on preventive medicine. We need to focus on those \nfolks as 6 percent of the seniors account for 55 percent of Medicare \ncosts.\n  Private plans are already making progress in implementing coordinated \ncare programs. Medicare needs to catch up. This is our opportunity to \nnot only allow for that but to provide for that.\n  It doesn't make sense that Medicare today will pay for extended \nhospital stays for ulcer surgery at a cost of about $28,000 per patient \nbut will not pay for drugs that eliminate the cause of ulcers, drugs \nthat cost about $500 a year. Another example how out of step with \nmodern medicine Medicare has become is that it will pay many of the \ncosts to treat a stroke which can be as high as $100,000. Yet Medicare \ndoes not cover blood thinning drugs that could prevent strokes that \ncost less than $1,000 a year.\n  We need to strengthen the Medicare Program and provide seniors with \nthe ability to choose the type of health care plan that fits their \nindividual needs, protections against catastrophic health costs, and \nassistance in purchasing necessary prescription drugs. We also have to \nensure rural seniors have access to the same choices as urban seniors. \nThe Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan has proven to be a good \nmodel for giving folks the same health plan choices no matter where \nthey live. I plan to monitor the implementation of the new Medicare \nAdvantage plans, PPOs, to ensure that rural seniors have access to the \nsame type of choices as urban seniors. While it is true this bill \ncurrently fits within the $400 billion that has been set aside in the \nbudget for Medicare, we all have concerns that it will cost more money \nthan we anticipate.\n  It is important that we monitor spending carefully or we will be \nplacing a huge burden on our children and grandchildren. There are \nspecific cost containment provisions that do the following: Trustees \nare required to notify Congress when general revenues are used to fund \n45 percent of the Medicare Program. If this situation is reported 2 \nyears in a row, it is called Medicare funding warning. After a Medicare \nfunding warning is issued, the President must submit a proposal to \nrespond within 15 days of submitting his budget. An expedited \nlegislative process is then laid out.\n  So it has taken years for Congress to agree to spend this $400 \nbillion in Medicare. It could easily take another decade for Congress \nto learn how to control Medicare spending.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield the Senator 3 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is recognized for 3 more \nminutes.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I thank the chairman. As I said, I happen \nto be cochair of the Senate rural health caucus. We have worked on \nprovider equity issues for a very long time. We have introduced over \ntime several pieces of legislation with our rural colleagues that \ncomprehensively address the payment disparity in the Medicare Program \nfor rural providers, hospitals, physicians, ambulances, home health \nagencies, and rural health clinics.\n  The majority of our health care plan has been incorporated into this \nMedicare prescription drug plan that is now before us, thanks very much \nto the chairman and ranking member. I am extremely pleased with the \nrural health provisions and thank Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus \nfor their work. The rural hospital provisions in the Senate Medicare \nbill will make the equalization of the standardized amount permanent to \nhospitals; it will equalize Medicare disproportionate share payments. \nThese payments assist hospitals where a large number of uninsured \npatients show up; it will lower the labor-related share from 71 to 62 \npercent.\n  Hospitals with fewer than 800 annual discharges will receive a 25-\npercent increase. It strengthens the Critical Access Hospital Program. \nIn my State, for instance, many of the small towns cannot afford full-\nservice hospitals, and we are moving toward critical access. This does \na great deal with that issue.\n  The bill provides flexibility within the 25-bed limit for acute care \nand swing beds.\n  Not only is this a general movement forward with regard to Medicare \nand pharmaceuticals, but it does level the playing field for urban and \nrural areas.\n  I ask my colleagues to keep the big picture in mind as we debate this \nlegislation. Seniors need assistance with prescription drugs now. Also, \nour rural health care delivery system cannot afford to wait for \nCongress any longer.\n  This bill is not perfect. No one said it is. We have concerns about \nthe cost, but as I stated, we have plans to monitor the PPOs, to \nmonitor the costs, to ensure seniors in rural areas have choices.\n  I do not believe we can walk away from the opportunity that is now on \nthe table and its importance to seniors and providers. For these \nreasons, I strongly support the proposal before us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, the real test of this bill, in the final analysis, is \nwhat it is really going to do for the senior population of the country. \nI know the arguments have been made forcefully that it is going to take \n$400 billion and give seniors something. But the test is not whether we \nare going to give them something, the test is whether or not we are \ngoing to do more harm than good.\n  I believe when we measure the overall impact of this legislation on \nseniors and on the overall Medicare system, the bottom line is this \ndoes more harm than good. That is why I believe the Senate should stop \nthe bill where it is.\n  Obviously, we would like to pass a prescription drug benefit. All of \nus want that. This bill could be better. It could be better by being \ncloser to what was sent out of the Senate which had the support of my \ncolleague, Senator Kennedy, and others because it did more good than \nharm. But this bill moves in the wrong direction because while it was \nin the conference with the House, it was loaded up with major giveaways \nto the drug companies, insurance companies, and has put some measures \nin such as the restraint on the ability of the Federal Government to \neven negotiate for bulk purchases and thereby lower costs, which is an \nextraordinary reduction in the ability of the Government to try to \nconstrain the costs overall of prescription drugs.\n  These are the reasons I think this bill does more harm than good:\n\n       No. 1, the prescription drug benefit for many is not \n     affordable, it is not comprehensive, and it is not \n     guaranteed. There are holes in coverage and complex rules. \n     The coverage gaps remain too high, and seniors are still \n     charged premiums even after their benefits shut down in the \n     so-called donut hole.\n\n  Seniors are not assured a Government fallback plan with a set \nnational premium. So if there are places where you don't have HMOs or \nthere are other problems, they are going to have increases in their \npremiums under Medicare. It seems we ought to have a fallback with some \nsort of fixed price that will be affordable. At least 3 million seniors \nare projected to lose their gold-plated retiree prescription drug plan \nand be forced into a lesser benefit under the Medicare plan.\n  The bill fails to adequately fix protections for low-income seniors \nand people with disabilities who currently rely on both Medicare and \nMedicaid for their coverage. That could cause as many as 6 million \npeople to pay more money for fewer benefits.\n  For seniors who think this bill is only designed to give them new \nbenefits, they are going to be shocked to\n\n[[Page S15676]]\n\nfind that this legislation actually raises $25 billion in new revenue \ndirectly out of the pockets of senior citizens by increasing the costs \nfor traditional Medicare coverage of doctor and hospital visits.\n  They will also be surprised to find out that while we are in such a \nrush to pass this bill, the benefit is not actually going to come to \nthem until 2006. In the meantime, seniors get a disingenuous discount \ncard. Most of them have four or five of the cards today anyway with the \nsame amount of reduction, and it will give them no more discount than \nany of those handful of cards available to them in the marketplace now.\n  The question ought to be asked: Why are we not beginning a Medicare \nprescription drug benefit until 2006? It took 11 months to put the \nentire Medicare Program in place. Are we telling seniors we can't, in \nthe age of computers, put a prescription drug benefit in place in a \nmatter of months? Why 2006?\n  We all understand why. It has to do with the private companies and \ntheir taking time to ramp up, the amount of money they are going to \nget, and the unaffordability today.\n  One of the biggest failures of this bill is its silence on \ncontrolling the rising prices of prescription drugs. Without an \neffective means to restrain double-digit drug price increases, this \nbill does nothing to protect seniors from ever-growing out-of-pocket \ncosts. When they are pushed off Medicare into HMOs and the HMOs raise \nthe prices, seniors are going to be screaming about the increased cost \nof prescription drugs.\n  This bill prohibits the Government, as I mentioned earlier, from \nusing its bulk purchasing power to negotiate volume discounts for \nMedicare prescription drugs. That doesn't make sense. In the State of \nMaine, they have done that with good results. It is interesting, they \nwere taken to the Supreme Court and challenged in their right to do \nthat, and the Supreme Court upheld their right to do that. As a \nconsequence, they are able to provide more affordable prescription \ndrugs to their citizens.\n  This bill is more about shifting medical costs to beneficiaries than \nactually reining in prescription drug costs.\n  In the name of private competition and to prevent the Federal \nGovernment from running the program, the Republicans came up with an \nunprecedented $12 billion slush fund to entice private plans to \nparticipate in this risky market. On top of giving them extra payments \nto participate, the bill does nothing to require that those private \nplans operate efficiently.\n  The Medicare Program in its entirety now spends only 2 percent of its \ntotal expenditures on administration. By contrast, many of the health \nplans in the private market often commit as much as 15 to 20 percent of \ntheir expenditures to administration. So every dollar that goes to \nadministrative costs is a dollar not available to improve benefits for \nMedicare beneficiaries. Smart stewards of taxpayer funds ought to \ndemand that private plans be more efficient if they want to \nparticipate.\n  So this bill is not just about adding a prescription drug benefit to \nMedicare, it is also a bill that represents an ideological excess by \nsome who want to force the traditional Medicare Program down the path \nto privatization.\n  Under this bill, 7 million seniors will be given this choice: pay \nmore for Medicare and get forced into an HMO, give up on choosing your \nown doctor and hospital or watch your bills skyrocket. This so-called \npremium support provision is, in my judgment, irresponsible and unfair.\n  The so-called cost containment provisions add insult to injury. By \nessentially placing a cap on future Medicare spending, this bill is \ngoing to attempt to force future Congresses to reconcile Medicare \nspending growth by cutting benefits, raising premiums, or increasing \nthe payroll tax. I think that is unacceptable.\n  In addition, this bill squanders another $6 billion on tax breaks for \nwealthy people, and that is going to have an impact in harming \nMedicare. The reason is that when a tax-free, high-deductible, \ncatastrophic health policy, known as a health savings account, is \ncreated, it is principally going to be used by those who have the money \nwho can afford it. The result is it is going to undermine traditional \nMedicare by cherry-picking the healthiest people and the wealthiest \nseniors out of the risk pool, thereby raising premiums by as much as 60 \npercent for those who are left behind.\n  In the end, we have to ask ourselves who wins and who loses in this \nbill. I think I have shown how seniors lose. So who wins? Well, \ninsurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, lobbyists, and special \ninterests of every stripe: A $125 billion to $139 billion bonanza, and \nthe stock market confirms it. My hope is we will go back to the table \nand come up with a measure closer to what the Senate originally did.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, it is my privilege to give 5 minutes to \nthe Senator from Montana, Mr. Baucus, whose cooperation with me and, \nhopefully, my cooperation with him has made this bipartisan agreement \non Medicare possible to bring about what we need to do for seniors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, with all due respect, while listening to \nsome speakers, including the previous speaker, I would ask what bill \nthey have been reading. It seems that they are referring to a bill \nwhich is not the conference report before us today. They are discussing \nproblems that might occur in the future. But the problems described are \nbased on some other bill, not the bill before us, not the conference \nreport.\n  The fact is that this legislation provides $400 billion for seniors. \nThat is a $400 billion entitlement for U.S. seniors that they do not \nhave today. I think we owe it to our American seniors to give them this \n$400 billion new entitlement for drug benefits. We are on the brink. We \nare close to passing it.\n  In each of the last several years, we have come close but we were not \nable to finish the job. I do not think we are going to have this \nopportunity again. I do not think the Budget Committee is going to set \naside $400 billion again, particularly with the increasing budget \ndeficits and current account deficits. We will not have this \nopportunity again.\n  This is a good bill. No bill is perfect. We are 535 Members of \nCongress. There are 535 people who have to work together to get \nsomething passed. This product before us today reflect this reality. It \nis $400 billion for seniors.\n  It is also much closer to the Senate bill than the House bill. I hear \ncomplaints that the conference report is not nearly as good as the \nSenate bill. These critics have not read the conference report. The \nconference report is better than the Senate bill in many respects. For \nexample, dual eligibles. The conference report covers low-income dual \neligibles through Medicare. I think most Senators agree this is a \nbetter policy than what was in the Senate bill.\n\n  We also have a solid fallback. It is wrong when Senators say there is \nno guaranteed prescription drug benefit to seniors. It is guaranteed in \nthis bill. Fee for service is held harmless in this bill in all \nrespects. So a senior can always get a standard prescription drug \nbenefit under this bill. Whether one takes it from a PDP, a private \ndrug plan, a PPO, or the fallback, this benefit is guaranteed for all \nseniors. Seniors will get their prescription drug benefits in this \nbill. It is guaranteed.\n  As I mentioned earlier, this benefit is an entitlement. It is a $400 \nbillion entitlement expansion we have tried to pass in past years but \nare only able to get passed now.\n  I have heard some Senators claim that this is not the Senate bill \nbecause it contains something called premium support, and it has a so-\ncalled slush fund. Let me remind Senators, the so-called premium \nsupport is extremely watered down from what was in the House bill. It \nis time limited to 6 years. Only six cities will be demonstration \nprojects. Low-income seniors in each of those six cities will be held \nharmless. They get full protection. In addition, the premiums for those \nwho are not low income are limited to a 5 percent change. Fee for \nservice Medicare is held harmless in all respects in those six cities \nwhere there may be a demonstration project. They are held harmless in \nall respects, except the\n\n[[Page S15677]]\n\nPart B premium may go up by no more than 5 percent. Any other change in \nthese demonstration areas has to be enacted by Congress--enacted by to \nCongress to extend, enacted by Congress to expand, enacted by Congress \nto change.\n  What has happened in the past when we have had these demos? They have \nbeen repealed. They have not been extended. In 1997, Congress set up \npremium support demonstration projects. Congress then rushed in to \nrepeal them as quickly as they possibly could. They were gone. The same \nwill happen here. Do my colleagues know why? Because the dollars \nprovided to private plans in the premium support demonstration areas \nwill be much less than in other parts in the country. The private plans \nwill not be able to survive.\n  Mark my word, those plans, those physicians, and those providers in \nthe demonstration MSAs are going to come to Congress and ask us to \nrepeal it.\n  Regarding this so-called $14 billion slush fund, $12 billion was in \nthe Senate bill, which seventy-six Senators voted for. This is just $2 \nmillion more, and it does not come out of the $400 billion for drug \nbenefits. That $400 billion for drug benefits is still there, but the \nconference report does have $2 billion more than the Senate bill, for \nwhich 76 Senators voted.\n  To close, I will return to my main point. This is a very good bill. \nWe have the opportunity now to provide prescription drug benefits for \nseniors. We are not going to have this opportunity in the future. \nBeneficiaries have waited a long time for this benefit. This bill is \nmuch closer to the Senate bill than it is to the House bill. If we do \nnot pass this now, I must ask you, what are we going to tell our \nseniors when they say to us, Mr. Senator, Ms. Senator, you told us you \nwere going to give us prescription drug benefits but you found some \nreason to say no and you voted against it and did not give it to us; \nwhy did you give us the help you promised?\n  We have an obligation to help our seniors pass this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the bill before \nus.\n  When the Senate first voted on a prescription drug benefit for \nseniors back in June I offered an amendment. My amendment was simple. I \nproposed that we give seniors a prescription drug benefit sooner rather \nthan later. But that amendment was voted down by the Republican \nmajority.\n  So now, under this conference report, the drug coverage doesn't start \nuntil January 2006 23 months from now. Yes, 2006.\n  So why so long? One clue is illustrated on this chart. Notice that \nElection Day is 11 months from now. And notice that the prolonged \neffective date for the drug benefit is conveniently well past election \nday.\n  I would like to remind my colleagues that the original Medicare plan \nwas signed into law by President Johnson on July 30, 1965 and 11 months \nlater July 1, 1966--all the people who were eligible for the program \nwere enrolled in the program.\n  The entire system was created from scratch in 11 months.\n  I know the President is desperate to take credit for passing a \nprescription drug bill when he faces voters next year. But he does not \nwant the many shortcomings in this plan to be fully evident to seniors \nuntil well after the election. My Republican friends are hoping that \nseniors won't find out what they don't get from this legislation until \nit is too late. It is almost a cruel joke.\n  When a prescription drug benefit is signed into law, all of our \noffices will be flooded with calls by seniors asking a simple question: \n``How can I sign up for this benefit?'' They will have seen President \nBush sign a bill with great fanfare, and they will have seen many \nMembers of Congress crowding the stage with him, and everyone will say \n``we have put a prescription drug benefit in place.''\n  And when seniors call to find out how soon they can receive the \nbenefit, we will have to tell them ``2006.'' Sorry, President Bush's \n2003 Medicare Prescription Drug plan will not start until 2006.\n  No one wants to provide a real Medicare prescription drug benefit to \nseniors more than the Democrats. After all, Democrats created Medicare, \nand we have protected it for decades.\n  Everyone knows that Republicans resisted the creation of Medicare and \nhave opposed it ever since. It wasn't too long ago that former House \nSpeaker Newt Gingrich expressed his desire to see Medicare ``wither on \nthe vine.''\n  Well, the bill before us today is the first major step toward the \ndisintegration of Medicare as we know it.\n  In reality, this bill isn't as much a benefit for seniors as it is a \nbig benefit for HMOs and other private sector special interests who \nwant to tear the Medicare program to pieces.\n  So, what is it specifically that the President is afraid seniors will \nfind out before 2006?\n  Is the President afraid that seniors will realize they are going to \npay at least $810 before they break even and get any benefit from this \nplan?\n  For many seniors that is more money than they spend on prescription \ndrugs right now. Up to 30 percent of beneficiaries would pay more for \nenrolling in the plan than they would receive in actual benefits.\n  Is the President worried that seniors are going to discover that \nthere is a huge gap in coverage?\n  Under this plan, a senior will pay a premium estimated at $35 a \nmonth, a $250 deductible, and 25 percent coinsurance payments until \nreaching $2,250 in drug expenses. What happens then? Seniors get no \ncoverage. You heard me correctly nothing, zero.\n  That is right. At that point, seniors will continue to pay their \npremiums but they will also pay 100 percent of their drug costs. Only \nuntil they have reached the catastrophic limit of $5,100 in drug costs \ndoes any benefit return. And by that time, seniors will have incurred \n$3,600 in out-of-pocket spending. This is called the ``hole in the \ndoughnut'' and it sure doesn't sound like such a good deal to me.\n  And remember that nowhere in this bill does it say that the premium \nis only $35. It could be significantly higher. The $35 figure is an \nestimate. We all know how good this administration has been at making \nestimates.\n  Is the President afraid that seniors will figure all this out? You \nbet he is.\n  Seniors deserve a much better program than what the Senate is \nconsidering right now, and they certainly deserve it before 2006.\n  There are some who will say we must have this gap in coverage because \nwe only have $400 billion to work with. Well, I say if there are \ninsufficient funds in the budget to give seniors real drug coverage, \nthen it is the result of choices made by the President and his party. \nThey chose to provide a massive tax cut to the wealthy the people who \nneed it least and they chose it at the expense of Medicare.\n  What else is in this bill that the Republican's don't want seniors to \nfind out about until 2006?\n  This bill will effectively destroy the Medicare program that has \nworked for almost 40 years. That is right. Say goodbye to Medicare as \nwe know it.\n  This bill does not expand Medicare; it opens the door for HMOs to \ntake over the program. And that means that seniors will be at the mercy \nof these HMOs. And as everyone knows, HMOs will not pay for all \nprescription drugs.\n  Under this bill, seniors will be limited to the prescription drugs \ncovered by their drug plan or HMO. In order to keep costs down, these \ndrug plans and HMOs will use something called a ``formulary.'' A \nformulary is a list of drugs that are covered under the health plan. If \na particular drug is not on the formulary then it is not covered.\n  That means that after a senior has paid her premium and her \ndeductible if she needs a certain medication not on the list used by \nher drug plan or HMO, then she will pay 100 percent of the cost of that \nmedication.\n  Where is the benefit in that?\n  Mr. President, this bill goes to great lengths to prop up and protect \nHMOs at the expense of seniors. Included in this bill is something \ncalled the ``Stabilization Fund.'' It should be called the ``HMO Slush \nFund.'' This fund is designed to ensure that HMOs succeed by offering \nartificially lower premiums and better benefits than traditional \nMedicare. This bill hands over $12 billion of taxpayer money for this \neffort.\n  This is $12 billion that could be used to close the coverage gap or \nlower the deductible but our Republican friends have made a choice to \ncreate a $12 billion slush fund for the insurance industry.\n\n[[Page S15678]]\n\n  I want to spend a few minutes talking about the overall impact of \nthis bill on seniors in the State I represent--New Jersey.\n  The most important reason why I am voting against this bill is \nbecause I am convinced that more seniors in my State will be hurt by \nthis legislation than helped.\n  There are approximately 1.1 million seniors in New Jersey.\n  Currently 430,000 New Jersey retirees receive prescription drug \ncoverage from their former employers. Because this bill provides a \ndisincentive to employers to continue offering coverage to retirees, \nover 90,000 seniors in New Jersey will lose their existing drug \ncoverage, which often offers more generous benefits.\n  This bill is also going to make poor seniors in my State worse off. \nIn New Jersey, Medicaid covers the drug costs for seniors up to 100 \npercent of the federal poverty level. That is an income of \napproximately $9,000 a year for an individual or $12,000 a year for a \ncouple.\n  In New Jersey, low-income seniors currently on Medicaid have access \nto whatever drugs they need and they don't have any co-pay for their \nprescriptions. Under this bill, however, they will now pay $1 per \nprescription for generic drugs and $3 per prescription for brand name \ndrugs.\n  Low-income seniors tend to be in worse health and, as a result, they \nhave higher annual drug spending. A senior with an annual income of \n$7,000 or $8,000 simply doesn't have the discretionary income to shell \nout $15 or $20 or $25 for the prescriptions that he or she may need.\n  That may not sound like a lot of money to my colleagues, but for low-\nincome Americans, it can force them to choose between buying medication \nand buying food or buying medication and keeping the heat turned on in \nthe winter.\n  Mr. President, this bill represents an enormous opportunity \nsquandered. We had a real chance to do something right here. We had \n$400 billion to improve the lives of 34 million seniors, 14 million of \nwhom don't have any prescription drug coverage right now. Frankly, we \nblew it.\n  When I look at this bill, I see a bill that makes seniors in New \nJersey worse off.\n  I see a bill that makes poor seniors worse off.\n  I see a bill that takes away choices from seniors.\n  I see a bill that wastes taxpayer money on a slush fund for HMOs.\n  I see a bill that ``hides the ball'' until 2006.\n  And I see a bill that I cannot, in good conscience, support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, let me inquire of the Democrats. Could \nwe have a Democrat speak?\n  Mr. REID. Senator Akaka is here and raring to go.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Thank you very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition to \nthe conference report for H.R. 1, the Medicare Prescription Drug and \nModernization Act of 2003.\n  For far too long Medicare has lacked a prescription drug benefit. The \nlack of this benefit has been the gaping hole in the Medicare safety \nnet. I have consistently supported efforts to establish a meaningful \nMedicare prescription drug benefit. I supported S. 1, the Prescription \nDrug and Medicare Improvement Act of 2003, because it would have been \nan important step forward in meeting the prescription drug needs of \nseniors. I am extremely disappointed that instead of making \nimprovements in the Senate-passed bill, the conference report is now a \nfalse promise to our seniors. Mr. President, the conference report \ncontains too many flaws to warrant passage. The conference report lacks \nappropriate prescription drug coverage for seniors. Indeed, many \nseniors will be worse off under this proposal. The conference report \nalso weakens the existing Medicare entitlement program.\n  The prescription drug coverage in this legislation is simply not \ncomprehensive enough. Too small an allowance is provided within the \nlegislation to establish a meaningful prescription drug benefit for \nseniors. Instead of reducing the size of the coverage gap, the \nconference report would require that seniors pay for all of their drug \ncosts after their total drug spending reaches $2,250. Despite \ncontinuing to pay their premiums, they will not receive any additional \nsupport until they spend about $5,000. This gap is about twice as large \nas the gap that was contained in the Senate-passed bill. Why should \nseniors have to continue to pay premiums when they do not receive any \nbenefits if they are in the gap? This coverage gap must be filled.\n  Mr. President, for too many seniors in Hawaii and across the nation, \nprescription drug coverage will be worse under the provisions in the \nconference report. Seniors who are currently provided prescription \ndrugs through their state's Medicaid programs will have federally \nmandated copayments imposed on them. For example, Hawaii's seniors who \nhave incomes of less than 100 percent of the poverty level and obtain \ntheir medications through Hawaii's Medicaid program will be worse off \nunder this plan. They will now have to pay copayments to get their \nprescription medication. Hawaii's seniors are not alone. The Center for \nBudget and Policy Priorities believes that most of the 6.4 million \nindividuals that have dual eligibility for Medicare and Medicaid will \nbe charged more under the conference agreement for medication than \nunder existing law.\n  I am afraid that too many low-income seniors will not be able to \nafford even these meager copayments. Those who cannot meet these \ncopayments will be denied access to the medications they are currently \nbeing provided. Again, they will go without the treatment they need. In \naddition, the financial burden that the conference report places on \nstates may lead to a reduction in other Medicaid services that states \nwill no longer be able to afford, because of the substantial share of \nprescription drug costs that states will have to pay the federal \ngovernment for seniors who are eligible for Medicare and Medicaid.\n  Mr. President, I am also concerned about the millions of retirees \nthat will lose their existing coverage. We have seen over the past few \nyears that there has been a disturbing trend of reducing benefits for \nretirees. Creating this voluntary benefit will only accelerate this \ntrend. The intent of the legislation is to expand prescription drug \ncoverage for seniors, not merely to shift the financial burden of \nexisting coverage to the federal government. Many seniors will be \nforced to rely on Medicare, which will provide a less generous benefit \nthan what they currently enjoy. It is estimated that 17,850 Medicare \nbeneficiaries in my home state of Hawaii will lose their retiree health \nbenefits as a result of the enactment of this legislation. If Medicare \nbeneficiaries lose their employer-based coverage, they may have to pay \nmore for a Medicare drug benefit that provides less comprehensive \ncoverage. Despite the subsidies included in the conference report to \nencourage the continuation of existing coverage, it is estimated that \napproximately 2.5 million people will lose their coverage.\n\n  Mr. President, I along with Senators Warner, Allen, Mikulski, \nSarbanes, Johnson, and Corzine requested that the conferees include our \nbill, S. 1369, in the conference report to ensure that present and \nfuture federal retirees receive the same level of prescription drug \ncoverage. The government's Federal Employee Health Benefit (FEHBP) \nprogram for its employees and retirees stands as a model for all \nemployer-sponsored health care plans. Our legislation would protect \nprescription drug benefits for federal retirees by ensuring parity for \nthese benefits with other FEHBP subscribers. The other body approved \ncompanion legislation, H.R. 2631, on July 8, 2003. While the Medicare \nreform bill includes subsidies and tax credits to employers who retain \nexisting drug benefits for their retirees, such incentives provide no \nguarantee of the FEHBP drug benefit for the government's own \nannuitants. If FEHBP is the model for this reform, the federal \ngovernment must not drop or reduce drug benefits for retired FEHBP \nenrollees. Our legislation sends a message to other employer-sponsored \nplans that the federal government stands behind its commitment to \nretired workers. I will continue to work to bring about the enactment \nof this bill.\n  Mr. President, the cost containment provisions in the legislation \nprovide a fast-track legislative process to cut Medicare benefits if \ngeneral revenue funding for the entire Medicare program exceeds 45 \npercent. This arbitrary process is included while more meaningful \nprovisions to control the costs of prescription drugs were left out. \nThe conference report prevents the federal government from using the \nbargaining power of 40 million senior citizens to\n\n[[Page S15679]]\n\nbring down the cost of prescription drugs for the Medicare program.\n  Mr. President, the conference report weakens Medicare. It imposes \nmeans tests for Medicare Part B premiums and for low-income subsidies \nfor the prescription drug benefit. This is the beginning of the end of \nMedicare being as a universal benefit. This is the first step towards \nmeans testing other parts of the existing Medicare program. Means tests \nplace greater burdens on seniors. They also create administrative \ndifficulties for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n  Even more objectionable is the assets test used to determine the low-\nincome subsidies for the prescription drug benefit. The assets test is \ncompletely unrealistic. According to Families USA, the assets test will \ndeny subsidies to 2.8 million very low-income seniors if they have even \na small amount of assets. For example, the assets test disqualifies \npeople who have household goods and personal effects worth more than \n$2,000. Medicare is an entitlement and participants should not be \nsubjected to these demeaning means tests. Additional assistance should \nnot be denied because they happen to have set money aside for future \nexpenses.\n  Mr. President, this legislation also threatens existing Medicare \nbenefits because it includes billions of dollars for subsidies for \nprivate plans. This increases premiums for seniors, raises government \ncosts for health care, and damages the solvency of the Medicare trust \nfund.\n  Mr. President, I also want to express my disappointment that language \nsimilar to an amendment that I had offered, which was accepted as part \nof the manager's package for S. 1, was not included in the conference \nreport. While I thank Chairman Grassley and ranking member Baucus for \ntheir assistance with this provision, it was not included in the \nconference report. My amendment would have allowed my home state of \nHawaii to benefit from the increase in Medicaid disproportionate share \nhospital (DSH) payments included in the bill. Medicaid DSH payments are \ndesigned to provide additional support to hospitals that treat large \nnumbers of Medicaid and uninsured patients. The Balanced Budget Act of \n1997 (BBA) created specific DSH allotments for each state based on \ntheir actual DSH expenditures for fiscal year 1995. In 1994, the State \nof Hawaii implemented the QUEST demonstration program that was designed \nto reduce the number of uninsured and improve access to health care. \nThe prior Medicaid DSH program was incorporated into QUEST. As a result \nof the demonstration program, Hawaii did not have DSH expenditures in \n1995 and was not provided a DSH allotment.\n\n  The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection \nAct of 2000 made further changes to the DSH program, which included the \nestablishment of a floor for DSH allotments. However, states without \nallotments were again left out. Other states that have obtained waivers \nsimilar to Hawaii's waiver have retained their DSH allotments. Only two \nstates, Hawaii and Tennessee, do not have DSH allotments.\n  The conference report provides that states without DSH allotments \ncould receive additional assistance if their waiver was terminated or \nremoved. While this may possibly benefit Tennessee, this language will \nprevent Hawaii from obtaining any additional Medicaid DSH support that \nis included in this bill. The conference report includes an additional \n$6.35 billion in Medicaid DSH relief to the states. Hawaii does not \nreceive any of these funds. Hawaii's hospitals are struggling to meet \nthe healthcare needs of the uninsured. Hawaii cannot continue to be \nleft out. Additional DSH payments would help Hawaii hospitals to meet \nthe rising health care needs of our communities and reinforce our \nhealth care safety net. All fifty states need to have access to this \nadditional Medicaid DSH support. I will continue to work to correct \nthis inequity.\n  Mr. President, as I said at the start of my remarks, this legislation \nis a false promise. Even if this conference report is enacted, we will \nneed to enact follow up legislation to address the flaws in the bill. \nWe will also have to repeal several of the provisions that weaken the \nexisting Medicare program. Many have said this is an important step \nforward in the Medicare program. I disagree. This conference report \ntakes too many elderly Americans backwards in terms of their benefits \nto constitute forward progress or forward thinking. Many people, \nparticularly seniors, will eventually come to the conclusion that I \nhave reached on the legislation and Congress will regret this rush to \njudgment. After reviewing the provisions in this legislation, I am \ndisappointed that this bill is a false promise that undermines the \nexisting Medicare program. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield myself 30 seconds, before I yield to the \nSenator from Maine 7 minutes, for just a little bit of history and to \napplaud the Senator from Maine.\n  She was active in this issue of Medicare prescription drugs a long \ntime before I was. But on July 25, 2001, we held our first meeting of \nwhat was called the tripartisan group. She was obviously part of that \ntripartisan group along with Senators Hatch, Jeffords, Breaux, and \nGrassley.\n  I remember that meeting we had. The AARP sent us a birthday cake with \na pie-shaped piece cut out of it. Their admonition to the tripartisan \ngroup was: Fill in the missing piece. The missing piece of Medicare was \nprescription drugs.\n  The Senator from Maine has been very aggressive since July 25 in \nvarious ways, helping us fill in that piece of the pie. On August 1 of \nthat year, we held a news conference, all five of us, announcing our \nplans for doing that. We have not exactly come out where we were a year \nago. We probably have come out a lot better with the legislation we \nhave before us. But regardless, the Senator from Maine was in on the \nground floor, a long time before I was, on that issue.\n  I yield to the Senator from Maine 7 minutes.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his most gracious \nremarks. As I said on Saturday, without his considerable efforts, \ndetermination, leadership, and willingness to work across party lines, \nwe would not be where we are today. I want to congratulate him and \ncommend him for the enormous leadership and support he has given to \nthis issue as the chairman of the committee and throughout this process \nthat has obviously been a difficult one.\n  I had the opportunity on Saturday to elaborate on my views with \nrespect to this conference report. I think we are on a precipice of \nopportunity and ushering in a new era in the Medicare Program. While \nthis conference report does not rise to the level of everyone's \naspirations and expectations when it comes to prescription drugs, I \nthink we have to understand that this report was melding some very \ndisparate views in very disparate bills. We must, in the final \nanalysis, measure these results for the millions of seniors who will \nbenefit against the benchmark of the stagnation of the status quo.\n  The question is whether the status quo was preferable. Someone said \nyou may have to fight a battle more than once to win it. We know how \nmany battles we have fought on this issue over the last 5 or 6 years. \nHow many more battles and how many more years will have to go by and at \nwhose expense? I think we know at whose expense. It will be at the \nexpense of the 10 million seniors who do not have prescription drug \ncoverage currently. It will be at the expense of the 14 million seniors \nwho are under the 150 percent of poverty level, who will now get a very \ngenerous level of support and subsidy to finance this most vital drug \ncoverage.\n  This conference report embraces many of the critical benchmarks that \nwe had established previously, the ones to which Chairman Grassley was \nreferring with respect to the tripartisan bill that should have passed \nlast year, a year ago. I was urging the Senate to pass that \nlegislation. We lamented the loss of that opportunity, but that time \nhas passed.\n  The Senate-passed bill was something we all preferred; there is no \nquestion about it. But I think we also understand the nature of \nconference committees. The key point to remember about this conference \nreport is that it embraces the critical benchmarks and principles that \nwe all championed: The prescription drug benefit would be universal, it \nwould be voluntary, it would be permanent, it would be comprehensive, \nit would be affordable, there would be equal benefits across all\n\n[[Page S15680]]\n\nplans, there would be a Government fallback to ensure that every \nsenior, regardless of where they live in America, would have access to \naffordable drug coverage, and we would target the most assistance to \nthose most in need.\n  While this is not everything it could be or should be, we have to \nmeasure the results against the status quo.\n  I would like to focus for a few moments on one of the issues that has \nbeen talked about consistently and understandably so, the privatization \nof Medicare. There is no question that I certainly would not support \nanything that would lead to the privatization of Medicare. In fact, the \nSenate-passed bill had nothing in the feature of a premium support \nproposal. Now we have to discuss what is before the conference and what \nhas actually changed from what was in the House-passed legislation. I \nthink it is critical that we understand the differences in what is \nincluded in this conference report. The House-passed bill sought to \nprovide for an open-ended, permanent nationwide privatization of \nMedicare through an untested and untried approach known as the premium \nsupport proposal. It is certainly no secret that I was totally opposed \nto that approach, as well as many of us here in the Senate. But it is \nalso critical to know what is now being applied in this conference \nreport, and there should be no mistake that this conference report puts \nan end to that proposal. It puts an end to that effort to privatize.\n  I certainly would have said the privatization approach in the House \nbill could have led us down the path of what the program of health care \nlooked like prior to 1965 when Medicare was created, which was a \npatchwork delivery of health care to seniors in America. We don't want \nto go back to that; that would be a retreat. The House approach would \nhave wild fluctuations in premiums, as we saw in the charts that were \nissued by CMS within the Department of Health and Human Services. There \nwould be wild fluctuations not only between States but within States \nand even within congressional districts.\n  In response to that concern, I and 43 of my colleagues wrote a letter \nsaying that it would be totally unacceptable--not only the open-ended, \npermanent nationwide system that the House-passed bill included but \nalso even the narrowed-down version of a demonstration program that \nwould have captured 10 million seniors. That was unacceptable.\n  I want to make clear where we are today. We have eliminated the whole \napproach of the House. Now, what is in this conference report as shown \nin this chart here today is one Federal demonstration program. That is \nwhat it is all about. Where the effort once centered on an open-ended \nnational program that would have ultimately ended up in the wholesale \nundermining and destabilization of the Medicare Program, we now have a \npared back demonstration project that would be limited to 46 \nmetropolitan statistical areas; that certain criteria will be included \nwhich will determine those areas; but according to the Congressional \nBudget Office, based on that criteria that, in fact, it would not \ninclude more than 650,000 to 1 million seniors.\n  What we were talking about originally in the House-passed bill was a \nnationwide program, but we are now back to a pared-down demonstration \nproject, and we include criteria that would limit the size of the \ndemonstration project to 650,000 to 1 million, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office.\n  Also, there is protection for low income. Where the original proposal \nby the House had no protection for low income under 150 percent of \npoverty level, now they are protected as well. They will not be \nincluded in this demonstration project.\n  It is very important to understand some of those changes.\n  In addition, this program sunsets in 2016. It doesn't start until \n2010. We obviously have time between now and then after passage of the \nlegislation to address any further concerns. But we move the date from \n2008 to 2010. There is an ending date--a sunset of 2016. No extensions \nare allowed without new legislative action.\n\n  There are six MSAs with criteria that I mentioned earlier. Now we are \nnot talking about open-ended, nationwide; we are not talking about even \n10 million seniors. We are talking about 650,000 to 1 million.\n  As far as any premium fluctuations, it is limited to 5 percent. \nWithout the compounding, that would have had the net effect of having a \n30-percent increase over 6 years. Now that would be phased in.\n  I should also mention that this demonstration project is phased in \nstarting in 2010. It is not totally in place until 2015 and 2016. In \n2016, it ends. Even with the 5 percent, it will be phased in over 4 \nyears. It represents 5 percent each year. We have made substantial \nchanges. It is a wholesale change of what was in the House proposal.\n  This is a limited Federal demonstration program that allows for the \ntesting of perhaps new ideas. But nothing can be implemented--nothing \ncan be done--until the Congress would want to address those issues \nbased on the results from that demonstration project.\n  That is very important for Members of this Senate to understand in \nterms of the differences in scope, size, implementation effect, and \nwhat it would do to the underlying program.\n  Finally, one other additional point with respect to this \ndemonstration project:\n  Also in this legislation we terminated the financial incentives that \nare offered to private plans participating in the demonstration when it \nbegins in 2010. I think we have to understand what the true facts are.\n  This demonstration project will not undermine the underlying \ntraditional Medicare Program as we know it. Obviously, it would be \npreferable not to have it in this legislation, but this is the essence \nof a compromise that is before us, and it is very limited in terms of \nsize and scope.\n  I think it is important for Members of the Senate to realize that.\n  In the final analysis, I think we cannot lose this opportunity. This \nis an idea whose time has not only come, but it is long overdue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield myself 9 minutes.\n  Mr. President, let me commend the Senator from Iowa, the Senator from \nLouisiana, the Senator from Montana, and others who have worked on this \nso very hard. I want to express my gratitude to them for spending so \nmuch time on this issue.\n  Let me also briefly thank my own staff. I am not a member of the \nFinance Committee. But this issue transcends committees. This is \nlegislation that all of us have a deep interest in. I thank Jim Fenton \nand Ben Berwick of my staff for the tremendous effort and time they \nhave put in.\n  I spoke at some length on Friday about this issue. Let me divide the \nissue very quickly.\n  A prescription drugs benefit, I think, would pass 100 to 0. If we had \na vote on the prescription drug benefit--you would hear speeches that \nit didn't go far enough and concerns about the donut hole and whether \nor not 150 percent of poverty was the right margin to be drawn--but I \nsuspect all Members in the final analysis would support the initiation \nof a prescription drug benefit on the assumption that we would work to \nimprove it in the years ahead.\n  If I were voting on that issue alone, I would stand here and raise \nconcerns about matters included in that provision, but it would have my \nwholehearted support as a long overdue proposition. I won't dwell on \nthat aspect of the legislation here this morning.\n  The second piece of this bill, however, is one that causes me \nconcern. This second piece is more difficult to understand, it is less \nclear than just $400 billion for prescription drugs. The second part of \nthis bill is a major change in Medicare. The program has been around \nfor 38 years and is currently serving 41 million Americans. It is \nprobably the most successful and the most wildly supported Federal \nprogram of the 20th century. I can't think of any program, except \nSocial Security, which has been so widely supported. We are about to \ntake that program which has worked so tremendously well, and I think \ndisadvantage it significantly. Let me explain briefly why.\n  The sponsors of the legislation say they are not forcing seniors out \nof traditional Medicare. They claim they are simply creating \ncompetition as a result of offering seniors a choice. Let us talk about \nthis so-called ``competition.''\n\n[[Page S15681]]\n\n  Private plans under this bill will be reimbursed at a higher rate \nthan traditional Medicare--9 percent higher. On top of that, this bill \nalso makes available $12 billion in a slush fund to be used to lure \nprivate plans into the market on a corporate subsidy. You get a 9 \npercent differential and $12 billion. That is what you get to compete \nwith Medicare. You do not have to have a Ph.D. in math or a Ph.D. in \nbusiness law to understand that kind of an advantage certainly is not \nwhat I call a level playing field. It is not competition, it is a \nrigged game. The bill stacks the deck against traditional Medicaid and \nthe effects are self-perpetuating. Traditional Medicare grows weaker, \nprivate plans grow stronger, forcing more beneficiaries out of the \ntraditional programs and into the open arms of HMOs.\n\n  It is easy to get bogged down in the complexities of this bill. Let \nme state it simply: The weakening of the traditional Medicare Program \ncaused by this bill will force seniors to pay more and face the \nprospect of fewer benefits.\n  Remember, Medicare initially said whether you are wealthier and \nhealthier or poorer and sicker, we all work together. Now we are \nsplitting off the wealthier and healthier and leaving the sicker and \npoorer on the side.\n  This bill will actually mean less choice, in many ways, for seniors. \nSeniors like the traditional Medicare Program precisely because it \noffers choice, the very thing the supporters of this bill claim to be \nproviding. Under the current system, seniors have a choice of doctors. \nBut that choice would soon disappear with a rise in private managed \ncare plans.\n  I hope this prediction is wrong but I am fearful it is right. If this \nprediction is wrong, it most likely means seniors have elected not to \nmove into private plans and HMOs will leave the market in many areas, \nas we have seen in the past with the Medicare+Choice plan, taking $12 \nbillion with them that might have been used to reduce the cost of \nprescription drugs rather than provide a subsidy for the private plans \nto compete with Medicare.\n  Even more ironic is that this highly unfair system is being \nchampioned by self-proclaimed champions of free enterprise. This bill \ngives $12 billion to HMOs to unfairly compete and it does nothing to \ncontrol drug prices. In fact, it actually prevents the Medicare Program \nfrom negotiating lower drug prices. Under law, Medicare is prevented \nfrom using its purchasing power to negotiate with drug companies for \nlower prices. What is wrong with letting free enterprise work here in \norder to lower drug prices?\n  If Medicare is so in need of reform, why in this bill are we \nsubsidizing private companies and not allowing the Medicare \nbeneficiaries to compete for lower drug prices? The reason is simple: \nThe champions of free enterprise know that private plans cannot compete \nwith traditional Medicare on a level playing field. The subsidies are \nnecessary because Medicare is actually more efficient. Medicare \ndelivers services at a lower cost.\n  In 2010, a provision included in this bill will go into effect that \nbegins an experiment with our Nation's seniors. Why we are taking our \nseniors, the most vulnerable, and turning them into guinea pigs for an \nexperiment is beyond me. That is what we are beginning to do. Given the \nunlevel playing field I have described, such a competition would \nfurther disadvantage the traditional Medicare Program.\n  The bill writes into it right now a cap of 5 percent premium \nincreases for each year in regions effected by this premium support \nexperiment. The bill anticipates premium increases even before we have \ntried the program, and they are going to take 6 million seniors and \nthrow them into an experiment, a pilot program, the outcome of which \nhas already been determined by the bill's authors when they talk of a \ncap at a 5 percent premium increase. How is Medicare going to compete \nthen? The outcome is predetermined, forcing those seniors into a \ndisadvantaged program. The weaker and the poorer and the sicker seniors \nwill end up paying more or having benefits cut.\n  I am afraid we can only conclude one thing: The architects of the \nbill, with all due respect, spend billions of dollars not to reform \nMedicare, but to dismantle it. It puts patients out there to wither on \nthe vine, as Newt Gingrich said 8 years ago. If the man who wanted that \nembraces this legislation, that could mean one of two things: Either \nhis opinion has changed or this legislation really is intended to end \nMedicare. I submit that I see no evidence his opinion has changed.\n\n  We set out to add a prescription drug benefit to Medicare. I applaud \nthat. We could have had a bipartisan bill that did just that. It could \nhave been approved by this Chamber overwhelmingly. But instead, we are \nbeing asked to vote on a wolf in sheep's clothing.\n  The second part of the bill, the changes in Medicare that will effect \n41 million seniors, two-thirds of whom make less than $80,000 and above \n$13,470, for those in that category, this bill offers disturbing \nalternatives.\n  For those reasons, I urge that when the cloture vote occurs, Members \nvote against it. We can do better. I applaud the efforts made, but we \ncan do better on this legislation than we have done.\n  I don't believe I used all 9 minutes, but others have gone over 9 \nminute. I yield back my time for those on the Democratic side who would \nlike to be heard on the legislation.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Arkansas. If \nthere is no one on the other side to speak, I can give the Senator a \nlittle bit more.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the Medicare \nprescription drug coverage conference report before the Senate today.\n  I do strongly believe this is a historic opportunity. I believe we \nshould not let it pass by. This proposal represents a $400 billion \nexpansion of the Medicare Program, the largest expansion of Medicare \nsince it was created nearly 40 years ago.\n  While I intend to support this measure, I think what is most \nimportant at this juncture is to be honest with the American people. \nFor me, it means being honest particularly with the people of Arkansas \nand the Arkansas seniors. This bill cannot be and will not be all \nthings to all people. The bill will not provide free drugs for \neveryone. Some seniors, because we have talked about this for so long, \nhave come to their own conclusion that what we were trying to get was \nfree drugs for all seniors in this country.\n  I have to remind people we are in debt in our country up to our \neyeballs, as far as the eye can see. We did not have an opportunity to \nprovide free prescription drugs to all seniors in this country. \nTherefore, we have to do the best we can do right now with what we \nhave. I am not pleased about the debt. I didn't support the last tax \nbill and I am scared to death of the debt we are creating for my twin \nboys who are 7 years old right now.\n  The fact is, in this year's budget we have $400 billion dedicated to \nAmerican seniors. We have to do the best job we can to make that \nproductive for them in this current circumstance because next year and \nthe year after that, it will not be there; we will still be in debt up \nto our eyeballs.\n\n  We have a tremendous amount to do. This bill starts that. It is \nunfortunate the issue of adding a prescription drug benefit to Medicare \nhas become so politicized. Several Democratic conferees, many of them \nexperts on this issue in their very own right, were not permitted the \nopportunity to negotiate the final bill. They were conferees in name \nonly. I join them in their frustration and how they feel. They have a \nright to be angry. It was wrong and unjust. They were prohibited from \nbeing part of this very important conference. This bill would have been \nbetter had they been involved.\n  Despite the flaws in this legislation and the partisan process we \nwitnessed over the last few months, Democrats and seniors should be \npleased that many of the principles we fought for are contained in this \nbill.\n  Is this the bill I would have written? Absolutely not. But there are \ncomponents in this bill that are productive and move us forward. On \nbehalf of our seniors, we must seize that opportunity.\n  The bill before the Senate today will provide all of the 453,438 \nMedicare beneficiaries in Arkansas with access to a Medicare \nprescription drug benefit for the first time in the history of the \nMedicare Program. Every senior will have access to a drug benefit to \nhelp them with the extraordinary cost of prescription drugs. \nExtraordinary.\n\n[[Page S15682]]\n\n  Again, it is not all things to all people. If you find yourself in a \nposition where you are well off and you do not have a lot of \nprescription drug costs, there may not be in here the most advantageous \ndrug program for you, but for the sickest and the neediest of this \ncountry we have come a long way in this bill.\n  While the benefit is somewhat meager, I am confident we will improve \non it in the future for those who maybe do not get the best return from \nthis package. But this bill targets the sickest and the neediest of \nseniors, those with the highest drug costs and those who are in the \nlowest income category.\n  Because of the $400 billion limitation, that is where we have gone. \nWhen fiscal times improve, we should eliminate the gap in coverage. I \nam concerned about those seniors who will be hit with the gap in \ncoverage and have to continue to pay their premiums. But the point is, \nevery senior in Medicare in Arkansas will be able to choose to enroll \nin a new voluntary drug benefit while staying in the traditional \nMedicare Program. This is a huge victory. Seniors will not have to \nleave the Medicare they love to get a prescription drug benefit.\n  That is because the bill contains a fallback plan--a Government \nguaranteed plan or safety net--that will provide drug coverage should \nprivate, drug-only plans not come into their area.\n  We in Arkansas know a lot about that. We have seen what happens when \nMedicare+Choice comes in.\n  I am concerned that the fallback provision in this bill is not as \nstrong as that which was passed in the Senate bill because it allows \none prescription plan and one integrated plan to provide the drug \nbenefit instead of two prescription plans.\n  I intend to work with my colleagues to fix this flaw before the drug \nbenefit is enacted. I am glad that the conference agreement requires a \nnational fallback contract, so that the Government fallback will always \nbe there when necessary.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield the Senator 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 1 additional \nminute.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I thank the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. President, I have a lot more to say, and I hope I will have an \nopportunity to do it at some point.\n  I think the most important point to be made today is to talk about \nthose who will be served. Over 170,700 beneficiaries in Arkansas will \npay no premium for their prescription drug coverage and a nominal copay \nof no more than $2 for generic drugs and $5 for brand name drugs. They \nalso will not have a gap in their drug coverage.\n  We are addressing some of the neediest individuals in our country at \nthis juncture. Over 40,200 additional seniors in Arkansas will qualify \nfor reduced premiums, lower deductibles and coinsurance, and no gaps in \ntheir drug coverage. All told, over 40 percent--over 40 percent--of \nMedicare beneficiaries in Arkansas will receive the much-needed special \nhelp.\n  This low-income assistance is of special importance to Arkansas' \nolder women. Medicare seniors are disproportionately women and \ndisproportionately poor, and will be served well by this special \nassistance.\n  There is much I would have done to strengthen the low-income \nprovisions, such as not having an assets test for everyone and ensuring \nthat Medicare could wrap around the cost-sharing requirements in the \nMedicare bill and that Medicaid could pay for prescription drugs not on \nthe private plan's formulary.\n  I fought to include a new benefit providing screening for diabetes. \nThe new diabetes screening benefit will help with the fact that \napproximately one third of the 7 million seniors with diabetes--or 2.3 \nmillion people--are undiagnosed.\n  They simply do not know that they have this very serious condition--a \ncondition whose complications include heart disease, stroke, vision \nloss and blindness, amputations, and kidney disease.\n  This bill takes a number of steps to protect seniors' access to \ncommunity pharmacies.\n  I worked hard to ensure that private PBMs must disclose any price \nconcessions made available by manufacturers, that the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services has the authority to audit the financial \nstatements and records of plans to ensure that they are complying with \nthese disclosure requirements, and that the Federal Trade Commission \nstudy whether the PBMs that own their own mail order pharmacies have \ncreated higher drug prices for consumers.\n  In addition, private plans must allow any willing pharmacist to be a \nprovider under its plan. And for the first time, local pharmacists will \nbe allowed to offer 90-day prescriptions just like mail-order \npharmacists.\n  These provisions are vital to rural hospitals, physicians, ambulance \nproviders, home health providers, and rural health clinics in Arkansas. \nI have worked with my colleagues for a number of years on these \nprovisions, and long-sought rural equity is finally achieved.\n  This bill also contains several good additions to the traditional \nMedicare Program that seeks to improve the health and well-being of \nseniors.\n  Among the provisions that I fought to include is my demonstration \nprogram on chronic care management that will help determine the healthy \noutcomes that result when a geriatrician is paid appropriately for \ncaring for a patient with multiple chronic conditions.\n  I also fought to include coverage for insulin syringes. Roughly 40 \npercent of the senior population with diabetes--or 1.8 million \nseniors--use syringes to inject insulin into their bodies to control \ntheir diabetes every day.\n  Without coverage, syringe purchases--which can be especially \nexpensive for seniors on fixed incomes--would not count towards cost-\nsharing and yearly maximum out-of-pocket expenses.\n  The low-income assistance in the Senate bill was much more generous. \nIt helped 3 million more seniors. And I pledge to these seniors that I \nwill continue to work on strengthening these provisions in the future.\n  I am pleased that the conference agreement provides financial \nincentives for employers to continue offering prescription drug \ncoverage for their retirees.\n  I have received many calls this week from constituents who want to \nensure they don't lose the health coverage they worked for their entire \nlives. It is frustrating that employers are already dropping retiree \nhealth coverage.\n  So I am glad this bill provides tax incentives to employers and \nunions so they don't drop drug coverage. Employer groups have told me \nthat this bill will actually encourage them to retain rather than drop \ncoverage in the future.\n  This bill also creates the most comprehensive rural package we've \nseen in years. By significantly decreasing or eliminating the \ndisparities in Medicare payments that exist between rural and urban \nhealth care providers, seniors in rural areas will have better access \nto the care they need.\n  To conclude, we must seize this opportunity before it is too late. \nThis is not the bill I would have written, but it is a step forward.\n  Yesterday, I talked with Cecil Malone, the president of the Arkansas \nAARP. We both agree that this moment must not be wasted. We must act \nnow to get a benefit started. Once it is there, it can only get better.\n  I promise the seniors of Arkansas that I will work day in and day out \nto make this prescription drug plan better.\n  I will also work to preserve and protect the Medicare Program so it \ncan continue to be a safety net for all those who are uninsurable in \nthe private market--millions of seniors, individuals with disabilities, \nand people with kidney failure.\n  The Medicare Program has prevented these most vulnerable individuals \nfrom being uninsured. We must remember the Medicare Program's origins \nand mission as we proceed--and do no harm to it.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I thank Finance Chairman Grassley, Ranking \nMember Baucus, Senator Breaux, and the members of their staffs who \nworked so hard over the last several months to bring us to this \nhistorical moment.\n  This bill also ensures that seniors have convenient access to \npharmacies\n\n[[Page S15683]]\n\nby adopting the same standard that TRICARE uses to determine access.\n  The bill also includes my provision to waive temporarily the late \nenrollment penalty for military retirees and their spouses who sign up \nfor Medicare Part B and to permit year-round enrollment so that \nretirees can access the new benefits immediately.\n  I am glad that this bill takes some steps to contain the skyrocketing \nprice of prescription drugs. One provision in the bill would help bring \ngeneric drugs to the market faster, and another provision would give \nthe Government authority to create a system for the importation of \ndrugs from Canada by pharmacists, wholesalers, and individuals once \nsafety standards are met.\n  I have long supported drug reimportation but both the Clinton and \nBush administrations have refused to implement drug reimportation \nauthorized by Congress, citing concerns about drug safety.\n  I am glad this bill directs the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices to conduct a comprehensive study that identifies current \nproblems with implementing the current reimportation law we already \nhave on the books so Congress can enact a law that will allow \nreimportation to go forward.\n  Mr. President, there is a lot to be talked about here. I hope we will \ncontinue to work together to improve upon the shortcomings in this \nlegislation as we work to see it implemented to make it a better \nprogram for current and future beneficiaries of the Medicare Program.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, this could and should be a day of common purpose, a \nday in which we are united, not divided, behind a vital and big goal; \nthat is, giving senior Americans, who have worked their whole lives, \naccess to the prescription drugs they need to stay alive and well. This \nis a promise that Presidents and Members of Congress of both parties \nhave made and failed to keep for years and years and years.\n  Since the vast majority of us agree on the outlines of a solution, we \nhad the opportunity, and I believe the responsibility, to finally make \ngood on those years of rhetoric and deliver a solid and sensible \nprescription drug benefit plan under Medicare.\n  Instead, this President and this Congress have rushed into this \nopening and have stuffed what was once a decent bill--the one that \npassed the Senate overwhelmingly earlier in the year--with \nirresponsible and hurtful ideas that, rather than strengthening \nMedicare, weaken it and that, rather than just offering prescription \ndrug benefits to millions of seniors who need it, reduce the benefits \nthat millions of seniors have today. It has given with one hand and \ntaken with another.\n  So instead of being a day of common purpose, which we had here on the \nSenate floor when we passed a prescription drug benefit bill just a few \nmonths ago, this is a day of all too common partisan politics, \nideological politics that has divided this Congress, diminished this \nGovernment, degraded our democracy, and, ultimately, disserves our \npeople. It did not need to be this way.\n  Everybody knows what the problem is, and just about everybody agrees \nthat it is serious. We live in the wealthiest and most advanced country \nin the world. Yet millions of our seniors have a health care plan that \nexcludes what is now an essential component of modern medical \ntreatment; that is, prescription drug benefits. It is a little like \nhaving a car warranty that covers everything but the engine.\n  America can do better. That is why I supported the landmark bill that \noverwhelmingly passed the Senate in July. Thanks to bipartisan \nleadership, we crafted a compromise that could have made a good \ndownpayment for America's elderly. It was not perfect, but it was a \ngood head start, a good start forward. Not everyone in my party \nsupported that agreement. But I believed, despite its flaws, it was a \nnecessary and worthy first step.\n  But a funny thing--or, rather, a bad thing--happened to that bill on \nthe way to the conference. That solid, bipartisan bill was taken over \nby ideologues and others determined to stuff it full of pet, partisan \nprojects that really end up hurting millions of seniors, lessening the \ncoverage they have now, and threatening Medicare.\n  Unfortunately, the special interests were in the room and too many of \nour Democratic colleagues were out of the room. They used this bill as \na vehicle for pushing into law a long list of things that had nothing \nto do with the basic goal, which was to provide prescription drug \nbenefits under Medicare. In fact, this bill takes us two steps back for \nevery one step forward. That is why I am opposing it.\n  Has the tone in Washington changed? Well, it has. It is more bitter \nthan ever, more self-serving than ever, less constructive than ever. \nAnd I am afraid no simple prescription can cure the tone I am talking \nabout; only real bipartisan leadership can.\n\n  As one who supported the original Senate version of the bill, I am \nnot only disappointed at this outcome, I must say I am furious at it, \nfurious because millions of seniors, desperate for the relief, have \nfound their plight exploited, not alleviated.\n  I did not rush to this judgment. I wanted to support a solution. When \nthe outlines of the bill began to emerge last week, I saw some \nprovisions that I liked and some that troubled me. I wanted to fix \nthem. I spoke to people on both sides. I made suggestions to the \nconferees about changes that might be made. But no changes were made. \nSo, ultimately, I have no choice but to oppose this bill.\n  Let me just cite briefly some of the most significant provisions that \nI believe are wrong with the bill.\n  First, it would make millions of low-income seniors pay more for the \ndrugs they are currently getting under Medicaid and give them a more \nnarrow choice of drugs that will be covered. So it takes billions, in \nthe so-called wraparound coverage that Medicaid would provide, from \nseniors for their drug benefits and gives those billions to HMOs to \nsubsidize them as they move toward privatization of Medicare.\n  Second, it includes up to $16 billion in cuts for cancer care. Let me \nrepeat that: $16 billion in cuts for cancer care. I have been hearing \nfor months now from cancer patients and oncologists, cancer doctors, \nworried that this exactly might happen.\n  Third, it will spend billions of dollars by expressly prohibiting the \nFederal Government from negotiating the best possible price for \nprescription drugs.\n  Fourth, driven only--I would say primarily--by ideology, but because \nit is against all the evidence of what works, this bill will commit us \nto an overpriced version of privatized Medicare that would actually \ndrive up costs for taxpayers, not lower them, and jeopardize the \nstability of the Medicare Program, which is one of the best programs \nthe Government has provided seniors in America in the last century.\n  The fact is, Medicare as we know it is more efficient, more \naffordable, than the privatized version that is part of this bill.\n  In recent years, here are the facts: Costs per covered person have \nrisen almost 10 percent for private insurers providing Medicare \ncoverage or the Medicare substitute while Medicare has been able to \nlimit those increases in costs to just over 4 percent. That means \nMedicare has been twice as good at holding down costs as the private \ninsurance substitute. So why are we subsidizing, at greater cost, that \nalternative?\n  The array of people opposing this bill is broad. One group is the \nDemocratic Leadership Council, sort of ``mother church'' of the \nmoderate Democrats. The DLC referred to this bill as ``Medimess.''\n  Two points I want to make briefly. It says the bill misses a chance \nto reform the medical payment system to focus it on paying for quality \ncare, not just care for our seniors. And, second, given limited funds, \nthe DLC argues that the bill should have targeted and exclusively done \nthis for the lowest income seniors and those seniors with the highest \ndrug costs. Unfortunately, it did a lot more than that.\n  I have been moved in recent days by the complaints from cancer \npatients and AIDS patients and their families and advocates and \npsychiatric patients and their families and advocates who are convinced \nthat the restricted list of drugs covered by Medicare, the so-called \nformulary--restricted as compared to what they are receiving now under \nMedicaid or under their retirement plans--will limit, ultimately, the \nlifespan of themselves or their loved ones.\n\n[[Page S15684]]\n\n  The American people know, as I have heard their calls, that something \nis wrong with the bill that promises instant relief but does not help a \nsingle senior really until 2006.\n  Would you buy a drug with that kind of lag time? In fairness, there \nis at least one good thing to say about that delay. It means that when \nanother President comes to occupy the Oval Office early in 2005, he can \nset about fixing the bill, if it passes before it goes into effect.\n  The proponents of this Medicare prescription drug bill have, in my \nopinion, tampered with America's seniors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I ask unanimous consent for the 1 minute that Senator \nDodd did not use. He delegated me to have that minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Proponents of this prescription drug bill have \ntampered with America's seniors. They have broken the seal on the \ncompromise we had reached over the summer, emptied the contents of the \nlegislative bottle, slipped in what I believe are a couple of poison \npills, and put it back on the shelf for us to buy. America's seniors \nare not buying it. They know what is in the bottle. We shouldn't buy it \neither. I cannot and will not vote for this bill. I urge my colleagues \nto do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n               The Medicare Prescription Drug Legislation\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I cannot, in good conscience, vote for \ncloture and I intend to vote against this bill. With reservation, I \nvoted in the favor of the Senate Medicare prescription drug bill. I \nfelt the Senate bill, though flawed, brought us closer to offering \nseniors the universal prescription drug benefit that they needed and \ndeserved. My hope was that the problems in the bill could be fixed in \nconference. The bill that has emerged from the House-Senate conference, \nhowever, does too much harm to the overall Medicare program.\n  We need to modernize Medicare by providing beneficiaries with a \nprescription drug benefit. But just because we need a bill creating a \nMedicare prescription drug benefit, does not mean we need this bill. I \nbelieve that this bill provides little help for Medicare beneficiaries \nand takes too many risks with the overall Medicare program, and I am \nnot willing to take those risks.\n  One of the things that I am most concerned about with respect to this \nbill is the lack of true cost containment. If we are to ensure that \nMedicare remains solvent in the years to come, especially after adding \na new $400 billion prescription drug benefit, we need to make sure that \nwe take strong measures to keep the cost of Medicare down. This is \nespecially important given the number of baby-boomers who will soon be \nenrolling in Medicare. Although this bill came in under the budgeted \n$400 billion, because it fails to make any real effort to bring down \nthe skyrocketing prices of prescription drugs, the true cost of this \nbill is likely to surpass what has been budgeted for it. This is \nfiscally irresponsible, and we cannot put Medicare in financial \njeopardy by ignoring the impact of rising health care costs on the \noverall Medicare program.\n  I am also greatly concerned by the efforts included in this bill to \nmake Medicare a private, managed care program. This bill includes $12 \nbillion in additional subsidies to encourage private insurance \ncompanies to offer managed care plans under Medicare. The bill also \nincludes a demonstration project, which could affect up to 25 percent \nof Medicare beneficiaries, that may cause them to pay more in premiums, \nshould they decide to stay in traditional Medicare. Those who cannot \nafford these higher premiums will be forced to choose a private plan, \nwhich may limit their access and choice of doctors and other providers. \nSeniors should not be forced to enroll in private plans simply because \nthey cannot pay more to stay in traditional Medicare.\n  One of my greatest concerns is how this bill will impact \nWisconsinites. While providing, at best, a minimal prescription drug \nbenefit for some, the bill will make others worse off than they \ncurrently are. It is estimated that, because of this bill, 60,000 \nretirees in Wisconsin will lose the health insurance they currently \nhave from their employers. Over 110,000 of poor, disabled or elderly \nWisconsinites who currently pay nothing for their prescription drugs \nwill now face increased payments for their prescription drugs because \nof this bill. This bill will also drive up costs for the State, in a \ntime of fiscal crisis, because Wisconsin will lose its ability to \nnegotiate drug costs and will face increased administrative costs.\n  There are some who will benefit because of this bill. Due to \nsubsidies, the tilted playing field toward private insurance plans, and \nthe lack of any cost containment on prescription drug prices, this bill \nwill be a windfall for pharmaceutical and insurance companies. All we \nhave to do is take a look at how the stocks of pharmaceutical companies \nand insurance companies soared recently in response to this bill. While \nthese selected industries will profit, however, retirees and many low-\nincome Medicare beneficiaries will suffer.\n  I am truly disappointed that I cannot support this bill, because \nthere are some good things about it. I am pleased that the provisions \nthat will bring us closer to having fairness in the Medicare \nreimbursement system were included in the final conference report. I \nhave fought for a fairer share of Medicare dollars for states like \nWisconsin for years. I am proud to have authored the amendment that \npassed in the Budget Committee earlier this year, which helped make the \ninclusion of Medicare fairness provisions in this bill possible. These \nparticular provisions will help reduce the gross inequity in the \ndivision of Medicare dollars across the country.\n  But, on balance, I cannot vote for this bill because of the negative \nimpact it will have on the Medicare program. The harm this bill does to \nMedicare and those who depend on it outweighs the benefits. Instead of \nworking to privatize Medicare, Congress needs to go back to the drawing \nboard and create a real Medicare prescription drug benefit without \nundermining the Medicare system itself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield 6 minutes to Senator Breaux.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 6 minutes.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the committee.\n  We have now come to the time of decision with regard to whether we \nare going to have the capacity to, in fact, reach a compromise on one \nof the great issues of the day; that is, whether the Congress has the \npolitical courage and political will to set aside partisan differences \nand to allow both sides to come together and reach agreement. We can \nargue about which party benefits from a Medicare reform bill and which \nparty will suffer, but the real issue is not whether the Democratic \nParty or the Republican Party wins or whether the President gets to \nsign a bill that reforms Medicare in the Rose Garden. The real question \nbefore this institution on both sides of the aisle should be whether \nfor once we can come together and craft a piece of legislation that \ncreates a program that is substantially better than the 40 million \nseniors currently have under Medicare.\n  When Medicare was created in 1965, it was bipartisan. It was a \nchange. Some say we should not change Medicare. I would argue that \nDemocrats have never feared change. In 1935, when we wrote the Social \nSecurity Program under Franklin Roosevelt's leadership, Democrats \nchanged the status quo. When we led in 1965 the effort to provide \nmedical assistance for our Nation's seniors, we challenged the status \nquo. We stood up for change and created a new program. Today, over 38 \nyears later, we have the opportunity to once again change a program \nwhich has served seniors well but not nearly as well as they deserve. \nDemocrats should not fear that type of change.\n  Medicare today, on average, does not cover 47 percent of the average \nsenior's health care costs in this country. Not one of us in this \ninstitution--our employees, Members of Congress--has health care \ninsurance that is that deficient in what it does not cover. Forty-seven \npercent of those costs have to be borne by the senior citizen \nindividually or, if they do not have enough money, by their children or \ntheir grandchildren or, if they become so poor,\n\n[[Page S15685]]\n\nthey are put into the State Medicare Program for the poorest of the \npoor. That is unacceptable. That is not in keeping with the greatness \nof this Nation, to have a health care program for seniors that is that \ndeficient.\n  This institution cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good. \nThis bill is not perfect, but this bill is good. We cannot let \npolitical pundits on both sides of the aisle who try to dictate what \nour choices are say, well, let's pass a Republican-only bill so that we \ncan blame the failure of its passing on the Democrats. Neither can we \nallow Democratic political pundits to say to us we should not pass this \nbill for the reason that it would allow the President of the United \nStates to sign it in the Rose Garden and that would be a political \nbenefit for him.\n  If we cannot take good legislation and pass it and both claim credit \nfor it, then, quite frankly, we should be doing something else. Good \ngovernment is good politics. This is good government. This is a good \nbill.\n  There are two different approaches to solving health care. Some of my \nfriends on the Republican side would say: The Government should have \nnothing to do with it. The private sector should do everything, keep \nthe Government out of it, and we can design a program with the free \nenterprise system that will work just fine.\n  Unfortunately, there are some on my side who would say: No, the \nGovernment has to do everything. Government would have to do it all. \nThe private sector cannot be involved at all.\n\n  Both of those approaches are incorrect. The best way to solve health \ncare problems is to do what this bill does; that is, to combine the \nbest of what government can do with the best of what the private sector \ncan do and come up with legislation that says: Yes, the Federal \nGovernment can supervise it but not micromanage it. Yes, the Federal \nGovernment can help pay for it through the tax system--and this bill \ndoes that--but the private sector needs to be involved as well. The \nprivate sector can bring about innovation. They can come up with new \nideas and new concepts faster than we can in the Congress and in the \nFederal bureaucracies here in Washington. The private sector can bring \nabout a degree of competition which is sorely lacking under the current \nmicromanaged system with 133,000 pages of rules and regulations. That \ndoes not allow innovation or competition. That is one of the reasons \nthe program as we know it today, as good as it is, can be made a lot \nbetter.\n  The issue for our Nation's seniors is not just living longer lives; \nit is also about living better lives. For the first time, seniors will \nknow that when they need prescription drugs, they will be available. \nFour hundred billion dollars will set up a structure where they will \nhave insurance that covers prescription drugs, just as in 1965 when we \nmade changes that said the Federal Government will help provide \ninsurance to cover hospitalization, we said that for the first time the \nFederal Government will help with a program that will provide insurance \ncoverage for doctors.\n  This is a good program. We should not fear change. This is a major \nstep in the right direction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Good morning, Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent to \nuse such time as necessary to complete my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for up to 9 minutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, this was a day I had always looked \nforward to, a day where the Senate would be voting on a prescription \ndrug benefit. I have devoted my life to the advocacy of senior citizens \nand to standing up for ordinary people to make sure they could make \nsure that government was on their side when they needed it, when they \nwere at risk. But today I come to this vote with indeed a heavy heart.\n  The bill the Senate is voting on today is a hollow promise for a \nprescription drug benefit for seniors. This bill talks big but delivers \nsmall. It promises prescription drugs to seniors yet it will create a \nskimpy benefit for the middle class, cause 2.7 million seniors who \nalready have drug coverage from their employer to lose their coverage, \nset up the stage to force seniors into HMOs which means seniors could \nlose the doctors of their own choosing, provides lavish subsidies to \ninsurance companies, creates tax dodges for those making over $250,000, \nwhile doing absolutely nothing to stop the soaring cost of prescription \ndrugs.\n  When I voted for a bill in June, it was a modest but genuine \nbipartisan effort. I believed it was a start. For years Congress had \ntalked about Medicare. But talk, talk, talk; when all was said and \ndone, more got said than got done. And you can't talk your way out of \ndiabetes; you need insulin. You can't talk your way out of high \ncholesterol; you need Lipitor. So I thought Congress should move on. \nBut when I voted for the bill, I said that was as far as I would go. I \nsaid when the plan came back, if it helped the insurance companies \ninstead of seniors, goodbye to my vote. I said if it increases costs \nfor seniors, say goodbye to my vote. And if it limits benefits, say \ngoodbye to my vote. On all three of these points, this bill falls and \nfails.\n  I am going to say that people who say this is a first step--well, it \nis a step in the wrong direction. If you take the wrong step, you can \nfall flat on your face. Some believe it is the best we can do. I don't \nbelieve that. I believe we can do better, we can do better now, and we \ncan do better next week. We are 45 weeks away from adjourning from this \nCongress. We have 45 weeks to do a bill that will benefit seniors, \nprotect seniors, protect the integrity of the Federal budget and be \nable to get the job done.\n  Seniors don't do better under this bill. It is skimpy. You have a \npremium of $420 a year, a deductible of $250. You pay $670 a year. When \nI sat and figured it out, you have to spend $1,000 to get $1,000 worth \nof drugs. Let me tell you what bothers me also. When you spend up to a \ndrug cost of $2,250, then the Government says the gap between $2,250 \nand $5,100--your Government says we cannot afford to help you. That is \na $2,850 coverage gap. This is while you are going to continue to pay \nyour premiums. You keep on buying your drugs. Your Government says it \ncannot help you. While you are paying that premium and paying for your \ndrugs, the Government will keep paying those HMOs. This bill leaves too \nmany seniors in the coverage gap.\n  In my home State, 200,000 people will fall in this coverage gap. Some \ncall it a donut. I call it a poison pill.\n  I have looked at what it means for those who already have \nprescription drug benefits. I truly believe that 400,000 Marylanders \nwill be at risk from losing their private plans--whether it is from a \nGovernment employer or a private sector employer. I am talking about \nfactory workers and teachers. I am talking about secretaries and \nfirefighters. This bill could dilute or even destroy these benefits \nover a lifetime.\n  Often, workers took these benefits instead of pay raises. They chose \nthe promise of a secure health retirement instead of increased pay. I \nam very concerned that they could lose their benefit. Employers are \nalready being crushed under the weight of health care costs.\n  In 1998, 48 percent had prescription drug benefits, and now only 28 \npercent have those employer-sponsored health care coverage. Now, why is \nthis a problem also?\n  The other very troubling provision in this bill is it has an absolute \nprohibition on allowing the Government to use its buying power to \nnegotiate lower prices. This bill does nothing to save money on drug \ncosts. In fact, it does the opposite. This bill prohibits the \nGovernment from negotiating lower prices. Page 54 of this bill--read \nit.\n  But, we already do it. I am the ranking member on the VA-HUD \nAppropriations Committee. I know what the VA does. The VA uses its \nbuying power to negotiate with drug companies for lower prices. That \nmeans we get a 25-percent reduction. It is not price control. It \ndoesn't shackle innovation. It is good management. By the VA \nnegotiating those prices, it is good for the VA to be able to afford to \nprovide drugs, and it is good for the veteran to be able to afford to \nbuy their drugs. Why can't we do this everywhere?\n  I will tell you, while we give these subsidies, while we have the \nskimpy benefit, it provides lavish benefits to insurance companies and \nHMOs; $12 billion in subsidies to private insurance plans to subsidize \ntheir participation, forcing them into HMOs in the future--$12 billion. \nWhat is the consequence? It\n\n[[Page S15686]]\n\nmeans if you are forced into an HMO, you are going to lose your doctor. \nYou will get the doctor that a bureaucrat tells you you should have \nrather than the doctor you want to have.\n  It also creates tax dodges for those making over $250,000, the so-\ncalled health savings account--another $6 billion, which they should be \npaying taxes on. But oh, no, it is one more gimmick, a tax dodge. If \nyou take that $12 billion plus the $6 billion, it would give us $18 \nbillion to close the coverage gap. Instead, we have tax dodges and \nbonuses to insurance companies rather than a better benefit for the \nseniors.\n  I know what some seniors are asking: Barb, why are you going to vote \nagainst this bill? I need help now. I need a prescription drug coverage \nnow.\n  Senior citizens in Maryland have told me that they don't even buy \ngreen bananas. They don't want to wait. I want to ease your worry about \nprescription drug costs. I want to give you something real. For the \nnext 2 years, all you are going to get is a 15-percent discount card, \nwhile insurance companies and HMOs are going to get $12 billion from \nthe Government, and there will be this tax dodge for those making over \n$250,000.\n  To the seniors of Maryland, I am going to vote against this bill. I \nam not voting against you. I am voting for you so that you have the \nbenefit that you need. We have an affordable program for the U.S. \nGovernment. We can hold our heads up high, but know that when my name \nis called, I am going to vote no on this bill and, yes, that we can do \nit better, and we can do it better tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on our side, I think the time we have \nallocated--we have a little time left, is that true?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Forty minutes.\n  Mr. REID. I have allocated a lot of that time. I ask unanimous \nconsent that Senator Edwards be given 3 minutes under our control.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise in support of this conference \nreport. I congratulate all those who have worked hard on it. It is a \nbill on which, I have to admit, I have mixed emotions. There are a lot \nof things in the bill I like and some things that I don't like.\n  One of the criticisms I have heard leveled against this bill is that \nit does harm to those who are in the Medicaid population, the very low-\nincome, under 100 percent of poverty. The interesting thing is that \nsome suggested it does harm because we have made people eligible for \nMedicaid now eligible for Medicare. Those are the dual eligibles.\n  One of the reasons we are doing so is because there are many on the \nother side of the aisle who wanted dual eligibles to be covered under \nMedicare. The copayment for those dual eligibles is the same as under \nMedicaid. It is $1 for generics and $3 for name brand drugs. That is \nhardly a very high cost for prescription drugs. And there are waivers \nof those copayments for people who are in nursing homes and have other \nsources of coverage. So what we have done is something that many on the \nother side wanted us to do, which is take people out of Medicare and \nput everyone over 65 in one program. That makes some sense, but it is \nan enormous cost to the Federal Government. We are picking up more of \nthe cost of Medicaid now and that money out of the drug benefit had to \ncome from somewhere.\n  So I argue that to accomplish one policy goal, we had to give up some \nsubsidies to other seniors. But, clearly, it was a win by many of the \nDemocrats who argued--Senator Baucus and others--that they had to have \nall dual eligibles covered. It is something they wanted. We have done \nthat. I hope we will understand that the reason some of the money has \nbeen shifted to lower income was to accomplish what the other side \nwanted to accomplish.\n  I also say that, yes, I agree the standard benefit is not the most \ngenerous benefit out there. But what everybody here agreed to last year \nwas $350 billion. This year it was $400 billion. I think everybody \nagreed that $100 billion should be targeted at two groups of people--\nlower income individuals and high users of drugs. When you do that, and \nyou provide $1 and $3 copays for people over 100 percent of poverty, \nand up to 150 percent of poverty $3 and $5 copays, what you are talking \nabout is a very expensive program for low-income individuals.\n  Then, at the other end, you have the catastrophic program that picks \nup 95 percent of the cost of drugs after $3,600 is spent out of \npocket--high users, sick people. We should be helping them with drug \ncosts. When you throw those two pots in, there isn't a lot left for the \nstandard benefit.\n  It was the idea, I think, that everybody here agrees that we need to \nfocus the $400 billion on those in most need, whether it is need \nbecause of sickness or need because of financial condition. This bill \ndoes that. I would argue, sure, I think all of us would like to provide \na more generous benefit. You have to remember, the rest of the people \nwe are talking about--about 80 percent of them--have prescription drug \ncoverage already. What we are allowing is for a lot of those people to \nhave the drug coverage they have in addition to this being wrapped \ntogether to provide a much healthier benefit than just the basic \nbenefit provided under this bill.\n  Seniors are not going to be just with this plan. In fact, the average \nsenior in this country is going to have a much more enhanced plan \navailable to them than what they have today as a result of this \ncoverage.\n  I say to my conservative friends who are expressing concern about \nthis bill, the most important thing in this bill, from my perspective, \nfor conservatives is this plan allows for health savings accounts. \nFundamentally, what health savings accounts will do is eventually \nchange Medicare--not today, not even 5 or 10 years from now, but over \nthe long term, once health savings accounts become what I believe they \nwill become, which is the method of choice that the vast majority of \npeople in this country will do in the private sector. Health savings \naccounts affect people under 65, the non-Medicare population. This will \nbe a very popular plan in which millions of Americans will participate, \nand it will fundamentally change the insurance market in this country.\n  One thing we have seen from Medicare reform--if you want to call what \nwe have done over the past 40 years Medicare reform--is it follows the \nprivate sector. A 1965 Blue Cross plan was the original Medicare bill \nbecause that was the standard state of the art in 1965. In the \nnineties, we changed Medicare to allow for HMOs. Why? Because the \nprivate sector adopted HMOs. Now we are doing PPOs. Why? Because the \nprivate sector moved from HMOs to PPOs, and in the future we will move \nto PPOs and health savings accounts in Medicare, and that, I believe, \nwill be the long-term salvation of that program.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, my understanding is that the Senator from \nNew York will be next. Following that, because we have taken shorter \ntimes, we will have two speakers in a row--the Senator from Arizona and \nthe Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I may speak briefly, I say through the \nChair to the senior Senator from New York, we have been taking \nsignificantly longer than the majority on speeches. They should get two \nspeakers to make up for what we have been taking on our side. Senator \nClinton is next in the order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, there are a number of significant issues \nthat have been raised in this debate over the last 48 hours. I remind \nour colleagues and our seniors who may be following this debate with \nsome interest that we have had this bill--this gigantic bill--for 4 \ndays.\n  This is one of the most significant pieces of legislation that will \ncome before this Congress certainly this year, but I would argue for \nmany years to come. It is a wolf in sheep's clothing. We remember the \nold fairy tale about the wolf that couldn't get into the hen house or \ninto the shepherd's enclosure to try to go after the hens and go after \nthe sheep and kept trying and trying.\n  Finally, the wolf figured out that a frontal assault was just not \ngoing to work. People would see the wolf sneaking up on the hen house, \nsneaking up\n\n[[Page S15687]]\n\nbehind the sheep, and they would scare them off and try to get him \nbefore he got the hens and the sheep.\n  The wolf got really smart. The wolf found some poor old sheep that \nhadn't quite made it back from the hills and, unfortunately, killed \nthat sheep, got that sheepskin, and snuck in. When people saw it moving \nacross the ground, they thought: That's just an old sheep.\n  Lo and behold, the wolf got to the hen house and the sheep, and that \npoor old farmer didn't have any hens or sheep left by the time the wolf \ngot done.\n  Make no mistake, that is what is going on here. You can dress it up, \nyou can talk about how significant a benefit it is going to turn out to \nbe, how we are modernizing and changing Medicare for the 21st century, \nbut remember that fairy tale. Fairy tales are rooted in ancient folk \nwisdom and experience, and what we have here is just a classic wolf in \nsheep's clothing.\n  There are many reasons to oppose this bill, and my colleagues have \nbeen going through them one after another. I think the bottom line is, \nNo. 1, this bill does very little of what it actually advertises doing. \nIt advertises it is going to be a sea change--a positive sea change--\nfor seniors, and that is not the case.\n  We have been fighting over prescription drug benefits for seniors for \nyears. A decade ago, when I was working on behalf of the Clinton \nadministration with respect to health care, we included a drug benefit. \nSome of you may remember that debate. That debate went down, and it \nwent down for many reasons, but one was that it was a 1,300-page bill--\na bill that would guarantee health insurance to every American, a bill \nthat would control prices so that we could actually afford health care \nfor every American, and people said: Oh, my goodness, that is such a \nlong bill; why, look at what the Clintons are trying to do. They are \ntrying to change health care with that gigantic bill.\n  Remember, we produced that bill with a thousand people involved in \nthe process. We vetted it with everybody. We brought it to the Capitol. \nIt was done in the light of day. We produced a bill and then, of \ncourse, all the special interests got everybody confused about what was \nin the bill, and the bill went down even though, as it was going down, \npublic opinion surveys were asking Americans: What is it you want in a \nbill?\n  They said: We want guaranteed affordable health care coverage and the \nability to pick our doctor--all of which was in the bill.\n  It didn't do me any good to keep saying it because $300 million had \nbeen spent by the special interests for TV ads, radio ads, and \nnewspaper ads--the whole 9 yards. Oh, my goodness, the bill was so big \nand so confusing and all these terrible things were going to happen.\n  Four days ago--4 days ago--we got this bill. I am looking through \nthis bill trying to figure out, my goodness, how long it is. I know it \nis awfully heavy. I think it is about 1,200 pages. That is just to do \nsomething to Medicare. It is not to guarantee health insurance for \nchildren and working people. It is not to guarantee health insurance \nfor people 55 to 65, who retired and who start, as you do when you get \nto 55, to have health kinks and problems and are not eligible for \nMedicare. It doesn't do anything for that.\n  It is a 1,200-page bill which we received 4 days ago, and I can \nguarantee you there are disputes on the floor of the Senate as to what \nis in it and what it means. Why is that? Because we haven't had a \nchance to examine and analyze it, and if we haven't, with our staff and \nour efforts over the last 4 days, I know the American people, \nparticularly our seniors, haven't either.\n  There are many provisions in this bill that really need to be brought \ninto the light of day. I will be voting against cloture, which is a \nparliamentary term to try to cut off debate, because I don't think we \nhave had enough debate yet. I don't want anybody being surprised about \nwhat is really in this bill because there are going to be a lot of \nsurprises.\n  The promise of reimporting drugs from Canada--which is really \nimportant in a place such as New York because we border Canada. A lot \nof my seniors from Watertown, Massena, or Plattsburgh go across the \nborder and get those cheaper drugs. In this bill, that is going to \ncontinue to be a problem and a prohibition in reality, if not legally, \nbecause drug companies are going to be given the go-ahead to basically \nviolate antitrust rules so they can cut back on the amount of drugs \nthey send to Canada.\n  I don't blame the drug companies. They have a captive market in our \ncountry. Our tax dollars do the research at our great universities and \nresearch labs. Our tax dollars support the National Institutes of \nHealth. Our tax dollars create the conditions in which drugs are given \nclinical trials to determine whether they help or hurt. We do all the \nwork for the entire world for determining the efficacy of drugs, \nquality, and safety, and then other countries, such as Canada, Europe, \nand other places, bargain with the drug companies.\n  They say, OK, we have a big market. We have millions of people. It is \nkind of like Sam's Club, only think of it as the Canadian club or the \nEuropean Union club. They bargain with these drug companies and they \ndrive the prices down because they are going to buy in volume.\n  Should we not have an Uncle Sam's Club? Should not Uncle Sam be able \nto bargain with these drug companies? Apparently that is not what the \nbackroom negotiators and writers of this legislation wanted because in \nthe most wonderful example of Orwellian language, on page 53 of this \nbill, under a title called noninterference--I love that--it says in \norder to promote competition--there are magic words around here. It is \nsaid that competition is going to be promoted, while they create a \nmonopoly, while they end antitrust, because they are setting up all \nkinds of special privileges for special interests. Nevertheless, we \njust hope nobody notices that.\n  So in order to promote competition under this part and in carrying \nout this part, the Secretary, No. 1, may not interfere with the \nnegotiations between drug manufacturers and pharmacies and PDP \nsponsors--those are drug plans--and may not require a particular \nformulary--that is the list of the drugs one can get--or institute a \nprice structure for the reimbursement of covered drugs.\n  Basically, what this means is the lid is off. Not only can we not get \nthe drugs from Canada anymore because our drug companies will say to \nthe poor Canadians, keep letting your pharmacists send them across the \nborder and we are going to not send the drugs for the Canadian people. \nBut we cannot even bargain. We cannot have an Uncle Sam's Club. We \ncannot get the volume discounts.\n  We have to look at who is doing what in this debate to figure out \nwhere the sheep are, where the hens are, and where the wolves are. One \nof the biggest wolves who has been after Medicare for as long as he has \nbeen in public life is our old friend, Newt Gingrich, former Speaker of \nthe House, when he called for Medicare to wither on the vine.\n  Well, guess who showed up to try to whip those House Republicans in \nline to vote for this bill, which is why they had to leave the vote \nopen for more than 3 hours, the longest time they had ever had to leave \na vote open because basically, there was the wolf in sheep's clothing \ngoing up to the House Republicans and saying: Do not worry, we are \ngoing to say all of these good things about this bill, but just wait \nuntil we get our hands on it; just wait until we get into that hen \nhouse.\n  I do not blame them if that is what they believe. Nevertheless, we \nare the ones who are going to be paying the price.\n  I ask unanimous consent for an additional 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That will be 2 minutes off the Democratic \nside. Since there is no one from the Democratic side objecting, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I will put a chart up that gives a short summary for \nany American, and particularly for any senior citizen, watching. This \nbill sacrifices seniors' interest to special interests.\n  Seniors need lower drug prices. Forget it. The drug industry wants \nhigher profits.\n  Seniors need predictable premiums. Forget it. Managed care wants the \nflexibility to raise their rates even in the middle of the year.\n\n[[Page S15688]]\n\n  Seniors need a choice of drugs. Forget it. The drug industry wants a \nrestrictive formulary that pushes their brands.\n  Seniors need to keep their retirement benefits. Forget it. The \nprivate plans want a $12 billion slush fund so we are going to lose \nretiree health care.\n  Seniors want to stay in Medicare. Forget it because what is going to \nhappen is that Medicare is going to get increasingly the health care \nplan for the sickest and the oldest of our seniors, which will make it \nmore expensive. In this bill we are going to even see a constriction on \nthe nondrug benefits for Medicare.\n  So one has to really watch what goes on around here. They have to \nfollow it carefully. This is a bill that is bad for seniors, bad for \nAmerica, and I hope my colleagues will stand against it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we have before us a conference report that \nrepresents one of the biggest expansions of the Medicare entitlement \nprogram and offers enormous profits and protections for a few of the \ncountry's most powerful interest groups, paid for with the borrowed \nmoney of American taxpayers for generations and generations to come.\n  This legislation reminds me of the ancient medieval practice of \nleeching. Every special interest in Washington is attaching itself to \nthis legislation and sucking Medicare dry.\n  We do not need leeching. What we need is reform. On top of the \nexisting $7 trillion accumulated deficit, which translates into $24,000 \nfor every man, woman, and child in the United States, this year's \ncurrent deficit is quickly approaching a half trillion dollars. Adding \na new unfunded entitlement to a system that is already financially \ninsolvent is so grossly irresponsible that it ought to outrage every \nfiscal conservative.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, this package is \nestimated to cost just over $400 billion over 10 years. If one believes \nthat is the maximum we will spend over 10 years, I have some beach \nfront property in Gila Bend to sell you. Four hundred billion dollars \nis merely a down payment.\n  One important number not frequently mentioned is the estimated \nincrease this new package will add to existing liabilities. The Office \nof Management and Budget estimated that current unfunded liabilities of \nMedicare and Social Security are $18 trillion. That is the current \nunfunded liabilities. What is absolutely astounding is that this new \nbenefit will add an estimated $7 trillion in additional unfunded \nliabilities. By the year 2020 Social Security and Medicare, with a \nprescription drug benefit, will consume an estimated 21 percent of \nincome taxes for every working American.\n  I think we ought to be honest with the American people. Passing this \npackage without implementing the necessary reforms to ensure that the \nMedicare system is solvent over the long term is rearranging the deck \nchairs on the Titanic. There is no one in America who is reliable who \nwill not say that the Medicare system is going to go broke. The \nquestion is not if. The question is when, not what.\n  To save this system we should enact true free market reforms and \nbring Medicare into the 21st century. Unfortunately, the minor reforms \nin this bill do not even begin to offset the burden added by the new \ndrug benefit. With future generations of American taxpayers funding the \npurchase of prescription drugs under Medicare, we have an obligation to \nensure some amount of cost containment against the skyrocketing costs \nof prescription drugs. Unfortunately, however, this package explicitly \nprohibits Medicare from using purchasing power to negotiate lower \nprices with manufacturers.\n  How is that possible? The Veterans' Administration, the VA, and State \nMedicaid Programs use market share to negotiate substantial discounts. \nIt is prohibited in this bill. The taxpayers should be able to expect \nMedicare, as a large purchaser of prescription drugs, to be able to \nderive some discount from its new market share. Instead, taxpayers will \nprovide an estimated $9 billion a year in increased profits to the \npharmaceutical industry.\n\n  Prescription drug importation is another lost opportunity for cost \ncontainment. American consumers pay some of the highest prices in the \ndeveloped world for prescription drugs and, as a result, millions of \nour citizens travel across our borders each year to purchase these \nprescriptions. In all, Americans spend hundreds of millions of dollars \non imported pharmaceuticals, not because they do not want to buy \nAmerican but because they cannot afford to.\n  This conference report contains language on drug importation. \nHowever, it has been successfully weakened to the point of guaranteeing \nthat implementation will never take place.\n  There is a good provision as far as generic drugs are concerned, but \nthis package is not only a bad deal for American taxpayers, I believe \nseniors will also find it not worth the price.\n  Although this conference report allocates close to $80 billion in \nsubsidies to corporations to encourage them not to drop or reduce \nbenefits, the CBO estimates that approximately 20 percent of seniors \nwill lose their current employer-sponsored coverage.\n  I am concerned we are about to repeat an enormous mistake. I was here \nwhen we enacted Medicare catastrophic in 1988, and I was here 1 year \nlater fighting to repeal it. We cannot let political shortsightedness \nblind us from the long-term fiscal implications of this package.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be told \nin 3 minutes because I intend to leave 2 extra minutes to the Senator \nfrom Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes remaining or use 3 minutes?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. After I use 3 minutes. Thank you.\n  Mr. President, while the medical community has ridden the \ntechnological wave of the future, pushing the envelope in research into \nnew pharmaceuticals, treatments and life-saving measures, Medicare has \nbeen stuck floundering in the 20th century. The venerable program, \ndesigned to provide healthcare for the elderly and the disabled, has \nfailed to meet all of the needs of those it set out to serve.\n  After years of talk, Congress is poised to enact the most sweeping \nchange for America's seniors in nearly 40 years. We have the \nopportunity to bring Medicare up-to-date and take advantage of the \nincredible advances in prescription drugs.\n  Pharmaceuticals are one of the miracles of modern medicine. Ailments \nthat traditionally required an expensive in-patient hospital stay and \ninvasion surgery can now be treated with medication. But most Medicare \nrecipients wouldn't know it. While the government pays for costly heart \nsurgery, it currently will not pay for the preventative drugs that may \nhave precluded the need for an operate in the first place.\n  An estimated 9.9 million Medicare beneficiaries do not have private \nprescription drug coverage, almost 600,000 in Texas alone. Some seniors \nwho could lower their cholesterol by ingesting a simple pill like \nLipitor have to pay out their pockets for the drug which retails at \n$108 per bottle, placing this simple solution out of their reach.\n  The bill before Congress would give America's seniors access to a \nprescription drug benefit for the first time. Beneficiaries would pay a \n$35 monthly premium and a $250 deductible, after which they would pay \n25 percent of drug costs between $275 and $2,250 and 100 percent \nbetween $2,250 and $3,600. Costs over that threshold would require an \naverage copay of $2 for generic drugs and $5 for brand name drugs, or 5 \npercent of the total drug cost depending on the plan.\n  Until these reforms are in place, a prescription drug discount card \noffering savings of up to 25 percent will be available in 2004, \nproviding some relief immediately.\n  This measure also offers additional and unprecedented assistance to \nthose with low incomes. Medicare beneficiaries at the poverty level and \nbelow will pay no premiums or deductibles and will have nominal cost \nsharing responsibility, with copays of $1 for generic drugs and $3 for \nother pharmaceuticals. Those at 135 percent of the poverty level, or \n$12,123 annually for\n\n[[Page S15689]]\n\nindividuals, will not pay premiums or deductibles and will have co-\npayments of no more than $5. Beneficiaries at 150 percent of the \npoverty level, or $13,470 annually, will have a sliding scale subsidy \nfor premiums, a $50 deductible and $2 and $5 co-pays. These changes \nwill mean more than 680,000 low-income Texans will pay no more than $5 \nper prescription. Furthermore, with the Federal Government providing \ndrug coverage for those individuals who qualify for both Medicare and \nMedicaid, my State will save $1.7 billion over an eight-year period.\n  Though much of the attention surrounding Medicare reform has focused \non the prescription drug benefit, there are a number of other elements \nthat are important. In the end, the legislation is a good compromise \nand addresses the fundamental problems.\n   One significant element is choice. This plan provides access to a \nbroad array of healthcare options, similar to what most working \nAmericans already enjoy. Seniors can stay in traditional Medicare, add \na prescription drug plan or choose an HMO or PPO that includes a \nprescription drug plan. Unlike the current Medicare+Choice plans, which \nhave been pulling out of communities, the bill guarantees all seniors \nwill have access to an HMO or PPO plan.\n   It also has provisions to encourage companies currently providing \nhealthcare to their retirees to continue offering this important \nbenefit.\n   Another important component of the bill is an increase in the \nreimbursement rate for physicians, many of whom have stopped taking on \nnew Medicare patients. Physicians were facing a cut in March of 2004 \nand another in 2005, but this legislation not only stops the \nreductions, it gives physicians an additional 1.5 percent \nreimbursement.\n   Hospitals that treat a large number of illegal immigrants will \nreceive some compensation for their services--a provision important for \nTexas hospitals and other providers.\n   Another advantage that will benefit the general population, not just \nthose within Medicare, is the creation of Health Savings Accounts, \nwhich will allow individuals and families to put tax-free money into an \ninvestment-type account dedicated to their medical costs. The money is \nnot taxed when withdrawn for qualified medical expenses, giving \nAmericans another tool to cover healthcare costs, such as deductibles \nand co-payments.\n   As with any compromise, the bill is not everything I would want. I \nadvocated larger teaching hospital reimbursement levels, and although \nthe percentage is not as high as I proposed, in 2004 it increases the \ncurrent reimbursement rate, from 5.5 percent to 6 percent in April and \nthen to 5.8 percent in October, but it is still higher than the current \nrate.\n   This increase means almost $13 million to Texas' teaching hospitals. \nEvery State has at least one teaching hospital, with 1100 of the \nfacilities nationwide. Teaching hospitals train nearly 100,000 \nphysicians, and the Federal Government has traditionally recognized the \nhigher costs inherent in training and educating those health care \nproviders. They utilize newer technology and provide more indigent \ncare. This increase will provide some much-needed assistance to our \nfinancially strapped rural and teaching hospitals.\n   Let me be clear: this bill is not perfect, but as AARP President \nJames Parkel said this week, ``Millions of Americans cannot wait for \nperfect. They need help now.''\n   After years of talk, we are taking the first step to bring this \nvital program up-to-date. For the first time, we can provide a \nvoluntary prescription drug benefit that offers additional assistance \nfor those who need it most and strengthen Medicare for future \ngenerations.\n  I know my 3 minutes are up. I would like to add 2 minutes to Senator \nHatch's 5 minutes with that added 2 minutes. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this major first step.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Under our agreement, we will slip over to that side and \nthen Senator Hatch will be next.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, without objection, I yield myself 5 \nminutes from the time of those in opposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, we have a very important vote coming up \nshortly on whether or not to proceed with the bill or to continue \nworking, whether or not to stop our efforts to continue to try to \nimprove this bill or to begin the clock to a final vote. Many \ncolleagues have pointed out that this is the bill--this is the bill. \nThe bottom line of all of this paperwork is that it does not take \neffect, in terms of prescription drug coverage for seniors, until 2006. \nSo this is the bill we are asking for time to thoroughly go through, \nline by line, and to be able to fix what does not work for our seniors.\n  We are being told we have to rush this; this is the last time we are \ngoing to be able to do it; we don't have any more time to be able to \nput this together. Yet the bottom line of all this, for seniors' \nprescription drug help, if there is any in here--and there is a \nlittle--doesn't even start until 2006.\n  I am going to be voting against the effort to stop debate and move to \na final vote because I believe we need to take the time to get it \nright. I believe there are critical issues we need to fix.\n  Let me first say a positive aspect in all of this is important \nefforts to help our rural providers, our doctors and hospitals, home \nhealth agencies, and nursing homes. On Saturday I put forward a bill \nthat would actually pull out those positive provisions that are \ncritical for our providers, to vote separately on that. I believe we \nwould have, if not unanimous, overwhelming bipartisan support for those \nefforts that help our providers.\n  While I do not believe this bill, on balance, is good at all for our \nseniors, it is a bad deal for seniors, there are good provisions in it. \nI hope if this bill does not go forward, we can pull those provider \npieces out and support them.\n  Why don't I support this bill as written? In this bill as written, \n2.7 million retirees lose their coverage. One out of four folks who \nworked hard during their lives, maybe have taken a pay cut here or \nthere to get good health coverage, would actually lose coverage as a \nresult of the provisions, the way this bill is written for private \nemployers.\n  Mr. President, 6.4 million low-income seniors, the folks we all talk \nabout, the folks we are desperately concerned about, who really are \nsitting down today at the table and saying, Do I eat today or do I take \nmy medicine, they will end up paying more because of the way this is \nchanged between Medicaid and Medicare. That doesn't make any sense. It \nis a bad deal for too many of our low-income seniors who need help the \nmost. It is a bad deal for 2.7 million folks who have private insurance \nand will lose it. My fear is they will not just lose the prescription \ndrug coverage; they will lose their entire health care coverage.\n  To add insult to injury, this bill locks in the highest possible \nprices in the world. It keeps drug prices high, which is why the \npharmaceutical industry is so strongly supporting it.\n  They changed their strategy a few years ago. They have been trying to \nstop prescription drug coverage because they didn't want Medicare to \nuse its clout as a group purchaser to be able to get a good discount, \nas we do for the veterans, and lower prices. They fought it, but then \nthey decided they couldn't fight it anymore because seniors are \ndesperate and we do need to do something. We are long past doing \nsomething real for our seniors. So they changed the strategy. They \nsaid: Let's write a bill that gets a whole bunch more customers, 40 \nmillion more customers potentially, and let's make sure we lock in the \nhighest prices so they can't compete; they can't lower prices; they \ncan't go to Canada or other countries where there are safe, FDA-\napproved processes right now to be able to bring drugs back across the \nborder.\n\n  That is a big deal for us in Michigan. It is 5 minutes across a \nbridge or 5 minutes through a tunnel to be able to get lower prices--in \nhalf or more. So they made sure we are not going to be able to do that \nand they made sure we are not going to be able to negotiate for lower \nprices.\n  What do we have in the end? We have a whole new group of customers \nfor the pharmaceutical industry who will be forced to pay the highest \npossible prices.\n\n[[Page S15690]]\n\n  This is not a good deal for our seniors. We can do better than this. \nPeople don't have to lose coverage. People don't have to pay more. \nPeople don't have to be locked into the highest possible prices in the \nworld. We have time. This bill doesn't take effect until 2006 for our \nseniors. I urge us to take the time to get it right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I think we have agreement we would yield 7 \nminutes to the Senator from Utah and then 5 minutes to the majority \nwhip.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. It is my understanding I have 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have listened carefully to the debate on \nH.R. 1 during the last few days.\n  I regret to say I have heard many half-truths and misrepresentations \nabout our bill from the opponents of the legislation.\n  This simply won't stand.\n  We're reaching the point where twisted facts and wrong-headed \nreasoning have been repeated so often that even those who know better \nare no longer jarred to hear it.\n  As one of the conference committee members who actually wrote this \nbill, I find this untenable, because the opposition is just scaring and \nconfusing Medicare beneficiaries.\n  The last thing any of us want is for critical decisions to be made in \na climate of fear or in a fog of uncertainty.\n  Yes, this legislation is not perfect. But it is good.\n  I'll tell you why.\n  First, and most important, this bill provides all beneficiaries--\nseniors and the disabled--with voluntary prescription drug coverage for \nthe first time in almost 40 years.\n  Coverage for their medications is something Utah beneficiaries have \nsought for decades.\n  Not a day goes by that I do not receive a letter from some part of \nUtah beseeching Congress to pass this bill.\n  Second, that coverage will be immediate. Seniors wherever they may \nlive, from St. George to Logan, from Tooele to Vernal and down to \nBlanding and Monticello, will be able to use a new drug card to get an \nimmediate discount on their medications.\n  Third, the program is voluntary. We all know--as do the bill's \nopponents--that beneficiaries will not be forced to join this new drug \nprogram. If they are happy with the status quo, then things can stay as \nthey are. If they want to participate in the new program--it will be \nthere for them.\n  Fourth, H.R. 1 provides choice in coverage. Beneficiaries may stay in \ntraditional Medicare and elect to take a stand-alone drug plan if they \nwant one. Or they may receive their coverage through a local health \nplan or the new regional PPO plans offered through the new Medicare \nAdvantage program.\n  How often does a Federal program offer people the range of choices \nthat this bill creates?\n  Fifth, this bill preserves retiree health coverage. Close to one-\nquarter of the spending in this bill, approximately $89 billion, is \ndedicated to protecting retiree health benefits.\n  For the first time--and none too soon--Medicare will provide funding \nas an incentive for employers to continue retiree health coverage. \nUnder this bill, no beneficiary will be forced to drop retiree health \ncoverage and participate in the new prescription drug program.\n  Sixth, the conference agreement is good for rural America, which has \ngotten the short shrift under Medicare for some time.\n  We want to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries will have access to \nquality health care, no matter where they live. We also want rural \nproviders, providers in Moab and Panguitch, providers in Price and \nManti, providers who dispense vital health services to beneficiaries, \nto be properly reimbursed for their services. This legislation \naccomplishes those important goals.\n  Seventh--as I intend to amplify later--this legislation improves the \nDrug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, better \nknown as Hatch-Waxman. The conference agreement strengthens the 1984 \nlaw so it is easier for everyone, including seniors and the disabled, \nto have timely access to less expensive, generic drugs.\n  Eighth, the Medicare agreement includes an appropriate response to \nthe question of reimporting prescription drugs into the United States.\n  While we include the provisions contained in the legislation approved \nby the Senate, this agreement also requires the HHS Secretary to \nconduct an extensive study that identifies the barriers to implementing \na drug reimportation program.\n  Many of my constituents have written, asking why they cannot use the \nlower cost medications from Canada. The answer is easy: it is just \nirresponsible for Congress to jeopardize public safety by allowing the \nunchecked reimportation of drugs. That is why I adamantly opposed the \nHouse policy.\n  If we truly care about our seniors and other patients who depend upon \nprescription drugs, we should not expose them to what amounts to \npharmaceutical Russian roulette.\n  And, finally, we have done all we can to craft a bill that is as \ncost-conscious as possible, a bill that the Congressional Budget Office \nhas certified stays within our budget, and a bill that minimizes \nbureaucracy whenever possible.\n  We have worked hard to write a measure that relies whenever possible \non the private sector, not on exploding the size of big, Washington \ngovernment.\n  Before I conclude, I would like to take a minute to refute some of \nthe points that have been raised by the opponents of this legislation.\n  Yesterday, I heard my good friend from Massachusetts talking about \nhow he feels that the Senate is being stampeded with a bad bill.\n  It is hard to argue we are being stampeded, when we have worked on \nthis issue for almost 15 years.\n  I also have heard our colleague say this legislation dismantles the \nMedicare program and that the HMOs are going to make out like bandits. \nAgain, that is simply not true. Guess who was one of the people who \nhelped to bring about HMOs. None other than the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  This agreement improves the Medicare program by giving beneficiaries \nvoluntary prescription drug coverage for the first time in 40 years--\nthat is a reaffirmation of Medicare, not a weakening of it.\n  We also give beneficiaries expanded choices in their health care \ncoverage; they may remain in traditional Medicare or in their retiree \nhealth care plan. Or they may receive their coverage through local or \nregional plans offered to them through the new Medicare Advantage \nprogram.\n  Contrary to what my friend from Massachusetts says, no one will be \nforced into an HMO, and I hope that the American people are not buying \nthat kind of scare tactic.\n  The other fallacy that I heard during this debate was that the \npremium support demonstration project, which would be conducted in only \nsix metropolitan areas, is going to disadvantage beneficiaries who \nremain in traditional Medicare. I have heard it said that those \npremiums could go up by 10, 15 or 20 percent, even though we who wrote \nthe bill know that the Part B premiums for traditional Medicare could \nnot rise by any more than 5 percent over the regular premium.\n  This rhetoric is absolutely outrageous. If you look on page 254 of \nthe conference report, you will see that it is not true. The \nlegislative language speaks for itself:\n  ``The amount of the adjustment under this subsection for months in a \nyear shall not exceed 5 percent of the amount of the monthly premium.''\n  In addition, if a beneficiary is under 150% of poverty, there is no \nimpact on premiums at all.\n  And I am really getting tired of Speaker Newt Gingrich's words being \ncontinuously misconstrued.\n  He never said, as my colleagues on the other side of the aisle like \nto assert, that he wanted Medicare to wither on the vine. What he did \nsay is that the agency that controlled Medicare, HCFA, should wither on \nthe vine because it was filled with bureaucrats that were strangling \nthe program. That is a far cry from what they have been representing--\nperson after person after person.\n  He was arguing against large bureaucracies and for seniors to have \nmore control over their health care.\n  I have saved the best for last: the accusations and allegations made \nagainst\n\n[[Page S15691]]\n\nthe AARP, which are truly amazing to me. It is truly amazing how last \nyear they were considered to be the greatest organization on Earth by \nfolks on the other side of the aisle, but this year they are dirtier \nthan dirt. That is just not true.\n  It is ironic that some in this Chamber are criticizing the AARP for \nsupporting a bill that will provide drug coverage to Medicare \nbeneficiaries.\n  What a difference a year makes! Last year, the AARP could do nothing \nwrong in the eyes of today's opponents.\n  Yet, suddenly the AARP is either greedy or being taken in like a \nbunch of half-wits. So much for honest disagreement among friends!\n  What has changed? What does AARP know that the opponents of S. 1 do \nnot?\n  AARP knows that this may very well be our last chance to enact a \nprogram adding prescription drug coverage to Medicare.\n  AARP knows, as we all do, that this is not a perfect bill. But AARP \nalso knows that this bill lays a solid foundation which we can refine \nin the future.\n  In the eyes of this Senator, AARP has made a courageous decision by \nendorsing our proposal and I greatly appreciate their support\n  In conclusion, I want to commend the chairman of the Senate Finance \nCommittee, Chuck Grassley and the ranking minority member, Max Baucus \non a job well done.\n  I also want to compliment the Majority Leader, Dr. Bill Frist, on his \nleadership in shepherding this bill through the Senate.\n  Today we will make history.\n  We will break gridlock. We will act decisively to help the people of \nthis great country.\n  The citizens of this great country are counting on us to get the job \ndone.\n  So, let us clear away all the parliamentary hurdles and pass H.R. 1.\n  It is the right thing to do.\n  One last thing. I have heard some of my colleagues who are opposed to \nthis bill raise the issue that Government can do nothing to help \nrestrain the growth of drug costs or bring drug costs down. Again, this \nis a misrepresentation of what the conference agreement actually does.\n  The conference bill specifies the Government ``may not interfere with \nthe negotiations between drug manufacturers and pharmacies and PPO \nsponsors and may not require a particular formulary or institute a \nprice structure.''\n  Opponents claim that provision, which originated with Democratic \nproposals, by the way, is a concession to the pharmaceutical industry. \nThat is why it is so phony to hear these arguments. They are plain \nwrong. The noninterference provision is at the heart of the bill's \nstructure for delivering prescription drug coverage. It is a good deal \nfor consumers rather than price fixing by the CMS bureaucracy, which I \nbelieve is opening the door for universal health care. It is a \nmisrepresentation of the language in this provision to argue otherwise.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, will the Senate turn its back today on \n40 million American seniors? We are going to find out in a few hours.\n  Will a prescription drug benefit that we have promised our seniors \nfor 38 years become law or became a victim to the political agenda of a \npartisan minority?\n  This bill provides a Medicare drug benefit to 40 million seniors. It \nhas passed the House, and the President of the United States will sign \nit.\n  Only one hurdle--just one--stands in the way of seniors getting a \nMedicare drug benefit, and that is the Senate.\n  While a strong bipartisan majority in the Senate supports this drug \nbenefit bill, that may not be enough. While the American Medical \nAssociation, AARP, and hundreds of other health provider organizations \nsupport this bill, that may not be enough.\n  While businesses, health plans, citizens, and taxpayer groups support \nthis bill, it may not be enough.\n  All of this support may not be enough because this is the Senate. And \nthe minority can, if it chooses to, obstruct.\n  Incredibly, some on the Democratic side plan to kill this Medicare \ndrug benefit through a filibuster, or use any other way they can think \nof to defeat the will of the majority.\n  Points of order have been suggested. We know this bill is within the \nbudget that we passed last year. So there may be some tricky point of \norder raised, but it should not be sustained because we know this bill \nis within the budget that we passed.\n  No matter how the minority tries to block the majority in the Senate, \na filibuster by any other name is still a filibuster.\n\n  Somewhere in my home State of Kentucky, a senior is beginning a new \nweek. She will have to choose whether to take half a pill of her \nmedication, skimp on her food, or endure some other belt tightening. \nShe doesn't understand about filibusters or arcane Senate procedures. \nBut she does know that the drug benefit she needs is one step away from \nher. She thinks because the majority rules in America she will get \nrelief soon. Well, the majority rule is everywhere except here in the \nSenate, potentially. She may be wrong. Here in the Senate the will of \nthe majority can be defeated by the minority. The will of the people \ncan be thwarted by a handful--a handful.\n  This is as close as we have ever come to passing a drug benefit, and \na minority in the Senate is determined to make sure this is as close as \nwe ever get. They do not want us to ever get any closer than we are \nright now. Why? Why deny our seniors that which they absolutely \ndeserve?\n  Despite the hyperbole, it cannot be policy. This bill is based on the \n1997 Medicare Commission. It reflects bipartisan legislation, such as \nthe Breaux-Frist and the Breaux-Thomas bills. It mirrors the Federal \nEmployees Health Benefits Plan, which Senators on both sides of the \naisle have endorsed. And it is the product of countless hours of \nbipartisan negotiations between the ranking member and chairman of the \nFinance Committee.\n  Time and time again, demands have been made by the minority as to \nwhat must be and what must not be in this bill. Time and time again, \nthis leader and this chairman have met them more than halfway.\n  The problem today is not this bipartisan policy but raw partisan \npolitics.\n  Because of partisan politics, some want to keep the Medicare drug \nbenefit as the ``Holy Grail'' of American politics--something always \nsought but never found.\n  To keep their election year gimmick where the Medicare drug benefit \nis always promised but never delivered--always promised but never \ndelivered--this partisan minority will deny seniors a drug benefit now.\n  This is crass politics of the worst kind. Our seniors deserve better. \nOur parents always put us first. Now is our chance to put them first.\n  But will our seniors come in second place to political games here in \nthe Senate? In the fight for prescription drugs, second place gets \nseniors nothing. Today, we will vote to see if we put our seniors first \nor if the greatest generation ever will come in last.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I will react to some of the comments, \nparticularly the fact there is emphasis in this bill for help for low \nincome Medicare Beneficiaries. As we move forward, certainly in \nMedicare the costs obviously are going to get higher as more and more \nin this generation move into the category of Medicare eligibility.\n  This conference report contains a generous drug benefit for the dual \neligible. There is no donut for low-income Medicare beneficiaries. They \ntalk about people being less well off because of this. That is not the \ncase. This bill guarantees all 6 million dual eligibles, the people \neligible for both Medicare and Medicaid, access to prescription drugs.\n  Under the conference report, dual eligibles will have better access \nthrough Medicare, especially since State Medicaid Programs are \nincreasingly imposing restrictions on patient access to drugs.\n  Further, States have the flexibility to provide coverage for classes \nof drugs, including over-the-counter medicines not covered by the \nMedicare Program. This bill ensures appeal rights for dual eligibles. \nUnder this arrangement, duals will maintain appeal rights like all \nthose in the Medicaid Program. Dual eligibles are a fragile population, \ncertainly, and are well taken care of in this bill. The conference \nreport recognizes and provides\n\n[[Page S15692]]\n\ngenerous coverage for those 6 million beneficiaries.\n  It is time for the partisan rhetoric to be put aside and we approve \nthis bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? If no one yields time, time \nis charged equally to both sides.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I yield the Senator from Massachusetts 1 minute additional.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Would the Chair notify me when I have 1 minute \nremaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will so note.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in a very short period of time, the \nSenate will be making a judgment about whether we are going to \neffectively close off any further debate on this legislation I hold in \nmy hands. It was made available last week, on Friday, to the Members of \nthe Senate on an issue of enormous importance and significance to every \nperson in America. That is the question of Medicare and its future and \nhow our seniors are going to get their prescription drugs.\n  It seems to me that out of consideration for our senior population \nand the importance of this issue, the Members of this body ought to \nknow what is in it, what is going to benefit our senior citizens, and \nwhat is going to benefit the special interests. We think we ought to \ntake a few more days, come back next week in the Senate and debate that \nissue, spend a couple weeks discussing it.\n  But our friends on the other side say no, they had to stay in all \nweekend--which I was glad to do. We had debate on Saturday, we had \ndebate on Sunday, and now on Monday they are asking Members to vote on \nthis measure.\n  I was not in the Senate at the time they passed Social Security, but \nI was here at the time we passed Medicare. The reason we created the \nMedicare system was because private insurance companies were not paying \nattention to the elderly in this country. We debated the issue for 5 \nyears--not 4 days; 5 years--from 1960, 1961, 1962, 1963, 1964 and \nfinally we passed it in 1965. When we passed the Medicare system in \n1965, it was opposed by many on the other side of the aisle. It only \ngot 12 Republican votes.\n  This is the party that is committed to Medicare and Social Security. \nOver the period of time I have been here, we have seen constant efforts \nto undermine Medicare. It was understood when we passed Medicare that \nthere was not going to be a role for private industry to take over \nsenior citizens in the Medicare system. Many of our elderly, who have \nworked a lifetime, brought the Nation out of the Depression, fought in \nthe World Wars of this country, fought in Korea, and paid their dues to \nthe Nation, are elderly and frail and many of them have illnesses. We \nknow the private sector cherry-picks, takes the healthiest senior \ncitizens and the younger senior citizen, makes a profit, and leaves the \nothers out so they can never get any kind of protection. We rejected \nthat as a nation, passed Medicare, and said everyone is a part of it.\n  That is why it is a beloved program in the United States. Seniors \ntoday, this morning, this afternoon, last night, know their doctor, \nknow their health care delivery, have trust and confidence in Medicare. \nThey do not want to risk that. This bill does. This bill does, make no \nmistake about it. It is the beginning of the unwinding of Medicare, the \nreplacing of Medicare with the private sector and privatizing the \nMedicare system, make no mistake about it.\n\n  They are using--our friends on the other side--the words \n``prescription drug program'' in order to carry this through. I have \njust listened to some of these statements. They say: ``Don't you want \nyour parents tonight in different parts of the country to be able to \nget their prescription drugs in order to meet our responsibility?''\n  We have been trying to do that. And we did it pretty well--not as \nwell as I would have liked--several months ago, in a bipartisan bill we \ncreated a prescription drug program. But the bill we have now has \nhijacked the prescription drug program and used it as an excuse to \nundermine the Medicare system, to require, effectively, or coerce our \nsenior citizens to leave Medicare and to go into HMOs in order to be \nable to get the prescription drug program.\n  The subsidies that are provided for the HMOs are scandalous--\nscandalous. We hear about ``free competition.'' There is no more free \ncompetition than the man in the Moon in this with the kind of subsidies \nthat are given. And who is paying for those subsidies? The elderly \npeople.\n  It is undermining the Medicare system in three different ways.\n  First of all, it undermines the Medicare system because of the \nunconscionable subsidies it gives to the HMOs, which will permit them \nto lower their premiums to draw and coerce seniors out of Medicare to \ngo for HMOs.\n  Second, we have premium support. Premium support just means the costs \nfor our seniors who remain in Medicare will be going up.\n  Is that what I say? Yes. But who else says it? The Medicare actuaries \nsay there will be an explosion in the increase of the cost of premiums. \nDo we want to take that risk? Do we want to say, well, let's try an \nexperiment with our nation's seniors? Why do we need an experiment when \nwe know the premiums are going to go up?\n  The third is the undermining of employer-based systems through the \nHSAs. They tried it. They fought for it. It is an ideological \ncommitment on the other side, and they have that included in the \nreport.\n  All those three measures were not in the Senate bill but in the House \nbill. That is why the bill passed with only one vote in the House of \nRepresentatives. Imagine that. If this is such a wonderful bill, why \nwould they only be able to pass it by one vote? That is all they passed \nit by the first time it came up in the House of Representatives. Then, \nafter twisting arms, cajoling, effectively bribing Members in the House \nof Representatives, keeping the tab open for 3 hours, they were able to \nbring together and carry the vote on the repot by just four or five \nvotes--this overwhelming new program that is so good for everyone? It \npassed by such a narrow margin. And now they are trying to jam it \nthrough the Senate.\n  We all know what is going on. It is the objective of our good friends \non the other side; and that is the beginning of the dismantling of the \nMedicare system, make no mistake about it.\n  I was here when Medicare passed in 1965. I was here in 1964 when it \nfailed. I remember the debate. I remember very clearly. And we are \nseeing, if this bill passes, the beginning of the unwinding of the \nMedicare system.\n  Now, you can say: Well, Senator, you are really extending yourself on \nthis and your interpretation of the motivation on the other side. I am \nsaying they want to undermine the Medicare system. And the next is \ngoing to be Social Security, make no mistake about it.\n  Is that what I say? No. This is just reported in the Washington Post \nthis past week. Just read it. It does a lot better sometimes to read \nwhat the objective is in the White House and what their statements are \nrather than necessarily the speeches by some of our Members on the \nfloor.\n  Here it is in the Washington Post, on page A-14: Presidential adviser \nsaid Bush is intent on being able to say that reworking Social Security \nis part of my mandate if he wins. This is it. President Bush aids \nreviving the long-shelved plan on Social Security. It is the \nprivatization of Medicare. And next is Social Security. That has been \ntheir objective.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Now, Mr. President, we are strongly committed--when this \nbill fails or goes down, or a legitimate point of order is made--that \nwe go back to the drawing boards. I am as strongly committed to get an \neffective prescription drug program as I was when I stood earlier this \nyear when we passed a good program here in the Senate in a bipartisan \nway, and as I was when I stood with the Senator from Florida and the \nSenator from Georgia, Mr. Graham and Mr. Miller, when they fought for a \ngood program here, and we got 52 votes for it.\n  But when we hear all this chatter over on the other side about, oh, \nmy goodness, they are filibustering the bill, they filibustered that \nbill--Republicans filibustered that bill a year and a half ago. We got \n52 votes. They would not let it pass. They refused to. It was a good \nbill.\n  So let's go back to the drawing boards. Let's go back to that \nconference. Sure, they will say: Well, we\n\n[[Page S15693]]\n\ncan't. It is conferenced. They say we have Thanksgiving coming up. We \ncan't do it. We would like to be home for Thanksgiving. But this is a \nmatter of life and death for many of our senior citizens.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thought I asked the Chair to inform me when I had 1 \nminute left.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I rapped the gavel and said 1 minute. I \nthought the Senator had seen it.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, Mr. President, I hope we will not invoke cloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? Who yields time?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Utah for 3 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have listened to my dear friend and \ncolleague from Massachusetts. I guess he wants us to spend another 15 \nyears either trying to reform Medicare, improve Medicare or pass \nanother prescription drug benefit program through the Congress.\n  We are putting up $400 billion over 10 years, for both a Medicare \ndrug benefit, something that seniors currently do not have today, and \nMedicare program improvements. Medicare beneficiaries have a choice of \nwhether or not they want to participate in this program. They may \nremain in traditional Medicare. And, to be honest with you, those \nremaining in traditional Medicare who end up participating in the \ncomparative cost adjustment demonstration project will not see their \npremiums increase more than 5 percent.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. HATCH. I only have a few minutes, so I would like to finish my \ncomments.\n  According to my colleague from Massachusetts, we are dismantling \nMedicare. That could not be further from the truth.\n  How can we say that--when we are improving and strengthening \nMedicare, we are giving Medicare beneficiaries a choice of coverage, \nand we are giving them $400 billion to help with their prescription \ndrug coverage and Medicare benefits. These new choices include the \nplans created under the new Medicare Advantage Program, the stand-alone \ndrug plan, the regional plans, the local plans--how on Earth is that \ndismantling Medicare? And this coming from one in this body who was one \nof the major proponents of HMOs, to begin with? I might add, I have \nbeen here long enough to have remembered that.\n  Next is Social Security? Nobody in this body wants to hurt Social \nSecurity, and the Senator from Massachusetts knows that. Since when \ndoes the Washington Post have the inside track on the Senate Republican \nagenda? Give me a break.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield on that issue?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am going to finish in just a minute.\n  Again, I think my friend from Massachusetts, as great a Senator as he \nis, is trying to scare senior citizens. And, frankly, I think to say \nlet's just not pass this bill and let's go back to the drawing boards \nis just plain wrong. The Members of the Medicare conference have been \nmeeting for hours and hours, days, weeks, months to figure out how to \nprovide Medicare beneficiaries with the best drug coverage possible. \nThere are Members of Congress who have been working on this issue, \ntrying to get a bill signed into law, for close to 15 years. And we are \nalmost at the finish line. Yet my good colleague wants to go back to \nanother 15 years of floundering around on this issue.\n\n  Now, if beneficiaries did not have choice in drug coverage, maybe my \nfriend from Massachusetts would have a point. But seniors will have \nchoice in coverage. Why would we go back to the drawing board, \nespecially after all the time and effort we have put in this \nlegislation? We have before us a bill that really does so much for \nseniors. The AARP is coming out strongly behind this bill, because they \nknow full well that it is the last train out of the station, it is the \nonly way we can go. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation so \nMedicare beneficiaries can finally have what they have wanted for close \nto 40 years--comprehensive prescription drug coverage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nVermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized for 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I have been listening closely to our \ncolleagues and their many statements of support or opposition to the \nMedicare Prescription Drug and Modernization Act of 2003.\n  Some have said this is the culmination of the debate we began last \nyear. But this debate is much older than just a year, or even 2 years.\n  The debate as to whether, and if so how, to provide prescription \ndrugs for the elderly through the Medicare program has been with us \nsince the very beginning of the program.\n  Thirty-eight years ago, when this body engaged in the historic debate \non the original Medicare bill, Senator Jacob Javits from the state of \nNew York offered an amendment to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries \nwould have access to prescription drugs. Senator Javits was asked to \nmodify his amendment to a study that would examine the assurance of \npaying for drugs, methods of avoiding unnecessary utilization of drugs \nand mechanisms for controlling costs.\n  Now, almost 40 years later, they are still debating the very same \nissues that were part of the 1965 Javits debate. We should enact a \nprescription drug benefit today. The doom and gloom scenario painted by \nthe bill's opponents is as exaggerated as the claims that this bill \nwill solve all seniors' needs. It is time to put aside our differences \nfor the good of all seniors. This is not a perfect bill, but it is a \nvery good bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. May I have an additional 1 minute?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Without objection.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Forty million seniors and disabled Americans need help \nnow. They cannot afford to wait for a perfect program because it may \nnever come. The bill provides the foundations we need. In the final \nanalysis, I find there are more reasons to support this bill than to \noppose it. I fear that if we do not take this golden opportunity, we \nwill have lost it forever.\n  We have on one hand the opportunity to provide the largest benefit \nimprovements to Medicare in nearly 40 years, including a comprehensive \nand universal prescription drug benefit.\n  On the other hand, we can turn away from the proposal before us \ntoday, and return yet again to the drawing board in search of \nperfection.\n  I believe it is time that we begin to offer a real benefit instead of \nmore studies, more analysis and more delay. We should enact a \nprescription drug benefit today.\n  Let's take a moment to look at some of the issues, because I think it \nis worth dwelling on why I think we should vote in support of this \nmeasure.\n  Vermont already has one of the most generous prescription drug \nprograms for the elderly and disabled.\n  As part of a waiver through the Medicaid program, Vermont expanded \nits ``V-Script'' state pharmacy assistance program and extended \nsubsidized coverage to individuals at 250 percent of poverty, well \nabove the income levels that provide subsidies in this measure.\n  In fact, the Vermont V-Script program is so generous that some have \nargued that people will be worse off with a less-generous Federal \nbenefit. I don't think that's the case.\n  First, in today's economy there is no guarantee that Vermont will be \nable to continue its current level of support for the V-Script program.\n  But this bill dedicates almost $400 billion to the development of a \nuniversal prescription drug program, representing the largest expansion \nof the Medicare program since its inception.\n  This bill will guarantee a comprehensive and universal drug benefit \nto 41 million seniors in America.\n  That includes all 93,000 seniors in my own home state of Vermont. \nAnd, it guarantees the same coverage to the millions of baby-boomers \nwho will soon rely on Medicare.\n  For 40,000 seniors in Vermont with limited savings and incomes below \n$13,470 for individuals and $18,180 for couples, the Federal Government \nwill cover most of their drug costs. In fact, nearly one-third of all \nseniors nationwide will receive assistance for nearly 90 percent of \ntheir drug costs.\n\n[[Page S15694]]\n\n  Additionally, Medicare, instead of Medicaid, will now assume the \nprescription drug costs for 21,767 Vermont beneficiaries who are \neligible for both Medicare and Medicaid.\n  According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, this \nwill save Vermont $76 million over 8 years on prescription drug \ncoverage for its Medicaid population.\n  Finally, the bill includes provisions that will allow States such as \nVermont that have pharmacy assistance programs to augment, or ``wrap-\naround'' the Federal Medicare benefit with State resources.\n  In fact, there is nothing in the legislation that would preclude \nVermont, should it wish, from using the savings to establish its own \nprescription drug plan as long as it meets the requirements of the \nbill.\n  Some of our colleagues have criticized this bill, arguing that it \nwould lead to an increase in employers dropping or reducing \nprescription drug coverage for its retirees.\n  I have looked at the estimates put forth by the Congressional Budget \nOffice and the employee benefit think tanks, and I am concerned with \nthose numbers.\n  But again, it is important to consider this potential downside in \nlight of what is already occurring.\n  The number of employers providing prescription drug benefits has \nalready been steadily declining for years, and without this Federal \nguarantee those disenfranchised workers would not have any benefit at \nall.\n  In short, no senior, regardless of income, will go without \nprescription drug coverage in Vermont or throughout America once this \nlegislation is enacted. That is, in part, why two of the largest \nnational aging organizations such as AARP and the National Council of \nOlder Americans supports this legislation.\n  And it why the Vermont AARP supports it as well.\n  Perhaps most important of all is the $25 billion for rural providers, \nending years of unfair payments to rural hospitals, doctors and other \nproviders.\n  This bill will ensure reliable access to health care services for \nseniors by better compensating health care providers.\n  I have already seen estimates that these rural provisions will \nprovide Vermont hospitals with an additional $41 million over the next \n10 years, and physicians will get a boost of $18 million in \nreimbursements over the next 2 years.\n  I have received many announcements from many Vermont constituents and \nstakeholders, including the Vermont AARP, the Fletcher Allen Health \nCenter, the Vermont Association of Hospitals and Health Systems.\n  I am also glad that Chairman Grassley and ranking member Baucus have \nworked with me to address another inequity in the system.\n  Critical access hospitals provide care in some of the most \nunderserved regions of Vermont, as is the case throughout rural \nAmerica. These hospitals are small, yet serve as critical resources to \ntheir communities.\n  So I am pleased to see that the conferees retained a provision from \nthe Senate measure that will allow critical access hospitals, such as \nMt. Ascutney Hospital in Windsor, VT, to expand access to psychiatric \nand rehabilitative services to the most vulnerable citizens in that \ncommunity.\n  Finally, I would like to acknowledge the conferees for retaining \nanother key provision from the Senate bill that will begin a major \ndemonstration on improving quality and patient outcomes for Medicare \nbeneficiaries.\n  This is the result of several years of working in concert with Dr. \nJack Wennberg at Dartmouth College to bring greater attention to the \nregional disparities in the consumption of health resources without the \nimprovement in health outcomes to show for it.\n  I acknowledge the sentiments of many of my colleagues here today. I \ntoo agree that this is not the bill I would have written if I had \ninfinite resources to do it.\n  This bill is not perfect. However, after all of the time that has \nbeen spent on trying to develop a Medicare plan for prescription \ndrugs--38 years--it would be a missed opportunity if we reject this \ngood beginning to comprehensive coverage.\n  By passing this bill, we are laying the foundation. A foundation that \nrequires constant vigilance, as has the original Medicare program.\n  So in closing, I would like to urge my colleagues from both sides of \nthe aisle to support this bill as we move forward.\n  This bill will establish a drug benefit that is universal, \ncomprehensive, affordable, and sustainable.\n  This bill restores necessary and long-needed fairness to our \nphysicians and providers in rural areas. And, the bill will improve the \nquality of care offered under Medicare.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in voting for the measure.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the following article printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nAARP Calls on Vermont Congressional Delegation To Vote for Medicare Rx \n                                  Bill\n\n       (Montpelier, Vermont) Earlier this week AARP, the leading \n     advocate for older Americans with 35 million members \n     nationwide and more than 116,000 in Vermont, endorsed the \n     Conference Committee's Medicare Rx bill. Their bill \n     represents a first step in the nation's commitment to \n     strengthen and expand health security for its citizens.\n       ``For the first time in the history of the Medicare \n     program, more than 90,000 Vermont Medicare beneficiaries will \n     have access to a prescription drug benefit. This is about \n     getting vital help to people who need it most--people whose \n     high drug costs have become a heavy burden to them and their \n     families,'' said Philene Taormina, AARP Vermont Director of \n     Advocacy.\n       AARP and its members call on the Vermont Congressional \n     delegation to vote for the Conference Report that establishes \n     a prescription drug benefit in Medicare.\n       In a survey conducted Wednesday of this week 83 percent of \n     AARP members polled supported enactment of the Medicare \n     legislation. Further, 75 percent of respondents said that the \n     proposed Medicare legislation should be passed because it \n     will help low-income elderly and those with high prescription \n     drug costs. Among middle and big-income individuals, 80 \n     percent were in favor of passing the legislation for this \n     reason; support for the bill was evenly split among Democrats \n     and Republicans.\n       Every day, AARP receives letters and calls from our members \n     recounting how the high cost of prescription drugs is hurting \n     their financial and physical health. We believe that the \n     legislation that has emerged after long negotiations is the \n     right start to relieve these burdens for millions of older \n     and disabled Americans and their families. Though not \n     perfect, the bill represents an historic breakthrough and an \n     important milestone in the nation's commitment to strengthen \n     and expand health security for current and future \n     beneficiaries. This Medicare legislation guarantees a \n     voluntary drug plan is available for all Medicare \n     beneficiaries, regardless of where they live.\n                                  ____\n\n\n Vermont Physicians and Hospitals Strongly Support Passage of Medicare \n                           Reform Legislation\n\n       Montpelier.--The Vermont Medical Society (VMS), Fletcher \n     Allen Health Care and the Vermont Association of Hospitals \n     and Health Systems today announced their strong support for \n     the Medicare Prescription Drug and Modernization Act of 2003 \n     conference report and urged tri-partisan support for its \n     passage. Not only will the bill provide a prescription drug \n     benefit to almost 93,000 Vermonters for the first time in the \n     history of the Medicare program--beginning in January 2006--\n     but it will also increase access to physician services for \n     Medicare beneficiaries in Vermont and improve Medicare \n     reimbursement rates for Vermont's rural hospital system.\n       The legislation provides approximately $28 billion \n     nationwide to correct a number of basic inequities in \n     Medicare's reimbursement system for rural providers. \n     Physicians in rural areas like Vermont are currently paid far \n     less under the Medicare program than their colleagues in \n     urban areas for doing the same procedures. In fact, in 1998 \n     Vermont received the lowest payment of any state for its \n     Medicare beneficiaries. This poor reimbursement continued \n     despite Vermont being ranked this year as 2nd highest in the \n     country in the quality of care provided to Medicare patients.\n       The Medicare prescription drug benefit bill being \n     considered by Congress will greatly reduce the geographic \n     disparities in physician payments. ``If the Medicare bill is \n     passed it will be much easier to recruit physicians to serve \n     rural states like Vermont,'' said VMS President James \n     O'Brien, MD. ``Congress must pass this legislation before the \n     Thanksgiving recess to fix many of the reimbursement issues \n     that have unfairly penalized Vermont.''\n       ``Clearly, this bill will benefit Vermont's rural health \n     care system as well as Fletcher Allen,'' said Melinda Estes, \n     president and Chief Executive Officer, Fletcher Allen Health \n     Care. ``It provides real benefits for all Vermonters.''\n       The legislation protects Vermonters' access to physicians \n     by replacing a 4.5 percent\n\n[[Page S15695]]\n\n     payment cut scheduled for 2004, which would have reduced \n     Medicare payments to Vermont physicians and hospitals by $6.7 \n     million, with two years of modest payment increases. The \n     Vermont Medical Society estimates that if the bill passes, \n     Vermont providers will see an increase in payments of more \n     than $2 million a year. The improved reimbursement will \n     encourage physicians to lift restrictions on how many \n     Medicare patients they accept in their practices.\n       Rural Vermont hospitals will also benefit if the Medicare \n     bill passes, because they will be paid at the same rate for \n     procedures as hospitals in more urban areas. Richard Slusky, \n     administrator of Mt. Ascutney Hospital stated, ``This bill is \n     an important step forward for Vermont's Medicare \n     beneficiaries and our small, rural hospitals. As a Medicare-\n     designated Critical Access Hospital, the rural hospital \n     provisions in this bill will strengthen our ability to \n     provide the local services our patients need. This assistance \n     could not have come at a better time for our community.''\n       Bea Grause, President and CEO of the Vermont Association of \n     Hospitals and Health Systems (VAHHS), believes that the bill \n     is good for Vermont hospitals and for Vermont hospitals and \n     for Vermonters with commercial health insurance coverage. \n     ``This bill will increase Medicare payments to Vermont \n     hospitals by $41 million over ten years.\n       This will help to reduce the cost shift to Vermonters with \n     commercial health insurance coverage and will move us toward \n     a fairer reimbursement system for our rural hospitals with a \n     high percentage of Medicare recipients in their case mix.''\n       The provisions improving access for Vermont Medicare \n     beneficiaries and reducing disparities in payment for rural \n     providers were added to the conference committee report \n     through the efforts of Sen. James Jeffords. The Vermont \n     Medical Society, Fletcher Allen Health Care and the Vermont \n     Association of Hospitals and Health Systems commend Sen. \n     Jeffords for his work to protect the Medicare benefits of all \n     Vermonters.\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, could the Chair tell us how much time \nremains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirteen/15 on your side; 15/40 the other \nside.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I thank the Chair. I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe chairman from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I should not take more than 5 minutes, \nso please tell me when 5 minutes are up.\n  This is the opportunity, a time of destiny, whether or not this \nCongress will deliver on the promises of the last three elections, the \npromises the other party has made as well. Thank God there are people \nin the Democratic Party who are working in a bipartisan way to deliver \non the promises of that party as there are Republicans willing to \ndeliver on the promises of the Republican Party.\n  Nothing gets done in this body without bipartisanship. This is \nbipartisan. We are putting aside partisanship. It is time the other \nside put aside rhetoric and complete our work on this bill for which \nthe AARP says seniors have waited far too long.\n  This bill offers an affordable, universal prescription drug benefit. \nThis bipartisan bill offers better coverage than today's Medigap \npolicies plus Medicare. It also offers much more generous coverage for \n14 million lower income seniors. And just to emphasize this point, this \nbill does not harm 6 million seniors, as the opponents of this \nlegislation claim. That is political poppycock.\n  In fact, this bill protects the benefits for these 6 million and then \nadds generous prescription drug coverage for an additional 8 million. \nIt expands coverage for lower income seniors, far more than anything \noffered today. This means that for about two in five seniors, this bill \noffers drug coverage with lower or no premiums, no coverage gap, and \ncoverage of 85 to 95 percent of the cost of prescription drugs. And it \nis voluntary.\n  The opponents of this legislation happen to believe--and they \nsincerely believe--that Government should always force people into \ndoing something. We want the right to choose for our seniors. Seniors \ncan stay in traditional Medicare if they like what they have today and \nhave full access to prescription drugs. There is also a guaranteed \nGovernment fallback if private plans might not go to all rural areas of \nAmerica. This bill protects retiree benefits in the corporation from \nwhich they retired. Overall, we put $89 billion in this bill to protect \nretiree health coverage.\n  This bill also creates new choices similar to what Federal employees \nhave for beneficiaries in a new revitalized Medicare Advantage Program. \nWith respect to drug costs, the bill speeds the delivery of new generic \ndrugs to the marketplace, lowering drug costs to Americans and not just \nthose on Medicare.\n  Finally, the bill includes long overdue improvements in Medicare's \ncomplex regulations. It also revitalizes the rural health care safety \nnet with the biggest package of rural payment improvements that \nCongress has ever done or seen. I urge my colleagues to put the \ninterests of our seniors first and give them more choices and better \nbenefits by supporting this bill.\n  Most importantly, we have brought this bill as far as we have over \nthe last 4 or 5 years because of bipartisanship. I hope this body will \nnot let the narrow partisanship of a few on the other side of the aisle \ndestroy our efforts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts, Mr. Kennedy.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I didn't hear a word from the chairman of \nthe Finance Committee on what he is going to do or what this bill is \ngoing to do with regard to costs. Hello? Costs. There is virtual \nsilence in this bill.\n  We know what is happening to the senior citizens. It is an issue of \naccess to prescription drugs and it is an issue of cost. This bill does \nnot meet its responsibility in terms of protecting our senior citizens \nwith regard to the cost.\n  The Senator from Iowa mentioned the numbers of people who are going \nto be the losers. If the Senator has trouble with this, just ask the \nBudget Committee, not the Senator from Massachusetts. They said that 6 \nmillion seniors who are on Medicaid are going to lose their coverage. \nThat isn't the Senator from Iowa or Massachusetts, that is the \nfinancial analysis. And 2.7 million retirees are going to be dropped, \nfor a total loss of 9 million; almost 25 percent of the total retirees \nare going to be lost.\n  We can do better. We can do something about the escalation of cost, \nbut they refuse to do it. Let's go back to the drawing board and do \nsomething that is worthwhile.\n  The Senate is on trial today. In a few moments we will vote to stop \nthis charade. But I say this today: I am going to fight this bill with \neverything I have and, if necessarily, fight it tomorrow, next week, \nand next year. I will fight it for the nurse who paid into our hospital \nretirement fund for 20 years and the 3 million retirees like her who \nwill lose their health insurance because of this bill. I will fight for \nthe city workers in Springfield, MA, whose brave mayor plans to \npurchase cheaper prescription drugs from Canada for them and their \nfamilies, an action that is illegal--do you understand?--illegal under \nthis bill. I will fight for the widowed grandmother on Medicaid and the \n7 million poor Americans like her who count every penny yet will pay \nmore for their prescription drugs under this bill. And I will fight for \nthe 36 million Medicare seniors who want to stay in the program they \nlove with the doctors and the hospitals they choose.\n  I will fight to keep billions and billions of Medicare dollars that \ncome out of your paycheck from lining the pocketbooks of the big drug \ncompanies and the HMOs. I will fight it for our honor as a nation that \nkeeps its commitment to our seniors, the ones who fought our wars, \nraised our families, and built our economy.\n\n  The more the American people learn about this legislation, the less \nthey like it. The more senior citizens learn, the more they oppose it. \nLet us not reverse the historic decision our country made in 1965. Let \nus not turn our backs on our senior citizens so that insurance \ncompanies and pharmaceutical companies can earn even higher profits. \nLet us reject this bill and come back and do the job right.\n  I withhold the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I think one of the subjects that really \nunited both Republicans and Democrats was the question about dual \neligibles. There was a large number of seniors being treated as second-\nclass citizens\n\n[[Page S15696]]\n\nof this country because, if they were poor, they were not in the \nMedicare Program. If they were poor, they were not allowed to get \nthrough the Medicare door, and for no other reason than they were poor.\n  Under that scenario, low-income seniors, maybe 80 years old, who \nworked all of their lives, but ended up in a very low-income status, \nwere relegated to the Medicaid Program, where there was not a \nconsistent amount of benefits for their health care programs. They were \nsubject to the will and whims of the various State legislatures. Some \ntreated them better, some treated them worse, and some didn't treat \nthem hardly at all.\n  What we were able to do, which I thought was a priority for many \nRepublicans because it was in the House bill--but it also was a \npriority for many Democrats in this body--was to say that we are going \nto bring those low-income seniors, for the first time, into the Federal \nMedicare Program. We did that. That is part of this bill. Those low-\nincome seniors now are going to have the opportunity to be in the \nFederal Medicare Program. They will know what their benefits are. They \nwill know, for the first time, they have access to prescription drugs, \nwhich is what I think the bill is all about. In addition, we were able \nto find an extra amount of money to help them with any type of \ncopayments they might have.\n  Some States have high copayments; some States have no copayments on \ndrugs. But what we were able to do was to say: Here is extra money for \nthe purpose of helping States to reduce the copayments down to $1, if \nthey are buying a generic drug and only $3 if they are buying a \nprescription drug. In addition to that, the subsidies and assistance we \nhave for low-income seniors in general is extremely important.\n  Starting in April of this coming year, they will get a drug discount \ncard. If they are low-income, they will start off with a $600 credit on \nthat card, to be able to immediately have the benefit of something, \nwhere they have nothing at all today.\n  On balance, when you have a 150 percent of poverty and below special \nassistance program, when you have a discount card that starts in April, \nand all of the seniors, for the first time, will be in the same Federal \nprogram, I think that is significant. For the first time, we will say \nto seniors who are low income that you will no longer be treated as a \nsecond-class citizen and be different from all of the other seniors you \nknow. You will be part of the Federal program and you will have access \nto prescription drugs.\n  Again, I think the question is, Have we designed a perfect bill? The \nanswer is no. But I think when you look to associations such as AARP \nand the National Council on the Aging, we have a bill that merits their \nsupport.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my understanding is that we have 12 minutes \nleft.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. We have allocated time to Senator Edwards, 3 minutes; is \nthat right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. \nKennedy. We want to make sure we will use all of our time now. If \nSenator Edwards isn't here, that time will run because Senator Frist \ngets the last 5 minutes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will just take a few moments to review \nfor our colleagues what the implications of this bill will be for my \nState of Massachusetts. I can say that this is very typical of what is \ngoing to happen just about to every State. We have three MSA \npotentially eligible for premium support--the program that will raise \npremiums and effectively drive our seniors out of Medicare into the \nhands of the HMOs. We have three potentially eligible. We have 62,000 \nretirees who will lose their drug coverage. They are part of the 6 \nmillion nationally, and those figures are the figures that have been \nfound by the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. So we have 62,000 \nretirees who will lose their drug coverage. And 185,500 low-income \nelderly and disabled will pay more for prescription drugs. We have \n60,000 low-income elderly and disabled who will fail the assets and \nincome test in Massachusetts.\n  This conference reimposed the asset test, which we had eliminated \nhere by 67 votes in the Senate. They reimposed it. So there are 2.8 \nmillion across the country, and 60,000 in my State, who will fail the \nasset test, and 34,920 seniors will pay more for Part B premiums.\n  In the few hours of this debate, the proponents of this legislation \nhave described their proposal in the most benign and misleading terms. \nThey say it gives seniors the freedom to choose among competing plans \nand gives protection to the poor seniors. They say this bill will lower \ndrug prices through competition. They say at least it helps low-income \nseniors. They are absolutely wrong on all those counts.\n  Here is the truth: This is a partisan plan, I remind my friend from \nIowa. You saw the vote over in the House of Representatives, what the \nRepublican leadership had to do to coerce Members to pass it. That \nanswers the question as to whether or not this is a partisan plan. This \npartisan program is out of the mainstream. The proposal damages \nMedicare and leaves the millions of senior citizens who rely on it \nwithout a lifeline. It is the first step toward a total dismantling of \nMedicare. In exchange for destroying Medicare, it offers senior \ncitizens a paltry and inadequate drug benefit. The moment it is \nimplemented, it will make 9 million senior citizens--almost a quarter \nof all senior citizens--worse off than they are today.\n  Senior citizens already have the most important choice they want--the \nchoice of doctors and hospitals they trust. That is the choice they \nwant, not higher premiums and premium support. Those are their choices \nif we pass this. They lose if they are forced to join HMOs and PPOs, or \nother programs that say an insurance company bureaucrat can choose \ntheir doctor for them.\n  Senior citizens already have the choice to join a private insurance \nplan competing with Medicare if they choose. But 9 out of 10 prefer to \nstay in Medicare. So they already have a choice and they are not taking \nit. But under this bill, you are providing so much in terms of \neffectively bribing them, and overpayments that they will eventually \ncoerce those seniors. The bipartisan bill that passed the Senate \nprovided additional choice, a program for regional PPOs. The conference \nadopted a right-wing House approach of ending Medicare as we know it \nand establishes a massive demonstration program that would subject 7 \nmillion senior citizens--1 out of 6--to a so-called premium support \nprogram.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to rebut \nsome of the points raised by the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  First, he mentioned he is concerned about the cost of this bill. Let \nme remind my friend from Massachusetts that last year, he supported a \nbill that would have not only cost $800 billion, it would have \nsunsetted the Medicare prescription drug benefit. How would that have \nhelped senior citizens and other Medicare beneficiaries, especially the \ndisabled?\n  Our bill costs $400 billion over 10 years and it is a permanent \nbenefit.\n  He also mentioned retiree health benefits and how individuals are \ngoing to lose their coverage as a result of the bill. Let me correct \nthat statement for the record. First, $89 billion--yes, I said $89 \nbillion--is devoted to employer subsidies in order to preserve retiree \nhealth benefits, so individuals will not lose their retiree health \ncoverage. We have gone from a drop-out rate of 37 percent in H.R. 1, to \na drop-out rate of under 20 percent. Again, my colleague is simply \nusing scare tactics.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I see the Senator from North Carolina \nhere. He wanted some time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes 10 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am glad to yield that to the Senator. I know he \nintended to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. I \nspoke yesterday, but I wish to speak once again on this bill.\n  This bill is a perfect example of the kind of legislation that should \nnot go through the Senate. It is a giveaway to HMOs and insurance \ncompanies, a giveaway to big drug companies, a continuation of this \nadministration's shifting\n\n[[Page S15697]]\n\nof the tax burden in America from wealth and the wealthy to work and \nthe middle class.\n  It is not shocking that there is a $12 billion stabilization fund in \nthis bill--$12 billion of taxpayer money that is going to go to HMOs so \nthat they can compete? I thought the whole purpose of this bill was so \nthat HMOs could provide competition. We are going to give $12 billion \nof taxpayer money--money that, in fact, could go to providing a better \nprescription drug benefit to seniors who desperately need it, instead \nof using that money to cover seniors, to give them help in getting the \nmedicine they desperately need when they go to the pharmacy. No, \ninstead we are going to give $12 billion of taxpayer money to HMOs. \nThat is a great idea. That is just a terrific idea.\n  On top of all that, we are not going to do anything meaningful to \nbring down the cost of prescription drugs. We have been through this \nfight over and over. We fight to try to allow reimportation of \nprescription medication from Canada, to bring down costs for people in \nAmerica. Does it pass? No. Can we get it into this bill? No. Why? \nBecause the drug companies are against it.\n  We try to do something about misleading company advertising on \ntelevision. Billions and billions of dollars are being spent every year \nby drug companies on television advertising. Much of the advertising is \nmisleading. We know who is paying for this advertising: consumers, \nseniors, every time they go to the pharmacy, are paying for those ads. \nWhen we try to do something about that advertising, try to put some \nkind of reasonable controls on it, are we able to do it? Are we \nsuccessful? No. Why? Because the drug companies are against it.\n  We cannot even allow the Government to use its bargaining power to \nbring down the cost of prescription drugs for all seniors.\n  This bill is a giveaway--a giveaway to HMOs, a giveaway to drug \ncompanies. It is not surprising that as a result of looking as if this \nbill is about to pass, the drug companies' stock and HMO stock is \nrising.\n  One thing I can tell you for sure, if this bill passes, it will pass \nover the dead bodies of a lot of us standing here fighting against it. \nIf this bill passes, the lobbyists will be celebrating all over this \ntown, lobbyists who worked this bill every single day on behalf of the \nHMOs and the drug companies.\n  I grew up in a small town in North Carolina in a rural area. There \nare more lobbyists for those industries around Washington, DC, than \npeople who live in my hometown. How about if we in the Senate stand up \nfor the kind of people I grew up with in that small town? How about if \nwe actually stand up to big drug companies and big HMOs?\n  Speaking for this Senator, I intend to stand up to those people. I \nwill vote no and fight with everything I have to stop this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nMontana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority still has time at this point.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes ten seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will be glad to wait until the Senator concludes, and \nthen I will yield the remaining 3 minutes to my colleague from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana has 1 minute.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, there is not a lot to say in 1 minute. I \nwill do the best I can.\n  Essentially, we have $400 billion in prescription drugs for seniors. \nI do not see how in the world we can let that moment pass by.\n  It was said before that there are not enough low-income benefits for \nseniors. The previous speakers said that. They are wrong. One-third of \nour seniors will get such benefits under this bill that 95 percent of \ntheir benefits will be paid for. One-third of American seniors will \nfind that 95 percent of their benefits are paid for. The allegation is \nthere is no help for low-income seniors. That is just flat wrong.\n  There were a lot of other statements made by those opposed to this \nlegislation that are flat wrong. Some say 10 million will be affected \nby premium support. Flat wrong. We asked CBO what the number is. They \nsaid 600 to 700 to 1 million.\n  Some people say 6 million were going to be hurt by Medicaid. Flat \nwrong. It is much less than that.\n  I strongly urge Senators to look at the facts. Vote for the bill and \nparticularly vote against the points of order because those are mere \ntechnicalities. They don't go to the substance of the bill. It is \nimportant to pass this legislation now for seniors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the Senator from Montana just admitted the \ncase. He said it is much less than that. He is arguing over fewer \npeople being hurt, not whether any are going to be hurt.\n  The question is, Why are people going to be hurt? How many people \nknow there is going to be $25 billion raised in new revenue directly \nout of the pocket of senior citizens because we are going to increase \nthe cost for the traditional Medicare coverage for doctor and hospital \nvisits?\n  This is following right in the wake of the Energy bill. Same deal. \nYou pick up the newspapers and you see a headline: Drug companies win \nin battle over prescription drugs. Who do you think lost if the drug \ncompanies won? The senior citizens.\n  There will be $139 billion or $125 billion, depending on which you \nread, of windfall profits to the drug companies. Why are the drug \nstocks going up the way they are? The difference between Medicare \nadministrative costs, which are 2 percent, and drug company \nadministrative costs, which are 15 to 20 percent, are now going to run \nroughshod over seniors who are going to be paying the additional \nadministrative costs, and they are not going to get the benefit of \nlower cost drugs.\n  There is nothing in this legislation that lowers the cost of \nprescription drugs. Indeed, it is the opposite. By pushing seniors off \nMedicare into HMOs and giving them the tough choice that if they were \nto stay where they have the ability to, they are going to pay more, \nthey are going to be picking up the additional cost. This is going to \nbe like catastrophic insurance in the 1980s when they pass legislation \nthey think is good and seniors find out how complicated it is and how \nmuch more they are paying, which is exactly why it has been set for \n2006 for implementation. It took us 11 months to put the entire \nMedicare Program in place. Why can't we put a prescription drug benefit \nin place 2 months from now or 3 months from now? Why does it have to be \n2006 after the 2004 election? This is one of the greatest giveaways \nthat I have seen in this city in a long time.\n\n  We are not even going to allow Medicare to negotiate lower bulk \nprices. The State of Maine is allowed to do that. We have veterans who \nare allowed to do that. We have veterans in this country for whom the \nVA, in an almost unanimously adopted amendment in this body, can go out \nand do bulk purchasing. And we are not going to allow Medicare to bulk \npurchase and lower the prices.\n  We should vote no. This is wrong. It is a giveaway. It is a special \ninterest bonanza.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The majority \nleader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we bring debate to a close prior to a very \nhistoric vote in which we are making a decision whether to give 40 \nmillion seniors the opportunity, for the first time through Medicare--\nthe program that has been constructed and been used to give them health \ncare security--whether for the first time these 40 million seniors will \nhave access through that program to prescription drugs, to the tool \nwhich is the most powerful element of health care security today. \nSeniors don't have it. What we are voting on today is to give them that \ntrue health care security.\n  America's seniors have waited 38 years for this prescription drug \nbenefit to be added to the Medicare Program, and today they are just \nmoments away from prescription drug coverage that they desperately need \nand deserve.\n  It is clear that in this body there is a bipartisan majority--and I \nwould say an overwhelming bipartisan majority--in favor of this \nMedicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization\n\n[[Page S15698]]\n\nAct of 2003. Yet we have before us an attempt to block this body from \nexpressing, through an up-or-down vote, their will to give seniors and \nindividuals with disabilities access to affordable prescription drug \ncoverage and, thus, stand in the way of health care security for those \nseniors.\n  We are about to vote on a cloture motion in an attempt to overcome \nthis filibuster.\n  Later today, we are likely to face additional procedural hurdles that \nthe minority has threatened to prevent passage of this bill. Make no \nmistake, these are not one and the same. The result of this filibuster \nand of the procedural points of order will be once again to deny these \n40 million seniors access to modern prescription drug coverage, \nsomething they need and something they deserve.\n  In my own State of Tennessee, there are nearly one-quarter of a \nmillion seniors who right now have no prescription drug coverage. There \nare millions more all across the Nation for whom this legislation \nliterally means life or death. Think hypertension, heart disease, \nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, or emphysema, all for \nwhich we have effective prescription drugs which are not made available \nthrough our Medicare Program today. Our seniors cannot afford to wait \nlonger. Then why wait? They cannot afford to wait. It is a matter of \ntheir health.\n  This generation of seniors did survive the Depression, did fight \nWorld War II, did help make the United States the prosperous and \nthriving Nation we have today. Again and again, they answered the call. \nNow is the time for us to fulfill our duty to that generation. Many of \nthem are poor and many of them are sick. It is time to answer their \ncall.\n  When he signed Medicare into law in 1965, President Johnson said:\n\n       No longer will this Nation refuse the hand of justice to \n     those who have given a lifetime of service and wisdom and \n     labor to the progress of this . . . country.\n\n  Let us not stay this hand of justice now. Let us not turn our back on \nAmerica's seniors and individuals with disabilities. Our seniors \ndeserve better than to be held hostage to Washington politics.\n  There is a life-or-death issue in many ways in this legislation for \nmillions of Americans and they cannot wait. Opponents of this bill \nwould deny coverage to essential medicines.\n  Mr. President, I will go on leader time for my remaining 2 minutes, \nif necessary.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. What will people tell millions of Americans or millions of \nlow-income seniors if we go home and say, no, you are not going to have \naccess to prescription drugs that this bill would have made available \nor tell individuals with disabilities, no, you are not going to have \naccess to the preventive care that is actually in this bill?\n  The elderly, the sick, and the disabled are now being told to wait \nfor action in the future. Now is the time to act.\n  We will do it next year, some say, but our seniors tell us time is \nrunning out. People are waiting for help.\n  Just 2 days ago in my office was Dorthea Yancy of Lakewood, CO, a \nretired African-American woman who worked for years but lost her \npension when her company went bankrupt. She needs our help now. Dorthea \nYancy needs our help now.\n  We are an eyelash away from fulfilling our promise to seniors. I ask \nmy colleagues not to thwart the overwhelmingly bipartisan majority in \nthis body because of using the tactics of some sort of parliamentary \nmaneuvering. Do not hold America's seniors hostage to Washington \npolitics. Our seniors deserve better.\n  I want to close by just reading a statement issued today by the AARP \non behalf of 35 million seniors that fine organization represents. This \nis from the AARP today, and I will close with this:\n\n       The fate of the landmark Medicare prescription drug bill \n     now stands in the hands of the U.S. Senate. More than a vote \n     is at stake. With the final passage in the Senate, the \n     Congress will honor a longstanding promise to 41 million \n     older and disabled Americans and their families by finally \n     adding a prescription drug benefit to Medicare. This bill \n     will help millions of people, especially those with low \n     incomes and high drug costs. It will strengthen Medicare by \n     adding this long overdue benefit and preserving the basic \n     structure of the Medicare program. We urge the Senate to act \n     to seize this historic opportunity and vote to pass this bill \n     now.\n\n  America's seniors are watching. America is watching. I urge my \ncolleagues to do the right thing, to seize this historic opportunity, \nto vote up or down on this bipartisan legislation, and to pass this \nhistoric bill.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. Under the previous \norder, the cloture motion having been presented under rule XXII, the \nChair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the conference \n     report to accompany H.R. 1, the Medicare Prescription Drug \n     and Modernization Act, an act to amend Title XVIII of the \n     Social Security Act to provide for a voluntary prescription \n     drug benefit under the Medicare Program and to strengthen and \n     improve the Medicare Program, and for other purposes.\n         Bill Frist, Charles Grassley, John E.

On this vote, the yeas are 70, the nays are \n29. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, for purposes of time management under \ncloture, I designate Senator Reid, the Democratic whip, as the \nopposition manager.\n  Mr. President, I make a point of order that H.R. 1, the pending \nconference report, violates section 311(a)(2) and section 302(f) of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, among other reasons, because of the \nprovisions related to premium support and health savings accounts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senators Grassley, \nBaucus, and Breaux, pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget \nAct of 1974, I move to waive the applicable sections of that act and \nthe budget resolution for the consideration of the conference report.\n\n[[Page S15699]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is debatable.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there now be 2 \nhours of debate on the pending motion to waive, with that debate time \nequally divided between the two leaders or their designees; further, I \nask consent that following that debate time, the Senate proceed to a \nvote on the motion to waive, with no amendments in order to the motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we will shortly begin debate for 2 hours, \nas we just agreed to, after which we will have the vote--approximately \n2 hours from now.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, obviously the pending motion is now the \nmatter before the Senate and the clock is ticking. I want to use some \nof the time at this point and reserve the remainder of time for those \nwho wish to speak. I will, hopefully, reserve some time for myself at \nthe end of the debate.\n  I make this motion recognizing there are a lot of concerns involving \nbudgetary considerations on the legislation now pending. Those on the \nother side have expressed their understandable concern about the \noverall commitment in the budget to a new entitlement program, and I \nrespect their position. It may be that on that basis alone, many of our \nRepublican colleagues will want to vote against the motion to waive a \nbudget point of order.\n  They will make the case that this is an entitlement that goes way \nbeyond the $400 billion, that it is very likely this legislation could \ngrow to $600, $800, $900 billion in the very near future, as other \nentitlements have on occasion. That is their right.\n  They will argue that this, as a new entitlement, provides very little \ncost control. On that I would agree, and I will come back to that point \nin a moment. So without a doubt, there are very important budgetary \npoints of order to be made.\n  Technically, this budget point of order challenges the bill because \nit exceeds the 2004 budget authorization. It also challenges the \nallocation of resources within the jurisdiction of the Finance \nCommittee. So those are the technical reasons.\n  I want to give my reasons for expressing the concern I have \nthroughout the debate, and how it relates to this budget point of \norder. I don't challenge the $400 billion. Frankly, I don't think that \nit is adequate to provide a meaningful drug benefit. We have to do \nbetter than that. But that is another issue. What I challenge is why it \nis we are misallocating so many of the resources within that $400 \nbillion budget pie. That is my concern; how it is that we can spend $6 \nbillion on HSAs, health savings accounts, and at the same time tell our \nseniors they are going to have to pay $35 a month, 100 percent of the \ncost for drugs up to $250, 25 percent up to $2,250, 100 percent up to \n$5,100. Why are we going to tell them that when we have all this money \nfor these special interests is something I can't understand.\n  I can't go to my senior citizens and tell them: You are going to have \nto suck it up and understand that sacrifice is something we are going \nto ask of you for the opportunity of the Government to pay 75 percent \nof your drug costs for a limited period of time throughout the year.\n  That is what we are saying. We have money for all these other \naccounts, but we don't have adequate resources dedicated to providing \nmeaningful help to seniors. That is my first concern. We are simply not \nallocating the resources within that $400 billion to their maximum \nadvantage.\n  But there is another concern as well. We all ought to be concerned, \nRepublicans and Democrats, about this. We have taken virtually all the \ncost control mechanisms out of this bill. So those who are concerned \nabout an exploding entitlement have a right to be concerned about what \nthis is going to cost 10 years from now.\n  Ten years ago, we passed a bill by unanimous consent. I wish my \ncolleagues all could have heard an eloquent speech made by the \ndistinguished Senator from Florida about this in our caucus this \nmorning. Ten years ago, on a bipartisan basis, we passed legislation \nproviding not only a drug benefit to veterans but a cost containment \nmechanism for that benefit. We passed it unanimously. When we passed \nit, we basically said, we are going to allow the Government to \nnegotiate the price for the VA, passing on the savings to veterans.\n  We have done that. And by most accounts, we have now cut the cost of \nveterans drugs in half. Senator Graham talked about being at a VA \nhospital in Florida on Veterans Day. He said: How much are you spending \non drugs right now?\n  They said: $39 million, at that facility.\n  He said: If you couldn't negotiate, if you had no ability to \nnegotiate on behalf of your veterans, what do you think the veterans \nwould be spending?\n  They said: $71 million, almost twice as much.\n  How is it we can argue on behalf of veterans that we ought to keep \ntheir costs down but at the very same time, argue that senior citizens \nought to bear the full cost of those drugs? You tell senior citizens \nsitting next to another one at a public meeting a year from now that we \nsomehow just believed there was a distinction, that it was OK for \nseniors to spend twice as much as veterans.\n  I will fight every single day for the right of veterans to get the \nlowest cost for their drugs, but that same opportunity should be \nprovided to every senior citizen as well.\n  So you are going to see an exploding cost. And you are going to see \nthe misallocation of resources within that $400 billion, away from \nseniors and to so many other groups that I have to say even the most \navid supporters of this legislation would say don't need it as much. Do \nhealthy people who have access to an HSA really need help as much as a \nsenior citizen who is struggling to pay their bills?\n  Isn't there a better way that we can allocate these resources to \nmaximize the drug benefit for every citizen in the country today? The \nanswer is, of course, yes. Why is it that we saw the need to exclude \nthe single demonstrated ability on the part of a Federal program today, \nin the Veterans' Administration, to control the cost of drugs when it \ncame to protecting drug prices for senior citizens? Why did we do that?\n  Unfortunately, that wasn't the only cost containment mechanism \nexcluded. For all intents and purposes, we also took out reimportation. \nWe don't have any real authority now to reimport lower cost American-\nmade drugs into this country. I am told the reason we didn't is because \nthe drug companies were overwhelmingly opposed. Keep in mind that a lot \nof these drugs are manufactured inside the United States, exported to \nbe retailed outside the United States. So the irony is that drugs made \ninside the U.S. cannot be sold and brought back into the U.S. under \nthis bill. I think it is a folly.\n  So the bottom line for those who are concerned about the exploding \ncost of an entitlement is this: I have news for you. You have a right \nto be concerned because we have not done anything to control costs in \nthis legislation. We are going to woe the day we passed this without \nproviding the same mechanism VA has to do just that. We are going to \nwoe the day. We are also going to woe the day when we draw distinctions \nbetween seniors for absolutely no good reason. If it is good enough for \nveterans, it ought to be good enough for senior citizens across the \nboard. But the drug companies don't like that either. Because they \ndon't like it, it was excluded. So I make these points of order on four \nvery specific points.\n  No. 1, we are not using that $400 billion we have allocated very \nwell. We could do a whole lot better.\n  No. 2, there are specific programs in here that don't belong in here \nin the first place, have nothing to do with offering drugs to seniors; \nthat are handouts to special interests and have no business in this \nbill.\n\n[[Page S15700]]\n\n  No. 3, we do very little with cost containment. We exclude the most \nconsequential leverage the Government has had in the past with a \nprogram as important as the VA. It passed unanimously on the Senate \nfloor 10 years ago. Why is it excluded now? Because there was special \ninterest opposition.\n  No. 4, we are going to woe the day when we put special interests \nahead of the senior citizens in making these resource allocations in \nthis legislation the way we have.\n  Mr. President, we can do better than this. We have to do better than \nthis. I hope, on a bipartisan basis, we simply say we are going to ask \nthat these provisions, these concerns be renegotiated.\n  I was one--and I will end here--who voted in favor of cloture. I am \nnot desirous of extending debate unnecessarily and in a prolonged way. \nI wanted to make that point by voting for cloture.\n  But I must say, we expedite the day when we do the right thing with \nregard to the costs of drugs and with regard to a new system under \nMedicare. We expedite the day by voting against the motion to waive the \npoint of order made by the distinguished majority leader.\n  So I hope those who claim fiscal responsibility as an important \npriority, those who want to maximize the bang for the buck for seniors \nin this legislation, those who are concerned about the distinctions we \ndraw among senior citizens, will join with those who voted for and \nthose who voted against cloture, against waiving this point of order.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator in charge left \nthe floor and said I could allocate some time to myself. I will not use \nmuch. I note the presence on the floor of the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee. He wants to speak. Clearly, I want to speak for no more than \n7 minutes. I ask that I be advised when I have spoken for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be advised.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Budget and Impoundment Control Act \nwill be 30 years old soon--30 years in existence. Many pundits never \nthought it would survive even 1 year. As a freshman Senator, I worked \nalong with my colleagues to help bring about the act, and then I was \nhonored by this body to serve as chairman for many years.\n  Let me say that the drafters of the Budget Act knew it was a bold and \ndaring piece of legislation, setting up a whole new way of considering \nlegislation in the Congress. As a matter of fact, I am not sure they \neven knew how bold it would be. It, indeed, in many respects, changed \nthe way the Senate does business--some for the better, some not so much \nfor the better.\n  There is one provision that is called reconciliation--a strange \nword--and people wonder what it means. Let me just tell you, without \ntrying to take much time, that our distinguished leader had an \nopportunity to move this bill under what is called a reconciliation \nbill. Do you know what that would have done, Mr. President? That would \nhave limited debate, and it would have made the bill almost not \namendable and, indeed, besides that, there would be no points of order. \nHe chose, as the bill progressed through, to do otherwise.\n  So let me repeat. The drafters recognized the need to provide waivers \nof points of order in this bill. The waivers are just as important as \nthe points of order. They are not there just because points of order \nmight cause so much damage that you need to waive them. They are there \nbecause points of order can be a range of things, and the points of \norder can be waived because the Budget Act says you can waive them, \nunless in fact they are important to fiscal responsibility or, in some \nway, violate the soundness of a Budget Act.\n  So let's be clear. The budget resolution before us, which we adopted \nback in the spring under the leadership of Senator Nickles, authorized \nspending over the next decade of $400 billion for reform of the \nMedicare Program with prescription drugs. Let me repeat. The fiscal \ndimensions are $400 billion. You would think if you are going to make a \npoint of order about this bill being out of line budgetwise, somebody \nwould be here saying it spends more than $400 billion, it breaks the \nbudget, would you not?\n  Most logically, any Senator who says there is a point of order \nagainst this bill would say, well, we didn't think it spent more than \nwas prescribed in the Budget Act. They are right, it didn't.\n  As a matter of fact, using technical rules of evaluation, it spent \nless than allowed. It spent $395 billion. You would almost think it \nshould get an accolade instead of a point of order. It should get a \nbow, a ribbon instead of a point of order. It spent less than the \nBudget Act, and yet a Budget Act point of order is being raised against \nit. Let me explain.\n  I know that members of the committee and the leader himself tried \ntheir very best to keep this bill under $400 billion, and they \nsucceeded. But you had to provide 10 years of estimates, the sum total \nof which could not exceed $400 billion. Are you with me, Mr. President? \nThey had to produce a bill with 10 years of estimates, the sum total of \nwhich did not exceed $400 billion. The sum total of this bill is less \nthan the Budget Committee gave them to spend. So it didn't break the \nbudget.\n  One of the years--1 of the 10 years--they could not make the estimate \nfor that year fit the estimate of the 10 years.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will complete in 2 minutes.\n  The committee could not make this proposal fit in each piece of the \n10 years. In other words, if you look along and keep adding up the \nyears, it is $395 billion. But the committee also made some estimates \nby the year, and one of those years is $4 billion high--got it, $4 \nbillion in an estimating bonanza of $400 billion.\n  First of all, everybody knows they are estimates, the best you can \ndo. I have had to rely upon them and got accused that I shouldn't have \nrelied upon them when I was the budget chairman, but we did. So there \nis one year that is $4 billion off in the estimating of 10 years. But \nevery other year is within, which is truly remarkable, and the sum \ntotal is $395 billion.\n  Mr. President, I say to fellow Senators, the truth is the Budget Act \npoint of order should not be used for a frivolous matter--$4 billion \noff in 1 year with a $400 billion bill. It should not be used to cure \ntechnical matters--$4 billion in a 10-year bill of $400 billion. I am \nsure my friend, the chairman of the Budget Committee, will talk about \nsome of the other technical issues regarding programs. But the biggest \nissue is fiscal soundness.\n  We have from time to time in a Budget Act authorized $300 billion for \na program over 10 years, and I can tell you, many times a committee \ncame back with a bill that was $300 billion, but for each of the 10 \nyears it didn't fit the number.\n  This Senator, as chairman of the Budget Committee, wouldn't have \ndared to get up and say the bill should fail on a point of order \nbecause it violates the budget and, thus, the Budget Act should be used \nto kill it because they had done a great job and had met the total, but \nyou can't, in estimating, make every year hit it right, right on the \nhead.\n  I submit that a point of order should not be used. The leader's \nwaiver of that provision should be sustained because we are using the \nBudget Act to try to kill a Medicare bill that is fiscally as sound as, \nif you are just talking about fiscal soundness, not substance--the \npoints of order are not substance; they have to do with dollars--if you \nare just off 1 year out of 10 but not on the total of 10, you should \nnot invoke the point of order. It should be waived as requested by the \nmajority leader.\n  I thank the Senate for the 7 minutes. I yield the floor.\n  I note the presence of the chairman of the Budget Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator withhold?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on our side, Senator Graham will speak for \n10 minutes, Senator Boxer for 5 minutes, Senator Dodd for 5 minutes, \nand Senator Corzine for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield myself as much time as I might \nconsume.\n\n[[Page S15701]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to vote to waive the budget point of order. I \nthink I am correct--I haven't looked at numbers--I probably voted to \nmake more points of order than almost anybody, maybe with the exception \nof my very good friend, the past chairman of the Budget Committee. I \nhave always tried to maintain the integrity of the budget, but I think \nwhat we have here is a way of people saying: Let's vote for cloture, \nbut maybe we can kill this bill indirectly; we will do it with a budget \npoint of order and not to save money.\n  I wish the people were really concerned about the fiscal integrity of \nMedicare, but I don't think that is what is behind the proponents of \nthese budget points of order.\n  As a matter of fact, in looking at past records, Senator Daschle, who \nmade the budget point of order, has moved to waive a budget point of \norder 56 out of 60 times. Senator Kennedy has moved to waive a budget \npoint of order 54 out of 57 times that he voted. In other words, some \n97 percent of the time they always moved to waive the budget rules. I \nhave always been on the opposite side. I am going to be on the opposite \nside of them this time because, frankly, I think they are just trying \nto kill the bill so the bill will come back later with more costs and \nbe a lot more irresponsible.\n  If my memory serves me correctly, when we debated the budget this \nyear on the floor of the Senate, there was an amendment to increase the \n$400 billion authorization or the reserve fund we put in the budget for \nprescription drugs and to improve Medicare. I believe Senator Kennedy \nand Senator Daschle supported an amendment to increase that figure to \n$600 billion. They were not successful.\n  My point is I think their effort today is not because they are \nconcerned about this bill costing too much money. I think they are \ntrying to figure out a way to bring this bill down so it can come back \nand cost more money. I just mention that.\n  What about the point of order? The budget said we would have up to \n$400 billion to spend for improving and strengthening Medicare, \nincluding providing prescription drugs. The bill that was reported out, \naccording to CBO, meets that target. It scores at $395 billion. I \nhappen to think it is going to cost more than that, but it is compliant \nwith the rules set by the Budget Committee on its total spending and \nscored by the Congressional Budget Office.\n  There is a violation or budget point of order in 2004. What do I mean \nby that? It scores $3 billion more in 2004. What that relates to is \nwhen we pass a budget, we allocate so much money to each committee each \nyear, and the Finance Committee has already spent all of its money. It \nspent all of its money because we passed unemployment compensation--a \ntotal of $4.7 billion in unemployment compensation in 2004 not assumed \nin the Budget Resolution. We spent an additional $10 billion in aid to \nthe States that was not assumed in the budget resolution. There are \nsome other things that we didn't do, so the Finance Committee is out of \ncompliance now by about $3 billion with this bill.\n  What does this bill do in 2004 that costs money? The prescription \ndrug proposal doesn't really get started in 2004 with the exception of \nthe prescription discount drug card. The card, which offers all seniors \na 15-, 20- or 25-percent of immediate savings in January of 2004 and \nprovides a $600 benefit for low-income seniors. Seniors who have \nincomes less than 135 percent of poverty will get a card. I believe \nthat card will be authorized in January of 2004 for $600. The \nbeneficiary would have to make a copayment of 10 percent. So that costs \nmoney in 2004. I don't hear the opponents seeking to delay immediate \nrelief for seniors and low-income seniors.\n  Further, there are other items that cost money in 2004. Providers \nreceive assistance. Providers, who do I mean? I mean doctors, \nhospitals, rural hospitals--provisions that are supported very strongly \nby Members of both parties--rural add-ons, and so on. That is the bulk \nof this money, $3.8 billion. So if people don't want to spend that \nmoney, that is of interest, but my guess is that is not really the \ncase.\n  My guess is people want to spend the money for rural health care \nareas.\n  I then heard the Democratic leader indicate his concern was also on \nthe revenue side of the budget. There is a point of order because of \nhealth savings accounts. That is a $160 million revenue loss in 2004.\n  I understand some people do not like that particular provision of the \nbill. I happen to think it is a very good provision of the bill. If the \nsupporters of this point of order prevail then the entire Medicare bill \nis going to be pulled down. Am I right to assume that their goal is to \nensure that there will be no prescription drug coverage for low-income \nseniors because of that provision? I do not think so.\n  Now folks are stating that the bill has no cost containment. Well, I \nbelieve we have very different meanings of those words. The proponents \nof the point of order consider government price controls to be \neffective cost containment tools. I do not agree. I do agree that the \nlegislation lacks real cost containment--I heard Senator Daschle say we \ndid not have cost containment. This Senator worked very hard to get \nreal cost containment. I wanted to put cost containment in that would \nrequire a supermajority vote to worsen Medicare's financial condition. \nIf any future Congress had legislation before the body which would make \nthe fiscal problems of Medicare, which are already significant, worse, \nthere would be a vote, a 60-vote point of order. I was not successful \nin convincing our colleagues to include that fiscal restraint.\n  In fact, my primary opponent in creating real cost containment was \nSenator Baucus. He kept saying: I cannot pass that in my caucus. That \nwill never pass. That is a nonstarter. You cannot get a supermajority \non this entitlement. You will be curbing the growth of this \nentitlement. That is not done for other entitlements. I heard it over \nand over. We debated it for a long time. Well, the facts are that it is \ndone for other entitlements. We have this rule in place today for \nSocial Security. Social Security's entitlement status has never been in \nquestion as a result of a supermajority requirement.\n  I was not successful in getting stronger cost containment than what \nwe have in this bill. I regret that. I wish that we would. I would be \nhappy to pursue that in subsequent budget resolutions with the Democrat \nleader, but we were not successful in getting it in this package. I \nthink the proponents of this point of order are not serious in their \neffort to control costs. In fact I am puzzled as to why the proponents \nof this point of order voted for cloture. Instead of opposing cloture \nthey are trying to get around it the other way and say, we will just \nuse a 60-vote budget point of order.\n  Seriously, I do not think their efforts are about budgets. I think it \nis a way to try and kill this bill. I may not support final passage of \nthe bill because I am concerned about the total cost of the bill. But I \ndo not think it should be because we are spending some money for rural \nhospitals or for doctors. I think doctors are getting like $600 million \nin 2004; rural hospitals and other providers are receiving money in \n2004; and health savings accounts reduce revenues by $160 million in \n2004.\n  The real reason the Finance Committee has exceeded its allocation in \n2004 is because we spent $4.3 billion for unemployment compensation and \nbecause we spent $10 billion for aid to the States in 2004, neither of \nwhich were in the original budget resolution.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will yield time in just a moment to my colleagues. \nFirst, I will respond briefly to a point made by the distinguished \nSenator from New Mexico, Mr. Domenici. I am sorry he is not on the \nSenate floor. I wanted to respond to a comment he made. He said this \nwas a frivolous point of order.\n  I remind my colleagues, this is precisely the point of order made by \nSenator Grassley and Senator Frist on two different motions last year. \nSo I argue if it was appropriate last year, it would be appropriate \nthis year. If it is frivolous this year, it would have been frivolous \nlast year. Yet the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, and I might \nadd, of course, my friend the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma, both \nvoted in favor of the points of order last year when that precise point \nof order was made.\n\n[[Page S15702]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the rollcall involving both points of \norder be printed in the Record at this time.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         U.S. Senate Rollcall Votes 107th Congress--2nd Session\n\n       As compiled through Senate LIS by the Senate Bill Clerk \n     under the direction of the Secretary of the Senate\n\n\n                              vote summary\n\n       Question: On the Motion (Motion to Waive CBA re: Graham \n     Amdt.

Nay\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nFlorida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, given my expanded amount of \ntime, I would like to talk about two aspects of this. In 2001, first \nwith Senators Zell Miller and Ted Kennedy, and then with Senator Gordon \nSmith, I offered variations of a prescription drug bill to this Senate. \nIn the case of the first legislation, there was, in fact, a point of \norder, precisely the one that is now before the Senate, offered against \nboth of those provisions.\n  In the first instance, the vote to waive the point of order was 52, \nso the bill had a majority of the Members of the Senate prepared to \nsupport it, which would have meant we would not be having this debate \ntoday because senior citizens and disabled Americans would be going to \nthe drugstore and getting their prescription drugs today.\n  The second bill which Senator Smith and I offered was very similar in \nstructure to the one that is in this current legislation; I would say \nsomewhat better and more public spirited but similar.\n  On that bill, there were 50 votes exactly not to waive the point of \norder. So this is not a unique, unusual, or inappropriate motion to \nmake. It was made twice in 2001. In the one case, it denied passage of \nlegislation. In the other case, on virtually the same bill we have \nbefore us today, it denied us the opportunity because we could not get \nthe 60 votes in order to override the point of order.\n  What I really want to talk about, however, is the last point that my \nfriend and fellow-departing Member of the Senate, Mr. Nickles, just \nsaid, and that was about the issue of cost containment. Senator Nickles \nhas a definition of cost containment. That definition is that we will \nimpose limits on the amount of funds which can be spent on the Medicare \nProgram, the most prominently suggested approach being to say that if \nmore than 45 percent of the nontrust fund monies of the Federal \nGovernment are going to be spent on Medicare, then there will be a \ncomplex Rube Goldberg of votes and countervotes to determine if that \ncan occur.\n  If those limits are imposed, then the only way that 45-percent excess \ncan be replaced are through things which are clearly going to be very \nonerous upon the Medicare beneficiaries, such as increasing the payroll \ntax or increasing the amount of premiums that seniors would pay.\n  The idea that we might go to general revenue as the means of meeting \nthat excess is not allowable. It has to come out of the Medicare \nProgram itself.\n  I have a different definition of what a cost control ought to be, and \nit is not a bureaucratic maze. It is a very straightforward, \ncapitalist, free enterprise, marketplace approach. It also is not a new \nidea. In the early 1990s, this Senate passed legislation which \nauthorized the administrator of the Veterans' Administration to \nnegotiate with pharmaceutical companies on behalf of the VA. That bill \nwas sponsored by Senator Alan Simpson, retired Republican from Wyoming; \nSenator and now-Governor Frank Murkowski of Alaska; retired Senator \nAlan Cranston from California, and our colleague today, Senator Jay \nRockefeller. Those were the four sponsors.\n  When the bill came before the Senate, there was not a request for a \nrecorded vote. It passed unanimously. So that does not sound like it \nwas a very radical bill, given who its sponsors were, or that it raised \nany great cries in the Senate.\n  What has happened over the intervening decade plus since this \nlegislation was passed? Well, here is a chart that shows some of the \ncommon prescriptions which are now being purchased by the VA under this \nlegislation. Let us take one which I happen to know well because I take \nit myself, and that is Zocor. It was designed to control high \ncholesterol.\n  On Veterans' Day of this year, I spent the day at the VA hospital in \nMiami. A lot of the day was spent in the pharmaceutical dispensing \narea. I asked the question: What are you paying for Zocor? Well, the \nanswer was 66 cents a tablet. I then asked what would it be if they \nwent to the drugstore and bought the same identical tablet. It was \n$3.77.\n  I said: Is that illustrative of the kind of discounts you are able to \nnegotiate? The answer was: No, it frankly is a little bit deeper than \naverage. We, this year, will dispense about $39 million of prescription \ndrugs through the Miami VA. I asked: If you went down to the drugstore \nand bought it at the same price that, for instance, seniors under \nMedicare would pay, what would it cost? It was $81 million. So there is \nmore than a 50 percent discount--in some cases much more dramatic \ndiscounts.\n  The question that I think we should anticipate, so we had better \nready with an answer, is the question: Why, in light of the success of \nthe VA in providing for its 27 million eligibles--why do we have this \nin this legislation, under the clause ``noninterference?''\n  I might correct a statement I made yesterday when I said it was on \npage 54. In the final version of the printed conference report it is \nmoved to page 53, lines 18 through 26. Here is what those lines say:\n\n       Noninterference. In order to promote competition under this \n     part and in carrying out this part, the Secretary--[who was \n     in the Chamber just a few moments ago]--(1) may not interfere \n     with the negotiations between drug manufacturers and \n     pharmacies and PDP--[which is the drug-only insurance policy] \n     sponsors; and (2) may not require a particular formulary or \n     institute a price structure for the reimbursement of covered \n     part D drugs.\n\n  What all that legalese means is that we are about to prohibit the \nSecretary of HHS from using the tremendous bargaining power which \nMedicare has, similar to the Veterans Administration, to accomplish for \nMedicare beneficiaries the same cost control that we are now achieving \nin the Veterans Administration.\n  Some people say: Why are we doing this? What is the reason we would \nhave such diametrically different policies for two very similar groups \nof Americans?\n  One answer was: Well, veterans, they are a special class. There are \nnot as many veterans; therefore, they will not have the impact.\n  I agree, veterans are a special group of Americans. They deserve to \nbe honored. But so are the other members of the greatest generation. So \nare the wives who stayed home with the children while their husbands \nwere fighting abroad.\n  The fact is, there are 27 million veterans eligible to get these \nreduced costs. When we pass this Medicare bill, until such time--and I \nam afraid it will not be very long--that we see a mass retreat of \nprivate pre-employers--that is the persons, the businesses that used to \nemploy the current retirees--start to drop coverage--until that \nhappens, there will be about 10 million to 12 million of the 40 million \nMedicare beneficiaries who are likely to take most advantage of this \nprescription drug benefit.\n  You can't tell me if 27 million veterans can take advantage of this \nprogram, and they have not brought the\n\n[[Page S15704]]\n\npharmaceutical industry to its knees, that 10 to 12 million Medicare \nbeneficiaries are going to cause that to occur.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). The Senator has \nused 10 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. I ask for an additional 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object--of course, I will not \nobject--I would like to be the next Democrat on the list to speak \nbecause Senator Daschle had committed that to me but he is not in the \nChamber at this time. I ask unanimous consent that I be the next \nDemocrat to speak, up to 7 minutes, after Senator Graham, and of course \nyielding to the other side.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. There is a question more serious than the \nquestion I just asked, and that is, How do we answer the question? This \nis Ms. Kitterage. She is 75 years old. She lives in Tamarac, FL. She \nhas about $4,900 a year expenses over a range of prescription drugs. \nThat is her annual expense. Here you see some of the vials of her \nprescription drugs.\n  This is not the case--at least I don't know it to be the case--but \nlet's assume that Ms. Kitterage either is married or is a widow and \nthat her husband was about her age, which would have meant that he \nwould quite possibly have been one of our brave soldiers in the Korean \nwar. As such, he would be eligible, as one of the veterans, to get the \nVA discounts. She is not eligible today. Because of this provision we \nare proposing to put into law, she will not be eligible in the future \nto get the benefit of Medicare's tremendous purchasing power.\n  I want to just leave this question. When we stand up before an \naudience of elderly Americans and Ms. Kitterage comes and asks this \nquestion: My husband is the same age I am; why is he able to buy \nprescription drugs at half the price that I have to pay because he can \ndo it at the VA, that is the question we are going to be required to \nanswer. I would like to offer that to my colleagues for a response. \nWould somebody please tell me what is the public policy that justifies \nutilizing the purchasing power of the VA to get these kinds of \ndiscounts?\n  Yet to the wives of the veterans we say: You have to pay the full \namount. I can't find a justifiable reason for that.\n  I am a capitalist. I am a free enterpriser. I am a marketplace \nperson. I don't believe in socialism. Why should we bring the \nmarketplace to the veterans but bring the red flag of socialism to \nMedicare? I hope, during the course of this debate, we can engage on \nthis issue because I think it is maybe the most central issue. If we \ndid this one thing, if we eliminated this specific paragraph and wrote \nin the language that we did over 10 years ago for the VA, we would be \ndoing the seniors of America a greater benefit than anything we are \nconsidering and we would be saving the American taxpayers an enormous \namount of money, therefore avoiding further additions to our national \ndebt.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his additional time.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I leave that question with you \nand hope during the course of this debate we will be engaged in \nanswering.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, first of all, I should find out how much \ntime we have left.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. You have 43 minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield myself such time as I might consume.\n  This may sound like a simple vote, to raise a point of order about a \nbudget and how this fits into the budget. But what this vote is all \nabout is whether or not we are going to have any bill whatsoever \nproviding prescription drugs for seniors. That is what this next vote \nis all about because I believe if we get 60 votes like we did 70 votes \non the cloture motion, we will be on our way to passage, in a \nbipartisan way--everything has been bipartisan on this bill, as far as \nI am concerned--in a bipartisan way, passage of this bill, so our \nseniors can have prescription drugs, so that the biggest hole that has \never existed in Medicare for the last 38 years is filled in.\n  So all the arguments can be made about this little budget deal or \nthat little budget technicality, but this is a vote about keeping the \npromises of both political parties over the last three elections. I do \nnot think we ought to pooh-pooh keeping the promises of the last \nelection. People are cynical about political leaders anyway--\noverpromising, not delivering on promises. This is our opportunity. \nThis is one of the last two votes for this bill to go to the President \nof the United States.\n  So this vote is about our seniors, and also we can include Americans \nwith disabilities. So a successful vote against overriding this point \nof order will gut the immediate funding we provide for prescription \ndrug discount cards.\n  Much has been said by the opponents of this bill about not providing \nhelp to seniors fast enough. How many times, in the last 3 days, 4 days \nof debate on this bill have you heard the point: ``Well, this bill is \nnot going to take effect for 2 years. I don't know why it can't take \neffect sooner''?\n  Now, that is not our choice. We pass a bill. You have to give some \ntime for bureaucrats to implement it and write the regulations, and you \nwant to do it right. So that is what they say: They need that amount of \ntime, No. 1. No. 2, this bill takes effect immediately for part of it, \nand that part is the drug discount card for seniors and the disabled so \nthey can get 15 to 25 percent discounts on drugs right away.\n  So apparently a discount card available to all seniors in less than 5 \nmonths, and also with a direct $600 subsidy to those with the lowest \nincomes, is something that opponents of this bill--crying in their beer \nall the time about this not doing enough for seniors or not taking \neffect soon enough--is a reason to block this bill.\n  They are talking out of both sides of their mouth when they say that. \nOn the one hand, they say it is not going into effect soon enough, and \nthen with the next vote we are going to have up, they are going to \nguarantee no drug benefit for years, and just with some little budget \ntechnicality on a procedure vote.\n  That is pretty ironic, that they would take that stand over the \ncourse of 4 days--argue that this bill is not going into effect soon \nenough, ignoring the discount card that starts immediately, and saying \nwe are not doing enough--and then they are willing to block it on a \ntechnicality.\n  It seems to me that anybody who says we are not providing drug \nbenefits quickly enough for our seniors and our disabled would vote to \noverride this point of order so we can get to the next vote, final \npassage of this legislation.\n  Also, I just heard some of my colleagues from the other side of the \naisle say this bill, in some instances, does not do enough for rural \nhealth care delivery. We provide $25 billion in this bill for rural \nproviders to deal with the inequitable situation of the 30 States below \nthe national average. That is because the formulas for doctors and \nhospitals in rural areas treat them less well, less equitably than the \nformulas for urban areas, because the assumption is in rural areas you \ncan deliver health care for less costs.\n  But they are crying in their beer about maybe that is not doing well \nenough. And if they vote as 1 of the 41 who might keep us from \noverriding that point of order, then how can they talk out of both \nsides of their mouth--one time saying, ``We are not doing enough,'' and \nthen, on the other hand, ``Kill this bill on this budget \ntechnicality''? Because just as soon as this bill passes, rural \nproviders are going to get a great deal of help from this legislation.\n\n  Now, that help is not just for our providers because we feel sorry \nfor doctors or hospitals. We are not being able to recruit doctors and \nmaintain our hospitals in rural America. This $25 billion in this bill \nwill strengthen our hospitals. It will give us an opportunity to \nrecruit doctors.\n  So if you are 1 of the 41 who does not help us override this point of \norder, you are saying no to the recruitment of doctors in rural \nAmerica. You are saying it is OK to close rural hospitals. Because you \nknow what is going to happen right away if we do not pass this \nlegislation--all the doctors of America are going to take a 4.5-percent \ncut in their reimbursement because of the way our formulas work. I do \nnot\n\n[[Page S15705]]\n\nknow how formulas such as that were written, but those formulas have an \negregious impact upon the doctors.\n  I strongly disagree that that ought to happen and that we ought to \nhave situations where medical doctors are fed up with working with \nMedicare patients and they just get out of the program. Then our \nseniors have fewer doctors to take care of their needs.\n  But if this bill passes, it is going to give relief to our doctors, \nnot only stopping that 4.5-percent cut, it will give them a 1.5-percent \nincrease in reimbursement.\n  It seems to me a vote against overriding the point of order is a vote \nagainst our rural hospitals every day because every day our hospitals \nare doing more with less. They serve our elderly. They serve the \nuninsured, those who live in some of the remotest parts of our country, \nand those who live in our cities as well because city hospitals have \nproblems, too.\n  Are we going to tell those hospitals what they do every day in saving \nlives and improving patients' quality of life is not somehow important? \nI certainly hope not. But a vote against overriding this point of order \nis a thumb in the eyes of health care providers, in the eyes of the \npeople who run our hospitals, the nurses who work there.\n  So this is going to be a vote against some of our neediest seniors. \nAnd the neediest of our seniors are those in nursing facilities who \nneed physical therapy. They need occupational therapy, speech therapy. \nThis bill, out of this $25 billion, provides a 2-year moratorium from \nthe therapy cap that is in law today, which, basically, at $1,500 is \nsaying, if you have a stroke, if you have some sort of major operation, \nyou are only going to get physical therapy up to $1,500; and too bad \nafter that.\n  Well, we take care of that in this legislation. But the people who \nvote against overriding this point of order are saying no to those \nneediest of seniors in the nursing homes who will be hit by this $1,500 \ncap and will not be able to get the physical therapy services they \nneed.\n  We are at a point where all this effort about rural hospitals has \nbeen supported by an overwhelming majority in both the House and the \nSenate.\n  We heard our colleague, Senator Bennett of Utah, speak passionately \nabout his daughter. His daughter is a speech therapist and knows all \ntoo well how nursing home residents benefit from therapies after they \nhave suffered a stroke, heart attack, or maybe just a fall. Are we \ngoing to say to Senator Bennett's daughter that we don't need to delay \nthese caps? Are we going to say to our seniors that access to physical \ntherapy doesn't matter? I certainly hope not.\n  You will hear a lot about this vote being a comment on how we spend \nmoney in this Medicare bill. You will hear how this vote might be a \nvote against special interests in America. I ask my colleagues what \nthey mean because if their seniors need immediate relief from high \nprescription drug bills, their hometown doctors need some help, their \nlocal hospitals need some help, their seniors recovering from stroke \nand heart attack need some help because they need more therapy, then I \nguess they should vote against these people.\n  That isn't what I hear from the other side of the aisle. They are the \ngreat humanitarians of the American political environment. They are \nconcerned about all these people. Well, this next vote will show how \nconcerned they are because they are voting against all these people who \nhave need, most often the seniors of America who need prescription \ndrugs.\n  I do not intend to vote against them and, in the process, hopefully \nget this bill to final passage.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from California has already been \nrecognized to speak for 5 minutes. Following the Senator from \nCalifornia, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Dodd be recognized, \nand following that, Senator Corzine be recognized for 5 minutes, and \nfollowing that Senator Durbin for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the understanding of the Chair that \nSenator Boxer was going to be recognized for 7 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, let me tell you where we are because \npeople watching this debate may be confused on what has happened. On \nour side we have made a point of order against this bill because it \nbusts the budget. Know where does it bust the budget? Does it bust the \nbudget by giving a more generous prescription drug plan to our seniors? \nNo. It busts the budget by giving away billions of dollars to the HMOs. \nIt also busts the budget because it allows a big deduction from the \nwealthiest and healthiest people to set up what they call HSAs, health \nservice accounts, and to be able to deduct that money. What that does \nis, it raises the premiums for everybody else, taking those people out \nof the insurance pool.\n  So make no mistake about it, when the Senator from Iowa says we are \nterrible on our side because we don't want to spend more money, we are \nwilling to spend the funds on the senior citizens' prescription drug \nbenefit. We are not willing to throw it away on HMOs and on the tax \nbreaks for the wealthiest people who are already doing just fine, thank \nyou very much.\n  Having said that, there is a real benefit to ensuring that this bill \nstops in its tracks by supporting this point of order. In order to do \nthat, we have to vote no on the motion to waive it. So if we prevail, \nif the other side does not get 60 votes, this bill will go back and get \nstarted again. It will come back to us with a better prescription drug \nplan. It will come back to us with less confusion, less bureaucracy and \nthe rest.\n  The underlying bill hurts seniors; 6 million of them will pay more \nfor prescriptions than they do today. There is a cruel asset test in \nhere where you may have to sell off your wedding band to get help. You \nmay have to sell off your car if it is worth more than $4,500 to get \nhelp with prescription drugs. And it seems to me selling off family \nheirlooms is not something we want to do to our seniors.\n  In many of our States that have big metropolitan areas--and I see the \nSenators from Connecticut, Illinois, and New Jersey, I am from \nCalifornia--our seniors will be forced into demonstration projects. \nThat means they will either have been forced into an HMO to get a \nbetter break on their monthly premium or have to pay more to stay in \ntraditional Medicare where they have the choice of a doctor.\n  It increases Medicare premiums for middle and upper class people. \nSome people may say that is a great thing. Let me tell you a couple of \nbad things about that. Again, what will happen is, these people may \nwell leave Medicare, which means the pool shrinks and the premiums go \nup for everybody else. The other problem is, these premiums are not \nindexed. If this had been in place in 1980, I think we figured it would \nbe people with $33,000 a year who would have to pay higher premiums. We \nknow that is a low number.\n  There will be confusion and fear. I will talk about that. And there \nwill be large benefit shutdowns which are daunting and penalize \ninnocent seniors.\n  I say to the occupant of the Chair, something maybe he has not yet \nfound in this bill because, look at the size of this thing. This is the \nsize of it. It is hard to lift it. If you look at this, hidden in there \nit says the Secretary of HHS can demand from the IRS your tax return or \nmine or any of our constituents to just make sure they are not cheating \non a lot of the rules that go along with this.\n  In California, the minute this bill goes into effect, I have a lot of \nproblems: 867,000 sick low-income seniors will have worse coverage; \n250,000 retirees will lose their more generous prescription drug \ncoverage; 296,000 fewer low-income seniors will qualify for low-income \nprotections than under the Senate bill that I was pleased to vote for; \n230,000 Medicare beneficiaries will pay higher Part B premiums; and 1.4 \nmillion seniors will be forced or could well be forced into one of \nthose demonstration projects with HMOs.\n  I don't have a lot of time left so I want to leave you with this \nchart that I made up, sort of wrote it myself. A lot of it is in my own \nhand. I have to tell you, I used this chart on Saturday. My phones have \nbeen ringing off the hook. This is what the senior citizens now have to \nunderstand.\n\n[[Page S15706]]\n\n  I would urge my colleagues to look at every expression on this chart \nand you tell me if you understand what these things are: Transitional \nassistance, there is one thing seniors better learn because they are \ntransitioning into something different; MSAs, medical savings accounts; \nrisk adjustment, you are going to hear about that; benefit shutdown, \nthat is when you know longer have any benefit, and Senator Daschle was \nso eloquent on that point.\n  If you have $5,000 worth of prescriptions, you are going to have to \npay $4,000 toward that $5,000. You can get a better deal with a \ndiscount card. If I was a local pharmacist, I would just say: Come on \nin, Medicare patients. I will give you a discount. Don't bother filling \nout all the forms that will be necessary with this so-called great \nbenefit that the other side says they have given. There is a huge \nbenefit shutdown.\n  Coverage gap is another expression to explain. There are copayments, \nrisk corridors. You all know what HMOs are. You better know it well \nbecause there are going to be a lot more of them. There is MA-PD plans, \nplan retention funding; MA regions; donut holes--and you can't eat \nthose donut holes; those are gaps in coverage--premiums, you all know \nwhat that means.\n  Let me tell you, it is going to be confusing. You won't know what \ngroup you fall in and what your premium is. Income related, HSAs, \nwraparounds, national bonus payments, stabilization funds--that is a \nnice name for the slush funds that are going to the HMOs, and one \nreason that budget point of order ought to be sustained--Medicare \nadvantage competition, annual out-of-pocket threshold. Seniors, you \nbetter learn what that is. You are going to have to keep notes on every \nlittle penny you spend.\n\n  By the way, if you happen to be on a prescription drug that is not in \nthe Medicare formulary, but it was in your Medicaid formulary--I don't \neven have the time to go through all this.\n  One of my favorites is ``clawback.'' Half of my colleagues probably \ndon't know what that means. States are prohibited from helping their \nseniors who are very poor pay their copayments. The States are \nprohibited and they must pay back the Federal Government. So seniors, \npick up the phone, call your Senator. Tell them to bring this bill back \nto the drawing board. It is a huge bill. Only a tiny portion of it is a \nprescription drug benefit.\n  Mr. President, let's get rid of this turkey in time for Thanksgiving.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from California. \nBring that chart down here. Talk about alphabet soup, this is very \ninstructive, it seems to me, in terms of why people are so confused \nabout what is in this bill. There is incredible language here that even \nthe most determined person to learn about this bill would be hard \npressed. There it is.\n  I thank the Senator from California because she has laid out here a \nlexicon of language which would glaze over the eyes of the most \ndetermined people to try to sort out what this bill means.\n  One of the points the Senator made is worth noting again. This is not \nthe end of a Congress. This is only the end of a session. If we were at \nthe end of a Congress, I presume the argument made that we have no \nother choice, we can either do it now or it doesn't get done would be \nvalid. Each new Congress has to begin all over. But we can actually \ncome right back, pick up where we left off, and try to work this \nlegislation out to serve a better interest.\n  I thank her for this. Some of this really needs further explanation. \nLet me say this--and I am being repetitive to some degree--the \nprescription drug piece of this is of concern to me. I was willing to \naccept the argument that having a prescription drug benefit of $400 \nbillion over the next 10 years, while not perfect, was a start. If that \nis all we were voting on today, I would probably vote for it. What is \nnot being discussed at any great length is the second half of the bill, \nwhich is very confusing to people because it has language in it that is \nunclear as to what the ramifications mean.\n  So people need to pay attention and understand that if we are just \ndealing with the second half of the bill, the Medicare-exclusive parts \nof Medicare, I think there would be a very different reaction in the \nChamber to what we are proposing. I suspect the prescription drug \nbenefit piece would pass overwhelmingly, and I suspect that a free-\nstanding Medicare piece might not get 15 votes, when you consider what \nis being proposed.\n  You are absolutely prohibited, under this bill, from joining to go \nout and buy prescription drugs collectively. You are banned under this \nlegislation. Under this legislation, of course, you are going to give a \nsignificant advantage in the competition because of the $12 billion \nsubsidy. That is the reason the order holds here. This piece of \nlegislation has a significant subsidy coming up to the private piece of \nthis proposal. Nothing like that is being offered anywhere else.\n  In fact, a similar point of order was raised in July of last year--at \nthe end of July of 2002--making the exact same point of order that has \nbeen made on this legislation. That point of order was raised by the \nmajority leader and the chairman of the Finance Committee against the \npiece of legislation offered by Senators Graham, Miller, and Kennedy. \nThere, the point of order was against section 302(f) of the Budget Act \nbecause it broke the budget ceilings.\n  That is what is being offered here for exactly the same reasons. It \nwill be curious to see whether or not the people who felt so strongly \nabout not waiving the Budget Act back then will do the same here.\n  This legislation being proposed, obviously, also makes it extremely \ndifficult for people, down the road, to be able to have a prescription \nbenefit plan that is going to be fair and balanced. I take note that \nnone of these provisions, by the way, will go into effect rather \nimmediately. You can impose many of the things we are talking about \nhere in a matter of days if you are truly interested. Yet they are \ndelaying it until 2006, until after the 2004 elections when, obviously, \nwhat happens to beneficiaries under the so-called fair competition--\nMedicare, remember, was a program designed to take the wealthy and \nhealthy and the poorer and sicker together, not to discriminate, and to \nprovide for both of these constituencies. Over the years, that is why \nthe program has been so successful. What is going to happen, of course, \nwith this unfair competition of a 9-percent differential and a $12 \nbillion subsidy is that those who are wealthier and healthier will spin \noff out of Medicare, and only the poor and the sicker will be left in \nthe program; thus, raising the premium costs or reducing benefits. That \nis what is going to happen here. There is no doubt in my mind about \nwhere we are headed with this proposal. We have raised this point of \norder to suggest that there is a better way of crafting this \nlegislation. We urge our colleagues to support the point of order when \nthe vote occurs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume. Will the Chair please notify me when I have used 10 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I find this to be a little bit of a \nsurreal experience, being here on the Senate floor and listening to all \nof the problems in this legislation, all about how it doesn't provide \nenough benefits and how we need to spend more money, and what is being \noffered is the budget point of order by the very people who want to \nspend more than what this bill does.\n  Someone is saying we are spending too much money--I think $4 billion \nor $5 billion--in 2004. We are not even spending the $400 billion \nallotted. It is a $395 billion bill. We are within the budget window \nover 10 years and also over 5 years. But in the first year we are not \nin the budget window. Why? Let's figure it out. If you are in for 5 and \n10, what is the problem for the first year? The problem the first year \nis that the budget sets up a category for mandatory spending, and \nincluded in that was the money for Medicare.\n  Now, is the money that we have in this bill exceeding the money that \nwe anticipated in the budget for Medicare? No. Well, wait a minute. If \nthe money that we have in this bill doesn't exceed\n\n[[Page S15707]]\n\nwhat we had budgeted for Medicare, then why is it subject to a budget \npoint of order? Well, because the money that we had budgeted for \nMedicare was eaten up by two Democrat initiatives that have swallowed \nup that money--unemployment extension, and FMAP, money to the States \nfor their medical program. Because of those two expenditures--which I \nagree was done in a bipartisan way, and I tip my hat to the other side; \nit was clearly motivated by the other side of the aisle to spend this \nadditional money--we have now blown through what we were going to spend \non Medicare. Guess what. There is no money left in fiscal year 2004 for \nMedicare--any kind of spending in this bill.\n  So if we would have done anything in this year to spend money on \nMedicare, we would have exceeded the budget caps. So we have this thing \ntantamount to a gimmick, if you will, where we have exceeded the budget \nbecause of other spending having nothing to do with Medicare, and that \nleaves us liable to a budget point of order.\n  Now, I understand if you want to kill the bill--and I understand you \ndo want to kill the bill--we had a vote on cloture. We had 70 votes, \nand it would have been 71 had Senator Shelby been here and his plane \nwas able to get off the ground. But we had 70 votes not to block it on \na procedural vote, to give the people of this country, through the \nSenate, an opportunity for an up-or-down vote as to whether this \nproposal is worthy. Seventy Members voted today that we were not going \nto use a procedural filibuster.\n\n  What is the next step? The next step is to use another procedural \ngimmick. In this case, as the Senator from New Mexico has pointed out, \nit truly is a gimmick because we are within what was contemplated when \nwe passed the budget earlier this year for Medicare next year, but we \nhave a technical problem because of other spending that has nothing to \ndo with Medicare.\n  I say to my colleagues who are going to be casting their votes \nmomentarily on this issue: If you want to block this vote procedurally, \nyou had your chance. It was a vote on cloture. We are now postcloture. \nTo put up another procedural gimmick--and this is truly a gimmick--\nbeing offered by someone who for 57 out of the last 60 waivers of the \nBudget Act voted to waive the Budget Act and the 3 times they did not, \nthey were not here to vote as a way to obstruct the Medicare bill at \nthe 11th hour and the 59th minute, when they had voted for every single \nwaiver that was available to be voted on, to use this to try to block \nthis bill I think does not comport with the original vote which was not \nto filibuster this bill.\n  This is tantamount to another filibuster only it doesn't have the \nword attached to it. Maybe you can go back home and say: We didn't \nfilibuster this bill; I voted to allow this bill to be considered. But, \nyou know, there was this budget problem. Now by the way, I have never \nseen a budget problem that I didn't have a problem with waiving. I have \nwaived it 57 times or 60 times this year on things a heck of a lot less \nimportant than prescription drugs for Medicare, and we routinely did \nit, but when it comes to Medicare, when it comes to $3 billion or $4 \nbillion or $5 billion out of a $400 billion bill in the first year, \nbecause of a problem having nothing to do with Medicare, then I am \ngoing to find a problem, then I am going to be concerned about the \nbudget when I voted to waive the Budget Act 60 times prior to that.\n  That dog doesn't hunt. That is just a procedural obstruction. I hope \nmy colleagues who voted for the cloture motion will vote consistently. \nThis is another vote on cloture. That is what this is. This is a \nprocedural hurdle that has no substance or basis to it.\n  When the people who offer this procedural motion, concerned about the \nimpact on the budget, and in all of their speeches talk about how much \nmore money we should be spending, one wonders how sincere the budget \nconcerns really are. Every person who has gotten up to support this \nbudget point of order has said this bill falls short because it doesn't \nspend enough. Yet they are making a point of order on the budget which \nsays we are spending too much.\n  This is the kind of shenanigans that goes on in the Senate, that goes \non in Washington, DC, that the public, frankly, just doesn't \nunderstand. You are either for this bill or against this bill. If you \nwant to block this bill, vote against cloture, but don't put up these \ngimmicks, rules that are in place to stop something from happening \nbecause you want to accomplish the opposite effect of the rule. The \nrule was put in place to save money. They are using the rule so they \ncan spend money.\n  It shouldn't be any surprise that on another issue relating to this, \nwe have a situation where many on the other side of the aisle have been \ncritical of this noninterference issue. That is the provision that says \nthe Federal Government is not going to negotiate a price for \nprescription drugs for everybody on Medicare. Why do we have this in \nplace? Let me give you the policy.\n\n  We have this in place from a policy point of view because roughly 50 \npercent of all prescriptions in this country are going to be bought \nthrough Medicare--to have that kind of ``market power'' where the \nFederal Government will basically go in and dictate a price fix, price \nset to every pharmaceutical--most pharmaceutical, not every--most \npharmaceutical products in this country.\n  Most Members of Congress are not for a command-and-control, one-size-\nfits-all drug price in America. Some are. Some would like to adopt the \nCanadian-style system, and some would like to adopt the German-style \nsystem, but we have made a decision that we believe it is better for \nthe private sector insurance company, with big market share because \nthere will not be very many of these plans--there will be big market \nshare--to negotiate with the private sector drug companies for the best \nprice they can get. And the better negotiators they are, the better \npremiums they can offer to their beneficiaries which means more \nenrollees. It is certainly their incentive to negotiate tough bargains \nwith the pharmaceutical companies. They have the market power and the \nability to negotiate.\n  It is different than giving the Government the ability to negotiate--\nI shouldn't say negotiate, I should say dictate--the price they will \npay for pharmaceuticals. We think the private sector should work, not \nthe Government dictating prices. They compare it to the Veterans \nAdministration. Yes, the Veterans Administration has such a proposal--\nnot a proposal; it is the law. It mandates a 24-percent reduction. Does \nthat have any rhyme or reason to what the drug costs should be? No, it \nis just a flat 24 percent across the board. If you don't take that \nreimbursement, then you can't participate in Medicaid or any other \nFederal program. It is a heavy hammer. It is a very small part of the \npharmaceutical industry.\n  I yield myself 3 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, that is the policy. What is the history \nof this provision? It is very interesting. This proposal, which was \ncriticized by Senator Daschle today, was introduced by Senator Daschle. \nThis came from the Democrats' bill in the year 2000. This language, \nalmost verbatim, was introduced by the Democratic leader, and now like \nlemmings, they are lining up saluting this as the worst thing they have \never seen. Yet it is their proposal, not just Senator Daschle's. It was \nalso in Congressman Stark's bill in 2000, and again, in the Snowe-Wyden \nproposal, there was the exact language. It was in the tripartisan plan \nof last year. Actually, a version of this language appeared in the \nSenate bill that received 76 votes on the floor of the Senate.\n  I just wonder whether the degree of outrage is somehow inversely \nproportional to the actual complicity of the act. We see this huge \namount of outrage, and yet we see complicity. In fact, it is their \nlanguage that is in this bill. Why did they put it in? They put it in \nbecause they did not want to be charged with having Government price \nfixing. They didn't want to be accused in their proposal that it was \ngoing to be a command-and-control Government price fixing of \npharmaceutical products.\n  What did they do? They said: We believe in competition. They wanted \nto be able to say that they have a competitive model, so they put in a \ncompetitive model. Let the private sector negotiate their incentives \nfor the insurers to get lower costs out of the\n\n[[Page S15708]]\n\npharmaceuticals, and there are incentives on the pharmaceuticals point \nto give volume discounts.\n  Let that mechanism work. Don't have the head of CMS, the Medicare \nDirector in Washington, DC, dictate prices for everybody.\n  Let us not set those prices in the Senate. Let us let the marketplace \nwork to squeeze cost and get efficiency out of the system. It is their \nidea. So, again, I suggest on two issues that have gotten a lot of \ntalk, No. 1, the budget point of order, which is made to save money, is \nactually being used by the other side so they can spend more money. The \nmajor provision that has gotten the ire of so many, which is this \nnoninterference with negotiating drug prices, is their proposal.\n  I suggest, as I had a conversation with one of my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle a few moments ago, I understand the left hates \nthis bill. As we saw from the House and we saw from some of our \ncolleagues, a lot of the right hates this bill. Usually, things that \ncome straight down the middle are usually where most Americans are and \nwhere most Americans would like us to go. That is what this bill does. \nI hope we have very strong support for it as a result.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I want to speak for about 5 minutes about \nencouraging my colleagues to sustain this point of order. I want to use \nsome of the comments I heard about gimmickry because I am concerned \nabout the budget issues, and this is absolutely relevant. It was \ngimmickry to say we are spending $400 billion on a prescription drug \nbenefit for seniors and then hide it in HSAs, $12 billion support for \nthe insurance industry, lots of support, some of which I actually might \neven have agreed to with regard to encouraging corporations to maintain \ntheir insurance policies so Medicare does not have to pick it up, all \nof that is true. But we have a major league problem. There is no cost \ncontainment in this program of any serious effect.\n  I come from a State where there are a lot of pharmaceutical \nindustries and we were talking about importing price controls from \nCanada. We had that debate around here. I am not for that. I think we \nought to deal with a market structure that is fair and respectful of \nthe buyers actually competing for the price.\n  Last time I checked, the Federal Government, when it buys a tank, \nactually goes out and negotiates the price. When it is buying \nairplanes, we talk about negotiating the price. I think it is \nabsolutely essential that if Medicare is the provider of the resources, \nthe taxpayer, that they be able to negotiate their price.\n  One of my problems with this bill--which I will remind people is \n1,200 pages long and not many of us have read it--is that it has a lot \nof unintended consequences. It has one very real intended consequence \nwhich is to dampen competition which might lower prices. We are \nincreasing the demand curve and we are keeping the supply curve the \nsame, and that raises prices. That is exactly what happens. That is \neconomics 101.\n\n  By the way, the VA is a perfect example of it, and I thank Senator \nGraham for pointing this out. When the VA is negotiating prices, it is \nnot 24 percent across the board. It is on individual drugs. They can \nsave about half of what would be paid if they went to a pharmacy.\n  This is not my chart but it is actually doggone good. I take this \nLopressor for high blood pressure. No wonder I have high blood pressure \nbeing in the Senate. It costs 1 cent per pill. At the drugstore it is \n87 cents.\n  Here is another one. This is Zantac. I guess if one has an ulcer--\nsome people get ulcers when they are around here--it costs 2 cents at \nthe VA. It costs $1.83 at the drugstore. That is price control, price \ncontainment at the VA, while the drugstore is charging what the market \nwill bear. That is what our seniors are doing. That is going to back \ninto the longrun explosion of costs with regard to this bill, about \nwhich a lot of conservatives are concerned. I am concerned about it.\n  We say this is $400 billion, it is out of tilt with the budget \nresolution in the first year, but if we think we know whether this bill \nis going to produce $400 billion worth of expenditures over the next 10 \nyears, I think we are kidding ourselves.\n  Nobody knows what is inside this bill on each individual page. There \nis going to be a lot of difference by the time we get there. The one \nthing we do know when we go from 40 million seniors to 70 million \nseniors is this thing is going to explode in the second 10 years. The \nestimate is it will cost $1.3 trillion to $2 trillion.\n  Frankly, it is going to increase the unfunded mandate for Social \nSecurity and from about $18 trillion to $25 trillion. I cannot even \nthink of those numbers, but that is a huge problem if we are not \nwilling to deal with the reality of what we have to do.\n  That is why it is important on the budget to take into consideration \nwhether VA and the Medicare system are actually going to negotiate \nthese prices because they can hold down those costs. If we do not want \nto deal with that, then we are going to have those kinds of long-term \nresults which are going to end up undermining the ability of the \nAmerican people to continue to have the kind of support they expect \nfrom Medicare and other things.\n  I said last night, there is a lot of good in this bill. \nUnfortunately, at least in New Jersey, 300,000 folks who do not have \ninsurance or drug coverage right now are going to get it, but 550,000 \nare going to be impacted negatively. It is real. We have done the \nanalysis. We know it.\n  What is important is we are putting ourselves on a track where we \nwill not be able to afford Medicare A, B, prescription drugs, or any of \nthese things. I think we are putting ourselves on a track because we \nhave been unwilling to deal with cost containment in a serious way. The \nway to do that is not command and control. It is 15 percent of the \nmarket. People negotiate for the Federal Government in every other \npurchase they do. They ought to be doing that here. It would make a big \ndifference on cost containment.\n  I urge my colleagues to sustain the point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield whatever time he might consume, up to 5 \nminutes, to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to add a couple of comments to my \nearlier statement. I noticed the Democrat leader, Senator Daschle, \nalluded to similar points of order being raised in July of 2002. That \nwas raised and supported for a couple of reasons. One, the budget \nresolutions in 2002, that was based on the resolution that passed in \n2001 for fiscal year 2002, said there is up to $300 billion in a bill \nthat was reported out of Finance Committee that would strengthen and \nenhance Medicare.\n  In 2002, the Democrats were running the place. They did not report a \nMedicare bill out of the Finance Committee. They bypassed the Finance \nCommittee. I was a member of that committee. I was incensed that we \nwould just ignore the committee. Therefore, it violated the budget. \nOne, I know it was not reported by committee. Also, it was just, here \nis the bill. I believe the bill was quite a lot larger than $300 \nbillion. I am not sure if it was $570 billion or $600 billion. It was a \nlot more than $300 billion.\n  So there was a very legitimate reason. One, it was not reported out \nof committee. It did not have work done on it by the committee. It did \nnot meet the overall structure or the framework. This bill that we have \nbefore us is within the $400 billion as reported by CBO. It did go \nthrough committee, both the Finance Committee and the Ways and Means \nCommittee. It has been scored by CBO. At that time, I believe the bill \nwe had on the floor of the Senate had not even been scored, or at least \nthe details had not been scored, by CBO.\n  There was a legitimate reason to make a budget point of order. This, \nin my opinion, is not. By its very fact, as evidenced by most of the \npeople who are promoting this budget point of order, they have almost \nall the time, 90-some percent of the time, opposed budget points of \norder when they have been raised in the past.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n\n[[Page S15709]]\n\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Under the unanimous consent, I believe I have been \nallocated 5 minutes. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask for 4 and ask if the Chair will notify me when I \nhave 1 minute left.\n  A few minutes ago, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Tommy \nThompson, was on the floor. It is his right to visit with us. It is an \nopportune moment for him to come as the Senator from Pennsylvania \nreminds us that we are not going into socialism, socialized medicine, \ncommand and control; we are not going to have the Government bargaining \non the prices of medicine.\n  Yet I guess the Senator from Pennsylvania has forgotten that during \nthe anthrax crisis when Cipro, which was going to be used as an \nantidote, was $4.67 a pill, Secretary Thompson negotiated for America \nto reduce the price of that drug in the midst of the crisis to 75 \ncents. He was quoted as saying:\n\n       Everyone said I wouldn't be able to reduce the price of \n     Cipro. I'm a tough negotiator.\n\n  Sounds a lot like command and control for me.\n  For Americans, they are taking a look at this bill and saying: Who is \ngoing to speak for us? This 1,100 page bill prohibits reimportation of \ndrugs from Canada. So our friends, the seniors and families and others \nwho are looking there for relief, they will not be getting it out of \nthis bill. Even worse, as has been noted, in this one page that I take \nout of 1,100, page 53, lines 18 through 26, we prohibit Medicare from \nnegotiating lower drug prices.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania says that is because we believe in the \nfree market. Let the market set the price.\n\n  I might say to my friend from Pennsylvania, how do you explain the \nmultibillion-dollar subsidies for HMOs included in this bill? How do \nyou explain the $6 billion subsidy for your friends with health savings \naccounts in this bill? Frankly, you can't, under free market \nprinciples.\n  Let me say, when you take a look at this bill you understand that we \nare squandering $6 billion for retiree coverage. That is one of the key \nelements. We create these new health savings accounts. I will not go \ninto the long and lurid history, but when Mr. Newt Gingrich of Georgia \ntook control of the House, he brought with him one of his best pals, \nthe Golden Rule Insurance Companies from Lawrenceville, IL. In fact, \nthe Speaker was so smitten with this company he cut a television ad for \nthem with their medical savings accounts. Frankly, they returned the \nfavor, contributing over $3.6 million to Republican congressional \ncandidates. It was such a sweet arrangement. They would pass bills \nsending more business to Golden Rule, Golden Rule would send millions \nof dollars to Republican candidates.\n  Frankly, that meant nothing compared to this bill. This bill gives $6 \nbillion for health savings accounts that have nothing to do with \nMedicare and nothing to do with prescription drugs for seniors. This is \nthe largest single giveaway I have ever seen in 21 years. It is in this \nbill.\n  Now, let me connect the dots. Turns out Golden Rule Insurance Company \nwas recently purchased. Who bought Golden Rule Insurance Company? A \ngroup called UnitedHealthcare, down here, whose CEO, Channing Wheeler, \nwas paid $9.5 million, a sweet salary; compared to other HMO execs--not \nthat great.\n  Now connect the dots. Golden Rule, a friend of the Republican Party, \npurchased by UnitedHealthcare; UnitedHealthcare is the largest \ninsurance group working with AARP. It all comes together.\n  AARP is selling this product for UnitedHealth Group, a $6 billion \nsubsidy in this bill, and now they have discovered this is the best \nbill in the world.\n  I suggest to all my colleagues and all those watching this debate, \ncall AARP. Here is the telephone number, 1-800-424-3410. Tell them to \nstand up for seniors for a change, tell them to fight for Medicare, \ntell them to stop the sweetheart deals with Golden Rule and \nUnitedHealthcare. We need to make sure the people who wrote this bill \nget back to work and eliminate these giveaways, the multibillion-dollar \ngiveaways, the subsidizing for these great free market disciples that \nare included in this bill. And we need to do it now. Sustain the point \nof order. Vote no on the waiver of the point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we reserve the last 4 minutes for the \nDemocratic leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 3 minutes remaining. The Senator from \nIowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I want to take 30 seconds and then yield 5 minutes to \nthe Senator from Louisiana and then the Senator from Montana.\n  Before I do that, how many times have we heard from the other side of \nthe aisle about this being a 1,000-page bill? I want them to read, if \nthey know how to read: There are 678 pages here. I want to know how you \nfolks can raise a point of order when you can't even count the number \nof pages in a bill? I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, we have reached that point where the \ndebate is on the size of the bill and not the merits of the bill.\n  Let me just say, 38 years ago this Congress passed this document that \nI have in my hand for the first time. It was in 1965 that we enacted \nMedicare, which was a noble experiment. It was led by Democrats and \nsigned into law by President Lyndon Johnson. It was, indeed, a change \nand a challenge. No one knew whether it was going to work. People could \nnot be guaranteed it was going to serve the needs of America's seniors. \nBut it was a chance worth taking. It was a change. I suggest today \nDemocrats in particular should not fear change if it is aimed at \nimproving a document that has served this country so well.\n  The only defect of this legislation was that it didn't do everything \nthat it should have. For instance, while it covered doctors and it \ncovered hospitals, it did not cover what at that time were new \ninnovations in the area of prescription drugs. Members of Congress knew \nwe had to take care of seniors going to the hospital. We had to take \ncare of seniors seeing their doctors. But no one really thought that \nseniors getting prescription drugs was going to be that important.\n  Today we have the opportunity to correct what we did not do in 1965 \nand bring about a reform to this program which is greatly needed. I \nwould just say that is why organizations such as the National Council \non Aging, which represents all of these seniors who go to these senior \ncenters throughout our States and congressional districts, as well as \nthe AARP--and Democrats many times cite the AARP when they agreed with \nthem. But now when they do not agree with them they find fault with the \norganization.\n  I suggest the Nation's largest organization representing over 35 \nmillion seniors has had their health economists and their lawyers \ncarefully study the document that is before us and made a \nrecommendation to those of us in Congress. They said this is something \nwe support because it is indeed, on balance, the bill we should approve \nand send on to the President for signature.\n  Again, I say it is not a perfect bill. But, once again, we can't let \nthe perfect be the enemy of the good. We also cannot let the political \npundits of both of our parties suggest we cannot vote for this bill \nbecause somehow it may give credibility to the other party. I have \nactually heard that from both sides of the aisle. I think that would be \na tragic mistake.\n  The issue today is not which political party wins. The issue today is \nwhether we can craft legislation that allows America's 40 million \nseniors to come out a winner. I think on balance this bill does that \nbecause it combines the best of what government can do with the best of \nwhat the private sector can do.\n  Many on my side of the aisle think the Federal Government should do \neverything all the time. We can't do that. We can't do it very \neffectively. So I think it is important to note that on the other side \nof the aisle, many of them think the Federal Government should not do \nanything and that the private sector should do it all.\n  The truth lies, as most truthful matters lie, somewhere in between. \nThe fact is, we ought to combine the best of\n\n[[Page S15710]]\n\nwhat Government can do with the best of what the private sector can do \nand create a new Medicare reform for the 21st century.\n  With regard to the points of order, I made it very clear the two \npoints of order we are going to be voting to waive are not dealing with \nthe so-called premium support language that is in the bill. It doesn't \ndeal with the cost containment provisions that are in the bill. It \ndoesn't deal with whether we are going to bring in the Medicare Program \nall low-income seniors who are currently in, under the State Medicare \nProgram--it doesn't deal with any of that. It deals basically with the \nfact that we are spending more money in this legislation than the \nstructure of the budget would allow us to do.\n  That is not uncommon, and the proper procedure is to have a waiver of \nthose points of order, which is what we are going to be voting on.\n  The first point of order really lies because of the fact that we put \nmore money to help the State Medicaid Programs, something that most \npeople on my side of the aisle strongly supported, to make sure we help \nthose programs make sure the drugs that they are going to still be \ninvolved in helping seniors with--that they will be able to help them \nto the maximum degree possible.\n  In addition, one of the other reasons the first point of order lies \nis because previously the Finance Committee helped the States with \ntheir unemployment insurance, something most people on my side of the \naisle strongly supported. It is not sufficient for people to go back to \nour States and tell seniors that we somehow prevented this bill from \nbeing adopted because of a point of order that was very technical in \nits essence. I think people want to know where we stand on the merits \nof the bill. Are we for prescription drugs for the first time, for \nseniors, since 1965? Are we for giving them a program where the Federal \nGovernment pays 75 percent of their drug costs? Are they for or against \na program that is going to give particular help and assistance to our \nNation's low-income seniors, which is so terribly important? Are we for \nbringing low-income seniors into one standard national Medicare Program \nor are we not?\n  I would not want to go back and somehow argue the technical merits of \nthe point of order and say this is why I could not vote for \nprescription drugs for seniors, a $400 billion package. There are going \nto be some on the more liberal wing and more conservative wing who will \nfind reasons to be against this bill, but on balance it represents a \ncentrist coalition, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, how much time remains on either side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority side controls 3 additional \nminutes, the majority side controls 6\\3/4\\ minutes.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, make no mistake about it, the issue before \nus--that is, whether a point of order should be sustained--is a vote \nabout whether or not we provide prescription drug benefits to seniors. \nIt is that simple.\n  If we fail to waive this point of order, this bill is dead, certainly \nfor this year, probably for the next Congress. The very narrow issue \nbefore us is whether or not it is ``OK'' to spend roughly $4 billion \nmore than the Budget Act previously allocated for the year 2004.\n  It is important to remember that this bill is totally within the \nBudget Committee's allocation for the 10-year period of $400 billion. \nSo the narrow question is, Is it within the allocation for the year \n2004?\n  Now, a couple points here. In 2004, dollars will be spent based upon \nvarious pieces of legislation. There is already legislation passed \nwhich allocates dollars for 2004. So the conference report itself does \nnot break the 2004 cap, but, rather, it is the accumulation of the \ndollars in this bill plus previous bills which total up to exceeding \nthe cap allowable for 2004 under the Budget Act by about $4 billion.\n  So the real question we are asking ourselves is, Are we going kill \nthis bill--a bill for which the full $400 billion allocation does not \nviolate the Budget Act--are we going to kill this bill on a mere \ntechnicality, a technical trap that any spending in 2004 has the effect \nof bringing this bill down?\n  Now, it makes no sense to do that because, clearly, we want, in this \nbill, to spend some money in 2004. What about the doctors in 2004? What \nabout the hospitals in 2004? Are we to tell doctors and hospitals, \nbecause of a mere technicality, they do not get reimbursed in 2004? We \nwill suspend payments for a year, but then, beginning in 2005, we could \npick them up again? I do not think so.\n  I don't know what Senators are going to say to their seniors back \nhome who vote to sustain the budget point of order to kill the bill \nbecause of some spending in 2004 for doctors and hospitals, denying \nthem a prescription drug benefit because they killed the bill. I do not \nthink many people in this body would like to do that.\n  This is a good bill. It is unfortunate that at this stage of the \ndebate, where we are past the listening stage, an awful lot of Senators \nare not listening to each other. Rather, they are being rhetorical, \nthey are making their rhetorical points, and they are trying to \npersuade I don't know who, but some people to certain points of view.\n  But if you look at the mere language of the bill, it is a good bill. \nIt provides a prescription drug benefit for seniors, a huge benefit for \nlow-income seniors. One-third of all seniors, under this legislation, \nare categorized as low-income, and they get the benefits of this bill.\n  We also added in more money for what is called the Medicaid wrap to \nhelp lower income folks even more than earlier was the case. We also \nadded in money to help keep retiree coverage.\n  I think it is important to note that companies generally are reducing \nretiree coverage in America, irrespective of this bill. We have put in \n$88 billion to companies for retiree coverage, which means, clearly, \nthat those companies are more likely to keep and retain coverage; that \nis, this legislation intends to encourage the retaining of coverage, \nnot discouraging it.\n\n  So if this bill goes down, there are going to be more retirees who \nwill lose their coverage. Senior citizens will not get the benefit of a \ndrug benefit, particularly the lower income seniors will not get the \nbenefit, and we will be doing our seniors a terrific disservice.\n  So tomorrow is another day. We can improve upon this bill. If the \nbill is killed, as it will be if this point of order is sustained, \nthose who hope, ``well, maybe we can do better next year,'' I think \nshould remember the admonition that a bird in the hand is worth two in \nthe bush.\n  Next year is a very political year. It is 2004. It is a Presidential \nelection year. It is almost impossible to predict the dynamics of next \nyear. It depends on the economy. It depends upon foreign policy. It \ndepends upon the Presidential election politics. And we all know that \nusually in a Presidential election year not much legislation of \nconsequence passes. Usually, there is a lot of talking but not a lot of \naction.\n  I do not think we can afford passing up giving seniors a chance to \nget prescription drug benefits. So I urge Senators, on the technical \nmatter before us, to vote to waive the point of order because it does \nnot make much sense to me to let a technicality kill this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might \nconsume, and probably all of it.\n  Keeping the point of order means keeping the status quo. So I am \nasking my friends on the other side of the aisle, what is there about \nthe status quo on Medicare that is good and acceptable? The lack of \nprescription drugs? The slowness in getting cheaper generic drugs out \ninto the market? Arbitrary caps on physical therapists? Insufficient \nfunding for rural hospitals and long waiting lines for seeing the \ndoctors, if Medicare people can get in to see a doctor in rural \nAmerica?\n  I ask my colleagues, is this status quo acceptable? Apparently it is, \nat least to the Senators who are refusing to waive the point of order.\n  I say nothing about Medicare's status quo is acceptable, not doctors' \ncuts, not decreasing hospital and home health payments, not the lack of \naccess to health plans in rural areas such as\n\n[[Page S15711]]\n\nmine. And most of all, seniors' lack of access to prescription drugs \nfor all these years is what I find to be most unacceptable about the \nreality of the status quo.\n  For those of you happy with the status quo, I say, try telling that \nto your doctors, your hospitals, and, most of all, to your seniors. You \ntry telling these people that a technical point of order is more \nimportant than changing Medicare's status quo. I will not try, and I \nhope my colleagues will not try either.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this is our last chance to do something \nto control the exploding costs that are absolutely guaranteed to occur \nfor seniors and for the Government unless we do something else. This is \nthe last chance.\n  There are those who have just said this will kill the bill. Just to \nmake sure everybody understands, this has nothing to do with killing \nthe bill. What happens under Senate rules is that we will go back to S. \n1 as an amendment to H.R. 1. That is the pending business. That was \nvoted on, by the way, 76 to 21. So we go back, if we sustain this point \nof order, to the Senate-passed bill, which passed 76 to 21. We can send \nit to the House and ask for bipartisan support.\n  The distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania was saying that one of \nthe concerns I raised was our ability to contain costs. And yes, he is \nright, we had an early bill that had the provision, this egregious \nprovision in it prohibiting the Government from getting the best deal, \njust as Secretary Thompson has done with Cipro, just as we do with the \nVeterans Administration.\n  What he did not tell our colleagues is that every subsequent bill--\nthe last two bills we have introduced--did not have this provision in \nit. Why? Because we understand what an incredibly valuable tool it has \nbeen for the Veterans Administration.\n  So, Mr. President, if you want to control costs, if you want to make \nsure the senior citizens of this country have the ability to get the \nlowest price, if you are absolutely as concerned, as you say you are, \nabout controlling the costs of this program, then you are going to vote \nto sustain this point of order.\n  This is our last chance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota has 1 minute \nremaining.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been requested. Is \nthere a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 61, nays 39, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 458 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--61\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--39\n\n     Akaka\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Clinton\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Graham (FL)\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 61, the nays are \n39. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is agreed to, and the point of order falls.\n  Mr. FRIST. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DAYTON. It is with a heavy heart I rise to speak against, and \nlater vote against, this bill before the Senate. I campaigned in \nMinnesota on the need for prescription drug coverage for senior \ncitizens. I said consistently I would vote for a responsible bill. \nSomething was better than nothing. I voted a few months ago for the \nSenate-passed bill despite considerable reservations. It was better \nthan nothing.\n  That Senate bill contained my ``taste of their own medicine'' \namendment which would require Members of Congress to live with the same \nprescription drug coverage as we have for seniors and other Medicare \nbeneficiaries. That amendment, which passed the Senate by a vote of 93 \nto 3, was stripped out of the conference report as, evidently, some \nMembers were promised it would be. That should tell the American people \neverything they need to know about this bill. It is not good enough for \nCongress.\n  Some Members of Congress are trying to sell this legislation as good \nfor seniors and other Medicare beneficiaries of America, but it is not \ngood enough for them to live under. That is the height of hypocrisy. It \nis good enough for the senior citizens of this country, it is the best \nwe will vote to provide for them, but, sorry, we will pass on it for \nourselves. Why is Congress opting out of this coverage if it is so \ngood? Why is it only half as good as what Members voted to provide \nthemselves and their families and their employees?\n  First, the program does not begin for 2 years, not until January of \n2006. Until then, the senior citizens of America are going to have \ntheir opportunity to get another drug discount card. There is a novel \nidea. There are only how many dozens available already to seniors?\n  This one plays special favorites. A senior with an income above 150 \npercent of poverty, approximately $13,000 per year of income and \napproximately $16,000 a year for a couple--they get a drug discount \ncard and nothing more. A single senior with an income just under that \namount, by even a couple dollars, or a married couple with an income \nsimilar, just a few dollars under that cut off level, gets a drug \ndiscount card plus $600. It is all or nothing. Either $600 or nothing.\n  I am strongly in favor of helping low-income retirees but certainly \non a more equitable basis than $600 or nothing. That is all that is \navailable for seniors for the first 2 years.\n  I would think the administration and others who decry the \nbureaucratic ineptitude and want to dismantle whole structures of \nGovernment would say something about this kind of ridiculous delay. Two \nyears from passage to inception, for what? To give insurance companies \ntime to write insurance policies? Or to shortchange seniors for 2 years \nto get the 10-year costs of the bill down? What is the reason for this \nridiculous delay?\n  Whatever it is, if a program such as this cannot be initiated for 2 \nyears, that is a compelling reason to junk this program and find one \nbetter. Seniors of Minnesota and America have waited too long already \nto get good comprehensive prescription drug coverage. They should not \nbe told they have to wait another 2 years before the program can even \nbegin. That should be reason itself to find another way.\n\n  When it does begin, what does the average senior get? He or she pays \nan annual premium of about $420 with an annual deductible of $250 and a \n25-percent copay for the next $2,000 in expenditures in that 1 year. In \nother words, $500 of the $2,000 of costs. So if you add those up--$420 \npremium, the $250 annual deductible, the copay of $500, the\n\n[[Page S15712]]\n\nsenior is paying $1,170 of the first $2,250 annual costs for \nprescription drugs. In other words, just over half.\n  But the next $2,850 of the costs for that senior citizen in that \nsingle year have to be paid entirely by the senior, everything out of \ntheir own pockets. That means for the first $5,100 of annual expenses \nfor prescription drugs--which is not, unfortunately, beyond the pale \nfor many seniors--the senior citizen pays $4,020. The Senior pays for \n80 percent of the first $5,100 of annual prescription drug expenses. \nAbove that, catastrophic coverage kicks in and the program pays 95 \npercent of the balance for that year but then the next year it starts \nall over.\n  Something is better than nothing, but to delegate $400 billion over \n10 years for coverage that seniors have to wait 2 years to begin and \nthen they have to pay $4,000 of the first $5,100--all of that to save a \nlittle over $1,080 is something but it sure is not much.\n  If that were all the bill did, I still would support it reluctantly \nbecause something is better than nothing. Unfortunately, the bill does \nworse than that; 2.7 million seniors estimated by the Budget Office now \ncovered under private plans will lose that private coverage and will be \nrelegated to this coverage which is far inferior to what they have now. \nThat would include an estimated 40,000 Minnesotans. People who worked \nall their lives for a private employer and are now covered under that \nplan would lose it and be shifted to something much worse for them and \nwhat they have now.\n  For over 7 million low-income elderly, the poorest of our poor senior \ncitizens, they will pay more as they get shifted from Medicaid to \nMedicare. Their copay will increase and their choice of prescriptions \nwill be reduced. That will affect almost 90,000 people in my State of \nMinnesota.\n  The worst result in this bill is a prescription for higher and higher \ndrug prices for all Americans that all Americans will have to pay. All \nAmericans will have to pay out of their own pockets for their own \nprescription drugs and they will have to pay out of their own pockets \nfor this program and other Government programs because the way this \nbill is written, the drug companies profit and everyone else has to \npay.\n  There will be no drug reimportation from Canada permitted unless the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services certifies the safety of \nall, which is something that the Secretary's predecessors in the \nprevious two administrations did not do and this Secretary has \nindicated he will not do either.\n\n  It is a totally unrealistic requirement to put on a Secretary to give \na blanket certification of the safety of everything that would \ntranspire.\n  If the Secretary of Transportation had to provide that kind of \nguarantee for all air travel in the United States, we would not have an \nairline network functioning because no one could be expected to give \nthat kind of guarantee.\n  But the people who wrote this bill were very clever. They will not \nprohibit reimportation themselves, even though that is the result they \nwant. No. They pretend the opposite, that it is permitted if--if--the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services certifies safety, something they \nknow he will not do.\n  The irony--or the absurdity really--is that according to Congressman \nRahm Emanuel, one of the coauthors of the reimportation bill in the \nHouse of Representatives, the United States imports $14 billion worth \nof foreign-made drugs into the United States every year--$14 billion of \nprescription drugs that are manufactured in countries such as Ireland \nand elsewhere that are imported into the United States and distributed \nto U.S. pharmacies and then sold to American citizens.\n  Those exact same drugs are manufactured in exactly the same plants, \nin the exact same countries, such as Ireland, and are shipped into \nCanada and distributed to Canadian pharmacists; and the only \ndifference--they are exactly the same; the same product, manufacturer, \npackaging--the only difference is in Canada the price is one-third what \nit is in the United States or one-fourth what it costs in the United \nStates or even as little as one-fifth or less than what it costs in the \nUnited States.\n  That is the only difference: the price. Yet all of my colleagues who \nare free trade proponents and those over in the House want to repeal \nNAFTA just for prescription drugs, which is one of the areas where the \nAmerican consumer would benefit most decidedly, enormously, from NAFTA, \nfrom free trade, from the ability to go to another country and take \nadvantage of those lower prices.\n  No. Sorry. Under this legislation, the result will be you Americans \nmust buy your drugs in the United States, and only in the United \nStates, at prices two or three or four times the world market price.\n  Now, why are the prices so much lower in Canada than they are in this \ncountry? It is because the Canadian Government stands up for its \ncitizens and negotiates prices that are lower and will not agree to \nprices that are exorbitant. And their citizens are the beneficiaries of \nthese prices that are one-third, one-fourth, one-fifth of what they are \nin the United States--not even close approximations.\n  People say the Government ought to act more like a business, and they \nare right. What we are proposing the Government would do is exactly \nwhat large corporations which self-insure or HMOs do, which is to \npurchase volumes of prescription drugs at negotiated discounts of 30 \npercent, up to 50 percent. It is exactly what my colleague Bob Graham \nfrom Florida has pointed out, that the Veterans Administration does \nquite successfully, with fantastic savings for veterans and for the \nAmerican taxpayers who pay for part of the cost of that program.\n\n  But not under this legislation. This legislation would prohibit what \nthey call Government interference in price setting negotiations. Why? \nWell, once again, the words of the bill belie the intent and the \nresult. It says: ``in order to further competition.'' What deception \nthat is. It says, let a bunch of small-competitor plans offer nickel-\nand-dime savings, but prohibit the Government from insisting upon and \ngetting 5 times, 10 times that amount of savings, savings that would \nbenefit everyone in America--seniors and everyone else. Those price \nreductions would be reflected in domestic market prices.\n  The critics call it price fixing. Well, there is price fixing now in \nthis country. It is the drug companies that are doing the price fixing. \nThey are given monopolies, called patents, for 15 to 20 years or more. \nThey set the prices, they raise the prices, and we have to pay the \nprices. But that kind of price fixing, I guess, is all right according \nto some who want to prohibit the Government from doing so.\n  Does anybody really believe Americans are going to be upset about \npaying lower prices for prescription drugs? Does anybody think \nconsumers in America are going to say: Government is acting in a way \nthat I don't support? In fact, it will be the opposite. People will \nsay: Wow, my Government is doing something for me. My Government is \nstanding up for me against these big corporate entities that I don't \nhave the ability to face by myself. I don't have that purchasing power. \nI can't go to a drugstore and negotiate price. Even as a pharmacist I \ncan't negotiate a different price. My Government is standing up for me \nthe way the Canadian Government is standing up for their citizens. By \ngolly, my Government is doing something right.\n  But the people who wrote this bill are so anti-Government that they \nwill not even let Government do something right. They will not even let \nGovernment do something that would have enormous financial benefit for \nall the people of this country that would save them billions of dollars \nof expenditures because I guess it might contradict their ideological \nabsolutism that Government does everything wrong.\n  Well, it also might cost the drug companies, the largest contributors \nto the Federal political campaigns--it might cost them, I guess, some \nof their millions of dollars of profits, coming out of the pockets of \npeople we are supposed to represent.\n  It is a big victory, this bill, for the corporate drug dealers. You \nhave to give them credit. All those lobbyists--what is it? They \nestimate there are six times the number of lobbyists for the \npharmaceutical industry for every Member of this body. Well, it sure \npaid off for them this time. They won everything. They got uncontained \nprice increases for years to come, a market group, 39 million seniors \nwho will have help pay them, who will pay those\n\n[[Page S15713]]\n\nhigher prices, and everyone else paying higher prices, and a captive \nmarket, where they are not even able to go someplace else and take \nadvantage of lower prices elsewhere. The drug companies want \neverything.\n  The Medicare manipulators, they are the other winners. This bill is \nsupposed to be about providing the best possible prescription drug \ncoverage for senior citizens. Now we find out all these ambushes of \nvarious aspects of Medicare are tossed in that were not considered by \nthe Senate, for which there were no hearings. And there were not votes \non these matters. They were either put in the House bill or stuck in \nthe conference committee behind closed doors where no one else could \nsee what was going on.\n\n  The program reform in Congress has become like a drive-by shooting. \nWith no forewarning, somebody picks a target, shoots a bunch of holes \nin it, and takes off. That is our version of reform. That is what we \nare doing here with no forethought.\n  Another example is special education. We have waited 3 years for so-\ncalled reform of special education, which is always used as the reason \nwe cannot spend the money that is necessary to fulfill a 27-year old \ncommitment. And then suddenly, last week, lo and behold, there was \nunanimous consent for 2 hours of debate, evenly divided, on IDEA \nreform, and, boom, we are going to have it done, boom, in time to go \nhome and eat turkey.\n  Unfortunately, we produce enough turkeys right here with this \nlegislation. Unfortunately, this bill we have before us is one of those \nturkeys. And I say that with no pleasure at all, given the importance \nof it. But this is a $400 billion turkey that gives first pickings and \nall the gravy to the corporate drug dealers and the big insurance \ncompanies and the big plan providers. Some seniors get the leftovers, \nand the American taxpayers get the neck and higher drug prices for \nthemselves and higher payments through this program and others, \nsubsidizing prices that are just exorbitant and that I would be ashamed \nto support.\n  There is a better bill that could be written. There is a better bill \nthat could be passed. There is a better bill that could benefit the \npeople of Minnesota and the people of this country. With a 2-year \ndelay, we could come back next year and pass that bill and still enact \nit and get it implemented sooner than this one. That is the course of \naction we should take.\n  We should reject this conference report, not for nothing, but for \nsomething better because the American people deserve something much \nbetter than what is being foisted on them here.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I have a question, Mr. President, about the process. \nIs the time available under the cloture rule divided between two sides \nin equal parts?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, there is no provision for equal division \nof time.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. So that any speeches now are made under cloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, for the information of my colleagues, \nSenator Clinton and I are going to speak briefly and make a unanimous \nconsent request with which I think he would agree.\n  Having listened to my colleague from Minnesota, I think many of us \ncome to this historic day on this vote on Medicare with some \ntrepidation but, frankly, with a lot of hope. Everyone knows that \nMedicare, as it is currently constituted, does many good things for our \nsenior citizens. We also know they need a prescription drug benefit. \nAnd we also know we are just about to add $400 billion for that \npurpose. There are reforms in this we hope will work, but reforms which \nwill make us enlightened as to how best to preserve Medicare in the \nfuture. I believe that is the bipartisan motive behind all of this.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 1839\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I sought recognition to talk about our \neconomy and, frankly, the need to extend unemployment benefits. It is a \nfact that long-term unemployment reached a 20-year high and the job \noutlook for the future, though improving, still leaves an awful lot of \npeople wanting and unemployed as this holiday season approaches. For \nexample, in my State of Oregon, we are down from 8 percent now to 7.6 \npercent. This is simply too high. Despite this economic reality, the \nFederal program that provides Federal unemployment benefits is set to \nrun out next month unless we provide an extension.\n  We have extended these benefits several times since it was created in \nMarch 2002. I believe we need to do so again. Millions of unemployed \nworkers have reached the end of their benefits without finding work, \nand thousands more continue to run out of their State unemployment \nbenefits at the highest rate on record.\n  My concern is that Congress is going to recess and go home without \nproviding the assistance jobless Americans need and deserve. This \nmonth, Senator Clinton and I introduced the Temporary Extended \nUnemployment Compensation Program for an additional 6 months of \nunemployment benefits. She and I have introduced this bill because the \ncurrent unemployment insurance program will run out in June, unless we \ndo this. It would then run out in June and phase out by September 30. \nThis is a modest extension for Congress to pass, but it is vital to \nmany unemployed Americans, particularly those who have lost not only \ntheir jobs but their homes, health care, and more. We simply cannot \nleave families out on a limb while they are looking for jobs. This is a \nbill that will help them provide for their basic needs while making \ntheir job searches a little easier.\n  I urge my colleagues not to leave Washington for the Thanksgiving and \nChristmas holidays without passing legislation to lend a helping hand \nto those Americans most in need.\n  Before I propound a unanimous consent request, I yield time to my \ncolleague, Senator Clinton of New York, for her comments, and then \nwould make my request.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from New York \nis recognized.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am very pleased that my colleague \nSenator Smith has taken the lead in asking for an extension of the \nTemporary Extended Unemployment Compensation Program. One might wonder \nwhy we are having to do this, but the simple explanation is that once \nagain we have run out of time. People will run out of their benefits by \nthe end of this year. If we go home for the Thanksgiving and Christmas \nholidays without acting, there will be many Americans and a lot of \npeople in Oregon and in New York who are not going to have the \ncontinuing help they deserve in these times.\n  We have extended unemployment insurance with bipartisan support in \nthe Senate three times in the last 2 years. I am very proud of that \nbecause I think it shows how we can work together to help those who \ndeserve our assistance.\n  Because we are not coming back in, as I understand it, until January \n20, we won't be able to do that if we don't act now on the Senator's \nproposal. If we do act now, the House, which is coming back in early \nDecember, will be able to similarly act and the benefits will flow.\n  It is significant, too, that Senator Smith and I are in the Chamber \nasking our colleagues to join us because the State of Oregon and New \nYork City have the highest unemployment rates in the entire country. \nNew York City has an unemployment rate of 8.2 percent. We have never \nrecovered from the effects of September 11. Oregon has an unemployment \nrate of 7.6 percent. So both the Senator and I are very concerned about \nthe good people we represent on opposite ends of our country who have \nbeen out of work for a long time. We know long-term unemployment is at \nthe highest level it has been in 20 years. We need to give them some \nadditional time.\n  This extension would provide another 13-week extension until June. I \nwould urge support of Senator Smith's proposal. If I am not already \nlisted as an original cosponsor, I ask unanimous consent that I be so.\n\n[[Page S15714]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I yield back to the Senator from Oregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from Oregon is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of S. 1839, to provide additional Federal \nbenefits for the unemployed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I want to \nmake a couple of points. Point one is that we have seen that the \neconomy is recovering. We are at about a 6 percent unemployment rate \nnationwide. Back in 1993, the Democrats controlled the House of \nRepresentatives, they controlled the Senate and they controlled the \nWhite House. Extensions of unemployment benefits had been going on for \na period of time because of the recession. And with the Democrats in \ncontrol of both Houses and the Presidency, they terminated the program \nwhen the national unemployment rate was at 6.4 percent. The national \nunemployment rate was .4 of a percent higher than it is today.\n  The current extension of unemployment benefits does not end until the \nend of December. In December, individuals currently receiving extended \nbenefits will still maintain those benefits. And based on all the \nprojections, the national unemployment rate should be lower at the end \nof December than it is today.\n  There are a couple other points that need to be made in this debate. \nFirst, when the unemployed are about to exhaust their unemployment \nbenefits, over half of those unemployed individuals get a job in those \nlast 2 weeks. And we have seen that a lot of people lately have been \nexhausting the full time on their unemployment. Why is that? Well, for \none reason: The States have been reducing the amount of job searching \nrequired by each individual. Basically, they are making it easier to \nstay on unemployment insurance and taking away the incentives to go out \nthere and get a job.\n  The welfare reform bill, signed into law by President Clinton, \ncharacterized Republicans as throwing women and children out into the \nstreets, that we were cruel, heartless, hard-hearted people. But we \nknew something about human behavior. We knew that if we gave some \nassistance, some temporary assistance, and gave individuals an \nincentive to be employed, in other words that it was better to get a \njob than it was to be on welfare--we knew that a lot of people would go \nout and get jobs. What we didn't know was the staggering number of them \nwho did.\n  Unemployment insurance is the same way. The more generous the \nbenefit, the easier you make it to stay on unemployment insurance, and \nthe less incentive there is for people to actually go out and do what \nit takes to get a job. So this is not about being cruel and heartless. \nIt is recognizing the fact that our unemployment rate is less today \nthan it was in 1993, when the Democrats were in control and every \nsingle Democratic Senator and House Member voted to end the program \nwhen the unemployment rate was higher than it is today.\n  Every single Democrat voted to end the program. With that, I \nappreciate the work they are trying to do. I know their hearts are in \nthe right place. But on policy grounds, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from New York \nis recognized.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I believe we are to go back on the \nschedule for the postcloture Medicare debate; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I will say a few words and then yield to \nmy good friend from New Jersey. Before I get into the Medicare debate, \nI wish to say some concluding remarks in response to my colleague from \nNevada.\n  At the rate that job creation is going under this current \nadministration, we have one job opening for every three applicants, and \nit will take the next 19 months to get to the level of jobs we had \nbefore the March 2001 recession started. So I think we are mixing \napples and oranges here.\n  This has been a jobless period. One can argue about whether or not \nthere has been any kind of recovery. I would take issue with people \nsuggesting it, but if they do, then they need to use that oxymoron ``it \nis a jobless recovery,'' because the economy sure is not creating jobs. \nIn addition, we have places such as the one my friend, the Senator from \nOregon, represents, and my State, where the unemployment rate is far \nabove the national average. There is no way to say New York City, with \nan 8.2-percent unemployment rate, is creating jobs again. It is not \nhappening.\n  I have a little problem with this idea that we are comparing welfare \nrecipients with people who lost their jobs. Welfare recipients didn't \nhave jobs, by definition. The whole effort in the 1990s was to create \ncircumstances in which people could move from welfare to work. What we \nhave now are people moving from work to nothing. We have no safety net. \nSo we are telling people who have worked hard, done what they were \nsupposed to do, been laid off from airlines, or telecommunications, or \nfinancial services, whose jobs have gone to India or China, and there \nare no jobs to replace them, we are telling them: Tough luck, happy \nThanksgiving, Merry Christmas, Happy New Year.\n  If that is what the other party wants to send as their Christmas \ngreetings to their constituents, that is certainly their right. It \ncertainly seems not to be in the spirit of the holiday we are about to \ncelebrate.\n  It is factually inaccurate to say there are jobs being created, and \nall we have to do is really put the pressure on these people and make \nit impossible for them to do anything other than go get a job. That \nwould be great if there were jobs to be gotten.\n  Given the combination of the economic and budget policies of this \nadministration, I don't think we are going to have those jobs \navailable. I predict to you that even if we have an unemployment rate \nnationally of 6 percent, or 6.1 percent, or 6.2 percent, we are not \ngoing to have the jobs coming back because this administration has \npresided over the largest job loss in American history since Herbert \nHoover. If I were on the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, I would not \nwant to be reminded of that, either. I would not want there to be an \nup-or-down vote on whether or not to extend unemployment insurance \nbecause, if do you that, you admit the obvious: You know what, we are \nnot creating jobs and we have to do something to help people.\n  I regret that the effort my friend, Senator Smith, and I have joined \ntogether in trying to accomplish has been objected to; namely, to bring \nabout an extension of unemployment benefits, which strikes me as not \nonly the right thing to do but the smart thing to do, because every \ntime we extend unemployment benefits to the people who truly need them, \nyou pump more money into the economy, which may create a job or two and \nobviate the need for uninsurance benefits in the future.\n  We will be back, as we were last year. We are not going away, \nobviously. This is something about which we care deeply. It is the \nright thing to do. If I thought we were having the kind of economy in \nthe future that we had starting in 1993, I might have a different idea, \nbut that is not what is going to happen. All the happy talk \nnotwithstanding, that is not going to happen.\n  Mr. President, I will now move to the Medicare conference report. I \nhave to tell you that the more I learn about this proposal, the less I \nlike it, the less fair I think it is, the less useful for our seniors.\n  Just recently, because we got this 1,200 page bill 4 days ago, \nincluding a weekend, when people were combing through it, our experts \nwere trying to read it. I can guarantee you that if you put two \nSenators up in the well of the Senate on opposite sides of the bill, or \neven on the same side of this bill, they would not agree on every \nprovision because there is not anybody who fully understands what is in \nthis bill.\n  But what I just learned is that three important items from the Senate \nbill were changed in conference, in addition to everything else we know \nthat was changed--all the big things, including the reimportation of \ndrugs, the limitation on premium support, the lack of any kind of \nsupport for HSAs, all of those things which changed. Here are\n\n[[Page S15715]]\n\nsome additional changes which are now coming to light as people comb \nthrough the fine print of the bill.\n  First, we thought seniors would know at the time of their enrollment \nin these private plans what drugs would be on the list. That is called \na formulary. It is kind of a fancy term. There are lots of fancy, \nconfusing terms in this bill. My colleague, Senator Boxer from \nCalifornia, has a mind-boggling chart, where she and her good staff \nhave pulled out all kinds of words that no normal human being \nunderstands. Heaven forbid, I don't think abnormal people understand \nthem. They are made-up words that describe these processes and events, \nand nobody understands what they really mean.\n  So we now found out that these formularies--the list of drugs that \nwould be offered by a plan--are not necessarily going to be available \nto a senior when that senior signs up.\n  Now, imagine that. Think about my 84-year-old mother, who takes a \nnumber of prescription drugs that are very specific and assigned to her \nby her physician to meet her needs. Her doctor says: This is what you \nneed, and here is your prescription. So in 2006 or 2007, when she signs \nup for one of these plans, she is not going to know whether the plan \nincludes a particular drug that she needs. I find that a big problem, \nbecause how can you buy something when you don't know what it is you \nare buying?\n  This is supposed to be a prescription drug plan. Therefore, \nprescription drugs are at the heart of it. If you don't even know which \ndrugs you are supposed to get on your plan, that is not much of a plan. \nThis is another typical example of the old bait and switch--maybe it is \nbetter to call it buying a pig in a poke. You don't know really what \nyou are buying but you have to go out and buy it.\n  Second, when the Senate sent the bill to conference, the Senate \nrequired that the 10 regions determined by the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services would be larger than a State. Now, that was supposed to \nassure that we avoid the problem we now have with Medicare+Choice, \nwhere HMOs serve some counties but withdraw from or refuse to serve \nother counties.\n  I have that problem all over my State. The most intensely organized \nseniors in my State are seniors who have had a bad experience with \nHMOs--HMOs that came into their county and left them high and dry at \nthe end of the year; HMOs that came in and, when they found they had no \ncompetition, raised the costs right in the middle of the year. Or at \nthe end of the year, when it came time to change and they were the only \ngame in town, they really increased costs to our seniors.\n  But the conference report, instead of taking the Senate requirements, \neliminates it--eliminates the requirement that the insurers must serve \nan entire State or a large region.\n  I also know that as a Senator from New York, I have a special \nobligation toward the people of Puerto Rico. We have a lot of Puerto \nRicans in New York. We are very proud and I am very honored to \nrepresent a large Puerto Rican population in New York. But the \nconference report has less money than the Senate bill for prescription \ndrugs for Puerto Ricans. I know it always comes as a surprise to some \npeople to learn that Puerto Ricans are American citizens. They are not \nsome alien group over here. They are American citizens. They don't live \nin a State, but neither do the people who live in the District of \nColumbia, but they are American citizens, too. For some reason, we are \nnot providing adequate funding for the people of Puerto Rico to get the \nprescription drugs to which American citizens under this bill are \nentitled.\n  Those are three hidden provisions in the fine print that we just \ndiscovered today. Now we are going to have to vote on this bill today \nor tomorrow, and we are going to be setting ourselves on a course that \nwill radically change Medicare.\n  Why should people care? If you are not 65 or older, if you are not my \nmother's age, if you are not even closing in on Medicare, as I am, why \nshould you care if you are my daughter's age or one of these young \npeople working in the Senate in their thirties or forties? Why should \nyou care?\n  I would argue you should care because, No. 1, in our country we try \nto keep faith with each other by providing a safety net for seniors, \nfor people who fought the wars, raised their families, built their \nbusinesses, and served their communities. We thought ever since 1965, \nwhen Medicare was passed, that it was really good for America to make \nthat commitment to our parents and our grandparents. It was the right \nthing to do. It was the moral thing to do. It was the smart thing to \ndo. Before 1965, the poorest people in America were people over 65. Now \nthere are poor children. We have had a massive transfer of wealth to \ntake care of our parents and grandparents through Social Security and \nMedicare. I believe we have neglected our children. We have about 22 \npercent of our children living in poverty. I am not proud of that, but \nI am proud of what we have done through Social Security and Medicare.\n  If we are starting to unravel that now, that says something about who \nwe are as a people. It says something about this generation of American \nleadership compared to previous generations.\n  Why else should you care if you are not a Medicare beneficiary? Maybe \nyou are the son, the daughter, or a grandchild of a Medicare \nbeneficiary and maybe you will want to do the right thing if your \ngrandparent or your parent has some kind of medical problem and they \ncannot afford to pay for it themselves, and you want to step in and \nhelp because that is the kind of person you are. And I hope that \ndescribes the vast majority of our young people in our country today.\n  That may be tough because maybe you are saving to send your own child \nto college or maybe you are saving to buy your first house. Then all of \na sudden, a medical catastrophe strikes, and what used to be Medicare \nto provide that safety net is just not there anymore in 2010 or 2012. \nAll of a sudden, the burden falls back on you.\n  Why else should you care? Because in this bill it is not only about \nundermining Medicare, it is about undermining health insurance in \ngeneral. We already have an increasing number of uninsured people, and \nwe are going to have even more of them in the future because we have a \ntotally dysfunctional system for financing health care that certainly \ndoes take care of insurance companies and their executives and \npharmaceuticals and their executives but doesn't do a great job for the \naverage person.\n  This bill will undermine insurance for everyone, not just for \nMedicare recipients. Why do I say that? Because there are no cost \ncontrols to keep the price of a prescription drug down. There is no \nbargaining power for the Governor to try to hold the pharmaceutical \ncompanies in line to prevent them from just blowing the top off \nwhatever the price structure is. There is a really insidious provision \nthat puts a limit on how much money we can spend on overall Medicare if \nthe prices of Medicare go up--that is, hospitals, doctors, and drugs \nnow--which means you have to cut back on everything, not just \nprescription drugs. So we are going to have Medicare recipients \nsqueezed even more. There is such a thing called cross subsidization. \nWhat that means is, if you have insurance and you go to the hospital, \nyou are not just paying for your services that you get, you are, in \neffect, paying for people who couldn't pay. For example, maybe the day \nbefore you showed up in the emergency room, Mrs. Smith came in after a \nterrible car accident or maybe some kind of acute asthmatic attack or \nother kind of serious problem, and she didn't have any insurance. The \nhospital takes care of her, but then they have to charge you, your \nemployer and your insurance company more to pay their bills. Anytime \nyou transfer money away from direct care, you are forcing more people \nto pay more for the same care. Some of them will be unable to afford \nit, but the cost to the providers of that uncompensated care will, in \nturn, raise the price which, in turn, has employers dropping people \nwhich, in turn, creates more uninsured individuals. It is a closed \nsystem. It is a circuit. The circle should not be stressed. This breaks \nthat circle. This takes the security of Medicare and pulls it right \nout, causing all sorts of effects throughout the circle.\n\n  The reason we created Medicare in the first place was that insuring \nolder people who might be more sick and more frail is not a profitable \nenterprise. There are people who retire and go to some beautiful place \nand play\n\n[[Page S15716]]\n\ngolf all the time. They are physically fit and they look great when \nthey are 75, but now they may live to be 100, 25 more years. At some \npoint, the body starts breaking down no matter how well you take care \nof yourself.\n  Medicare was the idea that we needed to provide a product because the \nmarketplace would not provide it, and this bill proves the wisdom of \nthat because the only way you are going to provide these benefits is \nbasically by subsidizing or, some might say inelegantly, bribing \ninsurance companies with billions and billions of taxpayer dollars to \nprovide this benefit that they would not ordinarily provide because it \nis not cost-effective; it is not profitable.\n  There are many other reasons this Medicare bill is not in the best \ninterests of either Medicare recipients or our general population.\n  It is a sad day when we essentially devise this scheme to try to \ntransfer money from the Medicare system and the taxpayers' pocket to \nthose who are already doing very well, indeed. Probably the saddest \nthing to me is not what might happen to the average Medicare recipient, \nwhich I deeply regret, but to the poorest of our Medicare recipients, \nthe people who don't retire from an office job or some other \nundertaking that gives them the resources to move to some warm place \nand play golf every day, but the vast numbers of people who are sick, \nwho are frail, who are chronically ill, who are poor, and who end up in \nnursing homes. Six million of them will be worse off under this bill. \nThat is really hard for me to accept. I do not understand how a great, \nrich nation like ours can come to this point, where we impose new and \nextra burdens on the poorest of the poor and the sickest of the sick.\n\n  I guess we think if somebody is in a nursing home and not out at a \ngolf course that we will not see them; we will not care; we will not \nknow. Maybe that is true if it is not your relative, your neighbor, \nyour colleague, or your friend. But 6 million low-income, chronically \nill or nursing home bound Medicare beneficiaries will be worse off \nunder this bill because of formularies or increased co-pays. I find \nthis not only hard to justify but cynical, cynical because some folks \nare making a bet that those poor people are not going to raise a fuss \nor a ruckus: Out of sight, out of mind.\n  They will not show up to vote or certainly not give anybody any \ncampaign contributions. So basically they do not exist. So we can turn \nour back on them.\n  I do not understand what has happened to our country. I do not \nunderstand what we believe about our obligations to one another or our \nvalues when we would do that to our fellow citizens. I also do not know \nwhat universe some people are inhabiting because none of us knows what \nis going to happen tomorrow. Not a single one of us can predict when we \nmight need help, when we might have that accident, when we might get \nthat terrible diagnosis. We do not know.\n  I thought the golden rule was the overriding philosophy that should \nguide us, but unfortunately in this bill that stands for an insurance \ncompany that is going to get billions of dollars for the unproven \nconcept of health savings accounts. That is not what I learned in \nSunday school but what somebody else figured out how to make some money \noff of.\n  It is a sad story, but I have a lot of confidence in the intelligence \nof Americans and particularly for the generation that lived through the \nGreat Depression and World War II. I am about to yield the floor to one \nof them. He is someone I admire and think so highly of, who had a lot \nof blessings in his life and never forgot where he came from. He never \nturned his back on people who were less fortunate than he was because \nhe knew the basic lesson that I think some people forget--there but for \nthe grace of God go I.\n  If that were our hallmark, we would not be passing this bill, which \nputs so many of our seniors at risk, but even more than that puts at \nrisk what we mean when we talk about America and American values.\n  I yield to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank my colleague from New York for her eloquent \nstatement and her perception about what is really taking place in front \nof us. We both have the good fortune to share one of the most \ninteresting areas of this country, the center for finance, industry, \nand trade, and people, yes, who have to work hard to maintain their \nliving in this high cost area that we share.\n  One of the problems we see in both of our States is that unemployment \nis unreasonably high; that people who used to work in manufacturing in \nthe New York City region, in New Jersey, have lost jobs that are not \navailable to be regained. It is a pity, but what has happened is that \nthey were sold out to cheaper prices. We are looking for things cheaper \nwhile many of us revel in the fact we can live by such luxurious \nstandards.\n  What does it tell us? It tells us there is a significant imbalance \nout there in the way people earn their livings, live their lives. That \nis one of the things that is so much in our view today when we talk \nabout the outcome of the vote thus far on this purported Medicare bill. \nIt does not have the ``care'' and I am not sure it even has the \ninterest.\n  One of the things we are looking at is whether or not people who have \nhad the good fortune, as I have--as said by the Senator from New York, \nI have had very good fortune. My father died when he was 43. His father \ndied when he was in his middle fifties. His brother died when he was in \nhis early fifties. I think the cause of death was probably \noccupational. They all worked in the same factories in the city of \nPatterson, NJ, where I was born. My father's death left a permanent \nimprint on me because of the circumstances of how and when it occurred.\n  My father was 43 in the year 1943. He lived his life by the \nhealthiest of standards, including the food that he ate. He disavowed \nsmoking in a very vigorous way. He was not someone who drank a lot of \ncoffee. In fact, he did not drink any coffee. He enjoyed his nonworking \ntime by being in a gymnasium. They did not call it ``workout'' then. \nThey called it exercise. They called it the ``gym.''\n  So he would spend time down there. He used to like to lift weights, \nwrestle, and play basketball. One day, he was not feeling well and he \nwent to a doctor. The doctor informed our family that my father had \ncolon cancer, a condition that gets ever rarer with the medical care we \nhave today, if it can be afforded. No matter what we did, without the \nadvances that we have today and medical technology and medicines, he \nsuffered for 13 months. From a well built, muscular man, who was a \npicture of health to behold, he disintegrated before our very eyes \nuntil he died 13 months later.\n  My mother was 36 when my father died. She was a very young widow. I \nwas 18. I had already enlisted in the Army. Why this story? Because it \nis seared so deeply in my memory. Not only were we grieving, we were \npoor, and my mother strained to make a living as my father was in his \nillness. I had a job loading trucks. That was my skill. That was my \nexperience. We just about kept ends together.\n  When my father died, imagine a family of four--I had a little sister \nwho was 12--grieving over the loss of a father at age 43, so young, and \nalso at the same time worrying about bills that had to be paid, about \nobligations that occurred as a result of hospital treatment, bills that \noccurred because of doctors' visits, bills that we had to pay because \nwe owed pharmacists money. That is what I remember. I thought, oh, my \ngoodness, if only we could find the money to pay the bills so my mother \nand I didn't have to worry so much about our existence and at the same \ntime honor our obligations. We were that kind of a family.\n\n  Then, as time passed, we saw developments in America that made us all \nproud and that, frankly, I think should have caused us in this body to \nbe more tender, to be more understanding, to be more sensitive to the \npeople who have been able to live long enough to be eligible for \nMedicare and Social Security and all of that that is intended to reward \npeople for their work to build this country. Many of these people come \nfrom what has been described as the greatest generation. If they \nweren't exactly in that generation, they were in the generation that \ncontinued to build our country through the 20th century\n\n[[Page S15717]]\n\nto make this a stronghold of industry and business and technology and \neducation. That is what these people did who are now concerned about \nhow they continue their life.\n  Oh, of course, a lot of them can get jobs if they want them at school \ncrossings, at $5.50 an hour, $206 a week--have a good time, go to a \nrestaurant and have dinner. Not on your life.\n  That is what should have been thought about as we debated this issue. \nThere was a certain degree, I saw, of smugness, as they pirated votes, \ngiving lots of money--$11 billion, $12 billion to a special interest \nhere, special interest there, here a special interest, there a special \ninterest. It reminds me of a nursery rhyme. But that was no game that \nwas being played. They held open the vote in the House of \nRepresentatives way beyond the rules. They did anything they could to \nbypass the process as it was normally.\n  I wish to show those who can see what I am holding, if I have the \nstrength to hold them--I do. Those who witness this stack, who see it, \nthis pile of paper, may say: What is the Senator talking about? This \ndescribes what was in this Medicare proposal in which the Democrats \nwere not invited to participate. That is against the rules. The \nparticipation was limited. This was a stealth affair: Sneak it out, get \nit out there. Why? Because they don't want people to know what is in \nhere.\n  Do you know what else? Here is a little smaller part of this whole \npackage. This says: ``Joint Explanatory Statement.'' This tells the \naudience who might read this what is really in this stack here. It is \nall mysterious. It is all arcane--can't really understand what is \nhappening.\n  Why is this debate so acerbic? Why is it that those of us, along with \nthe senior citizens of this country, look as if we are losing this \ndebate? It looks as if we are going to lose control of this issue. It \nis true, that we will have suffered a day in infamy, to steal an \nexpression, because what happens here is we are going to assess poor \npeople more costs.\n  I come from the corporate sector. I was fortunate to be able to \ncreate one of America's great companies with two other young fellows \nwho lived in the same area as I did. Both of them, like me, had fathers \nwho worked in the silk mills. That was the trade in the city in which \nwe lived. They had no money. Their parents had no education. But it \ngave them the incentive to create something for themselves.\n  So we created a company. The company is called ADP. A lot of people \nknow it. It is an international company with 40,000 employees. We \nstarted with nothing.\n\n  One of the things I learned as the CEO and chairman of that company, \nbefore I came to the Senate, was that the most important asset my \ncompany had was not its customers. The most important asset we had was \nits employees, because if the employees did their job, the customers \nwere there for us. We could render a service that was an invaluable \nbeginning to outsourcing, to giving specialists opportunities to do \njobs that they could best do. But one of the things we had to do was to \nmake sure the employees were considered in everything we did, including \nhealth insurance, including an early start with daycare, to make \ncertain our employees were happy and thus productive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could interrupt the distinguished \nSenator from New Jersey, I have a unanimous consent I would like to \npropound.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I am happy to yield, with the proviso that I regain \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, pursuant to the rule, Senator Daschle has \ndesignated me the manager in opposition. Senator Levin is on the floor. \nSenator Akaka is on the floor. Pursuant to the rules, they have asked \nthat I be given their 1 hour postcloture. They are both on the floor. \nIs that sufficient?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senators have that right under the rule. \nIs that the will of the Senators?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I do ask unanimous consent that the hour \nwhich I might be entitled to under the postcloture rules be yielded to \nSenator Reid.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I yield my time to Senator Reid.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, through the Chair to the distinguished \nSenator from New Jersey, thank you very much for allowing me to \nproceed.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I assume the time that would have been credited to me \nfor my 1 hour, whatever time remains, is still available.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Chair.\n  What I got today was a request from one of America's largest \ncompanies. I will not identify them because they are not unique. But \nthey wanted us to pass this bill. They don't make pharmaceuticals; they \ndon't do anything in the health care field; they are not an HMO. They \nare a manufacturing company, a gigantic company by any standards. They \nare hoping we are going to pass this bill.\n  The reason they are hoping we would pass it is because then those \nretirees who are dependent on their health care continuation could be \nkicked off the system. Then, because of what we are saying in this \nbill--this hocus-pocus language that there will be some money to \nprovide premium support for HMOs--go there and you will be able to get \nit cheaper, and this giant company, this unnamed giant company will be \nable to say: Whew, we are finally rid of those retirees who we promised \nwe would give this care to all those years they worked for us. But now \nwe don't have to keep that promise--no. All we have to do is say \ngoodbye, thank you, we are eliminating coverage.\n  In New Jersey, it means that about 90,000 people are likely to lose \ntheir company-provided health care.\n  Coming from a State as I do--a State often called ``the Medicine \nChest;'' it is a great State--we produce terrific products that make \npeople feel better and help them live longer. I know because I use a \ncouple of their products here and there. But the entire debate here is \nthe result of the irrefutable fact that prescription drugs cost too \nmuch in this country. This bill doesn't do anything to fix that \nfundamental problem. All over the world, people pay less money for the \nexact same prescription drugs that they can buy cheaper in other \ncountries.\n  In Italy, Acoplex is 40 percent less than here in the United States. \nIn England, it is 31 percent less than here in the United States. And \njust to the north of us, our friendly neighbor, Canada, the price is 37 \npercent less.\n  No wonder seniors are getting on buses and making the trip to Canada \nto get their medication.\n  If you look at the things that we talk about, and see what happens \nwhen prices are not negotiated, the prices keep rising. From 2001 to \n2002, drug prices rose 17 percent. The only way to lower drug prices is \nto give Medicare bargaining power--just the opposite of what this bill \ndoes. This bill says they want to prohibit giving what is normally \ncalled volume discounts. Instead of taking this step to lower prices, \nthis bill explicitly forbids it.\n  The company I was talking about with a health plan has over 1 million \nemployees. They want us to pass this bill. Imagine what happens when \nthey say to their retired employees that they will be off their health \ncare system.\n  We know from experience that allowing agencies to use bargaining \npower brings down prices. A good example of this is the health care \nsystem run by the Veterans' Administration. The VA is encouraged to \nnegotiate prices. In this bill, as it presently exists, they forbid \nMedicare to negotiate prices.\n  I want to follow up on a point that our friend and colleague, Senator \nBob Graham, made earlier today. This chart really tells the story. The \nchart compares VA-negotiated prices for medication with what it costs \nto buy from a local pharmacy.\n  By way of example, Acoplex, a stomach acid product, in the drugstore \nit is $4.37. At the VA it is 22 cents.\n  Let us take a product such as Zocor, to guard against high \ncholesterol which is very damaging to one's heart. If you want to buy \nit in the drugstore, you have to pay $3.77 per tablet, and if you are a \nmember of the VA, their price is 66 cents. The list goes on.\n\n[[Page S15718]]\n\n  At the drugstore for aspirin at 325 milligrams, the cost is 20 cents. \nIf you buy it in the VA, it costs a penny.\n  Plavix to guard against heart attack and strokes, $3.63 per tablet; \n$2.01 if you go to the VA.\n  The list goes on with even better known products. The price \ncomparison is ugly at best when you consider what happens with people \non Medicare.\n  Mevacor reduces cholesterol--four bucks in the pharmacy and 26 cents \nat the VA.\n  Many of these medications make the top 50 list of drugs used by the \nelderly. We ought to learn from that and not prohibit the VA from \nnegotiating volume prices.\n  Another troubling part in this bill is the effective date. When the \nSenate first voted on a prescription drug benefit for seniors back in \nJune, I offered an amendment to make this benefit effective within 1 \nyear. But it was voted down with strong Republican assistance. Eleven \nvotes made the difference. We passed that amendment with bipartisan \neffectiveness to make this benefit effective within 1 year.\n\n  Under this conference report, the drug coverage doesn't start until \nJanuary 2006, 23 months from now.\n  We have to ask the question: Why is this taking so long? One clue is \nillustrated on this chart. Notice election day in the yellow box; the \noriginal Medicare Program was processed in 11 months. President Johnson \nsigned the law on July 30, 1965, and 11 months later, July 1, 1966, all \nof the people who were eligible for the program were enrolled in the \nprogram. I know something about computer processing. I literally had my \ncareer grow in the computer development stage. They had to create the \nfiles. The identification had to be punched into cards. They weren't \nread electronically in 1965 as they are now. It took 11 months and the \nwhole deal was done. It was created from the beginning in 11 months.\n  Now we are asking for a toleration of 25 months to get it into place. \nBut election day is here, and Heaven forbid that the public at large \nshould find out about this bill. When they learn about it, they are \ngoing to be mad as could be.\n  If they can get safely past election day, the rhetoric is out there \nflooding the country. They even have the American Association of \nRetired Persons supporting the bill. That is a mystery that we are \ngoing to have to find out about one day. A lot of people we get calls \nfrom--Medicare recipients and beneficiaries--are ripping up their \ncards. We got one batch that was 75 to 2 against the bill. There were \ntwo who were doctors also who are concerned about whether they will be \nable to continue their practice as it was. It is a reasonable question. \nBut 75 to 2--that is while this bill is being discussed. The bill is \nnot yet in place.\n  Once the phone calls start coming into my office, I know what is \ngoing to happen. They are going to ask: When can we sign up? What are \nthe benefits?\n  We are going to say: Hold your horses. What is the rush? It costs you \na lot of money later on. Right now, we have your temper down. Not so \nmuch your temperature but your temper is going to go up once you find \nout after election day that this bill is going to take place with \nhigher prices for medical care and prescription drugs.\n  The Democrats created Medicare. We protected it for decades. The \nRepublicans never really liked it. They resisted the creation of \nMedicare and have opposed it ever since.\n  It wasn't too long ago that a very well known leader of the House, \nNewt Gingrich, expressed his desire to see ``Medicare wither on the \nvine.'' That is what he wanted to see happen. He represented a view \nthat was generally accepted.\n  We may see it wither but not without a strong fight on our hands, \neven if we have lost step 1 here. The senior citizen population in this \ncountry has to raise the alarm and shout it out to those who are in \nthis building and those who are in the House of Representatives. Tell \nthem: We don't like that bill. It is going to cost us more. You are not \nhelping us, you are hurting us. We worked our lives away with certain \npromises in place, and the promise included a proposition that said as \nyou get older and as we see things develop, we are going to help you \nget those things to keep your health going.\n  The bill before us today is the first major step toward \ndisintegration of Medicare as we know it.\n  In reality, this bill is not as much a benefit for seniors as it is a \nbig benefit for HMOs, the private health care organizations, and other \nprivate-sector special interests who want to tear the Medicare Program \nto pieces. Get them in corporate hands so we can charge more, make \nmore. I wonder whether we could limit the incomes of some of the guys \nat the top of these companies, in the interest of public service? We \nregulate lots of industry.\n  So what is it specifically the President is afraid seniors will find \nout before 2006? Is the President afraid the seniors will realize they \nwill pay at least $810 before they break even and get any benefit from \nthis plan? For many seniors, that is more money than they currently \nspend on prescription drugs. Up to 30 percent of the beneficiaries \nwould pay more for enrolling in the plan than they would receive in \nactual benefits. Is the White House worried seniors will learn there is \na huge gap in coverage? Under this plan, a senior will pay a premium \nestimated at $35 a month, a $250 deductible, 25 percent coinsurance \npayments until reaching $2,250 in drug expenses.\n  What happens then? Seniors then get no coverage. I have been heard \ncorrectly: Zero coverage. At that point, seniors continue to pay their \npremiums but they will also pay 100 percent of their drug costs. That \nis a double whammy, as we say in New Jersey. Only until they have \nreached a catastrophic limit of $5,100 in drug costs does any benefit \nrestart. By that time, seniors will have incurred $3,600 in out-of-\npocket spending. This is the so-called hole in the donut. It does not \nsound like a good deal to me.\n  Remember, nowhere in the bill does it say that premiums will be only \n$35. It could be significantly higher. The $35 is a current estimate. \nWe know how good this administration has been at making estimates. Is \nthe President afraid that seniors will figure all this out? You bet. \nSeniors deserve a much better program than that which the Senate is \nconsidering right now. They certainly deserve it before 2006.\n  I will spend a few minutes more talking about the overall impact of \nthis bill on seniors in the State I represent, New Jersey. The most \nimportant reason I am voting against this bill is I am convinced more \nseniors in my State will be hurt by this legislation than helped. There \nare approximately 1.1 million seniors in New Jersey. Because this bill \nprovides a disincentive to employers to continue offering coverage to \nretirees, it is estimated that over 90,000 seniors in New Jersey will \nlose their existing, more generous retiree drug coverage from their \nformer employer.\n  This bill is also going to make poor seniors in my State worse off. \nIn New Jersey, Medicaid covers drug costs for seniors with incomes of \nless then $9,000 a year for an individual or $12,000 a year for a \ncouple. In New Jersey, low-income seniors currently on Medicaid have \naccess to whatever drugs they need and they do not have a copay for \ntheir prescription. Under this bill, however, they are now going to pay \n$1 per prescription for generic drugs and $3 per prescription for brand \nname drugs.\n  Low-income seniors tend to be in the worst health and have higher \nannual drug spending. A senior with $8,000 annual income does not have \nthe discretionary income to shell out $15 or $20 or $25 for the \nprescriptions he or she may need.\n  I will long remember the battles we have had in the Senate to try to \nraise the minimum wage. It is the old rhyme that says: Try, try again. \nWe tried, we tried, and we tried, but we could not raise it. So there \nare people out there who are working for $5.15 an hour, $206 a week. \nHaving to pay these extra burdens for their prescription drugs is going \nto be a torturous outcome for them. The low-income Americans can be \nforced to choose between providing medication or buying food, providing \nmedication or keeping the heat on in the winter.\n  This bill represents an enormous opportunity squandered. We had a \nreal chance to do something right. We had $4 billion to improve the \nlives of 34 million seniors, 14 million of whom do not have any \nprescription drug coverage right now. Frankly, we missed the \nopportunity. We ought to scrap this plan and go back to the drawing \nboard to give seniors a real prescription drug\n\n[[Page S15719]]\n\nbenefit in the Medicare Program. Let's not try to move seniors into \nHMOs. Let's not leave that enormous gap in coverage. We should give \nseniors a plan that starts now, not in 2006.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, let me first of all commend my colleague \nfrom New Jersey for a very fine statement on the pending matter, the \nMedicare bill. I intend to take some time to speak on the same matter \nand then I plan to yield my remaining time to the Democratic leader for \nhis purposes.\n  This is the third time I have spoken on this matter since last \nFriday. We are now in a situation, I am sure people are aware, where we \nhave had a cloture motion which was approved earlier today. We then \nconsidered a point of order which was not sustained, and as a result \nour efforts to try to use a procedural move short of final passage have \nbeen, I gather, exhausted. So we are down now to the question of \nwhether or not we ought to vote for this bill at this juncture or \nwhether or not people will come to the conclusion there are enough \nflaws in the pending matter that we ought to take some additional time \nto review it before it becomes the law of the land.\n  Before I get into some discussion of the substance of the bill, I \nwill take a minute or so and talk about the process of law. Putting \naside the matter before the Senate, which has obviously been \ncontentious, I am very worried about how we are doing our work in this \ninstitution--not just this body but the legislative branch in general.\n  I will have served, at the end of this term, some 30 years in the \nCongress, 6 years in the other body and 24 years in the Senate. I have \nenjoyed serving in this fine institution and watched it carefully over \nthe years. In that time, I have noticed that there are ebbs and flows \nin how the institution functions and operates. There have been periods \naffectionately referred to as the golden age of the Senate and other \ntimes when they have been less than golden. I will not use language to \ndescribe what others have used to describe the less than golden periods \nof the Senate.\n  I am very worried about how we are proceeding at this time with the \nunderlying measure. It is so important in these institutions that we \nnot only just be concerned about what we accomplish but how we go about \nworking toward these accomplishments.\n  The Founding Fathers of this country were very concerned about that. \nIf they were looking for efficiencies of systems, if they were looking \nfor a process that would guarantee quick results overnight, this is \ncertainly the last system they would have constructed. Particularly in \nthis institution, the Senate, the rights of a minority are paramount. \nWe have always said in the other body, the House Chamber, the rights of \nthe majority should prevail. And the Founders, in their wisdom then, in \nthe creation of the Senate, emphasized the rights of a minority. In so \ndoing, they wanted to guarantee that matters would be thoughtfully \ndeliberated.\n  I am very worried, over these last number of months, including the \nbill presently before the Senate, that we are not devoting the time \nnecessary for deliberate consideration of matters before this body. In \nfact, I was stunned to just learn that when conferees were named on the \nMedicare bill before us--and for those who are not students of this \ninstitution or follow the Congress on a regular basis, when the Senate \npasses a bill, and the House passes a bill, invariably, with some \nexceptions, there are differences.\n\n  So this body, the Senate, will appoint conferees, representatives of \nthis body--usually from the committees of jurisdiction over the \nlegislation--to meet with conferees of the other body, usually coming \nfrom their committees of jurisdiction. And those two smaller groups \nthen meet to resolve the differences between the two bills.\n  Over the years, of course, many conferences have been lengthy, many \nhave been contentious, particularly those involving difficult matters, \nbut it is the nature of the institution, learned over our 220-year \nexperience that it is in the tension of debate that some of the best \nideas emerge, when there is full expression of the views of the \nAmerican public in those meetings, when people of different persuasions \nand ideologies come together and work to resolve their differences.\n  What I find stunning is that it has become popular, in recent days, \nto have conferees named and then have conferees excluded from meeting \nin these conference committees. That is exactly what happened here with \nthe measure presently before us. Whether you are a Republican or \nDemocrat, liberal, conservative, or moderate, you ought to be deeply \nconcerned if this becomes the precedent, the operating standard \nprocedure, that when bills are passed and conferees are named, then \npeople are excluded from meeting to try to resolve their differences.\n  I can only suspect, Mr. President, that most Americans are not aware \nthat this 675-page bill, the Medicare reform bill, was crafted by only \nRepublican Members of the House of Representatives. There was not a \nsingle Democratic Member of the House of Representatives from the Ways \nand Means Committee included in the room to write this bill--not one--\ndespite the fact that the House is controlled by Republicans by only a \nsmall majority. Yet not one member of the minority party of the House \nof Representatives was brought into the room to sit down when the \nconferees met to resolve their differences on this bill. And out of \nthis body, only two conferees from the minority side were included, \ndespite the fact that only one Member separates us. Senator Daschle and \nSenator Rockefeller, duly appointed as conferees, were excluded from \nmeeting. In fact, Senator Daschle, the Democratic Leader of the Senate, \nwas excluded from the conference on this important measure. To say to \nthe Democratic leader, the minority leader of the Senate, and to \nSenator Rockefeller, two senior members of the Senate Finance \nCommittee: You are not allowed to come into the room to help draft a \npiece of legislation dealing with 41 million Americans, Medicare \nbeneficiaries, to frame a prescription drug benefit. I am stunned, Mr. \nPresident, that a 675-page bill, on as an important a matter as the \nhealthcare of nearly 41 million elderly Americans, that not a single \nDemocratic Member of the House, and only two members of the Senate \nFinance Committee already supportive of this bill could meet to craft \nthe bill before us. I find it breathtaking that the process was so \nflawed in the development of this bill that Members of our own \nrespective Chambers were not allowed to come in and work to resolve \ndifferences on matters as important as this.\n  Then, in the House of Representatives on Friday evening and well into \nSaturday morning, when the vote was being cast on the final passage of \nthis bill, we witnessed a historic moment as the House held open for \nalmost three full hours--the longest recorded vote in the body's \nhistory--a vote that was supposed to take 15 minutes to pass this bill. \nThe Presiding Officer said: There will now be 15 minutes to record your \nvotes by electronic device. Having served in the House of \nRepresentatives when electronic balloting came into place, I heard that \nmessage over and over again: Members will have 15 minutes in which time \nthey can record their ballots by electronic device. And almost 3 hours \nlater, that ``15 minutes'' elapsed, as every possible bit of arm \ntwisting, every possible maneuver you could make to change the outcome \nof that vote transpired. I believe that this vote constitutes one of \nthe worst moments I can think of in the conduct of the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Then, when several other members of the minority decided they would \nchange their votes in light of the arm twisting and in light of the \nfinal outcome, the gavel came down within a nanosecond, and the \ntraditional opportunity given to Members to change their votes before a \nfinal vote is recorded was denied them.\n\n  I am stunned as I watch a process around here so deteriorated that it \nhas come to this. And I say to my friends on the other side: Beware. \nThe wheel does turn. The day will come when we will be in the majority. \nAnd in the House that will happen as well. Changes in leadership have \noccurred throughout our history and they will continue to occur. What \nsort of precedent are we setting if this is how we conduct our \nbusiness?\n\n[[Page S15720]]\n\n  Then, last Thursday, late in the afternoon, those of us who were \nexcluded from having Members who represent our views work on this \nconference report, were delivered this 675-page document.\n  Suffice it to say, there is not a Member here who has read this in \nits entirety, nor could they possibly understand it even if they tried \nto, since last Thursday. Yet we have just voted on several procedural \nmotions here to say that within a matter of hours, we are now going to \nadopt this historic piece of legislation without fully, in my view, \nunderstanding the implications of what is actually contained in the \nbill.\n  Mr. President, a bill of 675 pages, delivered just last Thursday, and \nhere it is, Monday at 6 p.m., and we find ourselves only a few hours \naway from deciding the fate of 41 million Medicare beneficiaries and \ncoming generations of them as to whether or not they will have the \nincredible safety net the Medicare Program has provided for 38 years.\n  These process questions cannot go unnoticed, Mr. President. And while \nwe talk about the implications of what we are told is in this bill, I \nam deeply troubled that the shutting out entirely of Democratic Members \nof the House, the denial of the Democratic leader of the Senate, along \nwith Senator Rockefeller, the ability to meet and discuss this bill and \nits full implications. Further troubling then to witness a 3 hour vote \nin the House of Representatives in the middle of the night, under the \nguise that we must get this done. As my colleagues know full well, this \nis the end of a session, not the end of a Congress, and to not take a \nfew more weeks to analyze what we are doing with this bill, to see if \nthere is not some compromise that can be reached, when you consider the \ngreat implications of this bill, I think is a sad commentary on the \ncondition of the Congress. I have been here for a quarter of a century, \nand I do not recall a time like this in my 24 years where we have come \nto this.\n  So beware. Beware, America. Beware, America, of what happens when \nthis process breaks down, as it has here with this bill.\n  Beware, America, when you have a bill of this magnitude and size \npassed in the wee hours of the morning in one Chamber, and rushed \nthrough the other in a matter of hours of debate and discussion--more a \nlitany of speeches than any real debate.\n  Beware, when almost one-half of the entire Congress is excluded from \nsitting and working on a product as important as this. There is \nsomething wrong when that happens, Mr. President.\n  I don't care what your politics are; I do not care what your ideology \nis. Beware, Americans, when you find out other voices are denied being \nheard. It is the critical quotient, the critical element of what \nconstitutes this democracy: the importance of debate and discussion, \nthe tension the debate brings, and the ultimate improved product that \noccurs when that happens in America.\n  When other voices are not heard, when other ideas are not brought to \nthe table, then we all suffer. That is what has happened in the \nconstruct, if you will, of this legislative package.\n  Let me take a few minutes, if I may, and try to share with my \ncolleagues what I believe is included in this bill. I have talked about \nit to some degree already, and I know, in a sense, why we are being \ncalled on to do this as rapidly as we are. Because based on the time I \nhave spent going over this bill, and looking at it, and others who are \nmore knowledgeable than I am about health care issues, who have \ndedicated almost their entire careers to examining these issues, I \nwould say one of the reasons this is being pushed through as rapidly as \nit is, is there is a lot in this bill that the more you know about it, \nthe less you would like it, and the more opposition would grow to its \npassage. The more people are aware of what is included in these 675 \npages, the greater concern they ought to have.\n  There are those who have never liked the Medicare program, who fought \nagainst its very creation 38 years ago, and since then have been \nseeking an opportunity to undo it.\n  Congratulations to them. Congratulations to them because I think, in \neffect, they have achieved that result with what I think is going to \nhappen in a few hours; that is, the adoption in the Senate of this \nparticular package, the approval already in the House and the \nlikelihood, of course, that the President is going to sign this into \nlaw.\n\n  Then I would tell America, as you get to know this bill, you will \ncome to have greater and greater concerns about it. Let me explain why \nI think that is the case.\n  We have all been talking about--certainly this side of the aisle \nhas--the great need for a prescription drug benefit for years. However, \nI have reservations about the prescription drug benefit contained in \nthis bill. Under this bill, 2.7 million retirees are going to lose \ntheir existing drug benefit package--2.7 million of the 41 million \nMedicare beneficiaries. While some might say that doesn't amount to \nmuch, when combined with the other millions of seniors who are going to \nhave their premiums increased, and possibly their benefits reduced if \nthis bill is to pass, you begin to realize how troubling this bill is. \nThat is literally what is going to happen under this bill. 2.7 million \nretirees are going to lose their present prescription drug coverage.\n  Why? Because they presently are covered under plans offered by their \nprevious employers. They have retired and yet they carry with them \nthose plans. The estimates are that 2.5 million retirees are going to \nlose coverage because their employers are going to drop those plans if \nthe benefit under this bill is enacted.\n  In my State, just to put it in local terms, this will mean that \n39,000 people in Connecticut who fall into that category will lose \ntheir present drug coverage. In Connecticut there are approximately \n515,000 people who are of retirement age, and of that number, I am \ngoing to have 39,000 who are going to be dropped from their \nprescription drug coverage.\n  Further troubling, I am then going to have 74,000 Medicare \nbeneficiaries in my state of Connecticut, and 6.4 million nationwide, \nwho are going to lose as well under this bill. What happens to these \npeople? These are seniors with severely limited incomes, making them \neligible for both Medicare and Medicaid. These senior citizens are \ngoing to face less access to and higher prices for the drugs they need \ndue to this conference agreement requiring drug co-payments and the \ncreation of an assets test.\n  I have heard Members say that the price increases these low income \nseniors will face are not that significant. Well, it isn't much, if you \nmake $158,000 a year as a Senator. A few bucks a month amounts to \nnothing. But if you are a person making $13,000 a year or less, as \nthese people do, and you are on Medicaid and Medicare and you are \nworking each month trying to pay a mortgage, to put food on the table, \nto pay for the other essential needs you have, then believe me, these \ncost increases are terribly hard to bear. We in this body do not have \nsuch worries because we have such a great health care program. Members \nof Congress enjoy a fabulous healthcare plan. We offer nothing like \nthat to the rest of the American public so we don't quite understand \nwhat other people go through in many ways.\n  Taken together--those losing their present prescription drug coverage \nand those low-income beneficiaries facing increased costs--you have one \nfourth of all Medicare beneficiaries negatively effected by this bill. \nThose are, to begin with, some of the concerns we have with what \nhappens to close to 9 million of this nation's nearly 41 million \nretirees.\n  Now let me move to address some of the other issues of concern in \nthis bill. While others have already talked about the prescription drug \nbenefit portion of this bill at length, I want to point out that I am \nworried about certain aspects of this portion of the bill which will \npresent real problems for our seniors. Under the proposed prescription \ndrug benefit, this bill before us contains a gap in coverage, the so-\ncalled donut hole. The donut hole is nearly $2,800, twice the size of \nthe one we adopted when this bill was adopted by the Senate back a \nnumber of months ago. Under the conference report, Medicare \nbeneficiaries with costs within this so-called donut hole will be \nforced to pay for the full cost of their prescribed medicines as well \nas a monthly premium of an estimated $35. This will mean that when your \nprescription drug\n\n[[Page S15721]]\n\nspending falls within this coverage gap that you will receive \nabsolutely no assistance purchasing your prescribed medicines under \nthis bill. To add insult to injury, you're still on the hook for the \nmonthly premiums while receiving no assistance affording your needed \nmedicines.\n\n  Also troubling, Mr. President, is the notion of the monthly premium \nof an estimated $35. Under this conference agreement, if you end up \nhaving only one private plan providing the drug coverage in your area, \nthese plans could charge whatever they want, because the lack of a \nanother competing plan. The $35 figure often cited is not a cap; it is \nthe estimate of what the average may be. There is nothing in this bill \nthat prohibits one of those private plans from charging whatever they \nwant in that area. You would end up being forced to charge whatever \nthese plans determine is their price or not having any drug coverage at \nall.\n  Despite all of the problems with the prescription drug benefit \nportion of this package, even with the concerns I have outlined, I \nwould have supported this portion of the bill if it stood alone as I \nbelieve it offers a first--though not nearly complete--first step \ntoward adding a prescription drug plan under the Medicare program. I \nthink the idea of doing something in this area made some sense. I would \nhave, even with these bad features, supported this legislation in the \nhopes that in the coming years we could have modified it and changed \nit.\n  But something that few people want to talk about on the other side of \nthe package before us are the structural reforms of Medicare contained \nin this bill. The conference report we are considering today is not \njust about prescription drugs. It has a second, much more troubling \npart. It is over this part that most of us who are expressing our \nstrong objections to this bill have found concern. It is this part of \nthe bill that gives us all pause because it is no less, in our view, \nthan an attempt to end Medicare, certainly as we have known it over \nthese past 38 years.\n  I tell America to watch carefully. This is the part on which you want \nto focus. The more you read about it, the more you will draw the same \nconclusion as those of us who are strenuously fighting adoption of this \nbill. It is an attempt to force seniors into private plans, producing \nbillions in profits for HMOs but denying seniors access to the benefits \nto which they have become accustomed and the doctors they trust.\n  This bill provides a $12 billion subsidy to the private companies and \na 9-percent kicker, in effect, to make sure the competition called for \nby this bill is rigged in such a way that they cannot possibly lose in \nthat competition. The supporters of the bill will tell you it is not \nforcing seniors out of traditional Medicare. They claim they are \ncreating competition and, as a result, offering seniors a choice.\n  Let's talk about the so-called competition in this bill and what it \nwould create. Private plans under this conference report will be \nreimbursed at a higher rate than traditional Medicare--9 percent higher \nto be exact. How does Medicare compete when you have a 9-percent higher \nreimbursement for the private insurance plans they are supposed to be \ncompeting against? What kind of a competition is that, when all of a \nsudden you get a 9-percent higher reimbursement rate and claim to have \na level playing field? Additionally, this bill makes available $12 \nbillion to be used to lure private plans into the marketplace. If it is \ngoing to be a competition, let it be a competition--but we are going to \nstick $12 billion into the pockets of the HMOs, give them a 9-percent \nhigher reimbursement rate, and say to Medicare: Go out and compete. \nThat is like tying both hands behind their back and tying their legs \ntogether and then saying go run a race. A 9-percent higher \nreimbursement rate and $12 billion to lure private plans into the \nmarket amounts to the inclusion of a corporate subsidy in this bill of \nmajor significance.\n  Under this plan, private plans can design their benefits to attract \ncertain beneficiaries, and that is a critical piece. These private \nplans can design them to attract wealthier, healthier Medicare \nbeneficiaries. In the beginning, one of the magnificent features of \nMedicare was that we didn't discriminate based on wealth or illness. We \nsaid if you reach the age of 65, we are going to provide a safety net \nfor you. The idea was that regardless of whether or not you are \nhealthy, sicker, wealthy, poor, all are together under Medicare.\n  For the first time--and this is a major change--we are going to start \nto discriminate if this report is adopted. So the wealthier and \nhealthier people are going to join plans designed by the private \ncompanies, leaving in the traditional Medicare program only the sickest \nand the poorest beneficiaries. When this happens, the premium costs are \ngoing to go up and for these seniors, and when they do, they are going \nto face higher costs and reduced benefits. I don't know what other \nconclusion you can draw. You cannot accept the notion that we are \ncreating a level playing field. It is not a balanced competition if I \nprovide you a 9-percent higher reimbursement rate than Medicare gets \nand I then give you an additional $12 billion to lure you into the \nmarket. It is just not.\n  America, pay attention. If you are, today, in the Medicare Program, \nyou could end up watching this program be radically changed. So you end \nup paying higher premiums and watching your benefits be cut and \nwatching only the poorest of the poor or the very sick be left in a \nprogram, as these designer programs created by the private plans will \nfind ways of causing the healthier and wealthier to desert traditional \nMedicare. This is not a fair competition. It is a rigged game. This \nbill stacks the deck against traditional Medicare. The effects are \nself-perpetuating.\n  Traditional Medicare will grow weaker and private plans will grow \nstronger, forcing more beneficiaries out of the traditional program and \ninto the arms of HMOs.\n  It is very easy to get bogged down in the complexities of this bill. \nSo let me state very simply that the weakening of the traditional \nMedicare caused by this 675-page bill is going to force seniors to pay \nmore and face the prospects of fewer benefits.\n  Ironically, this bill will mean less choice for seniors. One of the \nthings we are being told is there is going to be a lot more choice \nunder this agreement. One of the great features of Medicare is that you \nget to choose your doctor. I don't know a single American who doesn't \nlike that feature, who doesn't appreciate the opportunity they have to \nchoose which physician they want to have treat them. Under this 675-\npage bill, that is over with for many seniors. That fact alone ought to \ncause people to pause. Why? Why would you deny people the choice of \nwhich doctor they use, someone they may have dealt with for years? That \nchoice is gone with this bill.\n\n  America, pay attention. It is gone. If this bill gets adopted in the \nnext few hours, that is gone. That is not choice at all. Nothing would \nmake me happier than to find out these predictions are wrong, but they \nare not. I truly hope seniors can retain the choice that they already \nhave and that traditional Medicare survives.\n  Let me explain briefly why I get as passionate as I do about these \nissues, Mr. President. When the Medicare+Choice Program was created and \nthese private plans first came to our communities, many offering zero \npremiums. People joined in droves, jumped from traditional Medicare at \nthe promise of reduced cost and increased benefits. Then, of course, \nonce the plans looked around in certain areas and discovered there \nweren't quite as many wealthier, healthier people in certain areas but \nthere were poor and sicker people, they decided--and they can do this \nat a moment's notice--they said: We are leaving, packing up and getting \nout. They did that in my State. They packed up and left.\n  I remember going to a meeting because the senior Medicare \nbeneficiaries I represent were so upset and concerned about these \ndecisions to leave. I convened a town meeting in Norwich, CT. About \n350, 400 people showed up, and it was on a Saturday morning. They could \nnot believe what happened to them. One individual was so upset about \nhis wife losing her Medicare+Choice plan--a man who served in the U.S. \nNavy in World War II and worked at the Electric Boat Division in \nGroton, CT, for many years. As he spoke passionately about what \nhappened to his wife, being dropped from this program, in his great \nworry and concern about that, he passed away at this meeting. I will \nnever forget it. It was, obviously, a stunning moment for\n\n[[Page S15722]]\n\nthe people there. He was so upset about what happened to him because \nhis wife's HMO left, and she was left with nothing in terms of the \npromised health care coverage. He was a man by the name of Frederick \nKral from eastern Connecticut. I have never forgotten that tragic \nincident and the deeply personal stories shared at this town meeting.\n  I remember how people felt when these HMOs came running in and then \nwalked away. I cannot say that will happen here. I don't know what is \ngoing to happen. We are just playing such a risky game with all of \nthis. Why are we taking these kinds of risks on such an important \nissue? We should realize the tremendous damage we can do to people.\n  I recall very well what happened when we had HMOs promise they were \ngoing to step in and provide choice and do all these wonderful things. \nRemember, these are companies that have to make money and they want, as \ntheir customer base, healthy people. They would like wealthier people \nbecause then they don't have to pay out as deep a benefit. When these \nplans discover people are not quite as wealthy and healthy, then they \ndesign plans that exclude them. My fear is that will happen here.\n  Even more ironic is this highly unfair system is being championed by \nthe self-proclaimed champions of free enterprise.\n  The bill, as I mentioned, will provide $12 billion to help HMOs \nunfairly compete against traditional Medicare, along with a 9 percent \nhigher reimbursement rate. It does nothing to control drug prices. If \nwe really want to do something to promote competition under this plan, \nwouldn't you think we might have allowed the purchasing power of nearly \n41 million Americans to achieve lower prices for prescribed medicines?\n  That is what we allow with veterans hospitals. The veterans hospitals \ncollectively get together and negotiate with the drug companies for the \nbest price. If you are a veteran in the country, you get a much reduced \ncost of prescription drugs because the VA has negotiated these prices \non your behalf.\n  As my friend from Florida, Senator Bob Graham, so eloquently \ndescribed earlier today--what do you say to two people who walk in--a \nhusband, who is a veteran of the Korean war, who is paying one price \nfor drugs because as a veteran the VA has negotiated a lower price, and \nhis wife who stayed home and raised a family and maybe held down \nanother job during that time? She is not a veteran, but she is on the \nsame drug as her husband and she pays two, three, four times what he \npays. How do you explain that to people?\n  Why can we not do in this bill what we have done in the VA? This 675-\npage bill specifically prohibits the Medicare program to negotiate for \nlower drug prices. How is this representative of free market \nprinciples?\n  On the other hand, we are being told that we ought to have \ncompetition between private plans and Medicare. When it comes to \nnegotiating for lower prices for prescription drugs, this law \ncategorically prohibits the Federal Government from doing so. It is OK \nfor the VA, and I applaud them for doing that, but it is not OK for \nMedicare. Yet we are told this is supposed to provide a fair \ncompetition.\n  The reason, of course, for all of this is simple: The champions of \nfree enterprise know private plans cannot compete with traditional \nMedicare on a level playing field. The subsidies are absolutely \nnecessary because Medicare is actually more efficient. Medicare \ndelivers services at a lower cost. That isn't one Senator's conclusion. \nThose who have examined this program from top to bottom, in every \ndifferent manner, say Medicare is a very efficient program. And it \ndelivers terrific services at a much lower cost than private plans, and \nwe are about to walk away from that with the adoption of this bill.\n  We are going to go off now and take 41 million Americans and make \nthem guinea pigs, despite the fact the system works. There is that old \nexpression: If the wheel ain't broke, don't fix it. This wheel is \nworking well--the Medicare wheel.\n  I am afraid we can only conclude one thing: The architects of this \nbill are going to spend billions and billions of taxpayers' money not \nto reform Medicare, but to dismantle it, to push patients out so that \nit will, indeed, wither on the vine.\n  I remember so well when the former Speaker of the House, Newt \nGingrich, speaking in front of a group of people here in Washington, a \ngroup of lobbyists from the health care industry, talked about Medicare \nwithering on the vine. I heard the other day Mr. Gingrich, no longer a \nMember of Congress, showed up at the House Republican caucus and gave a \nstrong pitch for this bill: It is a great bill, according to the man \nwho wanted to make Medicare wither on the vine. Either he had a great \nconversion on the road to Damascus, along the lines of St. Paul, or he \nstill believes what he did a few years ago, and he is finally going to \nbe able to achieve what he talked about doing then.\n  I suspect it is more the latter than the former. I have seen no \nevidence that there has been a change of heart by Mr. Gingrich in his \nviews about Medicare. So the individual who promised you we are going \nto let this tremendously-successful program wither on the vine is now \napplauding the fact we are going to finally achieve what he suggested a \nfew years ago.\n  I predict we will be back, unfortunately, at great cost to the \nAmerican taxpayers and at great cost to older Americans. We will be \nback in this Chamber rewriting this bill. That much I will guarantee \nwill happen.\n  Unfortunately, we will squander billions of dollars unnecessarily. We \nwill put a lot of people who shouldn't have to go through this, given \ntheir age and the problems they face--older Americans shouldn't have to \ngo through the added frustrations and anxieties and wonder every day, \nas millions of them do, about how they are going to pay for the \nhealthcare needs they have. They are going to have to go through this \nwringer because there are people around here who just never could stand \nMedicare and have been looking for ways to undo it since its inception.\n\n  This part of this bill, these structural changes to Medicare, if they \nwere to offered before this Chamber as a sole proposition, I don't \nthink would get 15 or 20 votes, but because they have been linked \ninexorably to the prescription drug benefit, the bill will pass.\n  As I mentioned at the outset of these remarks, the prescription drug \nbenefit, while it is flawed, in my view, is worthy of support, despite \nthe objections I have to certain parts of it. But it is not so good, in \nmy view, that it ought to override the great damage to the Medicare \nprogram that will be caused by this bill.\n  Allow me to express my concerns about another provision. The \nconference agreement before us today establishes the dangerous \nprecedent of instituting so-called cost containment measures that could \ndirectly lead to service cuts in what Medicare covers and just-as-\nsevere increases in costs to Medicare beneficiaries.\n  Specifically, the conference report calls on the Congress and the \nadministration to address Medicare's costs when general revenue \nspending on Medicare reaches 45 percent of the program's total cost. \nLet me read that again. Specifically, this conference report, calls on \nCongress and the administration to address Medicare's costs when \ngeneral revenue spending on Medicare reaches 45 percent of the \nprogram's total cost.\n  Does anyone in this Chamber know of any other Federal program that \nhas a similar provision in it, when we pay for anything else you can \nthink of, when 45 percent of the cost comes out of general revenues, \nthat we must take enact cost containment measures? Only Medicare; there \nis no other Federal program that has similar handcuffs on it that \nMedicare does under this bill: It states that when you reach 45 percent \ncoming out of general revenues, then cost containment measures must be \ntaken.\n  The adoption of this purely arbitrary cap will lead to almost certain \nerosion of this critical program's scope of coverage and affordability. \nIt is yet another attempt of opponents of Medicare to destroy this \nprogram that so many of our senior citizens rely on every day.\n  Today, after nearly 40 years of Medicare's inception, we find \nourselves truly at a crossroads. The opportunity is before us to move \nMedicare toward the future without threatening its proven availability, \nto provide for the health and well-being of this Nation's\n\n[[Page S15723]]\n\nseniors citizens. Sadly, the conference agreement represents an \nopportunity lost, an opportunity not only to add comprehensive coverage \nfor prescribed medicines under the Medicare Program, but also an \nopportunity to strengthen the Medicare Program for future generations.\n  So it is with a great deal of sadness that I find myself faced with \nthis 675-page document. The entire House minority was not allowed in \nthe room on this bill. There were secret meetings of the conference \ncommittee that crafted this agreement--I am not making this up--\nclandestine meetings so no one could find out where they were meeting. \nNot a single representative of the minority in the House was allowed to \nsit in and help craft this bill affecting 41 million Americans--and all \nbut only two members of the minority on this side were excluded as well \nfrom these deliberations. The Democratic leader, a member of the \nFinance Committee, was told he had no right to go to the meetings. In \nfact, the chairman of the committee said: If the Democratic leader \nshows up, then the meeting will be canceled.\n  What kind of arrogance is that? The chosen leader of a minority of \nthis body was told if he shows up as a member of the conference \ncommittee, the House chairman of this conference would close down the \nmeeting and walk out.\n  This process is broken, Mr President. How much confidence can America \nhave in a product that in the construct of these 675 pages, minority \nviews were almost totally excluded.\n  I warn my colleagues, a dangerous precedent is set when a bill of \nthis significance is crafted in the manner of the bill before us. This \nbill before us affects not just those who are direct recipients of \nMedicare. Think what Medicare has meant to the children and \ngrandchildren of its beneficiaries. Think what costs would have had to \nhave been borne by children trying to raise their own children while \nthey were taking care of their parents had it not been for Medicare.\n  How many college educations would not have been achieved if the \nfamilies were forced to choose between making sure that mom and dad \ncould see a doctor or their children might go on to college? That is \nnot hypothetical at all. Think how many people's dreams of home \nownership, making investments in things families need, were made \npossible because there was a program called Medicare. It said to \nAmericans: You have given so much, particularly the generation that Tom \nBrokaw has called the greatest in our history, that carried us through \na Depression, through World War II and Korea, that after all of that, \nwe said to them, look, we are going to create a program that makes it \npossible for you and your families not to have to face poverty or worse \nwhen you face expenses for needed medical attention.\n  Despite the fact the program works well, has been efficient, and \nproduces services at low cost, we are about to enter a casino, under \nthe best of circumstances, and start playing roulette with people's \nhealth care and with the costs associated with it. That is why I am so \nsaddened by the emergence of this conference report.\n  The process has broken down. This is a product in which one can have \nlittle or no confidence. I am being asked as one Member, with only 3 or \n4 days to review this product, to agree to sign on to something of this \nmagnitude. There is an opportunity, I think, to get this right and to \nmake this better. We owe it to the people of this country to seize this \nopportunty.\n  Older Americans are not Democrats or Republicans. They are not \nconservatives or liberals. They are just hard-working people. The least \nthey deserve is to have a Medicare Program they do not have to worry \nabout. They need a comprehensive prescription drug benefit so they do \nnot have to make choices between the medicines they need and the food \nthey must have or the heat they must purchase to warm their homes.\n  We should be able to find a way to achieve that. I am deeply saddened \nthat we have not achieved that goal with this conference report. After \nall of the reasons I have laid out, I will vote against this bill and I \nurge my colleagues to do likewise.\n  I deeply regret we did not prevail on opposing cloture or on the \npoint of order that was raised so that we might have been able to go \nback and work on this again and come back in January with a better \nproduct. This is not the end of this Congress, it is only the end of a \nsession. Yet every effort is being made to see to it that we jam this \nflawed bill down the throat of America.\n  We will be back; unfortunately, at great cost to the Treasury, and at \ngreat cost to the well-being of an awful lot of people who deserve \nbetter than they are going to get through the adoption of this bill, in \norder to fix this bill. I truly wish this were not the case.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and designate the Democratic \nleader as the beneficiary of any time I may have remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. DODD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today by a 2-vote margin, I guess it was, \nthe Senate, this greatest deliberative body in the world, decided to \nbegin the process of ending Medicare in America. After nearly 40 years \nin which the elderly in our country have been raised out of poverty, in \nwhich the elderly in our country have been given the assurances that \nthey will not have to go to the poor farm to pay for medical care, \nafter nearly 40 years of children being freed from the burden of caring \nfor ailing parents and grandparents, after providing an envy of the \nworld in what we do to care for our elderly in terms of health care, \nthe Senate today began the process of turning our back on all the \nprogress we have made. Medicare was created, as I said, almost 40 years \nago, with the purpose of providing our Nation's aged and disabled with \nthat safety net, to protect them from death and destitution.\n  For years, seniors have counted on health security in their golden \nyears thanks to Medicare. For nearly 40 years, this program has stood \nas a social contract between the American Government and the American \npeople. After a lifetime of labor, when a person turns 65 they are \npromised health insurance covering doctors' visits, hospitals, and many \nother health costs. There was one exception for all of those 40 years; \nthat is, there was no coverage for prescription drugs. It is almost \nimpossible to overstate what Medicare means to a family, a citizen of \nmodest means who has worked hard for a lifetime, a person who does not \nwant to be a burden on the rest of his or her family. Medicare has been \na rock solid, reliable, guaranteed lifeline for America's senior \ncitizens.\n\n  Today, with a two-vote margin, we are watching that social contract \nerode. We are taking huge risks with the health and security of \nseniors, all to satisfy ideological agendas, to satisfy big political \ndonor's wishes and certain political strategies.\n  With this Medicare bill, we have seen grave abuses of power--such as \nthe recent vote in the House of Representatives in which this bill \nbefore us today lost in the House of Representatives, lost under the \nnormal rules, lost under the democratic means over there. But as you \nknow, they kept the vote open for almost 3 hours, from about 3 a.m. to \n6 a.m., to twist arms until they finally got the votes.\n  I was driving to work Saturday morning. I was listening to public \nradio. A caller had called in and she said President Bush says he wants \nto bring democracy to Iraq. After what happened last night in the House \nof Representatives, I hope Iraq wasn't watching. That is not the kind \nof democracy they need in Iraq.\n  I am disappointed in the process that we have had here. This has been \na sham process.\n  We have this bill here; I have held it up many times. I can barely \nhold it up right now--1,200 pages. It is dated November 20. It was \ndelivered on our desks when we arrived here Saturday morning, that big. \nSaturday morning and here it is, Monday, and we are expected to vote on \nit.\n  How many seniors in this country have seen this bill? How many here \nin\n\n[[Page S15724]]\n\nthis room have actually gone through it or looked at it--or staffs? We \nknow basically what is in it, but who knows what fine print is included \nand how some things may work? It is a terrible process.\n  That is why I argued against it repeatedly and that is why I voted \nagainst cloture today on the filibuster. It is not that I want to keep \nfilibustering, but I believe we should have gone home and let this bill \nget out to the public, let the American people see it, talk about it, \ndigest it. Then we can come back here in late January, as we are going \nto do, and February, and see what our constituents think about it. To \nme that seems to be the American way, the democratic process.\n  That is not the process we followed here. That is not the process. We \nare debating a proposal that was originally supposed to accomplish one \nsimple goal: to right the wrong in Medicare, that gap that was in \nthere, by providing coverage for prescription drugs and to make \nmedicine more affordable for seniors.\n  I regret that in writing this bill Congress has strayed from that \nobjective. We have forgotten who we are supposed to be helping--our \nNation's seniors. Instead of a straightforward drug benefit, we now \nhave a Medicare privatization proposal that threatens to undo the \nentire Medicare Program on which seniors and the disabled rely each and \nevery day. Seniors who rely on the stability and affordability of this \nprogram, seniors like many in my home State of Iowa, simply want and \nneed affordable medicine.\n  I have seen no big clamour to change the basic Medicare Program. We \nhad a proposal here in the 1990s to get more competition in Medicare. \nThe Congress came up with this Medicare+Choice Program, where seniors \ncould stay in traditional Medicare or they could join an HMO. So we \nhave had several years of experience with this.\n\n  What is the result? Eighty-nine percent of the seniors in this \ncountry have chosen to stay with Medicare. About 11 percent in various \nparts of the country went with HMOs. That is fine. That was purely \nvoluntary. But seniors have spoken. They want to keep traditional \nMedicare. They simply need an affordable drug benefit.\n  I want to say more about this as I talk, but under this bill seniors \ndo not really have a choice. You hear my friends on the Republican side \nsay time and time again, choice, choice, choice, we are giving seniors \nchoice, choice, choice. That simply is not true.\n  I hear all the time they say if a senior wants to stay with Medicare, \nthey can stay with Medicare. That is true. But at what expense? What \nthey don't tell you is, if a senior wants to stay with Medicare, they \ndon't get drug coverage. They get no prescription drug coverage. Yes, \nyou can stay with Medicare but you have to give up prescription drug \ncoverage. If you want prescription drug coverage, you have to go to \nsome private plan. That is what they are not telling. I will have more \nto say about that choice.\n  This bill totally violates the spirit and substance of the original \nMedicare Program. Again, to make it worse, we are rushing it through \nthe Senate. This bill doesn't start until 2006. What is the rush? Why \nare we here 3 days before Thanksgiving, 7 o'clock in the evening, \nhaving a vote on a filibuster today, trying to ram this bill through? \nWhy is it that the House of Representatives, in an all-night session, \nrammed this bill through? I will tell you why they rammed it through. \nBecause the pharmaceutical companies and the big insurance companies \nwant to get it through before Americans broadly know what is in it. \nThat is why. Get it through in a hurry.\n  Only a few fortunate people know what is in this: a roomful of \nRepublicans, two Democrats, and big money industries. Seniors didn't \nhave a seat at the table. If they would have, I am sure they would have \ncreated a very different bill.\n  I have this cartoon here. I will show it again. Here is a pharmacy. \nThere is a pharmacist who represents Congress. This elderly woman has \ncome in, has given her drug benefit to Congress, and Congress is \nsaying: Have a seat. It will be ready in 2\\1/2\\ years--your \nprescription; 2\\1/2\\ years. Yet we have to rush this through right now.\n  As I said, I called this the big Medicare gamble. It is like a \nroulette wheel. That is what we are doing. Before, under Medicare, it \nwasn't a gamble. You knew what you had. You had good, rock solid \ncoverage, no matter what part of the country you lived in, whether you \nlived in rural Iowa or New York City; it didn't make any difference. \nNow we are rolling the dice, spinning the roulette wheel. It is going \nto unravel Medicare. The special interests, the drug companies, the \nHMOs are now more important than seniors.\n  Seniors are being told there is not enough money for a really good \ndrug benefit. Why isn't there enough money? It is because we already \nsquandered our surplus in tax cuts worth trillions for the wealthy. \nOnce again, the well-heeled on Wall Street are more important to this \nadministration than the elderly and disabled on Main Street.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request? I \nask unanimous consent that I be recognized following the Senator from \nIowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. What we have before us today is a bill drafted behind \nclosed doors in the dark of night that amounts to a bonanza for special \ninterests. Don't take my word for it. Look at what others are saying \nregarding this bill.\n  This is from the Des Moines Register editorial board, my home paper:\n\n       This legislation is a big, sloppy kiss to the \n     pharmaceutical and insurance industries.\n\n  The Albany Times Union:\n\n       This is not only an imperfect bill, it may also be a \n     disastrous one.\n\n  This is the New York Times of the 19th:\n\n       This is a gift to pharmaceutical companies and insurers and \n     a threat to elderly Americans.\n       Deal would alter Medicare's core. If a compromise bill on \n     prescription drugs passes, the Government program will become \n     a massive subsidized insurance market.\n\n  That is the LA Times. They have it right. It is not just the media \nand some of us on this side. From the American Conservative Union, \nlisten to what they say:\n\n       The Medicare prescription drug benefit bill that passed the \n     House and the Senate would drive up costs for millions of \n     senior citizens. Millions more will lose their current \n     coverage under private Medigap insurance and employer \n     provided plans. The House-Senate conference committee should \n     reject the bill and start over with a bill that includes real \n     Medicare reform.\n\n  This bill would provide billions of dollars in subsidies--bribes--to \nprivate plans and HMOs. In fact, this morning's Washington Post had an \narticle which said the Medicare bill would enrich companies $125 \nmillion more for employers and health firms. It would ensure billions \nof dollars in profits and projected $139 billion to pharmaceuticals. I \nthink it speaks volumes that when this bill came out last week, the \ndrug and health industry stocks surged on Wall Street.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article from today's Washington Post \nbe printed in the Record.\n   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 24, 2003]\n\n                  Medicare Bill Would Enrich Companies\n\n                           (By Amy Goldstein)\n\n        The Medicare legislation that passed the House near dawn \n     on Saturday and is moving toward a final vote in the Senate \n     would steer at least $125 billion over the next decade in \n     extra assistance to the health care industry and U.S. \n     businesses, in addition to its widely heralded goal of \n     helping older Americans pay for prescription drugs.\n        The largest chunk of that assistance, according to \n     congressional budget estimates, would be $86 billion worth of \n     payments and tax benefits for employers, giving them a new \n     subsidy for the health benefits that many already provide to \n     retirees. Health maintenance organizations, hospitals and \n     physicians also would be paid more by the government for \n     treating the 40 million elderly and disabled people in \n     Medicare, the estimates show.\n        Whether this extra money, part of a $400 billion plan to \n     redesign the program, is warranted remains a matter of \n     intense debate. Regardless of whether the payments are \n     needed, the bill's generosity to employers and major sectors \n     of the medical industry helps explain the aggressive lobbying \n     campaigns for the legislation by groups including the U.S. \n     Chamber of Commerce and the American Medical Association.\n        Liberal and conservative health policy analysts say the \n     payments undercut a significant goal of the White House and \n     congressional Republicans in redesigning the Medicare system: \n     preventing it from running out of money in the near future.\n\n[[Page S15725]]\n\n       One of the bill's main architects, Ways and Means Committee \n     Chairman Bill Thomas (R-Calif.), has repeatedly said that \n     expensive new drug benefits must be balanced against other \n     steps that will rein in the program's spending. The most \n     recent federal estimates predict that Medicare will become \n     insolvent in 2026 because Americans are living longer and the \n     large baby-boom generation will start to retire in a few \n     years.\n       Yet, as House and Senate members have worked out an \n     agreement on the Medicare bill, ``nobody is serious about the \n     solvency goal,'' said Stuart Butler, vice president of \n     domestic and economic policy studies at the conservative \n     Heritage Foundation, which opposes the legislation. ``That \n     isn't even on the radar screen of more than a handful of \n     members.''\n       The extra money to private health care companies is part of \n     the reason many Democrats oppose the measure. Sen. Edward M. \n     Kennedy (D-Mass.), his party's leading voice in the Senate on \n     health care and a vehement critic of the bill, said last week \n     that provisions calling for increased payments to HMOs and \n     other health plans were ``obscene.''\n       Kennedy and other critics say that, for the first time in \n     the many years that Medicare has encouraged private health \n     plans to welcome older patients, the government would be \n     abandoning its original rationale that managed care is more \n     economical. Instead, the bill would create new funding rules \n     to ensure that no private plan is paid less than the rates \n     that Medicare pays for patients in the traditional, fee-for-\n     service part of the program. It also would establish a \n     special $12 billion fund to try to persuade health plans to \n     enter--or stay in--parts of the country where they have been \n     scarce.\n       Lobbyists for health plans counter that they cannot afford \n     to take Medicare patients unless they are paid enough to make \n     it worthwhile. But health economist Marilyn Moon said: ``It \n     is very ironic. . . . To increase participation in private \n     plans, we are going to overpay them for the foreseeable \n     future.''\n       The extra payments in the bill have varying purposes. One \n     is to send more Medicare money to doctors, hospitals and \n     other care providers in rural areas, through a combination of \n     funding methods that total about $25 billion over 10 years. \n     Rural health care advocates--and the lawmakers who represent \n     them--made that money a top priority.\n       The thinking behind the new employer subsidies is connected \n     to the new drug benefits. Once federal benefits became \n     available, corporate executives told lawmakers and Bush \n     administration officials, companies might accelerate a recent \n     trend in which some have been dropping--or charging more \n     for--health coverage for retired workers.\n       As a result, the House and Senate members who negotiated \n     for four months over separate Medicare bills, that the two \n     chambers had passed included incentives to deter companies \n     from abandoning their retirees. The bill would give companies \n     essentially the same amount of money per retiree that the \n     government would provide in subsidies to individual \n     Medicare patients who got the new federal coverage for \n     prescription drugs. The employers would get $70 billion in \n     direct payments and $16 billion more in new tax breaks \n     over the next 10 years.\n       Thomas A. Scully, administrator of the federal agency that \n     runs Medicare, said employers ``should be having a giant \n     ticker-tape parade.'' Scully recalled that he and Health and \n     Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson met in the spring \n     with labor and corporate leaders--including the chairmen of \n     General Motors Corp., General Electric Co. and a major steel \n     manufacturer. ``Their joint plea was, retiree health costs \n     are an unbelievable burden.'' They requested what Scully \n     called ``a modest buyout,'' equivalent to perhaps $350 per \n     retiree. The bill, he said, provides more than twice that \n     amount, a sum ``way beyond their wildest requests.''\n       Employers repaid with their support. Nine days ago, less \n     than an hour after House and Senate leaders announced their \n     compromise on the legislation, the Business Roundtable, an \n     organization of chief executives of large corporations, \n     issued a statement praising the agreement.\n       Similarly, the American Medical Association has mounted a \n     grass-roots campaign in which about 10,000 doctors and their \n     patients have contacted their congressional representatives \n     in recent weeks, urging them to vote for the measure. The \n     bill would cancel a planned decrease in Medicare's payments \n     to physicians for the next two years, providing them a small \n     increase instead. That would give doctors an extra $2.5 \n     billion over the next five years, although the money would be \n     decreased after that.\n       Together with special physician subsidies in rural \n     communities, the bill would give physicians $1.9 billion more \n     in Medicare payments during the next decade than they would \n     get otherwise, the budget analyses show.\n       Donald J. Palmisano, a New Orleans surgeon who is the \n     medical association's president, said the payments were \n     important ``to make sure physicians can stay in the practice \n     of medicine.''\n       ``It will be of no value to have medical coverage or a \n     prescription drug benefit, if you can't fine a physician,'' \n     he said.\n       Hospitals would get nearly $24 billion extra over the next \n     decade, about two-thirds of it in rural areas. The rest would \n     be used to help defray the cost of new technologies and \n     training doctors and to give all hospitals a bigger boost for \n     inflation next year than the House originally wanted.\n       ``I really take issue with anyone who would question the \n     need of those hospitals that are critical to Medicare \n     beneficiaries,'' said Charles N. Kahn III, president of the \n     Federation of American Hospitals. But health policy analyst \n     Gail Wilensky, a Republican who used to run Medicare, said \n     hospitals rarely have received as much money to cope with \n     rising costs as they would get from the bill.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the legislation before us seeks to \nprivatize Medicare, plain and simple. It seeks to privatize it, despite \nthe fact that 89 percent of seniors say they want to stay in \ntraditional Medicare--and they have done so when they had a choice--\ndespite the fact that traditional Medicare is less expensive to \nadminister--2 to 3 percent compared to 15 percent in private plans.\n  Again, there is something the average person doesn't understand. They \ndon't realize. You would think a Government plan such as Medicare would \ncost more than a private plan. Private plans are supposed to be cheaper \nbecause of competition. We have had Medicare for almost 40 years. We \nhave had private plans that length of time. So we have a lot of data. \nWe know. This is not conjecture. We have the data. We know. What does \nthe data say? Administrative costs for Medicare, 2 to 3 percent. In \nother words, out of every dollar that goes to a beneficiary, it takes 2 \nto 3 cents to administer Medicare. For a private health care plan, for \nevery dollar that goes out, 15 cents goes for administration.\n  You might ask, Why is that? Just think about it this way. With \ntraditional Medicare, we don't have to spend hundreds of millions of \ndollars on corporate CEO salaries. We don't have to spend hundreds of \nmillions of dollars at least for fancy full-page ads in the New York \nTimes and USA Today and Newsweek magazine. We don't have to spend all \nof that money to advertising agencies. That is where you get chewed up \nwith these private plans.\n  Despite the fact that Medicare expenditures are growing at a slower \nrate than private plans, they say government costs are going up. The \nfact is--again, we have data for 40 years--Medicare has increased by \n9.6 percent compared to private plans at 11.1 percent. Despite that, \nthis Senate, this Congress, and this administration want to move us \ninto private plans. Despite the clear wishes of senior citizens in this \ncountry, they want to move us into private plans.\n  I guess for those who came up with Medicare+Choice, somehow their \nideology said these seniors would move into HMOs, and 89 percent said \nno. By gosh, I guess the thinking is here, if they didn't want to \nvoluntarily move into HMOs, we will force them into HMOs. That is what \nthis bill does.\n  The conferees chose to ignore all of the facts and all of data we \nhave from the past. Instead, they concocted a grand experiment that \nencompasses all their right-wing ideological fantasies and seniors are \nthe guinea pigs.\n  What we have in this bill that no one here has read is nothing less \nthan a witch's brew of seemingly appealing benefits. But it is a \nwitch's brew, one that is going to come back to haunt us in the future.\n  This experiment is a result of what I call private sector worship. It \nis a faith-based notion among some of our colleagues that the private \nsector will take care of everything. It is a blind faith that free \nmarkets solve every problem. But this private sector worship flies in \nthe face of past experience. The entire reason we have Medicare today \nis that there is no private sector market for health insurance for sick \nseniors--none. Why? Because there is no money to be made in insuring \nsick, older people.\n  The free market works fine when you are talking about automobiles, \nairplanes, TVs, widgets, clothes, and that type of thing. But the free \nmarket is not stupid. The free market cares about profits--not people. \nBy its very nature, the free market shuts out people with disabilities, \nshuts out people with mental illnesses, and shuts out people who are in \nthe last years of their lives. In short, the free market shuts out \npeople who are not profitable.\n\n  I have news for my colleagues who believe the free market is the \nanswer to everything. The free market did not\n\n[[Page S15726]]\n\nbreak down barriers to people with disabilities in our country. It was \nthe Government--we here in the Congress--that had to step in to ensure \nopportunity and openness in our country for people with disabilities. \nIn the survival of the fittest free market, these folks were left \nbehind.\n  Another example: We have been fighting this Congress for years to \npass a bill ensuring mental health parity. But people with mental \nillnesses are not a profitable group. So the free market, left to its \nown devices, will have nothing to do with mental health parity.\n  Think about it. We don't have mental health parity. Why wouldn't we? \nWhy wouldn't the free market jump in there and get it? Because there is \nno profit. That is why, as soon as we get back into session next year, \nI hope we pass the Paul Wellstone mental health parity bill. Again, if \nwe leave it up to the free market, people with mental illness are \nsimply left behind.\n  Another prime example of those left behind is the elderly. The \nelderly are not a profitable group of people to include in an insurance \nrisk pool. They are sick. They have chronic illnesses. They are \nexpensive to treat. The proof is all around us. It is impossible to \nimagine private insurers fighting and competing with one another for \nthe privilege of covering the elderly. That is why we have to bribe the \ncompanies with billions of dollars of taxpayer money to get them to \nparticipate in this witch's brew scheme we have come up with here.\n  I have seen this proof firsthand. The other day, I talked about my \nown situation. I want to repeat it again.\n  In 1958, I was a senior in high school. My father was 74 years old. \nMy mother had passed away 8 years prior to that. My father had worked \nmost of his life in the coal mines in Iowa. My father had an eighth \ngrade education. My mother was by then deceased. She was an immigrant \nwith no formal education--little formal education. We lived at that \ntime in a little house in a rural town of Cummings, IA, of 150 people. \nBecause of my father's years in the mines--we called it miner's lung at \nthat time; they call it black lung today--he would get sick every year. \nWe would never see doctors. We didn't have any money. My father's total \nincome was less than $1,500 a year. It was about $1,200 a year. That \nincluded bonuses for having kids under the age of 18.\n\n  Thank goodness he worked a while during World War II to pay into \nSocial Security and he had some Social Security. That is all he had. My \nfather had no stocks, no bonds, no property, no trusts, nothing. He had \nthe small house we lived in and he had a Model A Ford, the only car he \never owned. That was 1958. And every year during those 1950s, I \nremember, like clockwork, my father would get sick. He would get \nsicker; he would get pneumonia. We would rush him to the hospital in \nDes Moines. They would put him in an oxygen tent, give him antibiotics, \nfix him up, and send him back home again.\n  If we did not have any money, and our total family income was less \nthan $1,200 a year, how did we afford that? I tell you how: It is \ncalled charity. The Sisters of Mercy at Mercy Hospital would take care \nof my father, and knowing that we were poor and could not afford it, \nthey would not bill us. That was charity.\n  I was in the Navy some years later, in 1966. I came home on leave, I \nthink for Christmas, and my father was quite beside himself because he \nshowed me this new card he had, a Medicare card. Now he could go see a \ndoctor. If he had to go to the hospital, he did not have to rely on \ncharity any longer.\n  I often think of how much better my father's later years would have \nbeen had he had Medicare. If he had seen a doctor and had preventive \nhealth care, his later years would have been much healthier and much \nbetter. But he only had Medicare for 2 years before he passed away.\n  I tell that story because I wonder, as I stand here and as I listen \nto all this debate about choice, as I listen to the debate about how \ninsurance companies out there will come in and do all this, I wonder, \nwhy didn't insurance companies rush to help my father? Why weren't they \nknocking on his door, competing with one another, to cover my father? \nWe had insurance companies at that time. Why weren't they knocking his \ndoor down to cover him? Why? Because my father was not profitable. \nElderly people in health care are not profitable.\n  So do not tell me the private sector will solve every problem, \nbecause I lived through its failures firsthand. I know many Iowans and \nmany Americans have the same situation. They do not want to be left to \nthe volatility and the whims of private HMOs.\n  I understand many of my colleagues prefer the free market over \nGovernment intervention. I do, too, in most cases. But to say that we \nare going to do it regardless is a misplaced faith. There is a time and \na place for the Government to step in, where the private sector fears \nto tread or fails to tread. No question, this is the case when it comes \nto helping people with disabilities, people with mental illnesses, and \nseniors with serious health problems.\n  We hear the claim that private sector competition will drive down \ncosts and save Medicare. Nonsense. The only competition will be \ncompetition for healthy seniors. If you are sick, you will be shunned.\n  I saw this headline in the Washington Post: ``Medicare Deal Likely to \nSpark More Health Care Competition.'' I thought, my goodness, and I got \nto reading it.\n\n       On Wall Street last week, drug stocks jumped as investors \n     anticipated a congressional deal finally announced in \n     principle last night that would add a prescription drug \n     benefit to the Medicare Program.\n       Pfizer was up on Friday. So was Eli Lily. And so was \n     Johnson and Johnson.\n\n  But this is what it is all about, as Robert Hayes, president of the \nMedicare Rights Center, states:\n\n       This could be like the wild West out there.\n       If suddenly there are five or six or seven plans out there, \n     the insurance companies will be pricing their product to make \n     a profit, as they are obligated to do. If the consumer is \n     kind of shooting in the dark because of the complexity of \n     this--and the darkness is deepened by age or disability--\n     you'll have a customer primed for exploitation. We're real \n     concerned that people could get ripped off.\n\n  It is not competition for the elderly out there. It is competition \namong the drug companies as to who will make the most money. That is \nthe only competition that will be out there. They do not want an even \nplaying field competition. This bill will give billions to private \nplans so they can compete and make profits.\n  This is what people have to understand. They should know this before \nwe vote on this bill. That is why we should get it out there and come \nback in February and vote on it and let the people see what is in \nthere. This bill before the Senate will pay a private insurance company \n26 percent more than traditional Medicare; $1,900 more per senior.\n  Get this straight: We are going to take your hard-earned tax dollars \nand we are going to give those tax dollars to a private insurance plan \nto compete with Medicare, and in order to be able to compete, we are \ngoing to give them 26 percent more than what we provide in Medicare.\n  I guess I would kind of like that competition. Man, I would like to \nget a piece of that action. I would like to have the Government give me \n26 percent more than what Medicare is making. That is not competition; \nit is a corporate giveaway. It is corporate welfare. That is what it \nis. It is a waste of taxpayers dollars when Medicare, over 40 years, \nshows it can do the job cheaper, more effectively, and more \nefficiently.\n  Seniors know it, trust it, and want to keep traditional Medicare. We \nare saying: No; we are taking your tax dollars and we are going to give \nit to private companies, 26 percent more, $1,900 more per beneficiary \nto bribe them to get into a private plan.\n  On top of that, the conferees have come up with what they call a \nstabilization fund. How about that for a nice fancy word--\n``stabilization'' fund? What are we stabilizing? It sounds as if there \nis an earthquake out there. There may be when seniors find out what is \nin the bill. It is a $12 billion slush fund for private plans. \nPrivatization, when it comes to medical care for the elderly, costs \nmore money and it will reduce choice.\n  We have heard the claim time and time again that seniors should have \na choice as Members of Congress do. Seniors will be gravely \ndisappointed when they find out what they are getting is nothing like \nwhat we have. I hear\n\n[[Page S15727]]\n\nabout choice all the time. No senior will be forced out of Medicare. \nHow many times have we heard that? They will be able to stay with \nMedicare.\n  Listen to the words carefully because what we are not hearing is that \nif you want drug coverage, you have to get out of Medicare. If you do \nnot care about not having drug coverage, you can stay in Medicare. That \nis what they are saying. They are saying no one will be forced out of \nMedicare. No. But if you want drug coverage, you are out of Medicare; \nyou have to go to a private plan.\n  Isn't that what we are all about, trying to get drug coverage for \nseniors? And seniors say they want it under Medicare; they do not want \nit under private plans. Seniors will actually end up with reduced \nchoices under this legislation.\n\n  If there are two private plans, say, an HMO and a PDP--maybe you have \nnever heard of a PDP. If you say you have never heard of it, I \nunderstand that because they do not exist. But it has been conjured up \nin this bill. We have conjured up something called PDPs. So if there \nare two private plans, an HMO, and a PDP, and if a senior who is in \nMedicare wants drug coverage, that senior is forced to take the PDP or \nthe HMO. You cannot stay in Medicare. You have to move over and take \none of the private plans.\n  That is a choice? That is a choice? That is like you have a choice \nbetween getting shot and getting hung. Either way, you are dead. Not a \nvery good choice. They will not be allowed to get their drugs through \ntraditional Medicare.\n  Again, let's say they go and join one of these private plans, this \nPDP, or whatever it is, or an HMO. Well, then the HMO can tell them: \nYou can't see your doctor. You have to see another doctor. Oh, you \ncan't take that drug. It is not on our formulary. You have to take this \nother drug.\n  Why do you have to take this other drug? Well, they will not tell you \nwhy, but they are probably getting a bigger kickback from the \npharmaceutical companies for that certain drug. So seniors are forced \nto change drugs. That is not choice.\n  It seems to me around here sometimes it is almost to the point that \nif you hear someone say it is daytime, you might just think it is \nprobably night. If someone says something is black, you probably think \nit is white. Around here we have gotten to the point where we use these \nwords to confuse people, to make people think something is not what it \nis.\n  This idea of choice, that somehow we are giving seniors more choice--\njust false. The rhetoric around this bill does not match reality. The \nPresident and this administration has said many times that seniors \ndeserve choice, that the seniors deserve what Members of Congress have. \nI am all for that. But that is not what they are getting.\n  Right now, I pay about 25 percent of my drug costs. That is it, flat. \nBut the prescription drug plan put before seniors in this bill will not \neven come close to that.\n  Instead, it is a confusing, convoluted maze that--mark my words--will \nleave the seniors feeling betrayed and bewildered. All I can say to \nsome of my colleagues who may have been here in the 1980s is, do you \nremember when we passed the catastrophic health insurance plan? Well, \nif you like the seniors' reaction to that plan in the 1980s, you are \ngoing to love their reaction to this grossly inadequate prescription \ndrug plan.\n  Now, look at what they are going to be faced with right here. Every \nyear we, in our plan, the FEHBP, the Federal Employees Health Benefits \nPlan, have an open season, and we get to choose what plan we want to go \nin. So we get all these books. Here is one from Aetna. Here is another \none from a different Aetna. Here is one from, of course, Blue Cross, \nand then a different Blue Cross. Here is Kaiser. Here is APWU. Here is \nPBP. Here is Mail Handlers. Here is NALC. Here is GEHA. Here is MB, \nIndividual Practices Association.\n  We are supposed to read this and go through them all and decide which \nplan we want to be in. I wonder how many Senators actually go through \nthese. I can count them on less than one hand. I can count them on less \nthan one finger. Yet seniors every year are going to get this. They are \ngoing to be asked: Make a choice. It is confusing. It is going to be \nbewildering to them every year--every single year.\n\n  That is what I mean, a senior could get out of Medicare and go into \nan HMO or one of these PDPs. They could jack up their prices--I will \nsay more about that in a minute--because the premium is not set in law. \nIt can go up. It can go up. They can get bounced around. So they may be \nin one plan 1 year, and that plan may not exist the next year.\n  Then what do they do? What do they choose? Well, that is why I say, \nyou wait. This is going to be a confusing, bewildering mess for our \nsenior citizens.\n  The only ones making the money are pharmaceutical companies. I think \nit is instructive that in this bill--if I can find it here, I think on \npage 53 of this bill, if I am not mistaken. I wonder how many people \nread this. Page 53, line 18: ``Noninterference--In order to promote \ncompetition''--I love this, I love the way they play with words--``In \norder to promote competition under this part and in carrying out this \npart, the Secretary''--the Secretary of Health and Human Services--\n``(1) may not interfere with the negotiations between drug \nmanufacturers and pharmacies and PDP sponsors; and (2) may not require \na particular formulary or institute a price structure for the \nreimbursement of covered part D drugs.''\n  Now, what do you suppose that is all about? Well, what it says is \nthat Medicare cannot negotiate with drug companies to get a better \nprice on drugs for our seniors. That is what was written in the bill. \nWe have said for a long time that we ought to use the power of Medicare \nto negotiate with the drug companies to get a better price. The VA, the \nVeterans' Administration, going back to a law that we passed here, I \nthink, in the 1980s, the VA sits down and negotiates with drug \ncompanies for the price of drugs for veterans hospitals and veterans \nthroughout the country. That is why veterans' drug prices are 50 \npercent or more less than what you might normally pay or what an \nelderly person would pay because they use the purchasing power of the \nVA to bring it down.\n  But in this bill, we have said, no, you cannot do it any further than \nthat. Medicare cannot negotiate. Think about it. It is written in here. \nMedicare is prohibited from negotiating with drug companies to get a \nbetter price on drugs.\n  People always ask: Why are drugs so much cheaper in Canada? I have \nbeen to Canada a lot. I am sure the occupant of the Chair has been to \nCanada. If you go to Edmonton, Calgary, places like that, there are \ndrugstores all over, private drugstores owned by private citizens--free \nenterprise. You go in there, and the pharmacist is there, and you can \nget your drugs 50, 60, sometimes as much as 80-percent cheaper than \nwhat you get here.\n  It is the same drug, made by the same manufacturer, that is that much \ncheaper in Canada. Why? Well, guess what. The Canadian Government buys \nthe drugs. They negotiate with the drug companies to get a lower price \nbecause they buy in such huge volumes. Then the private pharmacist \nmakes money on filling the prescriptions, watching your prescriptions.\n  But in this bill we are forbidding Medicare from negotiating with \ndrug companies for a better price. What a sweetheart deal that is.\n  Let's see what seniors are going to pay for this and why this is kind \nof confusing. Here is what seniors are going to find out. Right now, \nhere is what seniors pay under Medicare: Part A premium, hospital, \nnothing; Part A deductible, $876 for benefit period set for everybody; \nPart B premium $66.60 a month; Part B deductible for their doctor, $100 \nper year, and a 20-percent cost share on each visit to the doctor's \noffice.\n  Very simple, very straightforward; every person in Medicare \nunderstands that.\n  Now what? Well, let's see. Seniors who have an annual income above \n$13,470 per year will have to pay a yearly deductible of $250. They \nwill then pay a $35-a-month premium, which can go up, by the way. That \nis not fixed in law. So that is $420 a year. That figure can change \nevery year because if the private plan is not making the profit that \nthey want, they can boost that figure up, and they will.\n\n  After seniors have put in at least $670 up front, they can start \nreceiving some\n\n[[Page S15728]]\n\nbenefits. You might say, well, 670 bucks, that isn't much. Remember \nwhat I said: This is someone who is above $13,470 a year. Six hundred \nseventy dollars is a lot of money to someone making $14,000 a year and \nworrying about heating bills, buying food, taking care of themselves. \nSo after they pony up $670, the Government will then pay 75 percent of \nthe drug costs up to $2,250.\n  What happens then? What happens then is that person making more than \n$13,470 a year will have to pay 100 percent of their drug costs up to \nabout $5,000. That is the so-called donut hole. That is going to be \noutrageous.\n  One day you are going in, you are getting your drugs, and you are \npaying 25 percent. You are going to go in one day and your drugs are \n$2,200, and then all of a sudden your pharmacist says: You have to pay \nfull price.\n  Why?\n  Well, I am sorry. You reached the donut hole of $2,250.\n  Think of it this way. If your drug costs are $5,000 a year, you will \nhave to pay $4,000 out of pocket. And for that, we bribe HMOs, we give \nbillions of dollars in subsidies to the pharmaceutical companies and to \nHMOs and to PDPs and whatever else.\n  Another thing, a senior who has an annual drug cost of only $500 will \npay more into the program than they receive. You will put in $500. If \nyou have $500 in drug costs, you will pay $751.25 into this program \nevery year. What a deal.\n  To make things even messier, the program would create several tiers \nof classes under the Medicare Program. Again, there are different low-\nincome benefits available to those under 135 percent of the poverty \nlevel. That is $12,123 for a single person. There is another set of \nbenefits for those under 150 percent of poverty level. That is $13,470 \na person. On top of that, to receive the low-income benefits, a senior \nmust undergo an asset test. We threw the asset test out of here in the \nSenate. Now it is back in this bill. But now let's look at this asset \ntest. For one group, those who are at 135 percent of the poverty level \nor below--that is below 12,000 bucks a year--if you are below that, the \nasset test is $6,000 for a single person. You can't have more than \n$6,000 in assets. It is $9,000 for a couple.\n  For the group at 150 percent of the poverty level--let's see, that is \n$13,470--the asset test there is $10,000 in assets, $20,000 for a \ncouple. So mind you, for a difference of a little over $1,000 a year, \nmaybe about $1,300 a year, your asset goes from $9,000 to $20,000 for a \ncouple; $6,000 to $10,000 for a single person. If this sounds \nconfusing, believe me, it is. How are you going to decide where you \nfall?\n  Let's take a group of senior citizens down at McDonald's having their \nmorning coffee. They are all talking about the drug benefit when it \ngoes into effect. Bob is over there, and he gets good benefits under \nthe low-income benefit. But his friend Sue just took a job at the local \nsupermarket at minimum wage to try to make ends meet, pay her heating \nbills. But because she has a little extra income, even though she \nbarely makes any money, she is in a different class. So, therefore, she \nis going to get a different drug benefit.\n  Margaret thought she was going to get some low-income benefits but \nshe filled out her forms and she had too much life insurance, over \n$10,000 in life insurance. So she is out.\n  How in the world is the average elderly citizen supposed to know \nwhere they fit into this mess? You are going to have several different \npeople who make nearly the same amount of money each year and they are \ngoing to receive drastically different benefits.\n  This is a formula for confusion and confrontation. You are going to \nbe pitting elderly against one another. You are going to have friends \nwondering: Why is it that Bob over there gets all those benefits and I \ndon't? We know that Bob owns something else. He is cheating maybe. And \nwhy did he get that and we didn't? Why is it that George over there \ngets all these low-income benefits? And you know George. All his life \nhe frittered his money away, gambled it, boozed it up. Sure he doesn't \nhave much now, but the Government is coming in and giving him \neverything.\n  How about Bob? Bob over here worked hard all his life, raised a \nfamily, educated his kids. He is a man of meager means, but he has \nSocial Security. He was frugal. He saved a little bit. He has a little \nlife insurance policy. No, Bob, you don't get this. Your income may be \njust about the same as George's, a little bit more, but because you \nhave a little bit of assets--you saved for a rainy day--you are out. \nTell me what this is going to be like when the seniors get ahold of \nthis and talk about it.\n  Then there are those citizens who are going to lose retiree \nprescription drug benefits. Two to three million are going to lose \nprescription drug benefits. It is outrageous. This bill would spend \nroughly $88 billion to try to bribe employers not to drop retiree \nhealth coverage yet, even with that, 2 to 3 million seniors will lose \ntheir retiree benefits.\n  Yes, the drug and health industries are spending millions to ram this \nbill through immediately, even though seniors across the Nation don't \nknow what it contains. The authors of this bill did not let the senior \ncitizens of this country see what was in the bill because they knew \nonce they found out they would have trouble passing it here. Apparently \na seat at the Medicare table was quite expensive.\n  The Washington Post article from Saturday morning was entitled ``Two \nBills Would Benefit Top Bush Fundraisers.'' It explains that the \nMedicare bill will benefit at least 24 Rangers and Pioneers as \nexecutives of companies or lobbyists working for them.\n  A Pioneer in the Bush campaign is one who raises at least $100,000, \nwhile a Ranger is someone who has raised at least $200,000.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       [From the Washington Post]\n\n               2 Bills Would Benefit Top Bush Fundraisers\n\n\n                Executives' Companies Could Get Billions\n\n                         (By Thomas B. Edsall)\n\n       More than three dozen of President Bush's major fundraisers \n     are affiliated with companies that stand to benefit from the \n     passage of two central pieces of the administration's \n     legislative agenda: the energy and Medicare bills.\n       The energy bill provides billions of dollars in benefits to \n     companies run by at least 22 executives and their spouses who \n     have qualified as either ``Pioneers'' or ``Rangers,'' as well \n     as to the clients of at least 15 lobbyists and their spouses \n     who have achieved similar status as fundraisers. At least 24 \n     Rangers and Pioneers could benefit from the Medicare bill as \n     executives of companies or lobbyists working for them, \n     including eight who have clients affected by both bills.\n       By its latest count, Bush's re-election campaign has \n     designated more than 300 supporters as Pioneers or Rangers. \n     The Pioneers were created by the Bush campaign in 2000 to \n     reward supporters who brought in at least $100,000 in \n     contributions. For his reelection campaign, Bush has set a \n     goal of raising as much as $200 million, almost twice what he \n     raised three years ago, and established the designation of \n     Ranger for those who raise at least $200,000.\n       With the size of donations limited as a result of the \n     campaign finance law enacted last year, fundraisers who can \n     collect $100,000 or more in contributions of $2,000 or less \n     have become key players this election cycle. The law barred \n     the political parties from collecting large--sometimes \n     reaching $5 million to $10 million--``soft money'' \n     contributions from businesses, unions, trade associations and \n     individuals. This has put a premium on those who can solicit \n     dozens, and sometimes hundreds, of smaller contributions from \n     employees, clients and associates.\n       The energy and Medicare bills were drafted with the \n     cooperation of representatives from dozens of industries. \n     Power and energy company officials; railroad CEOs; \n     pharmaceutical, hospital association and insurance company \n     executives; and the lobbyists who represent them are among \n     those who have supported the bills and whose companies would \n     benefit from their passage.\n       The Medicare bill was scheduled to be acted upon by the \n     House late last night. If passed, it will go to the Senate. \n     The first comprehensive revision of energy policy in more \n     than a decade passed the House this week, but in the Senate, \n     the measure ran into a roadblock yesterday when opponents \n     stopped it from coming to a vote. Sponsors promised to make \n     further efforts to get the 60 votes to break the filibuster.\n       The energy bill provides industry tax breaks worth $23.5 \n     billion over 10 years aimed at increasing domestic oil and \n     gas production, and $5.4 billion in subsidies and loan \n     guarantees. The bill also grants legal protections to gas \n     producers using the additive methyl tertiary-butyl ether \n     (MTBE), whose manufacturers face a wave of lawsuits, and it \n     repeals the Public Utility Holding Company Act (PUHCA), a \n     mainstay of consumer protection that limits mergers of \n     utilities.\n\n[[Page S15729]]\n\n       The bill has been the focus of a bitter ideological and \n     partisan fight for three years. A leading sponsor, Rep, W.J. \n     ``Billy'' Tauzin (R-La), Chairman of the House Energy and \n     Commerce Committee, praised the legislation, saying, ``All \n     Americans can look forward to cleaner and more affordable \n     energy, reliable electricity and reduced dependence on \n     foreign oil for generations to come.''\n       Public Citizen, which has tracked the legislation and \n     correlated patterns of contributions to members of Congress \n     and to Bush, denounced the bill as ``a national energy policy \n     developed in secret by corporate executive and a few members \n     of Congress who are showered in special interest money.''\n       Perhaps the single biggest winner in the energy bill, \n     according to lobbyists and critics, is the Southern Co. One \n     of the nation's largest electricity producers, it serves \n     120,000 square miles through subsidiaries Alabama Power, \n     Georgia Power, Gulf Power, Mississippi Power and Savannah \n     Electric, along with a natural gas and nuclear plant \n     subsidiary.\n       The repeal of PUHCA, for example, would create new \n     opportunities to buy or sell facilities; ``participation'' \n     rules determining how utilities share the costs of new \n     transmission lines that are particularly favorable to \n     Southern; two changes in depreciation schedules for gas \n     pipelines and electricity transmission lines with a 10-year \n     revenue loss to the Treasury of $2.8 billion; and changes in \n     the tax consequences of decommissioning nuclear plants, at a \n     10-year revenue loss of $1.5 billion, according to the Joint \n     Committee on Taxation.\n       At least five Bush Pioneers serve as a Southern Co. \n     executive or as its lobbyists: Southern Executive Vice \n     President Dwight H. Evans; Roger Windham Wallace of the \n     lobbying firm Public Strategies; Rob Leebern of the firm \n     Troutman Sanders; Lanny Griffith of the firm Barbour Griffith \n     and Rogers; and Ray Cole, of the firm Van Scoyoc Associates.\n       The railroad industry also has a vital interest in the \n     energy bill. For years, it has been fighting for the \n     elimination of a 4.3 cent-a-gallon tax on diesel fuel, and, \n     at a cost to the Treasury of $1.7 billion over 10 years, the \n     measure repeals the tax. Richard Davidson, chairman and CEO \n     of Union Pacific, is a Ranger, and Matthew K. Rose, CEO of \n     Burlington Northern is a Pioneer.\n       Among the major lobbying firms in Washington, Akin Gump \n     Strauss Hauer & Feld, has been one of the most successful \n     collecting fees for work on the energy and Medicare bills. In \n     the first six months of this year, Akin Gump, which has two \n     partners who are Pioneers--Bill Paxon and James C. Langdon \n     Jr.--received $1.6 million in fees from medical and energy \n     interests.\n       Barbour Griffith & Rogers received $1.1 million from \n     similar clients.\n       On energy issues, Akin Gump represented Amerada Hess Corp., \n     Waste Management Inc. and FirstEnergy Corp., Pacific Gas and \n     Electric Co., BP Exploration and Phillips Petroleum Co. Two \n     of those corporations have, in turn, executives who are major \n     Bush fundraisers, Pioneer A. Maurice Myers, CEO of Waste \n     Management; and Anthony J. Alexander, president of \n     FirstEnergy, a Pioneer in 2000 and again in the current \n     campaign.\n       On Medicare issues, Akin Gump represents the Pharmaceutical \n     Research & Manufacturers of America, Johnson & Johnson, \n     Abbott Laboratories and Pfizer Inc. All would benefit from \n     the expanded markets resulting from a key provision of the \n     bill--the first federal subsidies to help Medicare patients \n     pay for prescriptions.\n       Hank McKinnell, chairman and CEO of Pfizer, has pledged to \n     raise at least $200,000 for Bush's reelection, although he is \n     not yet listed as a Pioneer or Ranger. Pioneer Munr Kazmir, \n     who runs a direct-mail drug company called Direct Meds Inc., \n     estimates that he has about 100,000 customers on Medicare who \n     will have more money to buy drugs from his company. ``We know \n     the patients, we know how important this bill is,'' he said.\n       In addition to the prescription drugs provision, the \n     Medicare bill is intended to encourage recipients to join \n     preferred-provider organizations (PPOs) and other kinds of \n     private health care, instead of receiving care through the \n     traditional fee-for-service system in which they pick their \n     doctors and generally get whatever care they request. The \n     health industry has provided substantial support to the Bush \n     campaign, and a number of officials whose companies and \n     associations actively support the Medicare bill are Pioneers \n     and Rangers.\n       Pioneer Charles N. Kahn, president of the Federation of \n     American Hospitals, said that the Medicare bill will make \n     ``important strides in ensuring that all hospitals have \n     sufficient funding to meet the medical needs of this nation's \n     seniors.'' A federation spokesman noted that the bill \n     provides more money for rural hospitals and for hospitals \n     serving disproportionate numbers of the uninsured, and that \n     it prevents doctors from setting up new competing specialty, \n     or ``boutique,'' hospitals.\n       M. Keith Weikel, chief operating officer at HCR Manor Care, \n     a chain of more than 500 nursing homes and other facilities \n     serving the elderly, is another Pioneer. Weikel and Manor \n     Care did not respond to requests for comment on the Medicare \n     bill, but the major nursing home trade group, The American \n     Health Care Association, strongly endorsed the bill, which \n     among other things, would continue to bar Medicare from \n     capping the amount it covers for various therapies offered by \n     health care providers such as nursing homes.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. The article goes on to describe how the drug industry got \neverything they wanted. I think seniors in this country deserve more. \nThey deserve to be put first in the process. Instead they have been put \nlast. Corporate interests, insurance companies, pharmaceutical \ncompanies, they come first. It speaks volumes that on Wall Street the \nhealth industry and drug stocks have surged with the emergence of this \nbill. Corporate executives may be popping their champagne corks in \ncelebration of what happened here today, but seniors are left \nscratching their heads and wondering why their interests were \nforgotten.\n  Maybe they assumed that the AARP would stand up for their interests. \nBut AARP has brazenly betrayed the wishes of its members. Seniors need \nto know what direction Medicare is taking and whose side the AARP is \non.\n  It says everything about this bill that Newt Gingrich is urging \nRepublicans to vote in favor of it. Remember, this is the same Newt \nGingrich who was Speaker of the House and expressed his desire to let \nMedicare wither on the vine. Mr. Gingrich is one of those ideologues \nwho insists that the private marketplace will solve all of our \nproblems. It would make his day to see Medicare dismantled. If he is \nfor this bill, that ought to give us pause for concern.\n  Mr. Gingrich and his rightwing friends love this bill, like the head \nof Americans for Tax Reform, Grover Norquist, who once said:\n\n       My goal is to cut government in half . . . to get it down \n     to the size where we can [drag it into the bathroom] and \n     drown it in the bathtub.\n\n  Today, with this vote on this bill, Newt Gingrich's dream is coming \ntrue. The bill is a first step toward privatizing Medicare. You can bet \nthat once the ink is dry, they will be starting on Social Security and \ngoing after that, too. Mr. Gingrich even went so far as to say he \nbelieved the pharmaceutical companies are getting unfair treatment; \nthat they are punished by the success. Wrong. The bill doesn't ask for \na penny from the pharmaceutical companies. I disagree.\n  On page 53 of the bill, it protects drug companies from Government \nefforts to negotiate lower prices. That is on page 53, line 18. It says \nthat Medicare cannot negotiate for lower prices for drug companies.\n  A recent Peter Hart poll found that almost two-thirds of seniors view \nthis bill unfavorably. Most of them identified themselves as members of \nAARP, American Association of Retired Persons. Among those AARP \nmembers, only 18 percent said Congress should pass this bill, while 65 \npercent said Congress should get back to work. Last week, AARP members \nfrom Maryland, New York, and Pennsylvania tore up their membership \ncards in front of their organization's headquarters here in Washington. \nMembers are accusing William Novelli, CEO of AARP, of ``selling out'' \nto insurers and selling out to Newt Gingrich. Where did they ever get \nthat idea?\n  Well, in fact, the relationship between Newt Gingrich and the bigwigs \nat AARP goes way back. William Novelli, the head of the AARP, wrote the \npreface to Gingrich's book, ``Saving Lives, Saving Money.'' In that \npreface, he states:\n\n       Newt's ideas are influencing how we at AARP are thinking \n     about our national role in health promotion and disease \n     prevention and in our advocating for system change.\n\n  That is Mr. Novelli in Newt Gingrich's book. I would have to ask Mr. \nNovelli which of Newt's ideas are ``influencing how we at AARP are \nthinking''? Is it Newt's wish that Medicare wither on the vine? Is that \ninfluencing Mr. Novelli's thinking?\n  AARP's endorsement is disturbing for another reason. They have a \nflagrant conflict of interest in this matter. They receive vast \nrevenues from the sale of insurance to seniors. Royalties from such \narrangements include deals with UnitedHealthcare Insurance Company, \nMetropolitan Life Insurance Company, and Advance PCS pharmacy benefit \nmanager. All that accounted for more than one-third of AARP's $630 \nmillion in revenues last year, according to AARP's 2002 annual report.\n  If you open up any newspaper in the last 3 days, you have seen full-\npage ads by AARP telling you why this is such a good bill--full-page \nads in USA Today, the New York Times, Washington Post, and on and on.\n\n[[Page S15730]]\n\n  First of all, I want every elderly person who belongs to AARP to \nthink about this and the dues they pay. Think of all that money being \nsiphoned off to ad agencies. Think about all that money being spent on \nthese full-page ads to get Congress to rush this through and pass it. \nWell, Americans deserve better from AARP. They deserve better from \nCongress.\n  This bill reflects the priorities of Newt Gingrich, who has been \nhostile to Medicare since its inception. Seniors know this bill is a \nbetrayal. They know who the winners and losers are with this bill. \nHMOs, PPOs, pharmaceutical companies, on premium support, they win, and \nseniors and disabled lose. On cost containment, they win because \nMedicare is prohibited from bargaining for better prices, and seniors \nand disabled lose. On drug coverage, pharmaceutical companies win and \nseniors lose. On health savings accounts--my, my, my, now we have \nthem--HMOs win, seniors lose; stabilization fund--a slush fund is what \nit ought to be called--again HMOs and PPOs win, and seniors lose; on \ncompetition, pharmaceutical companies win big time on that and seniors \nlose.\n  It may seem in what I am saying tonight that somehow I am opposed to \ninsurance companies. Nothing could be further from the truth. In my \nState of Iowa, I think we are, if I am not mistaken, the second largest \ndomiciliary for insurance companies in America, second only to \nConnecticut. Insurance has a prominent role in Iowa. It employs a lot \nof people. Insurance can provide meaningful protection for a lot of \npeople. I happen to have a lot of insurance--homes, cars, life \ninsurance; I have all kinds of insurance. It is a good deal. I have \nbenefited from insurance. Insurance is good. It shares the risk. You \nput people in a large pool and it shares the risk. That is the basic \nessence of insurance, and there is one principle of insurance that \neveryone understands, or should understand: The bigger the pool, the \nless the risk for everyone in the pool.\n  But what is Medicare doing? What are we doing in this bill with \nMedicare? We are dividing up the pool: a little bit here, a little bit \nthere, and a little bit there. Under the health savings accounts, the \nhealthiest will opt out. Under premium support, the healthiest will be \ncherry-picked by the HMOs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Under the \nprevious order, the Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Grassley be \nrecognized for 2 minutes to make a point, and then I will follow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, there is an issue that my colleague from \nIowa brought up that I don't want to take exception to or argue with \nhim about. He finds fault with something on page 53 of this bill called \nnoninterference. That is perfectly legitimate for him to take that \npoint of view. But I want to point out something that Senator Santorum \nhad pointed out earlier in the day's debate, in which a very similar \nnoninterference provision was in a Democrat prescription drug proposal \nintroduced May 10, 2000.\n  I don't mind intellectual arguments against this, but when \nRepublicans take a Democrat idea and put it in our bill, I don't think \nit is fair for colleagues on the other side of the aisle to find fault \nwith what we are doing. I only want to make that point. I don't want to \nargue with my friend from Iowa. I think everybody ought to know that \nthis is something that has had broad bipartisan support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield because I was mentioned? I just \nwant 30 seconds. I was opposed to it at that time, too. I was opposed \nto the noninterference at that time. I have always been opposed to it.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I now want to take my time and talk about \nthe Medicare reform and prescription drug bill that we have before us \ntoday. I rise to explain how and why I am going to vote on this bill.\n  From the day I was sworn into office in 1995 as a Congressman, I have \nspent as much time on strengthening the Medicare program as I have any \nother single issue considered by Congress.\n  On the Health subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee, I \nlearned the details of how this comprehensive healthcare system works \nfor our seniors and the disabled.\n  I have tried to keep true to the principle of making Medicare more \noriented to keeping seniors healthy, not just waiting until they become \nill to treat them.\n  With the growth of Medicare costs and the baby boom population, I \nalso believe just as strongly that the structural security of Medicare \nmust be kept healthy and reforms must not wait until the program is \nill.\n  As a Senator, I have continued to pursue my passion for healthcare \npolicy. I campaigned on and introduced my own Medicare prescription \ndrug bill, along with Senator Chuck Hagel.\n  I was proud that our bill received the votes of a majority of the \nSenate when it was considered last year, although not adopted as the \nfinal bill.\n  Aside from the prescription drug benefit in the bill, I strongly \nbelieve that for Medicare to remain healthy, structural reforms must \ntake place that control unnecessary costs through market forces and \nallow the program to operate more efficiently and more preventatively.\n  This bill contains a number of provisions that I hope will help drive \ndown the increasing costs of health care, not just for our seniors, but \nthroughout the entire healthcare market place.\n  Health Savings Accounts will give patients control over their care, \nto include who patients go to for care, as well as control over their \nindividual expenditures. If shown to be successful, this would be the \nmost sweeping healthcare reform since the managed care model over a \ndecade ago.\n  Likewise, income-relating of the Medicare Part B premium, the disease \nmanagement demonstration project, and the prescription drug card with a \nprivate account--by the way, that was a component of the bill Senator \nHagel and I introduced--are all positive aspects of this legislation.\n  I am pleased that in the bill are two other critical reforms that I \nspearheaded in the House and now in the Senate.\n  Placing a 2-year moratorium on the outpatient therapy cap is a win \nfor our oldest and sickest Medicare seniors. Those who suffer from \nlife-threatening ailments such as Parkinson's disease and stroke should \nnot have to pay every dollar out of pocket just because they require \nadditional care.\n  The bill also includes a provision that eliminates the late penalty \nmilitary retirees pay for joining Medicare. Our military retirees, who \ngave so much of their lives to our country, deserve access to the best \nhealthcare benefits available without being penalized for changes in \nthe system. They thought they were going to get lifetime Health Care. \nThen, when they were put into the Medicare system they were not \ninformed, or at least many of them were not aware that if they did not \nsign up right away, later they would have to pay extra penalty costs.\n  Joining me in helping to get these passed was Senator Lincoln, and I \nwould like to thank her for all of her efforts.\n  The reason I have struggled so fervently over the merits of this \nlegislation is the substantial financial burden this bill places, not \nonly on the Medicare program, but on the country.\n  The benefits in this bill will assist seniors and disabled Americans \nonly to the degree that our Nation is fiscally able to sustain paying \nfor it. That is why I drafted a bill that was responsible to the next \ngeneration of workers who will bear the burden of paying the price tag \non Medicare prescription drugs.\n  I want to put up a couple of charts that help us understand what we \nare dealing with for the next generation.\n  Until 1970, we had about 20 million seniors in our Medicare Program. \nToday we have a little over 40 million seniors, 30 years later. Thirty \nyears from now we will have close to 80 million seniors, equaling \nanother doubling of the number of seniors.\n  This chart shows the problem. These are the number of workers per \nsenior, per retiree, per person over 65 who we have in this country. In \n1970, for every one retiree we had a little over seven people, on \naverage. In 2000, that had slipped to 3.9. When that huge expanse\n\n[[Page S15731]]\n\nof the baby boomers is in full bloom in 2030, we will have 2.4 workers \nfor every one retiree.\n  I remember Senator Phil Gramm telling us that means there are a lot \nmore people riding in the cart and a lot fewer people pulling the cart.\n  I believe this bill threatens the fiscal security of the Medicare \nProgram and compromises the continued growth of our economy by lacking \nthe necessary cost controls to keep it from consuming our domestic \nbudget. I personally believe the cost of this bill is grossly \nunderestimated. By the time the drug benefit goes into effect in 2006, \nwe will have a better understanding of the enormous cost of this bill \nbut at that time it will be too late to do anything about it. Without \nmeasures to contain overutilization, the Government or the private \nsector plans will be forced to ration prescription drugs for our \nseniors, similar to the way care is rationed in Canada.\n  While all major legislation requires legislative corrections after \nbecoming law, I believe that before the ink is dry on this new benefit, \na campaign will be underway to expand this program by closing the \ncoverage gap that exists in the bill. I believe there will also be \nefforts also to reduce deductibles and reduce premiums as well, further \ntransferring costs onto the next generation.\n  While providing seniors with a prescription drug benefit is so very \nimportant to all of us, it must be done in a way that does not bankrupt \nMedicare and threaten future access to care in our country for our \nseniors. It also needs to be fiscally responsible to the next \ngeneration.\n  I believe the Congressmen and Senators who put this bill together \nlabored so intensively, and they did it for the right reasons. They had \npure motives. I also appreciate the leadership the President has shown \non this issue. In fact, if we would have adhered more to the principles \nthat he laid out at the beginning of the year, I believe we would have \na much better bill before us today--perhaps a bill I could support.\n  I am very disappointed in the debate these last few days in how \npeople have politicized this bill. Unfortunately, I believe many have \ndone so for their own political benefit. There have been many things \nsaid about this bill. You could say many negative things about this \nbill, and you could say many positive things as well. However, what we \nought to do in this Chamber is at least talk about what is in the bill \nand what is not in the bill. To mischaracterize the bill, I believe, is \npatently unfair, and it is just wrong to scare senior citizens into \nthinking that Medicare is somehow going to go away.\n  We must remember that most of the private sector reforms in this \nlegislation do not even kick in for several years. So to scare seniors \nI just, frankly, believe is wrong.\n  I have anguished deeply over this bill. There really are some \npositive things in it, things that I like. But, overall, I just believe \nthe negative things in it outweigh the positive. That is why I, \nunfortunately, am going to have to vote against this conference report.\n  I look at the chairman of the Finance Committee who is on the floor \nright now, and there is just no finer person in the Senate than Senator \nGrassley.\n  So it is with a heavy heart that I announce that I am going to vote \nagainst final passage of this bill because I know that he did his best \nto put together a bill with all the different people he had to work \nwith in the House and the Senate, the various interest groups and the \nlike. But I believe this bill does not rise up to the level where I \nthink the positives will outweigh the negatives in the future. I think \nthe costs are going to be too great. Looking at the first 10 years, it \nis estimated to be around $400 billion. For the second 10 years, I know \nof estimates as high as $1.7 trillion. Do we really want to shoulder \nour children and our grandchildren with this burden? That is a question \neach of us has to least ask ourselves, and go into this with our eyes \nwide open. Twenty years from now when we look back on this debate and \non our entire careers, will we be able to say we really did what was \nright for the future of our country? I hope that in fact we can.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I had the privilege of \naddressing the Senate yesterday on this bill. This is the bill that we \nare considering--some 675 pages. My statement yesterday announced that \nafter spending the better part of the weekend trying to comprehend some \nof the details of this bill, I have come to the conclusion that I will \nvote against this legislation for a number of reasons.\n  As has been stated by so many Senators, there is a lot that is good \nin this bill. Clearly, the part about reimbursement to doctors and \nother health care providers is very important. Interestingly, while \ngiving enormous subsidies to PPOs and managed care to the tune of some \n$12 billion, they take away from oncologists and other cancer providers \nin this bill $11.5 billion. That is a part to which I strenuously \nobject.\n  For my predecessor, Senator Connie Mack, who has been at the \nforefront of the fight against cancer, this is one of the provisions \nthat is causing him enormous agony. Visiting with so many of the \noncologists all over the country, it is just inexplicable to them as to \nwhy there would be a $11.5 billion cut on cancer care. The truth is, it \nwas a tradeoff. It was a tradeoff back when we originally considered \nthe bill in the Senate to provide for rural health care. You had to get \nthe money from somewhere. The choice was to take it from cancer care. I \nthink that was not only a poor choice, but I think it was a tragic \nchoice. But that is in this bill. That is one of the reasons I am \nagainst it.\n  But there are other things that are good in this bill, and a lot of \nthat has to do with trying to get physicians and other health care \nproviders adequately compensated instead of cuts that were enacted some \n5 to 7 years ago in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, which really \nstarted cutting health care providers to the bone in their Medicare \nreimbursement.\n\n  But there is a lot more in this bill that is causing me great \nconcern. It is why I am going to vote against it. I want to share that \nwith everybody.\n  One of the toughest jobs that I have had in a lifetime of public \nservice is the years that I served as elected Insurance Commissioner of \nthe State of Florida. I inherited a mess in the aftermath of Hurricane \nAndrew. I had to learn something about insurance marketplaces and how \nin a devastated insurance market we could encourage and nourish the \nfree market back to competition. In the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew, \nthe insurance companies--other than the 12 that went bankrupt--were \nfleeing the State of Florida. Those who stayed were cancelling \nhomeowners right and left.\n  We had to dig in to see what would make that insurance marketplace \ntick, and what would encourage insurers to come back into the \nmarketplace; at the same time, what would provide the needed \ncommodity--namely, in this case homeowners insurance--to the consumers \nof Florida.\n  Because a marketplace had been disrupted by the most costly natural \ndisaster in the history of the country in insurance losses, a lot of it \nwe had to learn by first impression. We were successful in doing that. \nIt took a long time. It was very difficult. One of the things that I \nlearned about insurance in the marketplace is when you get to health \ninsurance, you should let the principle of insurance work for you; that \nis, you take the health risk and spread it over the largest possible \ngroup so that the health risk--when it comes out in costs because \npeople get sick and they have to have health care expenditures--because \nit is a huge group and it is a diverse group in age and health, the per \nunit cost comes down.\n  One of the things that used to frustrate me the most as the Insurance \nCommissioner of Florida was when the new products would be filed, they \nwould be filed for a very small group. The insurance company would \ndrive the cost of the premium down so that it made it very attractive \nfor people to take that particular brand of health insurance. But over \nthe course of time, instead of the insurance company continuing to \nexpand that group, they would keep it stagnant. Over time, people would \ndrop out. Over time, people would get older. Over time, people would \nget sicker. The group would start getting older and sicker and smaller. \nSince the group was defined and not expanding, what do you think the \ncosts were going to be? The costs\n\n[[Page S15732]]\n\nwere going up. That meant the premium was going up in order to make \nthat group actuarially sound in what they were charging for that \ninsurance.\n  People were stuck in an insurance group. They had no place else to go \nbecause they weren't employed by a big employer. They certainly \ncouldn't go out on their own and buy a policy for one individual. The \ncost would be astronomical for that. They were stuck in a spiraling, \nupward cycle of insurance costs and insurance premiums that went to the \nMoon.\n  I saw people literally cry giving testimony about how they could not \nafford it.\n  I learned something from that. I learned that if you are going to \nhave a logical way of handling health insurance, it can't be with a \nsmall group. It can't be with a segmented group. It needs to be with a \nlarge group.\n  Beyond this particular bill, as we look ultimately to the future of \nwhat we are going to do about health care delivery and its costs in \nthis country, in my judgment, since I would like to see it delivered by \nthe private sector and free market competition, you are going to have \nto expand the groups. You are going to have to make them as large as \npossible so that the companies compete for that business. It is when \nyou start to shrink that large group that you get into \ntrouble. Senators, that is what this bill starts to do. It starts to \nselectively take people in Medicare, segmenting them, separating them, \ndissecting them, and ultimately when the healthier people in America--\nin this particular case, Medicare--when the healthier people in \nMedicare are siphoned off, it leaves the sicker seniors to be dealt \nwith in Medicare. And what will happen to the cost? The cost will go up \nand it will go up big time.\n\n  The figure has been thrown out in this bill that the starting point \nfor the premiums for the Medicare prescription drug benefit will be $35 \na month per person. That is not going to happen. It will happen when it \nstarts off in 2006, but as the group gets sicker, the costs are going \nto go up and the premiums--that $35 per person per month--are going to \ngo through the roof.\n  Why are they getting siphoned off? Look at the provision. The \nprovision says we are going to divide up the country in regions. Say \none State is a region. First of all, it says that you are going to \noffer the benefit in 2 ways. It will be offered with what is called a \nPDP, or prescription drug plan, and there is going to be the \nalternative of managed care, either a PPO or an HMO.\n  What this bill provides is the incentive for the healthier seniors to \ngo into the PPO or the HMO because this bill has a very generous \nsubsidy--as a matter of fact, $12 billion--to be used at the discretion \nof the Secretary of HHS, to nourish the PPOs so they can bring their \ncosts down, so they can make it very attractive to senior citizens to \ncome into the PPO because they can get their health care cheaper--\nindeed, all of their health care, including the Medicare fee for \nservice.\n  Also in this bill is a healthy subsidy for HMOs. This bill does not \nallow reimbursement for HMOs per patient like Medicare at 100 percent \nbut kicks it up an additional 9 percent, 109 percent reimbursement. So \nthe Medicare HMO then will be able to offer lower costs for services, \nthus enticing the senior citizen population, particularly the ones who \nare healthier, particularly when they use such recruiting methods as \ngoing into bowling alleys and recruiting seniors to come into the \nmanaged care operation, the PPO or the HMO.\n  What will that do? That is going to leave the rest of the seniors to \nget their drug benefit from the only other available way, which is the \nprescription drug plan. And if their seniors are sicker, what do you \nthink will happen to the cost? The cost is going to go up and the \nmarketplace under this bill is starting to be fragmented, violating the \nprinciple of insurance which is, take the largest possible group, \nspread the health risk over the group, and it brings down the per unit \ncost.\n  There is another way it is being fragmented, and that is the basic \nhealth care population in America. If another 5 or 10 years down the \nline we ever want to do major health care insurance reform--and it is \ndone around employers just because we have done it that way \nhistorically--if your employer is a big employer, such as the Federal \nGovernment or General Motors, you have a big group in which to spread \nthe health risk. But what happens if the employer has five employees or \ntwo employees or one employee? It is not an efficient way of delivering \nhealth care through an insurance system.\n  Indeed, that provision in this bill is another way of fragmenting \nthat population, another way of segmenting that population that \nultimately, when we have to face this crisis--as surely we are going to \nsomeday--you cannot keep operating in a country this large, with 44 \nmillion people who do not have health insurance, who at the same time \nget health care because when they get sick they go to the most \nexpensive place at the most expensive time--to the emergency room--when \nsniffles have turned into pneumonia. Sooner or later, the crisis will \nbecome apparent and we will have to deal with it, if the entire \npopulation has been so fragmented as a provision of this bill in \ncreating health savings accounts.\n\n  Now, for people who have some means of income, this is a very \nattractive alternative. Health savings accounts will allow someone to \ntake dollars, without paying tax on them, and put them into a health \nsavings account at the end of the year. Unlike in present law regarding \nmedical savings accounts where, if the dollars are not used, they self-\ndestruct, these dollars will accumulate. And it will not be just for \nmedical emergencies. Those dollars can be put aside. They can go out \nand buy an insurance policy that has a high deductible, such as $5,000. \nEven if they put $5,000 into the health savings account, they have \nsaved a lot of money because of the cost of insurance if they were \ngetting, say, a $500 deductible policy. That money can accumulate and \nthey can pay for other things than medical expenses, such as cosmetic \nsurgery. So, for a good part of our country that has the financial \nwherewithal, that is very attractive.\n  It is dissecting the overall insured population, and when the crisis \ncomes, it will make it very difficult to get these large pools upon \nwhich we can spread the health risk and where private sector insurance \ncompanies can come in and bid for that particular pool. That is another \nreason I oppose this legislation. It violates the principle of \ninsurance.\n  Some talk about it as a giveaway to the HMOs and the PPOs, pushing \nseniors into managed care where they lose their choice of doctors. That \nspeaks for itself. Over time, when this kicks in, in January of 2006--\nthat is another 2 years and 1\\1/2\\ months--people are going to start \nrealizing what has happened.\n  There is another reason I oppose this bill. That is, you cannot go \nout and offer the alternatives I have just explained for prescription \ndrugs, subsidized by the Federal Government for managed care, without \nprivate employers who have drug coverage for their former employees, \nnow retirees, without the private employer asking, why do I want to \ncontinue this costly prescription drug coverage for my retirees when, \nin fact, I will let these retirees go on in to the Medicare system of \nprescription drugs.\n  If it were an equal prescription drug benefit, that would be OK for \nthe senior citizen, the retiree. But the shock they are going to get is \nwhen their private employer, former employer, drops them as a retiree \nand they look to Medicare under this bill to give them a prescription \ndrug benefit, and, lo and behold, they will find it is a very \ninadequate benefit. If they have $5,000 worth of drugs that they have \nto buy in a year, the senior citizen under this plan is going to pay \nout of his own pocket $3,600, $3,600 under this prescription drug plan \nfor the senior citizen who has an annual prescription drug cost of \n$5,000.\n\n  So all of these retirees who are going to be dropped are going to be \nquite shocked and quite unhappy and quite disappointed, when they \nthought they were getting a full prescription drug benefit.\n  So in my State, for example, it is estimated by one of the very \ncredible studies--and I have heard no one who has disputed this study--\nthat 2.7 million retirees will be dropped from their private drug \ncoverage. In my State of Florida, that translates to 166,000 people. \nAnd I suspect that is going to be a very unhappy 166,000 people in the \nState of Florida.\n\n[[Page S15733]]\n\n  It is true that since this bill does cover those up to 150 percent of \nthe poverty level, there is going to be, for that group, some increased \ncoverage that they do not have now, but it is not going to be much. It \nis not going to be much because a lot of that group who would otherwise \nqualify because they meet the income test of being at that level of the \npoverty level, lo and behold, this bill now puts an asset test on them. \nThat asset test is going to disqualify thousands of them. And if it \ndoes not, they are going to see that they are limited, under this bill, \nin the brands of drugs, the brand name drugs, because this bill defines \ntheir receipt of drugs in a class, and that class of drugs is yet to be \ndetermined. There are going to be some disappointed seniors.\n  There is another reason for opposition to this bill. We talked about \nthere not being any competition for the prescription drug plan and \nhow--since there do not have to be two prescription drug plans \ncompeting against each other and therefore holding the cost down, \nholding the premium down--that $35 monthly premium is going to go up. \nBut in this bill there is also another violation of a principle we have \nfound in Medicare ever since Medicare was set up in 1965; and that is, \nthe premium is universal. The farmer in Iowa who is retired is paying \nthe same premium as the retiree in Miami Beach, even though the costs \nof health care in Iowa and Minnesota are much less than the cost of \nhealth care in south Florida. There is a universality of the Medicare \nPart B premium.\n  That is going to be broken up, not on the Part B premium but on the \nPart D premium, because this bill causes the division of the country \ninto at least 10 and some say as many as 50 regions in this country, \neach to be actuarially determined what is going to be the premium that \nwill be actuarially sound with regard to that premium, with regard to \nthe group, and with regard to the cost. So I do not think this bill is \nprocompetition even though that is how it is being sold.\n  The last reason I will state tonight of my reasons for opposition is \none that has been mentioned many times here. Mr. President, $400 \nbillion is lot of money. It depends on how you look at it. The Senator \nfrom Nevada, who just stood up and announced he was voting against the \nbill, has made a very eloquent statement about the cost being so high, \n$400 billion, at a time we are hemorrhaging to the tune of half a \ntrillion dollars in deficit financing this year.\n  But I might want to take it in another direction and say, yes, $400 \nbillion is lots of money, but it is not being efficiently used. The \nreason it is not being efficiently used is that Medicare is strictly \nforbidden, in this bill, from negotiating with pharmaceutical companies \nfor bulk purchases.\n\n  Now, I thought we were for free market competition. I thought we were \nfor letting the market forces determine what the price is. But this is \nan exact opposite of that. This is an interference in the private \nmarketplace for it says Medicare cannot negotiate in bulk purchases a \nprice less than the retail price. It is in here. It is in here not only \non one page, it is in here on two pages.\n  It is unlike what has been done for nearly 20 years in the Veterans' \nAdministration, in a bill that passed this Senate on a voice vote \nbecause it was so noncontroversial that the U.S. Government would \nnegotiate through bulk purchases for the acquisition of drugs for the \nVeterans' Administration.\n  The Veterans' Administration is serving a population of about 25 \nmillion veterans. Medicare is serving a population of about 41 million \nAmericans. If the Veterans' Administration can negotiate prices \ndownward, why should not Medicare be able to lower the cost of the \ndrugs to seniors? It is not logical that you would not. And it \ncertainly is not logical when you consider we are constrained under the \nBudget Act that we cannot spend more than $400 billion, until we waived \nthat today.\n  So $400 billion, at a retail price of a drug, that on the retail \nmarket is going to cost at least twice the cost of the drug to the \nVeterans' Administration, which is buying in bulk--we would be able to \nprovide so many more of the benefits of prescription drugs to seniors \nwithout their having to pay so much in a deductible and in copays; and \nin some cases the copay is an entire 100 percent until they get past \nthe threshold of spending $5,000 a year for drugs.\n  Now, I have counted noses. This thing is going to pass. It is either \ngoing to pass tonight or it is going to pass in the morning. It passed \nthe House two nights ago, when they held the vote open for 3 hours \nuntil they twisted arms and turned the vote around. So it is going to \npass.\n  Well, it is not going to pass with my vote for the reasons I have \nstated, that I think are against the interests of the United States and \nmy State. But I am going to do something about it after it passes \nbecause I have already started drafting a bill that is going to say, \nwhat is good for the Veterans' Administration ought to be good for \nMedicare as well, and that if the Veterans' Administration--under a law \nthat has been in effect for two decades, that was noncontroversial when \nit was passed--can purchase in bulk and therefore bring the price down, \nso, too, ought Medicare, for the sake of our senior citizens, be able \nto get a more extensive prescription drug benefit than the meager one \nthey are going to get in this bill.\n  I will be introducing that bill. I think one of the people I am going \nto work with is my senior Senator, Mr. Graham, since he has announced \nhis retirement in the last year of his service as a Senator, and the \ntwo of us will put together a comprehensive package. But that is \ncertainly one aspect of it that we are going to be following.\n  I thank the Senate for its attention. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would propose to proceed for a short \nperiod--I think we are going back and forth--unless one of my \ncolleagues signifies to the contrary.\n  I have listened very carefully, as indeed I think all Senators have, \nto the very strongly held views of colleagues on this bill. My good \nfriend, the Senator from Florida, who proudly serves on the Armed \nServices Committee, and I work together. I was quite interested in what \nhe had to say. I guess on most military issues we are together, but on \nthis one we seem to have differences of opinion. I would say that our \ndistinguished colleague from Florida does represent quite a few senior \ncitizens, so I expect he has done a little bit more of his homework to \ndevelop his views here tonight. Nevertheless, I respectfully differ, \nand we are going to have to think what is in the best interest of the \ncountry as we approach this vote, whenever that will occur.\n  I rise in support of the conference report to H.R. 1, the Medicare \nPrescription Drug and Modernization Act of 2003. Medicare was created \nin 1965, a nationwide insurance program that offered health insurance \nprotection for approximately 40 million older Americans and those who \nhave had the misfortune of becoming disabled. The program provides \nbroad coverage for many health services, but there are gaps--how well \nwe know that--in this program that has been working since 1965. Those \ngaps create no coverage in some instances. That is the reason we are \nhere today, to plug those gaps.\n  I think under the leadership of the distinguished Senator from Iowa, \nMr. Grassley, the distinguished majority leader, many others who have \nworked so long and hard on this bill, we have done more than plug the \ngaps. We have done more. I hope that increase, which is well deserved \nby the seniors, is appreciated because it is important to these \nindividuals.\n  I myself proudly fit into the category of a senior citizen. In fact, \nwhen I am speaking publicly, quite often I am not introduced as a \nsenior Senator but as a senior citizen. There is usually a lot of \nlaughter among the crowd, but I look them square in the eye and say \nthat I am very proud to have that status as a senior citizen. My mother \nlived to be 98 years old. I kind of hope I can follow along in her \nfootsteps.\n  One area in the current Medicare Program where a major gap exists is \nin the coverage of prescription drugs. We know that so well. Medicare \ncurrently provides no outpatient--if you are in the hospital, you can \nget some--prescription drug coverage. That is because when Congress \ncreated Medicare in 1965--it is interesting, when they created it in \n1965, prescription drugs\n\n[[Page S15734]]\n\nwere not a major component of the health system.\n  That is fascinating to me. My father was a medical doctor. He was a \nsurgeon. I remember he used to carry that black bag, and he used to \nhave several bottles of pills in it, to the best of my knowledge. I \nknow he was very careful in how he dispensed all those drugs. But when \nwe stop to think, it has been a dynamic, if not revolutionary, change \nin the practice of medicine and health care owing to the development of \nprescription drugs. So since 1965, there have been a lot of positive \ndevelopments in health care.\n  One major positive development is prescription drug innovations. We \nare proud in America of the many innovations we have had. Those \ninnovations have improved the quality of life for those with chronic \nconditions such as heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, and others. \nPrescription drugs are now an essential component of today's health \ncare system. They often allow individuals to stay out of the hospitals \nand, therefore, not become a burden on the already overburdened health \ncare system in the United States. That is owing to prescription drugs.\n\n  That is the reason--the prescription portion of this--why I am so \nfervently and strongly in support of this legislation.\n  I have had the good fortune of representing the citizens of the \nCommonwealth. I was talking to the distinguished majority leader. When \nthis session of the Congress concludes, it will be 25 years. A quarter \nof a century I have been privileged to serve in this Chamber. \nThroughout that period of time, as all of us do, we travel extensively \nthroughout our States. We have our town meetings and otherwise. How \noften have all of us come across those individuals who simply say they \nstruggle to pay for these prescription drugs, a well-worn but truthful \nphrase. Often they give up the bare necessities of life--food and \nshelter--to pay for their drugs. So we have all heard those stories.\n  I am proud that this act will go a very long way to remove that \nanecdotal phrase from our town meetings and from these individuals. \nThey are not aggressive about it. Really, they are very sad and almost \nembarrassed to say they have to dip into their basic necessities of \nfood and shelter to meet their daily requirements, weekly requirements, \nwhatever the case may be.\n  Some say they ration the drugs they are instructed to take by their \nphysician. Imagine that. A physician says you take a pill a day, and \nthey can't afford it. They take a pill every other day. That is just \nimpacting the health of so many people.\n  I hail this section on the prescription drugs. I think it is a \nremarkable step forward. This outpatient benefit is long overdue. Now \nwe are about, with a historic vote, to provide that.\n  Many of us have worked these years to try to come to this point in \nthe Senate where we do have this prescription drug outpatient Medicare \nProgram. I have in the past voted for a number of pieces of \nlegislation, have cosponsored a variety of bills to add such a \nprescription drug benefit. In fact, in an effort to reach a legislative \nconsensus, I even offered my own bill. It was bipartisan. I was joined \nby Senators Collins and Dayton early this year. It was very simplistic. \nI look at the remarkable size of that. It is about 8 inches thick. Our \nbill was probably not more than a dozen or so pages, but at least it \nwent to a partial solution of this problem faced by so many people who \ncould not afford their drugs.\n  None of these measures ever got enough support in either the House of \nRepresentatives or the Senate. As a result, while we in Congress \ncontinued to debate this issue, America's seniors continued to suffer.\n  Today, though, we have a historic opportunity before us. Early \nSaturday morning the other body passed their report and now we are \nabout to pass ours. I am confident we will. At that moment, across this \nNation will go the voice of the Congress saying that we have at long \nlast, since 1965, done our best to try to put together legislation to \ntake care of the 40 million beneficiaries of Medicare that exist today.\n  Under this legislation, starting in 2004, all Medicare beneficiaries \nwill be able to receive a Medicare-endorsed prescription drug discount \ncard. It is estimated these cards will save seniors between 15 and 25 \npercent on their prescriptions. Low-income beneficiaries will also \nreceive a $600 subsidy on their card towards the purchase of \nprescription drugs.\n  I am very proud in the way the drafters of this bill have put such a \ntremendous emphasis on the low-income Americans. Pain knows no class, \nno age. Pain is endured by all. Perhaps those of us who have a bit more \nthan others were able to alleviate our pain, but we certainly cannot \nlet those less fortunate than ourselves suffer.\n  So I think this $600 subsidy is a magnificent part of this bill.\n  Then, starting in 2006, beneficiaries will be able to, at their \noption, sign up for a new Medicare prescription drug program. This \nprogram is entirely voluntary, so if a senior already has solid \nprescription drug coverage and does not want to participate, he or she \ndoesn't have to sign up for the program.\n  Those seniors that do voluntarily sign up for the program will \nreceive standard prescription drug coverage that covers 75 percent of a \nsenior's drug costs up to $2,250 in drug expenses, after meeting a $35 \nmonthly premium and a $250 deductible. After a beneficiary has spent \n$3,600 out of their own pocket on prescription drugs, the standard \nplan's catastrophic coverage will cover at least 95 percent of \nprescription drug costs.\n  Under the bill, very generous assistance is provided to low-income \nbeneficiaries. In my view, these low-income provisions are truly the \nhallmark of the bill, as these seniors are truly the one's who have \nmost struggled to obtain the prescription drugs they need. These \nseniors will pay little or no premium and little or no deductible, \nbased on their income, and will only have to pay at most a $2 copay for \na generic drug and up to a $5 copay for a brand name drug.\n  What does this new drug benefit mean to Virginians? If passed and \nsigned into law, it will provide the nearly 1 million Medicare \nbeneficiaries in the Commonwealth with access to a Medicare \nprescription drug benefit for the first time in the history of \nMedicare. Almost 400,000 of these individuals will qualify for the \ngenerous low-income benefits.\n  But, not only does this legislation directly help Virginia's Medicare \nbeneficiaries by providing a prescription drug benefit, the legislation \nalso provides needed enhancements to Medicare providers to ensure they \nare more adequately reimbursed for their services. As we have seen, \nwithout adequate reimbursement, health care access can become a real \nissue as doctors and other health providers cut back services or even \nclose their doors to Medicare beneficiaries.\n  That is one of the reasons I strongly support this bill. We simply \nhave to help those people access the care which those of us here in the \nSenate and the Congress enjoy, and indeed that many other Americans \nwith larger corporations and small businesses enjoy, too. Some of them \nare being denied the Medicare rights.\n  This legislation recognizes this fact and provides significant \nassistance to Medicare providers. For example, the bill blocks the \nproposed 4.5-percent cut in physician reimbursement in 2004 and 2005 \nand updates their reimbursement by 1.5 percent in both 2004 and 2005. \nThis one fix alone will result in an influx of almost $200 million into \nVirginia's health care system.\n  Now, while I strongly support this historic legislation, I must admit \nthat in no way is this bill a perfect bill. It is certainly not the \nbill I would have drafted.\n  But, our leaders in the Senate on this legislation--the bipartisan \nteam of Senator Grassley, Senator Baucus, Senator Breaux, and our \nMajority Leader Senator Frist--really should be commended for their \nwork. After the Congress has for years struggled to reach an agreement \non this matter, we have finally reached what appears to be a strong, \ncompromise bill that the President will sign.\n  And, while I intend to vote for this bill shortly, I do wish to take \na moment to raise a few brief points of concern that I believe Congress \nmust carefully watch as this legislation is implemented.\n  First, Congress must be cognizant of the fiscal impact of this bill \nand its long term effect on Medicare and our\n\n[[Page S15735]]\n\nFederal budget. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that this \nlegislation will cost the taxpayers approximately $400 billion over the \nnext 10 years. Over the next few years we must closely watch the \nimplementation of this new benefit to ensure that the program's costs \ndo not explode exponentially beyond the CBO estimate. To do so would \nleave a tremendously unfair burden on America's younger generations.\n  Next, we in Congress must pay close attention to the possible \nunintended consequences of this legislation. Almost \\1/3\\ of all \nseniors currently have retiree employer-sponsored prescription drug \ncoverage. However, due to rising health care costs, more and more \nemployers are dropping retiree health coverage. This legislation will \nprovide a solid fall-back plan for those seniors who lose their retiree \ncoverage due to rising costs.\n  In crafting this legislation, though, we were mindful of the prospect \nthat the mere existence of a Medicare prescription drug benefit might \nsomehow encourage companies to drop their retiree prescription drug \nplan. This is certainly not our intention, and the legislation provides \nimportant Federal incentives to employers who offer good retiree \nprescription drug coverage. Nevertheless, we in Congress must provide \nstrong oversight to ensure that this legislation does not have the \nunintended effect of actually causing retirees to lose existing \nemployer-sponsored coverage.\n  Finally, I regret that the bill before us today includes provisions \nthat would sharply cut Medicare funding for cancer care provided to \nMedicare beneficiaries. After the Senate passed Medicare bill included \na $16 billion cancer care cut, I fought hard with Senator Sam Brownback \nand Senator Bill Nelson to ensure that the final bill contained little \nor no such cut. Together, we garnered the support of 53 U.S. Senators. \nUltimately, though, the Conference Report to H.R. 1 cuts reimbursement \nfor cancer treatment by approximately $11 billion over the next 10 \nyears.\n  Proponents of this cut claim that it is needed so that cancer \ntreatment reimbursement more accurately reflects the true cost to the \nphysician. On the other hand, the hundreds and hundreds of cancer \npatients and oncologists who communicated with me on this issue \nmaintain that these cuts will be devastating to cancer care in this \ncountry.\n  I remain committed to working with my fellow Virginians and others in \nthe Senate to ensure that cancer patients are not negatively affected \nby these provisions.\n  In closing Mr. President, the bill before us today is the product of \na number of years of hard work by a lot of people in the Congress. It \npresents the best opportunity we have ever had in the Congress to \nupdate the Medicare program with a prescription drug benefit.\n  While I do have some serious concerns about certain provisions in the \nbill--on balance--I firmly believe voting for this bill is the right \nthing to do.\n  I look forward to this bill becoming law but remain cognizant of the \nneed for the U.S. Congress to closely monitor the implementation of \nthis legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise at this late hour to add my voice \nin opposition to the legislation that I believe we will be voting on \nlater tonight or early tomorrow morning and to basically explain that I \nthink under this bill, my constituents in Washington State, who would \nbenefit from a prescription drug benefit, or are currently benefiting \nfrom something, will be worse off after this legislation than if we did \nnothing at all.\n  That is the important point for us to discuss today. Going home to \nWashington State over the summer, and in September and in October, the \nvoices of Washingtonians basically said we would like to see a \nprescription drug benefit. Actually, first, they said we would like to \nsee a reduction in the cost of prescription drugs, whether you have a \nbenefit or not. Those who have insurance now are seeing increases in \nthe rates of prescription drugs and cannot afford the continual \nincrease in pricing. I am going to talk about that in a minute. They \nalso said that if you can get a prescription drug benefit, go ahead, \nbut certainly don't do harm by passing something that puts seniors \nworse off than they currently are.\n  While I voted for the bill that came out of the Senate, I think this \nconference report is far off from where we need to go. My colleague \nfrom Virginia, who just spoke, talked about the physician reimbursement \nrate and hospital reimbursement rate, for which I applaud the \ncommittee. I point out that the reimbursement rate for Medicare \npatients that is still within this framework of a national average has \nWashington State at the very low end. In fact, I think we went from \n41st in the Nation to 45th in the reimbursement rate. As a place where \nwe want people to come and provide health care benefits, they are \ncertainly not incentivized under this legislation to want to come to \nWashington when they can practice in other regions and make more money. \nI think some of the failures of this bill far outweigh the strengths of \nthe legislation.\n  I may come at this differently than my colleagues who want to, as I \nsay, privatize Medicare. I certainly believe we have made a promise \nsince 1965 that we would provide a universal benefit of Medicare, \nprovide basic care to our seniors. I think this bill is a failure to \nexpand on that and put a prescription drug under Medicare.\n  When the Harvard School of Public Health did a study in June of 2002, \nthey asked people: If you retired and you had a choice to get a benefit \nunder the Medicare health insurance program or from a private plan, \nsuch as a PPO or HMO, which would you choose? And 63 percent said they \nwanted a program under Medicare. Only 19 percent said they wanted a \nplan under a private provider, a PPO or HMO organization. So I think \nthe public is clear that they have said they trust Medicare.\n  In fact, I found great pleasure recently when the Seattle Post-\nIntelligencer characterized this debate, I thought, in an editorial \ncartoon that was really right on the spot:\n\n       Two constituents obviously are saying to each other, honey, \n     see, the Republicans--what they promised is that we would get \n     out of the faceless control of the Government bureaucrats on \n     Medicare.\n\n  Unbeknownst to the couple, they are sitting in the faceless hands of \ninsurance company executives. I think that is fundamentally what is \nwrong with this legislation, that while we have had a trusted system \nfor many years and an increase in the cost of prescription drugs going \nfrom maybe 5 percent of your health care costs at the time Medicare was \nintroduced to now something like 25 percent of your health care costs, \nMedicare prescription drug benefits should just be part of basic care \nunder Medicare. Instead, we are saying we are going to subsidize \ninsurance companies to somehow provide a prescription drug benefit for \nyou. I think what we are going to find is that it is going to have \ndisastrous results.\n  There are a lot of things in this legislation about which I think \npeople in the State of Washington are concerned. Obviously, this \nparticular debate, as the New York Times called it today, is really a \ndebate--I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the \nRecord, entitled ``Medicare Debate Turns to Pricing of Drug Benefits.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Nov. 24, 2003]\n\n           Medicare Debate Turns to Pricing of Drug Benefits\n\n                            (By Robert Pear)\n\n       Washington, Nov. 23.--With Congress poised for final action \n     on a major Medicare bill this week, some of the fiercest \n     debate is focused on a section of the bill that prohibits the \n     government from negotiating lower drug prices for the 40 \n     million people on Medicare.\n       That provision epitomizes much of the bill, which relies on \n     insurance companies and private health plans to manage the \n     new drug benefit. They could negotiate with drug companies, \n     but the government, with much greater purchasing power, would \n     be forbidden to do so.\n       Supporters of the provision say it is necessary to prevent \n     the government from imposing price controls that could stifle \n     innovation in the pharmaceutical industry. Critics say the \n     restriction would force the government and Medicare \n     beneficiaries to spend much more for drugs than they should.\n       The House passed the Medicare bill on Saturday by a vote of \n     200 to 215, after an all-night session and an extraordinary \n     three-hour roll call. President Bush and House Republican \n     leaders persuaded a few wayward conservatives to vote for the \n     bill, which calls for the biggest expansion of Medicare since \n     its creation in 1965.\n\n[[Page S15736]]\n\n       In the Senate, debate continued on Sunday, with Democrats \n     asserting that the bill would severely undermine the \n     traditional Medicare program. Senator Edward M. Kennedy, \n     Democrat of Massachusetts, said he would lead a filibuster \n     against the measure.\n       Democrats acknowledged they did not have the votes to \n     sustain a filibuster. But they said they would use points of \n     order to slow the legislation, whose passage is a priority \n     for President Bush.\n       Senators Dianne Feinstein of California, Ron Wyden of \n     Oregon, and Kent Conrad of North Dakota, all Democrats, \n     announced on Sunday that they would vote for the bill. Other \n     Democratic senators who have endorsed it include Max Baucus \n     of Montana, John B. Breaux and Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana, \n     Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas and Ben Nelson of Nebraska.\n       But Senator Don Nickles, Republican of Oklahoma, said he \n     would vote against the $400 billion bill.\n       ``We are building a new expansion onto a house that's \n     teetering on a cliff,'' Mr. Nickles said. ``We are saddling \n     future generations with enormous liabilities.''\n       No provision has been mentioned more often in Congressional \n     debate than the section that prohibits the government from \n     interfering in negotiations with drug companies.\n       Democrats have repeatedly asserted that Medicare could \n     provide more generous drug benefits if, like other big \n     buyers, it took advantage of its market power to secure large \n     discounts.\n       But many Republicans have expressed alarm at the \n     possibility that federal officials might negotiate drug \n     prices. The Medicare program, they say, dwarfs other \n     purchasers, and the government is unlike other customers \n     because it could give itself the power to set prices by \n     statute or regulation, just as it sets the rates paid to \n     doctors and hospitals for treating Medicare patients.\n       Under the bill, the government would subsidize a new type \n     of insurance policy known as a prescription drug plan.\n       ``In order to promote competition,'' the bill says, the \n     secretary of health and human services ``may not interfere \n     with the negotiations between drug manufacturers and \n     pharmacies and prescription drug plan sponsors, and may not \n     require a particular formulary or institute a price structure \n     for the reimbursement'' of drugs.\n       Tommy G. Thompson, the secretary of health and human \n     services, said Sunday that if Congress wanted to give him the \n     power to negotiate drug prices, it could do so next year. But \n     ``that's not a reason to oppose this Medicare bill,'' said \n     Mr. Thompson, who negotiated with Bayer to obtain a lower \n     price for the company's anthrax medicine, the antibiotic \n     Cipro, in 2001.\n       Representative Tom Allen, Democrat of Maine, said it struck \n     him as absurd that ``the government will not be able to \n     negotiate lower prices'' for the drugs on which it plans to \n     spend $400 billion in the next decade.\n       ``The bill will allow the pharmaceutical industry to \n     continue charging America's seniors the highest prices in the \n     world,'' Mr. Allen said.\n       Representative Peter A. DeFazio, Democrat of Oregon, said, \n     ``We could provide a much more meaningful benefit if we \n     negotiated lower prices as other nations have done.''\n       Representative Rahm Emanuel, Democrat of Illinois, said: \n     ``We could bring down drug prices if we allowed the secretary \n     of health and human services to negotiate on behalf of 40 \n     million seniors. That is what Sam's Club does.''\n       Sam's Club, a chain of warehouse stores that is a division \n     of Wal-Mart, acts like a purchasing agent for its members, \n     who can buy low-price goods.\n       Republicans say that health plans will be able to negotiate \n     lower drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries, just as they do \n     for large groups of employees with private insurance.\n       The Senate majority leader, Bill Frist, Republican of \n     Tennessee, said: ``We tend to use the purchasing power of \n     private entities like individual plans to hold down costs \n     over time. The Democrats tend to emphasize, and thus push \n     for, more government control, government purchasing. We just \n     think that competition through the private sector, through \n     bulk purchasing and negotiation, is a more effective means to \n     hold down prices.;;\n       Medicare drug plans would be offered by state-licensed \n     insurance companies. They, in turn, could hire pharmacy \n     benefit managers like Express Scripts, Medco Health Solutions \n     and AdvancePCS to negotiate with drug makers, issue discount \n     cards and line up networks of pharmacies.\n       The bill would also create a benefit: an initial physical \n     examination offered to new beneficiaries as a ``welcome to \n     Medicare.'' this benefit illustrates a shift toward greater \n     coverage for preventive services.\n       Under the bill, Medicare would cover screenings for heart \n     disease and diabetes and would pay experts to coordinate care \n     for elderly people with chronic illnesses.\n       Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, took time \n     out from his presidential campaign to join the Senate debate. \n     The Medicare bill, he said, ``lines the pockets of powerful \n     moneyed interests and leaves America's seniors out in the \n     cold.''\n       But Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, urged \n     support for the bill. ``This historic opportunity may never \n     come again, and we cannot afford to let it pass,'' she said.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. In this article, I will read the paragraph:\n\n       With Congress poised for final action on a major Medicare \n     bill this week, some of the fiercest debate is focused on a \n     section of the bill that prohibits the government from \n     negotiating lower drug prices for the 40 million people on \n     Medicare.\n\n  That particular article goes on to talk about the fact that we are \nswitching over to insurance companies when we could have a benefit \nunder Medicare and when Medicare could provide those cost savings as a \nbig market.\n  Now, some people say: Gee, we don't want to set price controls \nbecause that will somehow artificially impact pharmaceutical companies. \nPharmaceutical companies are not the people who need the financing and \nthe access to capital.\n  It is the biotech industry. Washington State happens to be home to \nmany biotech companies. They need access to capital. It is one of the \nactual advantages of what I would call economic advantage that the \nUnited States has in making pharmaceutical drugs; the fact that our \naccess to the capital system allows these biotech companies to do years \nand years of research and then maybe 10 to 15 years later actually \ngetting a drug produced. So they need access to the capital market.\n  Once those drugs are created, we need to do something about \ncontrolling the costs of those drugs. This section of the bill, again \nreferring to the New York Times article, says:\n\n       The provision epitomizes much of the bill, which relies on \n     insurance companies and private health plans to manage the \n     drug benefit. They could negotiate with drug companies, but \n     the government, with much greater purchasing power, would be \n     forbidden to do so.\n\n  I have great concerns about what is the basic hamstringing of this \nproposal as it relates to prescription drug benefits when the key \nopportunity before us would be to put this benefit under Medicare and \ncapitalize on those savings.\n  Mr. President, that is why I had supported earlier legislation and \nfind it very difficult to support this legislation. I am going to talk \nabout why, besides this particular provision, we are hampering \nourselves from having other price controls in this legislation.\n  I agree with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, as we \nstart this new benefit, we must be cognizant of what kind of cost \nmeasures we can do to make sure we continue to provide this for our \ncitizens. Before I get to that, I want to mention, I have great \nconcerns about the retiree benefit plans under this proposal. We have \nabout 49,000 retirees in Washington State who might end up losing their \ncoverage under this bill in the future. They have good, solid insurance \ncoverage plans that I don't think are too generous, but under this \nproposal they might go away.\n  There is a certain percentage of the population under this proposal \nthat actually will start paying a variety of premiums based on income, \nand while some people think that might be a good idea, really these \npeople have been in this program--it has been a program based on a \npayroll tax into the Medicare trust fund--they have paid into the trust \nfund expecting to get reliable health insurance coverage back. Now they \nare going to be paying aggressively on their premiums.\n  About 51,000 residents in Washington State are going to wake up very \nmuch surprised to find that as a result of trying to provide a drug \nbenefit package to the country, all of a sudden they are paying more on \ntheir Medicare Part B program. I know my phone is ringing very much \nagainst this legislation, but I don't know if those 51,000 people \nrealize it is actually their premium rates that are going to go up.\n  Third, I think the legislation, as it relates to low-income seniors, \nis another area where we are leaving seniors basically worse off than \nthey are today. My State covers 150 percent of the poverty level under \nMedicaid with a prescription drug benefit. The lowest income seniors in \nAmerica are now going to have to pay a copayment.\n  One of the reasons we created the program at 100 percent of poverty \nfor people on Medicaid is so they can get access to prescription drugs \nbecause they couldn't afford a program to pay for prescription drugs. \nWe are taking the poorest of our population and now demanding that they \nhave a copayment, too.\n  The asset test--I am sure some of my colleagues will talk about \nthat--for\n\n[[Page S15737]]\n\nthose at 150 percent of the poverty level, which is basically incomes \nof about $13,000 per individual or $18,000 for a family of two, that \nthe asset test is going to be $6,000 for the individual or $9,000 for a \ncouple, that means after that, you are not going to benefit from the \nprogram in the same way.\n  Basically, you are limiting the opportunity for this section of low-\nincome individuals to benefit from what would be a more profitable way \nof dealing with a prescription drug benefit and giving them, not \nhampering them, saying you qualify but limiting them on the asset test.\n  In Washington State, for those individuals below 150 percent of \npoverty level, they are going to be worse off under this legislation.\n\n  I hope this legislation is not a death knell for those who are living \nwith cancer because according to the CBO estimates, this bill could \nbasically cut $11.5 billion over the next 10 years for cancer care \ncommunities because of the reimbursement rate for cancer care. \nBasically, we are making cuts to programs, and I have heard from \nfacilities, oncologists, and cancer patients all across the State that \nthey are very upset with this legislation and the reduction in \nreimbursements for cancer patients. This is another group of people who \nwill be worse off if this legislation passes.\n  As I said, my primary concern with this legislation is it does very \nlittle to rein in the cost of prescription drugs. Talking to my \nconstituents, yes, they would like to see a prescription drug benefit, \nbut they don't want to be worse off than they are today. Even without \nthe benefit, they expect the Senate to do something about controlling \nprescription drug costs.\n  What have we done? I see my colleague from Michigan on the Senate \nfloor. She had a great proposal that we failed to execute that \nbasically said: Why not cap the advertising dollars of the \npharmaceutical companies to the dollars that are involved in research \nand development; that way, they are doing research and development on \nnew drugs. They are not overspending, overadvertising to America, or at \nleast not getting a tax benefit for overadvertising and trying to drive \nup the consumption of drugs.\n  We have done nothing about that. My colleague from New York and \nothers have tried to address the issue of what has become evergreening \nof patents where drug companies actually change the name or some \nfeature of the product just so they can continue to have a patent \ncontrol and generic drugs, cheaper drugs, cannot come to the market.\n  This bill actually deals with some aspect of that, but the aspect I \nwas very concerned about is oftentimes you have big pharmaceutical \ncompanies buying a generic drug company right before the generic drug \ncompany produces the product. That ought to be investigated by the \nDepartment of Justice as an antitrust violation and to make sure we are \nnot allowing such collusive activities to happen, thereby raising the \noverall price of prescription drugs.\n  A provision that would have benefited us the most and was critically \nimportant--again, as we see insurance companies, basically, in charge \nof prescription drug benefits--is we had a great opportunity in an \namendment I offered with several of my colleagues to control the costs \nas it was put forth by pharmacy benefit managers.\n  In traveling around Washington State, actually a summer ago, it \nbecame very clear to me that a great deal of purchasing of \npharmaceutical drugs for individual plans were done by pharmacy benefit \nmanagers. They are the middlemen in this process, and pharmacy benefit \nmanagers often negotiate huge savings for various employee groups, \ncompanies, and organizations. Yet it is unclear what happens to the \nnegotiated discount. Is it passed on to the individuals within the \nbeneficiaries of that plan? Is it basically profit by the pharmacy \nbenefit managers? What happens to that money? In fact, we have had \ninstances in this country where pharmaceutical companies and the \npharmacy benefit managing company are owned by the same entity. Thereby \nthe middleman is basically helping to negotiate and sell a higher price \nfor the pharmaceutical company.\n\n  Most of those companies have gotten out of that. Certainly my \namendment would have prohibited pharmaceutical companies and benefit \nmanagers from working together under the same ownership. But a recent \nSeptember 9, 2003 study by Loyola University Chicago Law School found \nthat the cost to taxpayers for this inherent conflict of pharmacy \nbenefit managers is in the range of somewhere between $14 billion and \n$29 billion over the next 10 years. I think that is quite considerable.\n  To me, putting HMOs in charge of the prescription drug benefit is \nlike putting Enron in charge of our energy policy. Thank God we were \nable to make some comment and statements that we are not going to have \nthat energy policy of the free market without rules and transparency \nwhich basically drove up the cost of energy pricing. But that is what \nwe have here because basically we are saying Government can't do \nanything to control the prices.\n  But now we are going to throw this into the private sector, and it is \nunclear what rules they are going to use to control the prices. The one \namendment that was in this legislation saying that pharmacy benefit \nmanagers had to come clean about the drug benefits they negotiated with \npharmaceutical companies, and what percentage of those dollars they \nwere passing on to consumers--that got thrown out of the legislation.\n  So a key aspect of this bill, which would have said let's provide \ntransparency, let's give money back to seniors, let's make sure \nconsumers are getting the savings that are being passed on by being in \na big market and having market leverage--those things are gone.\n  I believe our Attorney General of the United States ought to \ninvestigate. I don't see why the manufacturers of pharmaceuticals, that \nthen sell through a PBM, can't list the top volume of 50 drugs they \nhave sold and the difference between the prices they received at the \npharmacy level and what discounts were realized. They don't have to \ngive all of their pricing information. They don't have to overexpose \nwhat I think would be private corporate information that allows them to \nbe competitive. But the Department of Justice ought to be able to \ninvestigate collusive activity that is ripping off seniors in America, \nwhen somebody negotiates huge discounts based on volume but then \ndoesn't pass those discounts on to consumers.\n  So, as I said, this is a key part of the legislation that was left \nout. I hope whatever happens with the outcome of this legislation, that \nmy colleagues will think about how we need to rein in pharmacy benefit \nmanagers in the future and make sure they are passing on savings to \nconsumers.\n  As I said, I think this private delivery model we are talking about \nfor Medicare gives too much control over to the insurance agencies and \nother organizations and doesn't give a guarantee to seniors. This bill \nprovides no limits on the premiums that drug-only plans can charge.\n  Seniors need a comprehensive benefit that covers their total \nprescription benefit needs. Why tease them with a program that we are \nsomehow going to cover their prescription benefits and then not control \nthe price, have it in the private sector, and then have the private \nsector dictate to them: Here is the very limited number of drugs that \nare going to be provided.\n  Thirty percent of Washington State seniors enrolled in the \nprescription drug benefit under this program would fall into what is \nthe donut hole. Easily some 122,000 people in my State could fall into \nthe donut hole. Again, another percentage of the population that I \ndon't think are--you might not say they are better off. It depends on \nwhether they have a drug benefit now. But they are certainly not going \nto get anything from this legislation and they are going to be far more \nconfused about why this cliff starts at a certain level.\n  Again, my colleagues, I am sure, have talked about the economic \nimpact of this legislation. I would go back, saying we should start \nwith a prescription drug benefit.\n\n  When my colleague, the Senator from Michigan, and I first came into \nthis Congress, when we had a huge surplus, that was the time we should \nhave put forth a prescription drug benefit that would have been a more \ncomprehensive package and started this process. But we didn't do that.\n  So what my constituents are telling me, and these are even \nconstituents\n\n[[Page S15738]]\n\nliving in the rural part of Washington State who might think their \nphysicians will get a higher reimbursement rate or their hospitals will \nget a higher rate, they will know Washington will still fall behind on \nthe overall Medicare reimbursement rate, falling from 41 in the Nation \nin reimbursement rate to 45. They will know either the lowest-income \nseniors who are going to fall out of the program and have to have \ncopayments--that is, they are already under a plan that they don't have \ncopayments on--or there will be some of these seniors who basically end \nup having to pay more than they are paying today.\n  As we debate this legislation and look forward to whether, as I said, \nthe vote is tonight or tomorrow, I think we need to talk about whether \nwe are going to trust the American people in their trust of Medicare; \nwhether we are going to say we are going to let the Medicare market \ncarry the weight that it has already carried. Actually, even if we \nsaid, Here is the limit of how much we could provide given our budget \ndeficit, I would say: Fine, continue to let Medicare provide for those \nindividuals. As we give more resources as a nation, let's build that \nup.\n  But don't fool America by somehow thinking you are going to turn this \nover to private insurance companies and HMOs and somehow they are \nmagically going to come up with the money to make this benefit program \nwork.\n  What Americans want is security in their prescription drug benefits. \nThey don't think that privatization will work. They don't think we are \ndoing enough to control costs. I suggest to my colleagues that we need \nto go back and work this bill to provide both--the certainty to \nseniors, in a program that they have believed in for many years, and a \nCongress that will stand up and fight the ever increasing cost of \nprescription drugs.\n  I yield the floor to my colleague from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, first, I thank my friend and colleague \nfrom the State of Washington for her eloquence this evening in laying \nout where this is not a good deal for seniors. We wish it was a good \ndeal for seniors. Both of us have been here since 2001, speaking in the \nChamber frequently about the need to provide prescription drug coverage \nfor seniors, real coverage, and about the need to lower prices for \neverybody.\n  In fact, I have been working on senior issues for a long time. \nActually that was the very first opportunity I had to get involved in \npublic service. I won't say when, but it was about 25 years ago. I came \ninto county government, which is a part-time position in Michigan. But \nwhat brought me into the Ingham County Board of Commissioners was the \nissue of senior citizen health care. I have been involved in that issue \never since.\n  Nothing would please me more than to be able to stand on the floor \nthis evening and say: We did it. We have put together a voluntary, \ncomprehensive prescription drug benefit under Medicare for seniors and \nthe disabled. Nothing would please me more. And nothing would please me \nmore than to say: We did it. We have put in place the ability to lower \nprices for everyone.\n  As colleagues have said, this is not just about Medicare and just \nabout our seniors and the disabled--although certainly they are very \nimportant people. They use the majority of the prescription drugs. But \nwe know right now the explosion in prices of prescription drugs is \ndriving the entire cost of the health care system.\n  When I talk to those who are in the auto industry, or when I talk to \nsmall businesses, when I talk to those who are in the furniture \nbusiness in Michigan, or in retail sales or work in State government, I \nhear the same thing, which is at least half the cost increases in \nhealth care are a result of the explosion in prescription drug prices.\n  So this is an issue that affects everybody. As we look at this \nquestion under Medicare, this is also an issue that affects everyone, \nevery taxpayer as well as every person who is paying for Medicare. So \nthis is a big deal. It is important that we get this right. It is \nimportant that we be able, at the end of the day, to say we have \nstrengthened one of the great American success stories called \nMedicare, and that we have put in place the competition and the \naccountability to bring prices down. This bill absolutely does not do \nthat. It doesn't do either one of those things.\n\n  First of all, it starts from the premise that seniors want something \nother than traditional Medicare. When we look at what seniors have said \nwhen they have had a choice, here is what they said. Eighty-nine \npercent of those who have a choice right now between Medicare+Choice, \nwhich is an HMO, private insurance, or traditional Medicare, 89 percent \nsaid: We will take traditional Medicare. Eleven percent said: We will \ntake the private insurance.\n  Seniors have already said what choice they want. When I hear folks \ntalking about what they want in Medicare, they are not asking for more \nbureaucracy, or more insurance paperwork, or more insurance companies \nto choose from. They just want to update Medicare for prescription \ndrugs, that is all--just update Medicare for prescription drugs. \nEighty-nine percent of the Medicare beneficiaries have already told us \nwhat they want to do. They want traditional Medicare.\n  This bill basically sets in place--some of it is immediate with \nprescription drug coverage where you have to choose from private \ninsurance plans if they are in your area, and some of it is down the \nroad a bit in 2010 when the entire unraveling of Medicare begins. In \nsome areas, people will have a very different system that will attempt \nto move them into private insurance.\n  That is not what folks have said to me. People say we should do that \nbecause it costs less. Medicare is in trouble financially down the \nroad. We need to do something to lower costs.\n  When you look at this, Medicare costs about 2 percent to administer \nand private HMOs cost 15 percent. So that can't be the reason we are \ndoing this. It costs more to go into private plans than it does with \ntraditional Medicare.\n  For many of the reasons colleagues said on the floor, traditional \nMedicare has a very large insurance pool--those who are sick, those who \nare well, those who are older, those who are younger, all together--the \nbigger the pool, the bigger the risk pool, the lower the price.\n  It is not because it would cost less, because it doesn't cost less; \nit will cost us more. It will cost taxpayers more. It costs more for \nservices under the private sector than it does under traditional \nMedicare.\n  Why are we doing this? I think we are doing this for one reason: \nUnfortunately, the driving reason behind this legislation is that the \npharmaceutical lobby has decided, instead of continuing to fight \nMedicare coverage and the Medicare prescription drug benefit as they \nhave done for many years--they decided they don't want to stop it \nanymore because it is too big an issue for people. It is a critical \nlife-and-death issue in order to pay for your medicine. That is not to \nsay people got up today and decided to eat or get their medicine. That \nis not rhetoric; it is real. So they changed their approach and thought \nthey couldn't stop it anymore because it is too real for people: This \nis a real problem. Let us create a benefit that is done in a way that \ndivides people up into private insurance plans and in a way that \ndoesn't allow Medicare to use all of its leverage to be able to lower \nprices.\n  So behind all of this, there are I think two things. There are those \nwho really do believe it ought to be done in the private sector, that \nwe ought to go back to private insurance. But you couple that with an \nindustry that wants to make sure that: No matter what, we can't lower \ntheir prices; let us make sure that no matter what, people have to pay \nthe highest prices.\n\n  That is why there is no reimportation, which is really important in \nmy State. The idea that you can have a local pharmacist in Michigan be \nable to do business with a pharmacist in Canada, be able to bring \nprescription drugs back into the local pharmacy in Michigan at half the \nprice, many of them made in the United States, they are safe, they are \nFDA approved, bring them back, and create a way to lower prices--they \ndon't want that. That is not in the bill. They do not want a strong \nprovision to tighten patent loopholes so competitors can be able to get \ninto the marketplace with generic drugs. That is not in the bill.\n  We have a weakened version of that. Amazingly, as colleagues have \nsaid,\n\n[[Page S15739]]\n\nthey were actually able to get language into the bill that says \nMedicare is prohibited from group purchasing on behalf of seniors and \nthe disabled. It is amazing. That is just amazing. The private \ninsurance companies can try to get the best price. Everybody else can \ntry to get the best price. But Medicare on behalf of our seniors is \nprohibited from trying to get the best price.\n  That would only be in the bill for one reason; that is, because the \nindustry has been successful in creating a whole new group of customers \nwho will be forced to pay the highest possible price.\n  How do we know this? This is not just me talking. The Boston \nUniversity School of Health has looked at this legislation and \nestimates there will be $139 billion in increased profits over the next \n8 years for the world's most profitable industry. At $17 billion \nannually, this means about a 38 percent rise in drugmaker profits.\n  I am all for folks making a profit. I have a major pharmaceutical \ncompany in Michigan. They do wonderful research. I am very proud of \nthem for doing this research. But we are talking about an industry that \nis already one of the most heavily subsidized by taxpayers, because \nthey do not make shoes, or chairs, or cars, they make lifesaving \nmedicine. We want them to make it. We want them to do research. So we \nhelp them pay for it. We give them protection. We have patent \nprotection so that they are protected from competition. We give them \nthe ability to write off their research and write off their \nadvertising. They get a lot of support and help. Why? Because we want \nto be able to afford the product.\n  At the end of the day, when, by the way, they are spending 2\\1/2\\ \ntimes more on advertising and marketing and administration rather than \nresearch, which is a big concern of mine, but at end of the day we are \nseeing not prices going down so people can afford them but efforts to \nactually protect prices and allow them to go up.\n  We are looking at about a 38 percent rise in drugmaker profits. \nCertainly any business would welcome that. But that is on the backs of \nAmerican citizens. This is on the backs of American taxpayers who are \npaying the bill--American seniors who just want to know that they can \ncount on Medicare, get the medicine they need, pick their own doctor, \nlive a healthy life, and visit grandkids and great grandkids. They \ntrust us to look beyond the 650 lobbyists, or however many there are in \nthe drug industry now. I know it is over six lobbyists for every one \nMember of the Senate. Imagine, more than six lobbyists for the drug \ncompanies for every Member of Congress. They are counting on the Senate \nto look beyond the swarm and to look at what they need. They are \ncounting on us to look at what they are asking for.\n\n  I know at the end of the day it is our obligation and responsibility \nto make sure we put together something that actually helps people get \ntheir medicine at affordable prices, is responsive to the taxpayers of \nthis country, and is something that protects one of the great American \nsuccess stories called Medicare.\n  The No. 1 reason I am opposing this legislation, there is nothing in \nhere to lower prices for anyone. Profits will continue to go up and \nthey are locked in. This legislation sanctions that.\n  Second, we are putting into place a system that will unravel by \nprivatizing Medicare, or will allow Medicare to wither on the vine as \nformer Speaker Newt Gingrich said. It took a while. He said that in \n1995 and here we are in 2003 with a bill that does that.\n  It does a couple of other things that make no sense to me. I would \nassume that the first rule would be: do no harm. Yet under this \nlegislation, it is estimated that over and above what is happening \nright now in the marketplace, 2.7 million retirees will lose their \ncoverage, people with private coverage. That is one in four. That means \nthree out of four employers will wrap around and keep the coverage \ngoing, but one out of four, which is too high--we could make that zero \nif we wanted to, if we had legislation I cosponsored a year ago that \nmade it--but right now one out of four in this bill are estimated to \nlose their private retiree coverage.\n  My guess is a lot of those folks gave up pay increases over the years \nto get good coverage, gave up other things so in their retirement they \nwould have private coverage.\n  On top of keeping prices high and unraveling Medicare, it is \nestimated by a study group that 143,000 people in the State of Michigan \nwould lose their private coverage. I don't know how in the world I can \nsupport that. And I will not.\n  The last thing this does, there are 6.4 million low-income seniors \nand disabled who will lose access to the drugs they need. Many of them \nwill actually pay more. How in the world does it make any sense that we \nwould have a prescription drug benefit that has been described as \nhelping our low-income seniors the most, but actually costs people more \nout of pocket, people who are currently on Medicaid, who find \nthemselves under Medicare with a different system, a different asset \ntest, different copays, and would actually pay more.\n  We should be focusing on and helping the people who really are \nchoosing every day whether or not to eat or get their medicine or pay \nthe electric bill.\n  When we look at this whole picture, as much as I would love to say \nthis is a great deal, this is a bad deal. My colleagues say this is a \nfirst step. There is an old saying: Beware of the first step. I think \nthe first step is right off the cliff on this legislation for too many \npeople.\n  In closing, there is one important piece in this bill that has strong \nif not unanimous bipartisan support that I wish we were passing \nseparately this evening. That is the issue I have talked about a number \nof times: what is happening to our doctors, our hospitals, our home \nhealth agencies, nursing homes, and others who have been cut \nconsistently in the reimbursements they receive, whether they be rural \nor urban providers.\n\n  Those who care for our seniors and the disabled have seen resources \ncut. That, in turn, is cutting access. We have known that cuts were \ncoming now for the last 3 years, and instead of doing something about \nit sooner because our doctors and other providers desperately needed us \nto, it gets rolled into this legislation that is highly controversial. \nI regret that. I have offered separate legislation pulling out all of \nthese provisions. I offered it on Saturday, and I asked unanimous \nconsent we take it up immediately and pass it. It was objected to on \nthe other side. I regret that, as well.\n  The reality is, in the middle of this bill I believe there are some \nvery important providers being held hostage, folks I want to support, \nwhom I have supported, and I will support in the future; folks for whom \nI have fought, and unfortunately because of the fact that this is in \nthe middle of this bill to unravel Medicare and hurt them in the long \nrun and increase cuts in the long run for all of them, I am not going \nto be able to support this bill. However, I do want the record to \nreflect that our doctors and hospitals and others who have been cut too \nmuch are cancer care providers. They are still cut too much in this \nlegislation. I am extremely upset that is the case.\n  But we do have in this bill provisions for rural hospitals, urban \nhospitals, and others that are desperately needed. I am at least \npleased there are provisions there recognizing the desperate needs our \nproviders feel.\n  In conclusion, when we look at the broad bill before the Senate that \nunravels Medicare, keeps prices high, causes people to lose their \nhealth insurance in the private sector, and causes the most vulnerable \nseniors to pay more, this is a bad deal. I am hopeful, still, that \nthose listening this evening will call their Members before the vote \nthat I believe is coming tomorrow morning. Tell the Members to go back \nto the drawing board. We can do better than this for people. I am still \nvery hopeful this will be stopped and we will get back to the drawing \nboard and get it right.\n\n\n                              Section 641\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Grassley and \nSenator Baucus for all of their work on this bill. Prescription drug \ncoverage under Medicare is long overdue, and I am pleased that we are \nnear to final passage on a drug benefit that will provide our seniors \nand disabled with help they sorely need. That we have made it this far \nis in no small measure to the important work of Senators Grassley and \nBaucus.\n\n[[Page S15740]]\n\n  As we continue to debate the Medicare conference report, I want to \nmake particular note of the efforts of Senators Baucus, Grassley and \nMurray to address the Medicare bias against self injectable biologics \nand oral anti-cancer drugs without an injectable equivalent. These \nbiases can mean that Medicare pays for treatments that are more costly \nand that require patients to travel long distances for treatment. \nWorking together, we have pushed hard for providing coverage of these \ndrugs for an interim period, until the Part D drug benefit begins. This \nimmediate coverage would make a real difference for thousands of \nseniors suffering from cancer as well as various chronic illnesses, \nsuch as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis.\n  While I am pleased that the Medicare conference includes measures to \nprovide coverage of these medications over the next 2 years, I am \ndisappointed that the funding for this policy was limited and the \nnumber of beneficiaries who will be allowed to benefit from this \ncoverage was capped. Also, I am very concerned that the Medicare \nconference report language does not accurately reflect the intent of \nthe conferees, which is clearly laid out in the statute of the \nconference report. I would like to ask my colleagues to comment further \non this issue.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I also want to thank Senators Baucus and Grassley for \ntheir support of the Conrad-Murray language that would have eliminated \nthis discrimination against self-injected biologics. Our amendment \nwould reward companies who innovate their treatments to meet their \npatients needs, not Medicare reimbursement policies. Many of these \npatients suffer from rheumatoid arthritis and MS, two disabling \nconditions that can restrict mobility and make it very difficult to \neven get to a physician's office. As my colleagues know, I have spent \nthe last 4 years working to end this outrageous disincentive in \nMedicare reimbursement policies.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. It is important to note that without Senator Murray's \nefforts and leadership on this issue, we would not be here today. I \nalso thank the Senator from North Dakota for all that he has done to \nrealize this important benefit. And I thank both Senators, as well as \nthe chairman, for working with me to level a Medicare reimbursement \nplaying field that has long been biased against rural patients and \nproviders. We have the most comprehensive rural health package in \nhistory in this bill, and I am proud of that.\n  With respect to self-injectable biologics and oral anti-cancer \nmedications, let me provide some background. Under current law, \nMedicare will cover certain drugs that are administered ``incident to \nphysicians' services.'' but self-injectable biologics which are \ncomplete replacements for physician administered drugs are not covered \nby Medicare. In other words, if a doctor is required to inject the \ndrug, you're covered. If not, you're out of luck.\n  A similar situation exists for oral anti-cancer medications. Coverage \nis available for oral anti-cancer drugs if they are also available in \ninjectable form. But Medicare coverage is denied for anticancer \ntherapies that are available in oral form only. Many new therapies to \ntreat cancer, as well as many that are in various stages of development \nand approval, are available only in oral form, and therefore are not \ncovered under the Medicare program.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank my friend from Montana for that explanation. \nAnd as he and the Senators from Washington and North Dakota know, we \nhave a demonstration program in this bill that covers, until the Part D \ndrug benefit starts in 2006, self-injectable and oral anti-cancer \ndrugs. This demonstration program is in the statutory language. That is \ngood news. However, the report language is clearly in error and refers \nto an entirely different provision, not the one we negotiated.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is right. And for clarification's sake, we would \nlike to ask you some questions about this demonstration project. First, \nin negotiations we intended that this demonstration would be available \nand would operate without limitation to the number of States, correct?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Isn't it true that you intended that the demonstration \nensure that the Secretary preserve physician and beneficiary treatment \noptions by providing for equitable coverage of all qualifying products?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. That is correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Isn't it true that the conference committee intended to \nprovide $500 million above what Medicare would have expended absent \nthis provision to cover replacement self-injectable medications and \noral anti-cancer therapies?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes, that is right.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the chairman for the clarification.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I also thank the chairman for that clarification and, \nagain, would like to thank both the chairman and Senator Baucus for \ntheir work on this important effort. I also strongly share their view \nthat the rural health provisions in the Medicare conference report are \na real victory for not only our States, but for all of rural America.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I just want to be sure that we provide the greatest \ndegree of relief for patients and their families. I was disappointed to \nlearn of this error in the final report language, and it does undermine \nthe entire negotiations for this provision. It certainly undermines the \nintent of the Conrad-Murray amendment adopted by the Senate during \nconsideration of S. 1. I appreciate your working with me to rectify \nthat error.\n\n\n                      Cost Containment Provisions\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, let me take a few moments to provide some \nbackground on the cost containment provisions in the Medicare \nconference agreement.\n  First, let me review current law.\n  Under current law, the Medicare Board of Trustees oversees the \nfinancial operations of the Medicare Hospital Insurance--or HI--trust \nfund--Medicare Part A--and the Medicare Supplementary Medical \nInsurance--or SMI trust fund--Medicare Part B. The Social Security Act \nrequires Medicare's trustees to submit reports to Congress annually by \nMarch 31.\n  Medicare Part A pays for beneficiaries' medical expenses incurred in \nhospitals, skilled nursing facilities, hospices, and a portion of home \nhealth care services. Payroll taxes provide most HI trust fund \nrevenues. Employers and employees each pay 1.45 percent of earnings. \nSelf-employed workers pay 2.9 percent of net income. Other sources of \nHI revenue include: interest on trust fund investments, the federal \nincome taxes on Social Security benefits raised in 1993, premiums from \nvoluntary enrollees into Part A, railroad retirement account transfers \nand reimbursement for certain uninsured persons.\n  Medicare Part B pays for physician and other health care practitioner \nservices, other medical and health services, including laboratory and \nother diagnostic tests, outpatient hospital services and other clinic \nservices, and therapy and ambulance services, durable medical \nequipment, and home health services not covered under Part A. SMI trust \nfund revenues come from beneficiary premiums to purchase Part B and \ngeneral revenues. The Part B premium is set at an amount so that \naggregate premiums make up about 25 percent of program costs. The \nmonthly premium for 2003 is $58.70. General revenues make up the \nremaining 75 percent of Part B program funding.\n  Next, let me note current law on Presidential legislation. Under the \nState of the Union Clause--article II, section 3, clause 1--of the \nConstitution, the President has a right to ``recommend to [Congress's] \nConsideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and \nexpedient.'' Thus the President can already submit legislation to \naddress Medicare solvency.\n  Current law on House procedures is that the House regularly passes \nrules that govern House consideration of particular pieces of \nlegislation. The Rules Committee formulates these rules, which the \nHouse can then adopt by a majority vote. Thus the House can already \nestablish such procedures as it deems appropriate to consider Medicare \nlegislation.\n  And current law with regard to Senate procedures provides that, under \nSenate rule XIV, any single Senator can cause a bill to be placed on \nthe calendar.\n  Now let me turn to what was in the House-passed bill. Section 131 of \nHouse bill would require the trustees to submit a report on the status \nof the combined two trust funds and the Prescription Drug Trust Fund. \nThe bill would require the report to include a statement of the amounts \nspent on benefits\n\n[[Page S15741]]\n\nin the preceding fiscal year from the general revenues and the \npercentage the Medicare general revenues bore to all other general \nrevenue obligations of the Treasury that year. The bill would require \nthis information for each year from the beginning of Medicare and for \n10-year and 75-year projections. The bill would also require the report \nto compare the rate of growth of Medicare general revenue funding to \nthe rate of growth in the gross domestic product. The bill would \nrequire the Committees on Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce to \npublish each report and post it on the Internet.\n  The Senate-passed bill was quite similar. Section 131 of the Senate \nbill would require the trustees to submit a report on the status of the \ncombined two trust funds and the Prescription Drug Trust Account. The \nbill would require the report to include a statement of the amounts \nspent on benefits in the preceding fiscal year from general revenues \nand the percentage that the Medicare general revenues bore to all other \ngeneral revenue obligations of the Treasury that year. The trustees \nwould make this calculation separately for Medicare benefits and for \nadministrative and other expenses. The bill would require this \ninformation for each year from the beginning of Medicare and for 10-\nyear and 50-year projections. The bill would also require the report to \ncompare the rate of growth of Medicare benefits and administrative \ncosts to the rates of growth in the gross domestic product, health \ninsurance costs in the private sector, employment-based health \ninsurance costs in the public and private sectors, and other areas as \ndetermined appropriate by the trustees.\n  Section 132 of the Senate bill would require the 2004 reports to \ninclude an analysis of the total amount of the unfunded obligations of \nMedicare. The analysis would compare long-term obligations, including \nthe combined obligations of the HI and SMI trust funds, to the \ndedicated funding sources for the program--not including transfers of \ngeneral revenue.\n  With regard to Senate Procedures, the Senate bill would express the \nsense of the Congress that the committees of jurisdiction would hold \nhearings on these reports.\n  Now let me turn to the conference agreement before us today. Under \nthe conference agreement, the trustees' report would include a \nstatement of general revenue funding as a percentage of total Medicare \nspending contributions to the Medicare Program. The report would also \ninclude a historical overview of general revenue contributions and \nestimates of general revenue contributions in 10 years, 50 years, and \n75 years. The trustees would compare these trends in Medicare funding \nto growth rates for gross domestic product, private health costs, \npublic health costs, and other appropriate measures. And the trustees \nwould report on the costs of the new drug benefit under Medicare Part \nD.\n  The report would also include an analysis of Medicare that assumed \nthat general revenue funding would not exceed 45 percent.\n  Starting in 2005, the Medicare trustees would annually determine \nwhether they projected ``excess general revenue funding'' that is, \n``general revenue funding'' exceeding 45 percent of Medicare outlays \nduring the current year or the next 6 years. If the trustees did so 2 \nyears in a row, it would be a ``Medicare funding warning.''\n  Under the conference agreement, ``general revenue Medicare funding'' \nwould mean total Medicare outlays minus ``dedicated sources.'' \n``Dedicated sources'' would mean funding received from outside the \nFederal Government, specifically: the HI payroll tax, the income tax \nraised by the 1993 changes in taxation of OASDI benefits, amounts \nStates pay to the Federal Government on account of dual-eligibles funds \ncollected by the ``claw-back,'' premiums paid by Medicare, and gifts to \nMedicare. The conference agreement would not include interest on trust \nfund assets in ``dedicated sources,'' as Republican conferees viewed \nthe general fund as needing to pay these amounts to the trust funds.\n  If, for 2 consecutive years of reports, both covering 7-year periods \nof projections, the Medicare Trustees projected that excess general \nrevenue funding would be required in any of those 7 years, then the \nMedicare Program would be subject to special procedures and the \ntrustees would notify the President and Congress. The special \nprocedures would be in force only after the second annual report \nconfirmed that excess general revenue funding would be required.\n  Here is a plausible example of how the system would work. When \nMedicare's trustees issued their March 31, 2010, report, they would \nexamine fiscal years 2010 through 2016. If the trustees projected that \nin 2016, general revenues would exceed 45 percent of Medicare funding, \nthen 2010 would be the ``notice'' year. The conference agreement says \nthat ``Congress and the President should address the matter under \nexisting rules and procedures.''\n  When Medicare's trustees issued their March 31, 2011 report, they \nwould examine fiscal years 2011 through 2017. If the trustees once \nagain projected that in at least one year of those 7 years--for \nexample, 2016 or 2017--general revenues would exceed 45 percent of \nMedicare funding, then 2011 would be the ``warning'' year. The \nconference agreement would trigger actions in the next year, 2012, the \nthird in this series of years.\n  Next, Presidential legislation: Section 802 of the conference \nagreement sets out the Presidential response. After 2 consecutive years \nof trustees' projections that Medicare would have excess general \nrevenue funding, the President would propose legislation in response \nwithin 15 days after the President's first annual budget of the next \nsession of Congress. The legislation could use any means to respond, \nincluding adding to the dedicated sources. But if the legislation in \nresponse did not include matter within the jurisdiction of the Finance \nCommittee, then the Senate discharge procedures would not apply.\n  Now the statutory language says that the bill must ``contain'' matter \nwithin the Finance Committee's jurisdiction. The joint statement of \nmanagers, based on an earlier draft of the bill, says that the bill \nmust be limited to the Finance Committee's jurisdiction. The joint \nstatement of managers is in error on this point. And of course, the \nstatutory language controls.\n  Mr. FRIST. Will the Senator from Montana yield on that point?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield to the majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Montana and rise \nto say that I concur with his remarks that the statement of managers is \nin error and that the statutory language must control. The result would \nbe faithful to the intent of the conferees on this measure.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, returning to my discussion of the conference \nagreement's provisions, the conference agreement expresses a sense of \nCongress that the legislation that the President submits in response \nshould eliminate excess general revenue Medicare funding for the 7-\nfiscal year period. If, during the year in which the trustees issue a \nwarning, Congress enacts legislation that would eliminate excess \ngeneral revenue Medicare funding for the 7-fiscal year period, then the \nPresident would not have to propose legislation in response to the \nlatest warning.\n  The warning would also trigger certain House procedures. Section 803 \nof the conference agreement sets out the procedures for House \nconsideration of the President's legislative proposal. Within 3 days of \nreceiving the President's legislative proposal, the majority leader and \nminority leader of the House, or their designees, would introduce the \nproposal. The legislation would be referred to the appropriate \ncommittees which would be required to report Medicare funding \nlegislation no later than June 30. The chairman of the Budget Committee \nwould certify whether the Medicare funding legislation would eliminate \nexcess general revenue Medicare funding for the 7-fiscal year period.\n  Unless the House of Representatives has voted on final passage of the \nlegislation by July 30, the conference agreement would provided \nfallback procedures. After 30 calendar days--and concurrently 5 \nlegislative days--after the introduction of the legislation, a motion \nto discharge any committee to which the legislation has been referred \nwould be in order, under specified circumstances, and debate on the \nmotion to discharge would be limited to one hour.\n\n[[Page S15742]]\n\n  The conference agreement provides for floor consideration in the \nHouse of the discharged legislation by the Committee of the Whole no \nlater than 3 legislative days after discharge.\n  Now let me turn to Senate procedures. Section 804 of the conference \nagreement sets out the procedures for the Senate consideration of the \nPresident's legislative proposal. Within 3 days of receiving the \nPresident's legislative proposal, the majority leader and minority \nleader of the Senate, or their designees, would introduce the proposal. \nThe Presiding Officer would refer the legislation to the Finance \nCommittee. If the Finance Committee failed to report the legislation--\nwith or without amendment--by June 30, then a single motion to \ndischarge the committee of any Medicare funding legislation would be in \norder. That motion to discharge would be subject to 2 hours of debate. \nIf Congress enacted legislation that the Budget Committee chairman \ncertified eliminated the excess general revenue, then the motion to \ndischarge would not be available for the rest of that session of \nCongress.\n  Once legislation got to the calendar, normal Senate rules would \ngovern its consideration. The motion to proceed to the bill would be \nfully debatable. The bill itself would be fully debatable and \namendable.\n  That is all that this procedure would do.\n  Now, let me take a few moments to talk about what the conference \nagreement on cost control would not do.\n  The conference agreement does not include references to \n``insolvency.'' Some sought to label Medicare general revenue funding \nof more than 45 percent as indicative of ``insolvency'' and \n``unsustainablity.'' The conference agreement contains no such \nlanguage.\n  The conference agreement does not include a hard cap. Some sought a \ncap on Medicare spending after general revenues exceeded 45 percent. \nCongress would have had to vote affirmatively to allow the program to \ncontinue above that point. The conference agreement would not be a cap.\n  The conference agreement does not include a new point of order. Some \nsought a point of order providing that when Medicare general revenues \nrose above 45 percent during the next 7 years for two consecutive \nreports, it would not be in order to consider legislation that would \nincrease the general revenue funding. This requirement would be waived \nor appealed by 60 votes in the Senate. The conference report contains \nno new points of order.\n  The conference agreement does not eliminate rights to filibuster. \nSome sought to eliminate the ability of Senators to filibuster the \nmotion to proceed to the Medicare funding bill and to filibuster the \nbill itself. The conference report does not curtail the right to \nfilibuster either the motion to proceed or the bill itself.\n  In sum, the conference agreement would provide for reports, \nPresidential legislative proposals, and getting a bill on the calendar. \nThe President or White House staff could get the reports with a phone \ncall. The President could already make a legislative proposal whenever \nthe President chooses. And any single Senator can get a bill on the \ncalendar under current rules.\n  Thus although the conference agreement could provide additional \nimpetus to cause these steps to occur, nothing prevents all of them \nfrom occurring under current law.\n  Thus, this is a reasonable set of provisions. And it should not be of \nconcern to those who hold the procedures of the Senate dear.\n\n\n                                S. 1402\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the leadership of the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation for their resolve in \npushing forward with reauthorization for Federal railroad safety \nprograms. The bill reported out of committee, S. 1402, the Federal \nRailroad Safety Improvement Act, will reauthorize the Federal Railroad \nAdministration, and make many important updates to continue to ensure \nsafety on the Nation's railroads.\n  In particular, I thank the chairman for his commitment to work with \nme to address a problem that has been brought to my attention regarding \nthe use of railroad police officers. These railroad employees, who are \ncommissioned by States with law enforcement authority on the railroad \nproperty, are given certain police powers for protecting railroad \nemployees, railroad property, and the general public. The Federal \nGovernment, recognizing that these personnel perform important \nfunctions, has taken steps to extend this authority across States \nborders, as many North American railroads are extensive and traverse \nState boundaries.\n  In this reauthorization, we look to extend this authority even \nfurther, to allow rail police officers to conduct law enforcement \nactivities with respect to railroads other than the rail police \nofficer's employing railroad, as our national system of rail \ntransportation is an interconnected system. While I welcome this \nextension, as these officers perform an important security function to \nprotect our rail system, I feel we should take a closer look at a \nrelated problem--the potential for abuse of this police power. As a \nspecial case of law enforcement officer, rail police officers answer to \nprivate sector employers and are not directly accountable to the public \nlike most law enforcement officers. I am mindful that this could \npresent potential for abuse--that under guide of State law enforcement \nauthority, these rail police officers could engage in activities \nunrelated to law enforcement, such as enforcing railroad company \npolicies or even labor agreements.\n  Given the potential for abuse, I was prepared to offer an amendment \nto the bill during the committee's executive session to address this \nproblem. However, the chairman has graciously committed to working with \nme to resolve the issue, and I look forward to working with him.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I appreciate the concerns of the Senator \nfrom New Jersey and have been working with him to address this issue. \nIt is a complex matter, and one that certainly merits further \nexamination. As such, the ranking member of the committee, Senator \nHollings, and I are writing to the Inspector General of the United \nStates Department of Transportation seeking an assessment of the \nadditional duties performed by rail police officers that are not \nrelated to law enforcement. We are interested to learn whether such \nduties are appropriate, and how potential abuses can be avoided. I am \nconfident that the Inspector General's assessment and recommendations \nwill be useful in helping us craft a bipartisan legislative solution \nshould one be necessary.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I also thank the chairman and the Senator from New \nJersey for their work on this important issue. Reauthorization of \nFederal railroad safety programs is needed, and the chairman has acted \nwith great diligence in advancing this legislation. The issue the \nSenator from New Jersey has raised concerning railroad police officers \nis one that requires a closer examination, and I believe the Inspector \nGeneral can provide valuable input. I look forward to working with both \nof them on this issue.\n\n\n                     definition of negotiated price\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to engage the distinguished \nchairman in a colloquy regarding three sections of the conference \nreport, 1860D-2(d)(1)(B) and 1860D-15(b)(3) as they relate to the new \nPart D prescription drug benefit, and 1860D-31(e)(1)(A)(ii), in order \nto clarify the intent of the conferees with respect to the prices paid \nfor prescription drugs, particularly the concept of negotiated price.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Senator from Montana and my Democratic \npartner in this legislation, Senator Baucus, for seeking to clarify \nthis issue. I would be pleased to engage in a colloquy.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. As I understand the conference report, how the bill \ndefines negotiated price is critical to Medicare beneficiaries, \nprescription drug plans, and Medicare Advantage plans offering \nprescription drug coverage. More specifically, I understand in section \n1860D-2(d)(1)(B) that with respect to drugs purchased under Medicare \nPart D, the intent is for negotiated prices to include ``any dispensing \nfees for such drugs.''\n  I also understand in section 1860D-15(b)(3) that ``gross covered \nprescription drug costs'' includes ``costs directly related to \ndispensing.'' The issue for me then is how the conference report \nintends the Secretary to operationalize the concept of dispensing costs \nespecially with respect to\n\n[[Page S15743]]\n\nMedicare Advantage plans whose Medicare members do not fill \nprescriptions at retail pharmacies.\n  I am referring to plans that operate their own pharmacies and take \npossession of prescription drugs directly from manufacturers and \nwholesalers. For these plans, is it the intent of the conferees that \ndispensing costs include all reasonable costs related to plan \nactivities needed to deliver prescription drugs to their Medicare \nmembers, including the costs of delivering this benefit? For example, \nthis would include salaries for pharmacists, and facility- and \nequipment-related costs.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes, the distinguished Senator is correct. The intent \nof the conference report is to recognize that different Medicare \nAdvantage plans are organized in different ways to deliver the new Part \nD prescription drug benefit and the benefits of the Medicare-endorsed \ndrug discount card.\n  The conferees understand that Medicare members of some Medicare \nAdvantage plans fill their prescription in retail pharmacies and others \nin a plans' own pharmacies. For Medicare beneficiaries that will be \nusing retail pharmacies to fill their prescriptions, the conferees \nunderstand that the prices negotiated between the prescription drug \nplan or the Medicare Advantage plan plus dispensing-related costs \ninclude the pharmacies' reasonable overhead costs.\n  Similarly, it is the conferees' intention that Medicare Advantage \nplans whose Medicare members do not use retail pharmacies, but instead \nfill their prescriptions at the plan's pharmacies be reimbursed for the \ncosts they incur in delivering the benefit when reimbursed for the same \ntypes of costs.\n\n\n                              section 507\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. I coauthored Section 507 of H.R. 1, the Prescription Drug \nand Medicare Improvement Act of 2003, which would amend current law \nregarding physician self-referrals. I would like to engage in a \ncolloquy with my colleague, Mr. Grassley, in relation to the exception \nlanguage contained in this provision.\n  I would like to clarify congressional intent with regard to the \n``exception'' language included in S. 1, as this language may \nultimately be included in any compromise between the two bills.\n  I would like to discuss the extent to which the Secretary would have \ndiscretion to exempt a hospital based on the factors identified in the \nlanguage. The language in the conference agreement states that, for the \npurpose of determining whether a hospital qualifies as under \ndevelopment, and therefore exempt from the self-referral limitation, \nthe Secretary:\n\n     . . . shall consider--\n       (1) whether architectural plans have been completed, \n     funding has been received, zoning requirements have been met, \n     and necessary approvals from appropriate State agencies have \n     been received; and\n       (2) any other evidence the Secretary determines would \n     indicate whether a hospital is under development as of such \n     date.\n\n  It was my intent in crafting this language that the factors outlined \nwould serve as an illustrative guide to the Secretary. The Secretary \n``shall consider'' these factors, but will not be required to see that \neach and every factor is met. Is it your interpretation, that the \nSecretary would have discretion to make a reasonable determination of \nwhether a specialty hospital is ``under development''?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes, I believe you are correct in saying that the \nSecretary would have discretion to consider these factors, but would \nnot be limited to or bound by those factors. The language states that \nthe Secretary ``shall consider,'' which implies that the Secretary \nshall consider these factors but that he or she should use the factors \nto make a reasonable decision as to whether a speciality hospital was \n``under development'' as of a certain date.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Is it your understanding that a specialty hospital that \nhas, as of November 18, 2003, met zoning requirements, received \napproval from the local planning board, and received partial funding, \nbut has not yet completed all architectural plans would quality for the \nexception?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes, it is my understanding that the Secretary would \nhave discretion to determine to what extent the hospital was under \ndevelopment as of November 18, 2003. If the Secretary found that the \nhospital was ``under development'' despite not having completed all \narchitectural plans, the Secretary could exempt that speciality \nhospital from the 18-month self-referral limitation.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Similarly, is it your understanding that a specialty \nhospital that has completed or substantially completed architectural \nplans but has not yet received full funding would also qualify for the \nexception?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The Secretary would have discretion to exempt a \nhospital that had completed architectural plans and initiated funding \nand, in making this determination, would consider the extent to which \nthe other enumerated factors had been completed. It is my understanding \nthat the language included in H.R. 1 is meant to provide guidance to \nthe Secretary, and that the Secretary will ultimately determine to what \nextent the factors have been met and to what extent the hospital was \n``under development'' as of November 18, 2003.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I thank my distinguished colleague for engaging in the \ncolloquy.\n\n\n              Retail Pharmacies and Community Pharmacists\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to engage the distinguished \nchairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Grassley, in a colloquy \nregarding benefits that Medicare beneficiaries may receive through \nretail pharmacies and community pharmacists.\n  Section 1860D-4 of the conference report to accompany the Medicare \nPrescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 states \nthat sponsors of Medicare drug plans or organizations that offer \nMedicareAdvantage plans shall permit plan enrollees to receive benefits \nthrough a pharmacy other than a mail-order pharmacy. These benefits may \ninclude a 90-day supply of drugs or biologicals. The conference report \nstates that such enrollees would pay any differential in charge.\n  I offered the amendment to add this language to the Senate version of \nthe Medicare bill during our debate in June. My intent in offering this \namendment was to prohibit plans from implementing restrictions that \nwould steer consumers to mail-order pharmacies. The Senate voted 95 to \n0 in favor of requiring Medicare drug plans and MedicareAdvantage \norganizations to allow local community pharmacists to fill long-term \nprescriptions and offer any other services that they are equipped and \nlicensed to provide.\n  The language does permit a Medicare drug plan or MedicareAdvantage \norganization to charge a different copayment for a mail-order \nprescription versus a prescription filled by a community pharmacist. \nThis happens today in many health plans.\n  I note that the conference report would require plans to provide \nclear information about copayments and deductibles. This information \nwould have to include details on the differences in charges between \nmail-order and retail prescriptions.\n  My concern is that any differences in charges between mail order and \nretail be reasonable differences, based on the actual cost of \ndelivering the service. I would be concerned if differences in charges \nwere used as a method of steering seniors and the disabled to mail \norder pharmacies.\n  I know that Chairman Grassley and I both agree that since seniors \ntrust their local pharmacists, they should be allowed to keep those \nrelationships in place.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Wyoming that \nMedicare drug plans and MedicareAdvantage organizations should not \nforce seniors or the disabled to choose a mail-order house when they \nwould prefer to patronize their local community pharmacy.\n  The Senator from Wyoming is correct in noting that the conference \nreport permits plans to set a different charge to the beneficiary for a \nmail-order prescription versus a retail prescription. However, it is my \nexpectation that any differential in charge be reasonable and based on \nthe actual cost of providing the service in or through the setting in \nwhich it is provided. I also would expect that the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services would disapprove of any plan that would impose a \ndifferential charge that was intended primarily to steer Medicare \nbeneficiaries to mail-order pharmacies versus retail pharmacies.\n\n[[Page S15744]]\n\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the distinguished chairman for this clarification.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I have voted today to oppose the \ntermination of debate on the Medicare Conference Report because I have \ncarefully analyzed the report and come to the conclusion that far from \nbeing a bipartisan compromise on prescription drug benefits, the report \nis nothing short of an attempt to compromise the integrity of the \nMedicare and Medicaid system as we know it.\n  When it comes to health care in America, there are many parties in \ninterest--providers, patients, care facilities, and pharmaceutical \nsuppliers, to name a few. These groups have interests that may, at \ntimes, be in conflict, but I believe one overwhelming interest unites \nthem all: providing the American public with the health care services \nand treatment that it needs. Regrettably, I find that the report we \nhave been asked to consider has abandoned this powerful unifying \nprinciple.\n  Worse than abandoning our commitment to the health of our Nation, \nwhen viewed as a whole, the report strikes at the foundation of the \nMedicare and Medicaid system. Rather than buttressing the system of \ncomprehensive care for our senior citizens and disabled persons, the \nreport actually sows the seeds of its demise by undermining its ability \nto provide a prescription drug benefit, subsidizing competing private \nhealth plans, and increasing Medicare premiums without increasing the \nbenefits provided.\n  The overwhelming drive to reconsider the Medicare and Medicaid \nsystems came from listening to our constituents and their frustration \nwith the ever-increasing cost of the medicines they needed. From blood \nthinners, to antibiotics, to state-of-the-art pharmaceuticals for \ncancer and HIV/AIDS, the cry for help was clear: the cost of \nprescription drugs was breaking the backs of the Americans who were \npaying for these expensive, but life-saving therapies.\n  Far from addressing these needs, however, the report actually makes \nthe problem worse. On the administrative level, the report dilutes the \nMedicare systems's purchasing power by mandating the purchase of \nnecessary medications by individual Medicare regions, rather than as a \nwhole system. With more individual buyers, pharmaceutical companies are \nmore able than ever to raise their prices, because the individual \nregions will have less bargaining power.\n  The report will also impact average beneficiaries by potentially \ndepriving them of the specific drugs they need by providing coverage \nfor only one or two of each class of drug. In a world where antibiotic \nresistant strains of common ailments are on the rise, this could be a \nvery expensive proposition, if the drug you need is not one of the \ncovered drugs in the antibiotic class. Difficulties only escalate in \nmedically complex cases where patients' individual responses to \npharmaceutical may vary dramatically, as in treatments for high blood \npressure, high cholesterol, cancer, and HIV/AIDS.\n\n  Even worse, what flexibility there is in the report to tailor the \nlimited drug benefit to the needs of individual patients must now be \nrequested and petitioned for by the patients themselves. Placing the \npaperwork burden on seniors and the disabled only shifts the burden to \nthe people least able to bear it, and I would not be surprised to learn \nthat as a result, more and more beneficiaries will lose access to the \nmedicines they need.\n  Finally, the report strikes a further blow to more than 6 million of \nour neediest citizens, those who are eligible for both Medicare and \nMedicaid. At present, States have the statutory flexibility to make any \ncopayments for persons who are ``dual eligible.'' Under the report, \nhowever, persons with dual coverage will face increased out-of-pocket \nexpenses because States will lose this flexibility. As a result, \nAmericans who are already below the poverty level would be expected to \nmake copayments between $1 and $3--a great hardship for single persons \nwith incomes of less than $8980 per year, and couples with incomes of \nless than $12,120 per year.\n  More than failing to provide the promised prescription drug benefit, \nhowever, the report actually paves the way for eventually dismantling \nMedicare and Medicaid altogether. The report establishes a \ndemonstration project for ``premium support'' in six metropolitan \nareas. ``Premium support'' does not mean, as one might think, \nadditional Federal support for areas where costs are especially high, \nand premiums are not sufficient to cover all expense. Just the \nopposite, it is a way of increasing the Medicare premiums Americans pay \nin order to compensate for rising health care costs. Moreover, with a \n``demonstration project'' such as this in place, it would be a simple \nstep to broaden the ``project'' to include the entire United States--\nand with an estimate average 25 percent increase in premiums, the costs \nto American citizens would be substantial.\n  The report would also provide a $12 billion subsidy to private Health \nMaintenance Organizations and Preferred Provider Organizations--HMOs \nand PPOs. With a massive subsidy such as this, there will be no \nquestion but that HMOs and PPOs will have a competitive edge over \nMedicare because they will receive more money per plan participant than \nMedicare will--and with more money, subsidized insurers will be able to \nprovide more benefits.\n  ``Premium support'' and a $12 billion subsidy for private insurers \nlook suspiciously like a one-two punch aimed at Medicare. On the one \nhand, ``premium support'' will increase the cost of Medicare without \nraising benefit levels, while on the other, a multi-billion dollar \nsubsidy will allow HMOs and PPOs to slash premiums and provide more \nservices. Add to this a prescription drug benefit that actually leaves \nmillions of Americans worse off than they are now, and it is difficult \nto see how this conference report responds to the simple unifying \nprinciple of our health care system: providing Americans with the \nhealth care they need.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, our seniors deserve a comprehensive, \nmeaningful drug benefit under Medicare--it's something that I, like so \nmany of my colleagues, have been fighting for years. The world of \nhealth care has changed, and Medicare should be updated to give seniors \nthe services and care they need.\n  I voted for this bill when it first came to the Senate because I \nthought it was a good start, and I hoped we could build on it in \nconference. Unfortunately, now that I see the result, I have to say \nthis is not good enough for New York's seniors--in fact, the bad parts \noutweigh the good.\n  The bill contains some good things--it provides a good benefit for \nseniors who have low incomes or very high drug costs who have no other \ndrug coverage. But for the average middle class senior with moderate \ndrug costs, the benefit is much too small.\n  In fact, the way this benefit is structured, hundreds of thousands of \nNew Yorkers who currently have coverage may actually end up worse off \nthan they are today--and that doesn't sound like a benefit to me.\n  When I voted for the bill the first time around, I said that if it \ngot any weaker, got any closer to the House version, I could not, in \ngood conscience, support it. And, unfortunately, that seems to be what \nhas happened here.\n  Other than the generic drug provisions--which represent a huge win \nfor consumers across the board--it seems in every other case where the \nchoice was between seniors and the big drug companies, the big drug \ncompanies have won.\n  Of all the bad things in this bill, the thing that angers me the most \nis that Congress has squandered away the single best weapon we have \nagainst rising drug costs by forbidding Medicare from using its buying \npower to negotiate lower drug prices with the drug companies.\n  At a time of rising budget deficits and escalating costs, it really \nmakes you wonder why the Congress would go out of its way to forbid the \nFederal Government from using its buying power to get prices like we do \nthrough the VA.\n  If the Federal Government leveraged its full buying power under \nMedicare, we might not have a doughnut hole in this benefit at all.\n  The impact of this reckless prohibition is best seen by a Boston \nUniversity study that shows that the drug companies will earn windfall \nprofits of $139 billion over the next eight years alone from this bill.\n\n[[Page S15745]]\n\n  This bill not only ensures we will be paying the highest possible \nprice for drugs in this country, but it also guts any chance at \nreimportation--guaranteeing the drug companies a captive audience.\n  Is that the Republicans' idea of cost containment?\n  What this bill does is ensure that the government is gouged by the \ndrug companies while putting a huge bulls-eye on the Medicare program. \nThe prohibition on negotiating and artificial ``cost containment'' \nmechanisms in this bill will simply help the opponents of Medicare \njustify shifting more and more costs onto the backs of seniors.\n  Under the drug benefit before the Senate today, the average middle \nclass senior could still be saddled with up to 80 percent of their drug \ncosts. And almost 30 percent of beneficiaries would actually pay more \nfor this Medicare drug benefit than they would be getting back in drug \ncoverage. What kind of relief is that?\n  So this bill represents a paltry benefit--or no benefit at all--for \nmost people who currently have no drug coverage. I had hoped that the \nbill would--at the very least--help provide a down payment for the one-\nthird of New Yorkers who currently have no coverage, but I don't think \nit even does that.\n  In fact, there is a very good chance this benefit will actually \njeopardize access to affordable drugs for New Yorkers who currently \nhave good coverage.\n  Of the 2.7 million Medicare beneficiaries in New York State, 989,000 \nhave prescription drug coverage from their former employers; 329,000 \nare enrolled in the state's pharmaceutical program--known as EPIC; and \nabout 537,000 are covered under New York's Medicaid program.\n  First, let's look at the EPIC program. Right now, EPIC is available \nto individuals with incomes less than $35,000 and couples with incomes \nless than $50,000. People in EPIC currently have access to nearly any \ndrug their doctors prescribe, and can go to virtually any pharmacy in \nthe state to get their prescriptions filled.\n  I fought to get strong language in the Senate version of the Medicare \nbill that would have provided these New Yorkers with a benefit better \nthan the one they get through EPIC.\n  The Senate bill would have provided New York State a subsidy equal to \nabout $375 million per year to help it continue the EPIC and even \nexpand it to provide a more generous benefit, to cover the disabled, \nwhich the State currently does not do, and to enroll even more people.\n  The watered-down compromise in the conference report leaves far too \nmany questions unanswered.\n  Under the bill, if the State wants to use any of the new Federal \ninvestment in Medicare, it has to force EPIC seniors to go and enroll \nin a Medicare private plan and the State legislature will have to go \nback to the drawing board and restructure the entire EPIC program to \ncoordinate with the Medicare plans.\n  The end result will be a program so laden with red tape that it is a \nvirtual certainty that seniors fall through the cracks and lose \ncoverage. It will be an administrative nightmare for the State to \nimplement.\n  I have yet to hear one compelling argument for how the bill before \nthe Senate will enhance the EPIC program. The State can't even tell me \nwhat will happen to EPIC and the 329,000 seniors who depend on it if \nthis Medicare bill passes.\n  Even more shocking is that the bill gives the private Medicare plans \na say in how generous any additional state coverage can be. The way I \nread it, under the new scheme, the Medicare plans will be able to limit \nwhich drugs an enrollee has access to and limit what pharmacies they \ncan go to--no such restrictions currently exist for EPIC enrollees. In \nshort, when it comes to EPIC, many seniors may be worse off with the \nbill than without it.\n  One of the other major concerns I have about this bill is that it \nsimply doesn't do enough to protect retirees who have good employer-\nsponsored coverage.\n  The conferees made some progress toward reducing the employer drop \nrate by giving employers a tax break worth an additional $18 billion. \nHowever, to truly protect retirees from losing coverage would cost \nabout $65 billion.\n  Even with the change made in conference, an estimated 215,000 New \nYorkers will likely lose their retiree coverage if this bill becomes \nlaw, and many others may see their options narrowed. That's simply too \nbig a risk for me.\n  In addition, starting in 2005, all Medicare beneficiaries would be \nsaddled with higher deductibles for doctor visits. Under the bill, \nMedicare premiums would no longer be universal, but higher for all \nbeneficiaries with incomes of $80,000 and up--a provision which \ndisproportionately affects states like New York.\n  In addition, over 500,000 Medicare beneficiaries in New York--living \nin Rochester, Buffalo, Glens Falls and the Capital Region--may be \nselected for the premium support demonstration program which would \nprovide seniors with a false choice of entering a private plan or being \nforced to pay more for traditional Medicare.\n  As I have said, the bill does provide a good benefit for low-income \nseniors and seniors with very high drug costs who don't have access to \nany other drug coverage. However, the new assets test in the conference \nversion of the bill means that about 150,000 fewer people will qualify \nfor these low income subsidies than under the Senate bill.\n  Even the seniors who do get this additional assistance will face \nconfusing and difficult choices each year about which Medicare plan to \nchoose.\n  They will face a confounding maze trying to figure out which plan \nwill cover the drugs they use and allow them to continue to go to the \ndrug store down the street. If they are even lucky enough to find such \na plan, it could be gone the next year, or change its premiums or its \nlist of covered drugs, and seniors would be back to square one.\n  Of course, despite all of these negatives, there are some very \nimportant provisions in this bill which make my decision a very \ndifficult one.\n  The bill includes significant relief for rural, small community and \nsmall city hospitals--about $344 million over 10 years for New York's \nhospitals, which is crucial to ensuring access to high quality care not \nonly in the very rural areas of the state, but also in and around \nupstate cities like Syracuse, Rochester, and Buffalo.\n  There is also modest relief for the nation's teaching hospitals in \nthe bill--but it is not nearly enough. New York institutions would see \nan additional $76 million over the next four years, but this only \nrestores about 11 percent of the total cuts they face over that time \nperiod.\n  The Nation's teaching hospitals are the backbone of our health care \nsystem--they do the research and they train the doctors--and I am \nworried we will not get another opportunity to provide them the \nresources they need to do their job.\n  The bill also addresses the crisis in physician payments which was \ndriving so many physicians out of the Medicare program and leaving \nseniors in the lurch. These provider issues must be addressed--we've \nfought back the draconian cuts in the Balanced Budget Act for five \nyears now. Our providers are struggling, and it's time to set things \nstraight.\n  I am pleased that the bill includes provisions based on a bill I \nintroduced with Senator Santorum to stabilize the Medicare+Choice \nprogram in the short term.\n  The changes will ensure that plans in places like Long Island and \nWestchester get paid on par with plans in other areas of the country \nand will help significantly bring down premiums in these areas over the \nnext few years.\n  Perhaps the biggest win in the bill--not only for seniors, but for \nall consumers, employers, and purchasers of prescription drugs--is the \nextraordinary victory we have achieved in the face of the unprecedented \ninfluence of the big pharmaceutical companies: generic drugs.\n  The generic drug provisions which Senators Gregg, Kennedy, McCain and \nI have been fighting for over the past few years--and which passed the \nSenate by a vote of 94-1--represent a huge step forward for all \nseniors, consumers, and purchasers of prescription drugs.\n\n  The provisions close loopholes in the law and end the abusive \npractices in the pharmaceutical industry which have kept lower-priced \ngenerics off the market and cost consumers billions of dollars.\n\n[[Page S15746]]\n\n  The Gregg-Schumer amendments to the Hatch-Waxman Act, would put an \nend to the practice of brand companies listing frivolous patents for \nthe sole purpose of automatically delaying generic approval. It would \nalso ensure that the 180-day exclusivity period enjoyed by the first \ngeneric to challenge a patent cannot be used as a bottleneck to prevent \nadditional generic competition.\n  First, the Gregg-Schumer provisions would limit brand drug companies \nto a single 30-month stay of generic approval, and only on patents \nlisted at the FDA before a generic application is filed. This way, the \n30-month stay--if there is one at all--will run concurrent with FDA \napproval of the generic application and minimize delay.\n  Second, key to ensuring that patent issues are resolved in a timely \nway, the provisions clarify that a generic applicant has a right to \nseek a declaratory judgment that its product does not infringe a patent \nor that a patent is invalid, and direct courts that they must hear \nthese declaratory judgment cases to the maximum extent permitted by the \nConstitution.\n  With the removal of the automatic 30-month stay, if the generic \ncompany did not have a clear right to seek resolution of potential \npatent disputes on its own, the brand company could simply file a new \npatent and sit back and wait--leaving the generic at risk of being sued \nand having to pay triple the brand's lost profits if it does decide to \nenter the market. This clarification of the courts' jurisdiction will \nhave an immediate effect on both pending and future declaratory \njudgment actions brought by generic applicants.\n  Third, the provisions enforce the patent listing requirements at the \nFDA by allowing a generic applicant, when it has been sued for patent \ninfringement, to file a counterclaim to have the brand drug company \ndelist the patent or correct the patent information in FDA's Orange \nBook.\n  Fourth, the generic provisions revamp the 180-day exclusivity \nincentive provided in the Hatch-Waxman Act. Under the act, the first \ngeneric drug company to challenge a patent on a brand drug has the \nexclusive right to market its drug for 6 months before any other \ngeneric can compete. This feature encourages generic applicants to \nchallenge weak patents and brings consumers much quicker access to \naffordable generic drugs.\n  However, at times, brand and generic companies have abused this \nexclusivity period--both through collusive agreements and use of other \ntactics that allow the provision to act as a bottleneck to generic \ncompetition. The Gregg-Schumer provisions end this abuse because the \ngeneric company forfeits its exclusivity if it doesn't go to market in \na timely manner.\n  The way the provision works, if another generic applicant has \nresolved patent disputes on the patents which earned the first to file \nits exclusivity--either through a court decision, settlement, dismissal \nbecause the brand company says it does not intend to sue, or withdrawal \nof the patent by the brand company--the first generic applicant has to \ngo to market within 75 days or it forfeits its right to the \nexclusivity.\n  If it forfeits, then the exclusivity is lost and any other generic \napplicant that is ready to be approved and go to market can go. Either \nway, the provision ensures that consumers have access to a low-cost \ngeneric as soon as possible.\n  I am very pleased that the conferees preserved these important, pro-\nconsumer cost containment provisions. Indeed, they are the only part of \nthis bill where consumers, seniors, and taxpayers prevail over the big \ndrug companies.\n  In closing, I had truly hoped this Congress would craft and pass a \nmeaningful Medicare drug benefit for seniors--one which would have \nprotected beneficiaries who have access to good coverage through other \nprograms and which would have provided real relief to seniors with no \nother choice.\n  While it contains some good provisions, the package before us does \nneither. I think we can do better, and we owe it to the 40 million \nseniors in this nation who have waited decades for drug coverage under \nMedicare to do better than this.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, on July 30, 1965, President Lyndon B. \nJohnson stood with President Harry Truman and, together, they delivered \nthe Medicare program. They proudly addressed the American people as \nPresident Johnson proclaimed, ``No longer will older Americans be \ndenied the healing miracle of modern medicine. No longer will illness \ncrush and destroy the savings that they have so carefully put away over \na lifetime so that they might enjoy dignity in their later years.'' \nToday, those words still move me and yet, if I am to be honest, they \nalso haunt me as we consider the Medicare reform legislation before us. \nI know that this legislation charts a course that will begin to undo \nthe good works of our former Presidents and of a program that is \nperhaps the single most effective public initiative in our nation's \nhistory. Medicare has literally saved the lives of our seniors, keeping \nthem from poverty and providing the peace of mind that comes with \nsecurity. For this reason, I have a heavy heart and a sense of near \ndread about this bill. My heart is heavy because I know that this bill \nto reform and ``improve'' Medicare is deeply, fundamentally flawed. \nThis is not what Presidents Johnson and Truman wanted for the millions \nof our parents and grandparents who made America strong, and it is not \nwhat I want, either.\n  For many years, we have talked about the need for a prescription drug \nbenefit under Medicare. For a brief moment, I believed we in the Senate \nwere serious about delivering a meaningful benefit. However, I cannot \nsupport the Republican Medicare prescription drug bill because it \nforces seniors to choose between paying more for their own doctor or \nsigning up with an HMO; leaves seniors to pay thousands in out of \npocket costs; eliminates employer drug coverage for 2.7 million \nretirees; prevents efforts to keep drug costs down; and effectively \nprohibits seniors from importing cheaper drugs from Canada.\n  I recognize that this bill commits $400 billion to a Medicare \nprescription drug benefit and truly helps some low income seniors who \nare without coverage today, and I am glad that it gives a critical \nboost to rural hospitals and doctors. But the fine print matters and \nwill have very dangerous consequences for how much seniors have to pay \nfor their Medicare benefit, whether this drug benefit really serves \nseniors, and whether we are strengthening or weakening Medicare for the \nfuture. I have always said that a Medicare prescription drug bill must \nbe voluntary, affordable and accessible to all Medicare beneficiaries; \nmust truly help with the high cost of prescription drugs; and must \nstrengthen the Medicare program for the future. This bill fails on all \ncounts.\n  West Virginians and many of my colleagues know I have been working on \nMedicare for 20 years. I sat on the Medicare Commission for a year \nduring which we debated the best way to improve Medicare. Before that, \nI chaired the U.S. Bipartisan Commission on Comprehensive Health Care, \nwhich discussed ways to address the problems of the uninsured and the \nneed for long-term care reform in this country. Today, I am the ranking \nmember of the health subcommittee of the Senate Finance Committee. I \nwas a member of the conference committee on this bill--but in name \nonly, not in practice. Nevertheless, my goal has always been, and \ncontinues to be, improving Medicare and the quality of health care \navailable to all Americans. This bill does not improve this program. \nThis bill harms this program--actually harms Medicare.\n  This bill is a tool to force seniors to leave the traditional \nMedicare program they know and trust in order to obtain the drug \nbenefit they need and deserve. Many people have said that this plan is \nvoluntary and, therefore, if a senior chooses to stay in traditional \nMedicare and get a drug benefit, he or she can do so. This legislation \ndoes not guarantee that in any way. Under this legislation, seniors \nwill have two different options for receiving a drug benefit. The first \noption is to stay in traditional Medicare for their doctor and hospital \nservices and enroll in a ``drug-only plan'' to receive their drugs. The \nsecond option is to give up traditional Medicare and enroll in a HMO or \nPPO for all of their health care services. You may ask: what is a drug-\nonly plan and how does one work? The answer is that we have no idea \nbecause no such entity exists today. It is a completely new concept\n\n[[Page S15747]]\n\nwhich the Administrator of CMS said does not exist in nature and would \nprobably not work in practice. The former head of the Health Insurance \nAssociation of America said that drug-only plans are like insuring \nagainst haircuts. So, it's completely uncertain whether these plans \nwill emerge, but let's say for a moment that they do. Well, at least \nseniors should be assured that they can remain in traditional Medicare \nand get a prescription drug benefit, right? Wrong. There is no limit on \nwhat these drug-only plans can charge seniors none at all. These plans \ncould charge seniors $100, $500, or even $1,000 per month. These \npremiums could be completely prohibitive. West Virginia seniors will \ncertainly not be able to afford premiums that high. If that is the \ncase, seniors will not really have the option to stay in traditional \nMedicare and get a prescription drug benefit. They will be forced to \nenroll in an HMO in order to get a drug benefit and that is not what \nour seniors want.\n  Again, to be fair, this bill has some provisions, including those \naffecting physician services and rural hospitals that will be helpful \nto my home State of West Virginia. I fully recognize that; in fact, I \npushed for these because I understand that good care is critical to \ngood health, and that we must adequately reimburse Medicare providers \nfor that good care.\n  However, despite this, I have grave concerns about the compromise \nproduced by the Conference Committee charged with reconciling \ndifferences between the House- and Senate-passed Medicare reform bills. \nI was on the conference committee. I understand the arguments on both \nsides. And now, more than ever, I believe that the Congress needs to \npass a meaningful prescription drug benefit that gives seniors more for \ntheir money, not less. I do not want to privatize Medicare, undermine \nexisting retiree coverage, or force seniors to flip-flop between plans. \nUnfortunately, this bill would do all of that and more. Today, 339,000 \nseniors live in West Virginia. Nearly 30,000 West Virginia seniors will \nlose their employer-sponsored prescription drug coverage simply because \nof the enactment of this bill. As health savings accounts (HSAs) \ncreated by this legislation select and cover healthier, younger \nseniors, employers will be left to cover sicker, older seniors. \nEmployers will see their health care costs rise and they will be priced \nout of continuing to provide employees or retirees with coverage, \nleaving remaining retirees with a benefit that is less desirable than \nthey had before. Meanwhile, 70,000 West Virginia seniors will fall into \na $2,800 coverage gap, forcing them to bear the total cost of their \ndrug themselves until they reach the end of that gap. In fact, the \navailable benefit will be so stingy that many seniors will pay more for \nthis drug plan than they will receive in actual drug benefits.\n\n  At the same time, private insurance plans will be assured even \ngreater profits through a $12 billion ``slush fund'' created by this \nlegislation. Proponents argue that this ``slush fund'' is necessary to \nbring HMOs into rural areas. The fact is that this additional funding \nis necessary because HMOs have overhead costs. They have to pay their \ninvestors, provide a return to their stockholders and they have to pay \nfor good marketing materials because that's the best way to skim off \nthe healthiest seniors. On average, private plans have administrative \ncosts that are about 15 percent of total spending whereas Medicare's \nadministrative costs are 2 to 3 percent of total spending. There is no \nway that private plans can be as efficient as Medicare. Yet I am not \nopposed to allowing them to compete fairly with Medicare. However, we \nshould make them compete on a level playing field. We should make them \ncompete by creating efficiencies. We shouldn't take money away from the \nhighly efficient Medicare program and give it to the HMOs to help them \ninstead of seniors. That is not the free-market at work. That is not \nreal competition. And, while a ``premium support'' demonstration, which \neffectively allows a voucher system instead of a real Medicare \nprescription drug benefit, will take place in six metropolitan \nstatistical areas (MSAs) initially, I believe we can safely assume that \nthis demonstration is meant to be standard at some point. This \ndemonstration is expected to raise monthly Medicare premiums by 26 \npercent.\n  Perhaps most disturbing, 45,000 ``dual eligible'' beneficiaries will \npay more for every prescription drug they receive under this \nlegislation. Dual eligibles are seniors who qualify for Medicaid by \nvirtue of their income. They currently receive drug coverage under \nMedicaid. In my State of West Virginia, these seniors pay between $0.50 \nand $2.00 per prescription depending on the total cost of the drug. \nUnder this legislation, they could be required to pay twice that much. \nI want to be clear on this point because I was among those insisting \nthat the dual eligibles be included under the Medicare benefit and not \nleft in Medicaid. I believe this conference report does the right thing \nby including these seniors in the Medicare benefit. However, this \nlegislation precludes States from ``wrapping around'' Medicare. In \nother words, States will not receive any Federal dollars for assisting \ndual eligible beneficiaries with the costs not covered by Medicare. \nThis is unprecedented. For every other benefit covered by Medicaid but \nnot by Medicare, the states receive a Federal match to provide those \nbenefits to our poorest seniors. For example, Medicaid covers long-term \ncare but Medicare does not. So, for those seniors who are also eligible \nfor Medicaid, the Federal Government provides matching dollars to \nstates to provide long-term care to dual eligibles. This conference \nreport completely twists that concept of protecting our poorest seniors \nagainst increased costs in an unprecedented way. This arrangement \nrepresents a fundamental change in the relationship between Medicare \nand Medicaid. Many predict that the individuals affected will choose to \nforgo the prescription drugs that they need rather than try to pay what \nthey cannot afford.\n  In my judgment, this bill represents the greatest threat to the \nMedicare program since its enactment. While numerous opportunities \nexisted to strengthen it, they were wasted. Instead of devoting $12 \nbillion to closing the $2,800 coverage gap, this conference report \ngives it to HMOs. Instead of protecting the right of our seniors to \nstay in traditional Medicare and get a prescription drug benefit, this \nbill protects the rights of the private plans to charge any premium \nthey want. Instead of shoring up retiree coverage for the two to three \nmillion beneficiaries across the United States who will lose drug \ncoverage as a result of this bill, this bill includes tax shelters that \nthreaten to undermine the entire employer-based system. This bill is a \ngive-away to special interests, compiled in the dead of night, under \nwraps. It is shameful. Public policy, like life, is about choices and \nthis bill makes all the wrong choices for our seniors.\n  While I have painted a bleak picture, I strongly believe that we can \navoid disaster. We can do so by putting this bill aside and coming back \nto the table with a proposal that helps seniors and protects the long-\nterm viability of what is a truly great program. We can take into \naccount the seniors who won't benefit from the low-income provisions in \nthe bill. We can protect retirees, and we can implement positive reform \nthat is productive, not destructive, confusing, or manipulative. It is \nnot too late. It is not too late. I urge my colleagues to reject this \nbill and to immediately go back to work for the kind of Medicare drug \nbenefit seniors deserve.\n   Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, we stand here today at a historic moment \nin this country as we begin consideration of the Medicare prescription \ndrug bill. This bill is a triumph not for a party or a President but \nfor America's seniors and their families. This is an incredibly hopeful \nday for all Americans who long for a national government that can get \nthings done for people.\n   I campaigned on a promise to get things done--deliver to the \nAmerican people what they need to live better lives and what they are \nlooking to Congress to accomplish to make America a stronger country. \nPrescription drugs, energy, partial-birth abortion were all at the top \nof the list of issues that most Americans were looking for Congress to \ntake action. Their seemingly simple request was for us here in \nWashington to put politics aside and do what is right for the American \npublic.\n   I am proud to say we are seeing that happen with this Medicare bill. \nThis is a bipartisan effort that, although not\n\n[[Page S15748]]\n\nperfect, makes a good start at addressing the needs of Minnesota's \nseniors and health care providers as well as those across this country.\n   This is the largest and most comprehensive rural health care \nimprovement package ever contemplated by this body. Last year, as I \ncampaigned across Minnesota and spent many hours talking to our rural \nhealth care providers, it was apparent to me that most of our hospitals \nand doctors had given up hope for fair Medicare reimbursement.\n   Thanks to the strong leadership of Chairman Grassley, we have a bill \nbefore us that has $26 billion--or $2.6 billion each year for 10 \nyears--for rural providers, something that one short year ago seemed \nnearly impossible.\n   Quality rural health care is one of the foundations of our rural \ncommunities--this isn't simply about making sure our rural hospitals \nare adequately reimbursed. This is about preserving a way of life in \nAmerica.\n   Without rural hospitals and physicians, it is tough to raise a \nfamily and hard to attract new businesses to rural communities. Without \naccess to health care, many of our out-state towns simply couldn't \nexist.\n   This bill seeks to eliminate many of the disparities in \nreimbursement rates that have existed too long and crippled the rural \nhealth system. Hospitals, physicians, and ambulances, as well as all of \nthose health professionals who work within these systems will not see \nMedicare reimbursement rates that better reflect the realities of the \ncosts of providing care in rural communities.\n   As I look back on the accomplishments of the first session of the \n108th Congress, addressing the rural health care payment disparity \nunder the Medicare program will undoubtedly be one of the most \nmeaningful achievements to Minnesotans. Many said it couldn't be done, \nand today I have the great opportunity to come to the Senate floor and \ntell my constituents that we will be voting on a bill that takes a \nmajor step in providing equality with urban payments that will \nsignificantly improve their ability to provide quality care.\n   Minnesota has a long tradition of providing high quality care, but \nmany of our seniors have not had access to this care because of the \nlack of prescription drug coverage under the Medicare program.\n   Again, I have the great honor coming here and announcing to the \nseniors back home that help is on the way.\n   Beginning in 2006, the 677,400 Medicare beneficiaries in Minnesota \nwill have access to drug coverage for the first time in the history \nof the Medicare program, and 187,356 of these people would not \notherwise have access to drug coverage.\n\n  That means access to new drug therapies that could never been \nimagined in 1965 when Medicare was created. It is time to bring this \nprogram in line with current medical practices. A 1965 Cadillac is a \nclassic. A 1965 health care benefit is a travesty.\n  This bill will provide prescription drug coverage for 41 million \npeople in this country--41 million people! Is this the perfect benefit? \nI'm not sure what the perfect benefit realistically looks like. But I \ndo know that the average senior's drug costs will be cut roughly in \nhalf under this proposal. That is meaningful assistance for all seniors \nand the bill provides even more assistance for those low-income seniors \nwho need us to shoulder even more of the burden.\n  Let's not let perfect be the enemy of good. In the words of the AARP, \none of the largest senior associations, ``Millions of Americans can't \nafford to wait for perfect.''\n  And we know that drugs are most effective when used to prevent the \nonset of a health condition. Right now almost 93 percent of our health \ncare dollars go to treat a person who is sick. While we have amazing \nscreening and early detection capabilities, we have a program that \nwaits for people to develop dangerous and costly conditions before they \ncan receive care.\n  It appears to me that this is a 1965 model of care, not a model that \nbelongs in a 2003 health care system. This bill for the first time \nincludes a ``Welcome to Medicare'' physical that will allow \nbeneficiaries to get an assessment of their health condition and \npossibly detect conditions that could possibly escalate over time. It \nalso includes cardiovascular screening, blood tests and diabetes \nscreening that will be available without deductibles or co-pays to \nencourage seniors to take advantage of these benefits.\n  I want to stop for a moment at the word ``encourage.'' It is \nabsolutely critical for every senior to know that they don't have to \ntake advantage of the preventive screenings, they are not required to \nparticipate in the prescription drug plan, and most importantly, no \nseniors under this proposal are forced into a private health plan. \nEvery senior who chooses to remain in traditional Medicare has that \nequally important option under this bill.\n  This bill is about expanding choice. Time and time again I hear from \nseniors who have said they want to receive the same benefits that my \ncolleagues and I here and in the House of Representatives enjoy. This \nbill is about giving seniors the option to participate in a plan that \nlooks very close to the benefits that I and most individuals in the \nprivate sector enjoy.\n  This bill is good for our seniors, it is good for health providers, \nand it is good for the American public who are tired of the partisan \nbattles that have characterized this Congress. I thank Senators \nGrassley and Baucus and the members of the conference committee who \nhave crafted this bipartisan Medicare package. This is a truly historic \ntime in this body's history.\n  As we look toward completing our work for this first session, I am \nhopeful that the spirit of cooperation that has led to this bill will \nbe extended to the many important issues we will leave unresolved this \nyear.\n  The Thanksgiving season is upon us. Our work in this session is \nnearing completion. But our work will not be done until and unless we \nseize this historic opportunity and bring a prescription drug benefit \nand hopes for a better and healthier life and make this a Thanksgiving \nto remember for all the right reasons for our senior citizens and their \nfamilies.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Republican leadership and even a member \nof the President's Cabinet twisted arms and bullied individual House \nMembers late in the night and into the wee hours of Saturday morning. A \nroll call vote was held open for almost 3 hours--the longest House roll \ncall vote in history--until enough Members ignored their conscience, \ncried ``mercy,'' and voted ``yes'' on the Medicare bill.\n  I believe most Americans would find such tactics repulsive and \nunbecoming of how Members of Congress should behave. One might expect \nto see such arm twisting and intimidation during a prisoner \ninterrogation scene in an episode of ``Law & Order,'' not a voting \nsession of Congress--especially on a vote of such great importance to \nthe citizens of this country.\n  What happened the other night was nothing short of a subversion of \nthe democratic process itself and a subversion of the democratic \nprinciples our Founders stood for. Is this the manner of legislating \nthat our Founding Fathers had in mind when they so craftily designed \nthe political institutions of this country? I do not believe it is the \nscenario our Founders envisioned when they created the Senate--to act \nas the ``saucer,'' as George Washington so wisely said, to absorb the \noverheated passions pouring out of the House of Representatives.\n  If ever there were a time for the Senate to act as that ``saucer,'' \nit is now. It is a time when the health care security of 40 million \nsenior citizens, and millions of Americans for years to come, could be \non the brink of collapse as a result of this bill. We may even be in a \nrace toward the finish line of Medicare itself. And I am afraid that \nthe race is driven by partisan politics, extreme ideological fervor, \nand blatant special-interest greed--all at the expense of our Nation's \nmost vulnerable citizens. Will the Bush administration and Republican \nleadership of this Congress stop at nothing in order to get what they \nwant?\n  I am bewildered as to why we are engaged in such a mad stampede to \nram this bill through the Congress--especially when this legislation \nwill not take effect until 2006. I have been around long enough in \nCongress to know that the actions of today's leadership smack of \narrogant politics and calculated indifference.\n  The more I read through this Medicare bill, the more I become \nconvinced\n\n[[Page S15749]]\n\nthat history is again repeating itself. I can recall a painful \nexperience during my majority leadership when an outraged citizenry, \ncomposed mostly of seniors, forced Congress to repeal the ill-fated \nMedicare Catastrophic Coverage Act back in 1989. The year before, \nCongress was engaged in a Medicare debate eerily similar to the one we \nare having today. An agreement was reached to make the most sweeping \nchange in Medicare's ``then'' 23 years of existence.\n  At that time, Congress agreed to two key changes to the Medicare \nProgram--a prescription drug benefit and a ``stop-loss'' protection \nfrom catastrophic medical bills. Facing deficits as we do today, \nCongress decided that beneficiaries should pay for the new benefits \nthemselves, with the wealthiest paying the most. The new law included a \ncomplicated benefit that was too difficult to explain and a lengthy \ndelay in the benefit's taking effect. In the end, seniors saw the bill, \nand wanted no part of it. After angry protests, it was repealed. We are \npoised to make the same mistake again.\n  I foresee a great deal of confusion and dismay occurring around \nkitchen tables across America when people actually start to read beyond \nthe newspaper headlines and see the fine print of this plan three years \nfrom now. Seniors may not know whether to laugh or cry. And if seniors \nreject this new Medicare plan, it will fail and fail miserably.\n  When senior citizens wake up in 2006 and find out what this bill is \nreally about, it will not be the turkey that needs to be eaten on \nThanksgiving day, it will be all of us in Congress eating crow.\n  We should not let political ideology drive our Nation's Medicare \npolicy when we are dealing with the health care and lives of the most \nvulnerable in the country. I am worried that this body is being asked \nto hand over one of the most popular Government programs in history to \nprivate insurance companies. I have been down this tortured road before \nduring my 51-year tenure in Congress. My constituents and others around \nthe Nation are reeling from public programs that have been turned over \nto the so-called free market. Utility rates, cable rates, airline \nrates, you name it, the free market has ensured exorbitant prices with \ndiminished service. Pensions and retirement security have taken a \nsimilar beating.\n  So here we are again, this time being presented with a rosy scenario \nabout how private industry competition will improve the Medicare \nprogram. The rhetoric is familiar: increased competition, lower costs, \nand greater services will be provided. Yes, the rhetoric is familiar, \nbut so is the reality. This scheme will not deliver what it promises.\n  I fear that we are going to wind up with a patchwork across the \ncountry of differing coverages, differing plans, differing copays and \ndiffering premiums. No senior will know for sure what they can count \non.\n  Analysis of the GOP Medicare bill estimates that 31,000 Medicare \nbeneficiaries in West Virginia will lose their retiree health benefits \nas a direct result of this package. Nearly 45,000 Medicaid \nbeneficiaries in West Virginia will pay more for the prescription drugs \nthey need. As many as 27,700 fewer seniors in West Virginia will \nqualify for low-income protections because of the assets test and lower \nqualifying income levels. More than 7,500 Medicare beneficiaries in \nWest Virginia will pay more in Medicare premiums because of income \nmeans-testing.\n  Let's slow down and take a better look at this legislation and the \nunintended consequences. We need more time to explain this plan to our \nelderly citizens. Don't we need their feedback? I doubt that our \nNation's seniors will be excited about accepting a bill that poisons \nthe well. Seniors will likely want no part of it--especially when they \nsee how it will undermine the rest of Medicare down the road. Just like \nthey did almost 15 years ago, they may revolt, and Members of Congress \ncould be back here scratching their heads and scrambling to find a \nsolution and save their seats.\n  This bill fails our seniors. It sells senior citizens out in exchange \nfor big profits for prescription drug companies. America's senior \ncitizens and disabled citizens deserve more than some new hocus-pocus \nscheme that leaves them naked to the whims of private insurance \ncompanies, and offers only a new-you-see-it, now-you-don't promise of \ncoverage. Instead of selling illusions, Congress ought to go back to \nwork and settle on a good, comprehensive, voluntary Medicare \nprescription drug benefit.\n  Let's not shortchange our seniors. We owe them much, much better.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my concerns with \nthe conference agreement on H.R. 1, the Medicare Prescription Drug, \nImprovement, and Modernization Act of 2003.\n  My original intentions were to work with this body to create and \nprovide a fiscally responsible prescription drug benefit for seniors \nwho are in need. My primary responsibility and obligation through this \nprocess was to make sure that Medicare beneficiaries with the lowest \nmonthly income and the highest monthly drug bill were taken care of. \nThat obligation has been fulfilled by this agreement.\n  This bill will provide almost 1 million Georgia seniors with \ncompletely voluntary access to a Medicare prescription drug benefit for \nthe first time in the history of the Medicate program. Starting next \nyear, low-income seniors will get drug cards that provide $600 worth of \nassistance for prescription drugs. Seniors will be covered with access \nto an initial physical and other new preventive benefits such as \ncholesterol and diabetes screenings. This legislation creates new \nHealth Savings Accounts, HSAs, to pay for qualified medical expenses, \navailable to all beneficiaries with contributions allowed from \nemployers and family members.\n  Beginning in 2006, all Medicare beneficiaries will be eligible to get \nprescription drug coverage though a Medicare-approved plan. In exchange \nfor a monthly premium of about $35, seniors who are now paying full \nretail price for prescription drugs will be able to cut their drug \ncosts roughly in half. Lower-income seniors could qualify for more \ngenerous benefits, including reduced premiums, lower deductibles and \ncoinsurance, with no gaps in coverage.\n  With Medicare beneficiaries receiving access to a prescription drug \nbenefit, Medicare instead of Medicaid will be assuming the prescription \ndrug cost of roughly 172,000 beneficiaries in Georgia. This could equal \n$469 million in added savings over the next eight years for the State \nof Georgia.\n  The bill also would increase Medicare funding for doctors, hospitals \nand other health care providers, particularly in rural areas, where \nreimbursement levels are far below what is paid in urban areas of the \ncountry. Additionally, the bill provides cost incentive to encourage \ncompanies to retain the health coverage they provide their retirees. I \nwant to voice my support for all of these provisions.\n  Following my review of the conference report, however, I can't help \nbut feel that this is not the best we could do. I feel like we missed \nthe mark on trying to ensure Medicare's solvency. While we are trying \nto ensure that prescription drug coverage is provided for those seniors \nwho need them, we should also ensure that future generations are not \noverburdened by the costs of this expanded entitlement program.\n  Attempts to cap the bill's cost have been diluted. Instead of putting \ncost containment provisions in the legislation, there is a vague \ntransfer of power from today's lawmakers to future lawmakers to handle \nthe cost when it becomes a problem. In 2007, the Congressional Budget \nOffice has estimated that the bill will cost $40.2 billion. By 2013, \nthat price tag hits $65.2 billion. I am not comfortable leaving these \nproblems to be dealt with in the future. If we cannot logically solve \nthem now, how do we expect future Congresses to tackle cost containment \nwhile this program is spiraling out of control?\n  Helping today's seniors with access to prescription drugs must be \nbalanced with our responsibility to future generations, our own \nchildren and grandchildren. These generations will have to pay, \nliterally, for our miscalculations. They will be able to look back and \nsee clearly when and where we made mistakes. Today, future generations \nare a main concern of mine because I think this bill lacks some common \nsense regarding fiscal restraint. It\n\n[[Page S15750]]\n\nhas the potential to expand our budget deficit for years to come. \nPlacing the cost burden of an entitlement program on the shoulders of \nour children's generation seems very unfair. Shouldn't it be possible \nfor this legislative body to create a prescription drug benefit plan \nthat is fiscally responsible? Have we successfully done this? With a \ncost containment trigger we could have done just that and we have \nmissed the opportunity.\n  In addition to the looming fiscal problems of this measure, I am also \nvery concerned with cuts for the reimbursement of drugs for cancer \ntreatment. Community oncology practices in Georgia and nationwide will \nbe at risk of closing their doors because of these cuts. When \napproximately 1.4 million people are diagnosed with new cases of cancer \neach year and approximately 550,000 people die from cancer each year, \nwhy are we decreasing these drug reimbursements?\n  Our small town pharmacists may also experience financial risk as a \nresult of the passage of this bill. They play a fundamental role in \ndelivering these benefits to our seniors. Pharmacy Benefit Managers, \nPBMs, should be required to report all financial concessions they \nreceive from manufacturers such as discounts, rebates, and indirect \nsubsidies and should be audited to ensure accountability. I want to \nensure that these pharmacists will be able to compete on the same level \nas the PBMs and purchasing by mail so that they can continue serving \ntheir patients. We also need to acknowledge and protect the role of \nmedication counseling services provided by our pharmacists as this is a \nvaluable benefit to the patient.\n  Another concern is the lack of flexibility within the Medicare \nprogram. Competition among private healthcare plans in Medicare will \nhelp ensure more up-to-date coverage and gives seniors the ability to \nchoose the healthcare plan that best meets their personal health needs \nrather than a one-size-fits-all government plan. A Medicare-approved \nprivate healthcare plan needs flexibility in designing benefits so that \nseniors can have the option to choose the coverage that makes the most \nsense to them and best suits their health needs. Seniors deserve choice \nand flexibility within their benefits, and this bill does not give \nseniors the full extent of flexibility they deserve.\n\n  Lastly, the means testing provisions included in this bill are \npositive but are not strong enough. Our goal should be to help those \nseniors who cannot afford life saving drugs and currently have to make \nthe difficult choice between putting food on their table and buying the \nprescriptions they need. We should not waste taxpayer money on \nsubsidizing wealthy seniors who can easily afford to pay for their own \nmedicines.\n  Individuals who fall into the category of 150 percent of Federal \npoverty level or those with a total income of $13,470 or less will \nreceive great benefits. However, the gaps in coverage for the middle \nclass will make this legislation somewhat effective or possibly even \nmore costly for certain beneficiaries. Protecting those most in need is \nimperative, but we cannot sacrifice those folks that fall in the \nmiddle.\n  The decisions we will make today by voting for this measure will \naffect the health of every American and significantly impact future \ntaxing and spending of generations to come. I stand before you today \nburdened by trying to make the best decision for America's seniors, for \nMedicare solvency, and for the financial security of our children and \ntheir future generations.\n  This bipartisan agreement is a necessary step to completing the \npromise we made to seniors, and that is to provide prescription drug \ncoverage. It is for this reason only that I will vote for this \nconference report, but I will continuously seek ways to improve this \nprogram by seeking stronger cost containment provisions and increasing \nthe flexibility for the plans.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the Medicare \nconference report. Once again, the Senate is on the verge of passing a \nbill that is good for everyone--except the people the bill is supposed \nto help. Our Nation's seniors rely on Medicare and are asking for \nCongress' help with a real Medicare drug benefit. This bill doesn't \ngive it to them. Instead, it is a dream package for drug companies, \ninsurance companies, and the people who make TV ads for politicians. \nAnd it is a nightmare for too many Medicare beneficiaries.\n  Our elderly and disabled citizens rely on Medicare. They know it and \nthey are comfortable with it. They know it will cover most of their \nhealth care needs whether they're healthier or sicker, middle class, \naffluent, or low income.\n  For years now our seniors have asked us to add a prescription drug \nbenefit to Medicare to help them pay for the costs of their medication. \nIt is a simple, straight-forward request that this bill meets with a \nconfusing, costly, and damaging response. The bill changes Medicare \nfrom the reliable, popular program that has worked for seniors since \n1965 to a Government subsidy program for private insurance companies.\n  The bill fundamentally changes the nature of Medicare. Instead of \nenhancing the current guaranteed benefit under Medicare with \nprescription drug coverage, the bill allocates billions to insurance \ncompanies to entice them to serve Medicare beneficiaries. In fact, the \ncompanies will be paid more than it costs traditional Medicare to cover \nseniors. And on top of that, there is a new $12 billion slush fund to \nbeg them to enter the program.\n  And what will these insurance companies do with this extra money? \nThey will design their plans to attract the healthiest, wealthiest \nseniors--and leave poorer, sicker seniors in traditional Medicare \nfacing higher costs.\n  This is no small point. Medicare has worked for decades because it is \na universal, reliable program. People believe in it, and it has worked \nwell for them. But this bill, which was supposed to simply add a new \nprescription drug benefit, instead changes Medicare to a new system of \nwinners and losers.\n  This fundamental weakening of the Medicare system is bad enough, but \neven worse is the process by which Congress is considering the changes. \nThe conference report was put together by a small group behind closed \ndoors. It is over a thousand pages long and is extremely complicated. \nBut we're being given only four days to read and digest this massive \nbill--this massive shift in the way we provide health care to our \nseniors.\n  Why are we rushing to vote? Are we afraid of seniors learning the \ntruth about what's really in this bill? This bill makes the most \nsweeping changes to Medicare since its creation, and we have barely had \ntime to examine it. Our seniors deserve more than a cursory glance and \ncrossed fingers that everything will work out.\n  Our seniors also deserve a real prescription drug benefit that gets \nthe best prices for their medication. But this bill actually prohibits \nthe Federal Government from negotiating with drug companies for lower \nprices. What a huge missed opportunity. What a waste of taxpayers' \ndollars. We could have used the tremendous purchasing power of the 41 \nmillion Medicare beneficiaries to make sure that prices are fair. \nInstead, this bill is a windfall for the drug industry. Just look at \ndrug companies' stocks shooting up over the last few days; it is clear \nwho the winners under this bill are.\n  The drug benefit itself is far less generous than seniors expect and \ndeserve--and for many seniors, it will do more harm than good. Many \nseniors will still be responsible for most of their drug costs. Those \nwith drug costs below $810 a year will actually pay more than they do \ntoday if they sign up for the drug benefit. Seniors with drug costs of \n$5,000 will still pay almost $4,000 themselves--almost 80 percent of \nthe bill. There is a giant hole in the drug benefit--a gap in coverage \nwhere seniors continue to pay their monthly premiums but get absolutely \nno help from Medicare with their drug bills. I voted against the \noriginal Senate bill in part because of this gap. Now instead of \nclosing the gap in conference, this bill actually doubles its size.\n  Even worse, this bill will cause many retirees who already have good \ndrug coverage through their former employers to lose it. According to \nthe Congressional Budget Office, 2.7 million seniors nationwide could \nlose their current coverage, including as many as 60,000 in Wisconsin. \nThese seniors\n\n[[Page S15751]]\n\nworked hard to earn retiree health coverage. That coverage will now be \nin jeopardy.\n  In addition, while there is additional help for some low-income \nbeneficiaries, millions of poorer seniors will be worse off because of \nthis bill. Up to 6 million seniors who are eligible for both Medicare \nand Medicaid--the poorest of the poor--will have higher costs. Up to \n110,000 dually eligible seniors in Wisconsin could be affected. In \naddition, the bill cuts out the extra help for millions of low-income \nseniors if they fail a restrictive asset test.\n  There are some good things in this bill. It includes an increase in \nMedicare payments to Wisconsin that will finally begin to level the \nplaying field for Wisconsin's doctors, hospitals, and seniors. I am \npleased that this was included.\n  I know there are some who say we can't afford to wait for a perfect \nbill. But I believe that this bill is not just far from perfect--it \nwill actually do harm to many of our seniors and will waste billions of \ntaxpayer dollars in a giveaway to the insurance industry and drug \ncompanies.\n  This drug benefit is nowhere close to what seniors have asked us to \ndeliver. They wanted to pay less for their prescription drugs. We could \nhave done tremendous good here. We could have brought the price of \ndrugs down using bulk purchasing through Medicare, greater use of \ngeneric drugs, and allowing seniors to purchase less expensive drugs \nfrom Canada. Instead, we have a complicated and skimpy drug benefit, \nhuge subsidies to drug and insurance companies, and a sea change in the \nMedicare Program. This is not what seniors asked for, and they will not \nbe fooled. When they learn the details of this bill, they will rightly \nrevolt.\n  There are those who say we have to pass this bill today because we'll \nnever have another chance. That is ridiculous. We have only had four \ndays to look at this 1,000-page bill. We haven't had any time to go \nback home and discuss this with out constituents. How can we represent \nthe seniors in our States when not one of them has had a chance to see, \ndigest or comment on this bill.\n  This bill doesn't even go into effect until 2006, so why the rush to \npass it today? With a mere 4 days of study, we are about to enact \nhistoric, sweeping changes to Medicare. The people we represent deserve \na much more serious effort.\n  I do not believe that this bill is our last and only chance. If this \nbill is defeated, we can't and won't give up on a real, effective and \nsmart prescription drug benefit in Medicare. We can't and won't turn \nour backs on doctors, hospitals and health care providers. We can do \nbetter if we have the will and the courage to do it.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise today to say a few words about \nSection 1101(d), a provision of the Medicare Prescription Drug, \nImprovement, and Modernization Act of 2003 relating to the Hatch-Waxman \nAct and the authority of Federal courts to entertain actions for \ndeclaratory judgments. This provision originally was added in the \nSenate, as part of the Greater Access to Affordable Pharmaceuticals \nAct, and formed Section 702(c) of S. 1, the bill passed by the Senate. \nI will discuss today some of the changes made to this subsection in \nconference, and what this provision is intended to accomplish.\n  Lower Federal courts typically have required that a declaratory \njudgment plaintiff satisfy the ``reasonable apprehension test'' before \nbeing allowed to bring declaratory judgment actions in Federal court.\n  Section 1101(d) provides that, so long as a generic drug company has \nfiled an Abbreviated New Drug Application, ANDA, and the patentee has \nnot filed suit within 45 days of receiving notice, ``the courts of the \nUnited States shall, to the extent consistent with the Constitution, \nhave subject matter jurisdiction in any action * * * for a declaratory \njudgment that such patent is invalid or not infringed.'' This \nsubsection will provide relief to alleged patent infringers--at least \nin the Hatch-Waxman context--in several ways.\n  First, this language sweeps away the type of discretionary barriers \nto a declaratory judgment action imposed in decisions such as EMC Corp. \nV. Norand Corp. The Federal Circuit in that case found that the \ndistrict court actually had jurisdiction to entertain a declaratory-\njudgment suit. It nevertheless allowed the district court to dismiss \nthe action, holding that district courts may do so unless ``there is no \nreal prospect of non-judicial resolution of the dispute.'' The Federal \nCircuit apparently felt that a patentee should be able to use what may \nprove to be an invalid patent as a source of ``bargaining power'' in \nlicense negotiations.\n  This refusal to entertain a litigant's action where jurisdiction \nunquestionably exists is, of course, at odds with the rule, announced \n182 years ago in Cohens v. Virginia, that the Federal courts ``have no \nmore right to decline the exercise of jurisdiction which is given, than \nto usurp that which is not given.'' Blame for this practice, however, \ncannot entirely be laid at the feet of the Federal Circuit. The Supreme \nCourt, in the 1995 Wilton v. Seven Falls Company case, affirmed that \nFederal courts have ``unique and substantial discretion in deciding \nwhether to declare the rights of litigants.'' Wilton identified two \nsources of this discretion: it found a ``textual commitment to \ndiscretion'' in the  Declaratory Judgment Act, emphasizing the act's \nuse of the word ``may.'' And it noted the courts' history of \nrecognizing discretion to decline declaratory-judgment actions.\n\n   Section 1101(d) directly sweeps away the type of discretion allowed \nin the EMC Corp. case. First, and most importantly, it replaces the \nword ``May''--the textual source of the discretion identified in Wilton \nand EMC Corp.--with the word ``shall.'' Second, simply by creating a \nnew source of authority to entertain declaratory judgments in the \nHatch-Waxman context, section 1101(d) disentangles such actions from \nthe tradition of discretion associated with the Declaratory Judgment \nAct. Armed with the word ``shall,'' this new section starts afresh, \nwith no reason to be exempted from the usual (Colorado River) rule that \nFederal courts have a ``virtually unflagging obligation * * * to \nexercise the jurisdiction given them.'' With this new provision, \ngeneric-drug companies never will be denied access to a declaratory \njudgment action on the basis of pending or potential license \nnegotiations, at least so long as the suit otherwise is \nconstitutionally sufficient for presentation in an Article III court.\n   This last matter--when the case or controversy requirement for a \ndeclaratory judgment action is satisfied--is the subject of the second \nmajor aspect of section 1101(d). I and other Senate proponents of this \nsubsection believe that the reasonable-apprehension test demands more \nthan is required by the constitutional case-or-controversy requirement. \nWe are fortified in this view by two letters received by the committee \nof jurisdiction from Professor John Yoo. Rather than repeat all of \nProfessor Yoo's analysis, I will simply include his letters at the \nconclusion of my remarks. As Professor Yoo notes in his first letter, \nthe reasonable-apprehension test is ``[not] demanded by the Supreme \nCourt's interpretation of the Declaratory Judgment Act.'' He suggests \nthat the test may be viewed as an exercise of the court's discretionary \npower.\n   Section 1101(d) shifts the focus of a court's inquiry to whether the \nrequirements of Article III are satisfied. In deciding when a Hatch-\nWaxman declaratory judgment suit may meet the requirements of Article \nIII, the courts should focus on the actual components of the case-or-\ncontroversy requirement. In the 1998 Steel Company decision, the \nSupreme Court reiterated that the ``triad of injury in fact, causation, \nand redressability constitutes the core of Article III's case-or-\ncontroversy requirement.'' In setting the constitutional standard for \nallowing declaratory judgments, the Supreme Court in its 1937 Aetna \nLife Ins. v. Haworth decision focused on the dispute's adverseness, \ndefiniteness, concreteness, and the specificity of the claims. this \nlanguage inevitably invokes the injury-in-fact element of the Article \nIII standing inquiry. It is from the injury-in-fact case law--which \nasks whether an injury is concrete and particularized, and actual or \nimminent--that the courts might draw new standards for a \nconstitutionally adequate case or controversy in the declaratory \njudgment context.\n   It thus bears mention that the Supreme Court has not hesitated to \nfind\n\n[[Page S15752]]\n\nactual Article III injury where a plaintiff forewent a legally \ncognizable benefit as a result of being actually and reasonably \ndeterred from particular conduct. Just 3 years ago, for example, the \ncourt held that even where a defendant's environmental discharges \ncaused no harm to the environment, environmentalist plaintiffs had \nstanding where their ``reasonable concerns about the effects of those \ndischarges, directly affected [their] recreational, aesthetic, and \neconomic interests.'' And in 1979's Babbit v. United Farm Workers, the \ncourt found that plaintiffs deterred from constitutionally protected \nconduct had standing to challenge the offending statute where the \nthreat of its enforcement was ``not imaginary or wholly speculative.'' \nThe Court further specified that the plaintiffs were ``not without some \nreason in fearing prosecution'' where ``the State has not disavowed an \nintention'' of enforcement, a fact that rendered the positions of the \nparties ``sufficiently adverse, * * * to present a case of controversy \nwithin the jurisdiction'' of the Federal courts. And--closer to the \ncontext of a section 1101(d) plaintiff--the court has inquired, when \nevaluating commercial plaintiffs standing in 1975's Warth v. Seldin, \nwhether the defendant's actions ``delayed or thwarted any project \ncurrently proposed.''\n\n  I would also note that some courts have applied case-or-controversy \ntests in the declaratory judgment context that, in their standards and \nfocus, are not dissimilar from what is suggested by the Supreme Court's \ninjury-in-fact caselaw. For example, in the 1974 case Blessings Corp. \nv. Altman, the district court for the Southern District of New York \nheld that ``any lingering possibility of an infringement charge is \nsufficient to support the finding of an actual controversy so long as \nthe plaintiff can demonstrate some actual harm to its business.'' \nSimilarly, in the 1986 case Research Institute v. Wisconsin Alumni, the \ndistrict court for the Western District of Wisconsin concluded that ``a \nperceived threat of infringement is real''--and would satisfy Article \nIII requirements--so long as ``it would be a substantial factor for \nmost business people in their choice to proceed in one direction and \nnot in another.''\n  Congress, of course, does not presume that any of these cases sets \nthe proper case-or-controversy standard in the context of a patent-\ninfringement declaratory judgment action, or that 1970s standing \ndecisions still are good law. Nevertheless, these cases do at least \nsuggest the proper focus of inquiry: whether the would-be patent \nchallenger has been reasonably and actually deterred from undertaking a \nprofitable enterprise.\n  Finally, should the courts be unwilling to wholly abandon the \nreasonable apprehension test for purposes of analyzing the requirements \nof Article III, the conferees have left them options short of striking \ndown section 1101(d). Unlike the Senate bill, the conference report \ndoes not gamble all on the hope that courts will find the filing of an \nANDA--which automatically constitutes an act of infringement--to always \nqualify as a constitutionally adequate case or controversy. The final \nact leaves the courts with options short of striking down section \n1101(d), if more is required. By including the language ``to the extent \nconsistent with the Constitution,'' the conferees have allowed the \ncourts to import as much of the reasonable-apprehension test as they \nfeel is constitutionally necessary. As the report language makes clear, \nthis may include the entire reasonable-apprehension test as currently \nconstrued by the Federal Circuit. As Federal Circuit Judge Gajarsa \nobserved in his concurrence in the Minnesota Mining case, that test \nwill ordinarily be satisfied in declaratory judgment actions brought by \nANDA applicants with respect to patents listed in the Orange Book. In \nany event, the courts should impose prerequisites to seeking \ndeclaratory relief--whether reasonable apprehension, the standing tests \nsuggested here, or any other requirements--only ``to the extent \nrequired by the Constitution.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that two letters from Professor Yoo be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Boalt Hall School of Law, University of California at \n           Berkeley,\n                                      Berkeley, CA, June 14, 2003.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: I have been asked by the Generic \n     Pharmaceutical Association to provide my views concerning the \n     constitutionality of a proposed amendment to the Hatch-Waxman \n     Act. The amendment would allow a generic drug manufacturer \n     who has filed an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) to \n     seek federal declaratory relief against potential patent \n     infringement claims. It is my opinion that this provision is \n     clearly constitutional.\n       Let me begin with a note of introduction. I have long \n     worked on separation of powers issues involving the courts. \n     It was my great honor to have served as the General Counsel \n     to this Committee under your Chairmanship from 1995-96. I \n     also recently served as Deputy Assistant Attorney General in \n     the Office of Legal Counsel of the Department of Justice, \n     which is charged in part with advising the executive branch \n     on the constitutionality of proposed legislation. I have \n     clerked for Judge Laurence Silberman of the U.S. Court of \n     Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and for Justice Clarence Thomas \n     of the U.S. Supreme Court. I am currently a visiting fellow \n     at the American Enterprise Institute and a professor of law \n     at the Boalt Hall School of Law, University of California at \n     Berkeley, where I have taught and written in the fields of \n     constitutional law, the separation of powers, and civil \n     procedure since 1993. The conclusions expressed here are my \n     own, and do not represent the views of the American \n     Enterprise Institute or the University of California.\n       In order to evaluate the constitutionality of the proposed \n     changes, it is necessary to first understand the statutory \n     framework at issue. Under the Federal Food, Drug, and \n     Cosmetic Act, a pharmaceutical company that seeks to \n     manufacture a new drug must file a new drug application (NDA) \n     with the FDA that includes information about the drug's \n     safety and effectiveness. 21 U.S.C. Sec. 355(a). The NDA must \n     also include a list of patents upon which the drug is based. \n     If the FDA approves the NDA, it publishes the drug and the \n     patents in the Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic \n     Equivalence Evaluations (``the Orange Book'').\n       The Hatch-Waxman amendments created a streamlined process \n     for the FDA to review applications by drug manufacturers to \n     produce generic versions of drugs previously approved by the \n     NDA process. Under an ANDA, a generic producer may rely in \n     part on the NDA of the pioneer manufacturer by showing \n     bioequivalence with the NDA-approved drug. 21 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 355(j)(2)(A). Under Hatch-Waxman, it is not patent \n     infringement to conduct actions necessary to prepare an ANDA, \n     35 U.S.C. Sec. 271(e)(1), but it is infringement to file the \n     ANDA itself before the expiration of the patents that include \n     the pioneer drug, id. Sec. 271(e)(2). An ANDA applicant must \n     make one of four certifications as to the patents listed in \n     the Orange Book for the pioneer drug it seeks to manufacture: \n     i) no patent information has been submitted to the FDA; ii) \n     the patent has expired; iii) the patent will expire on a \n     specific date; iv) the patent is invalid and will not be \n     infringed by the generic drug.\n       When an ANDA makes the fourth certification, known as a \n     Paragraph IV certification, the applicant must give notice to \n     the patent holder and explain why the patent is invalid, \n     unenforceable, or not infringed. 21 \n     U.S.C.Sec. 355(j)(2)(B)(i). The patent holder may sue for \n     infringement within the next 45 days, id. \n     Sec. 355(j)(5)(B)(iii), and if it does, the FDA may not \n     approve the ANDA application until the courts have ruled on \n     the suit, the relevant patents have expired, or thirty months \n     have passed from the time of the original notice. Id. During \n     that 45-day period, ``no action may be brought under section \n     2201 of Title 28 [the Declaratory Judgment Act], for a \n     declaratory judgment with respect to the patent.'' Id.\n       The proposal before you would make clear what this last \n     provision already implies. It would recognize that ``an \n     actual controversy'' between an ANDA filer and a patent \n     holder would exist ``sufficient to confer subject matter \n     jurisdiction in the courts of the United States'' if, after \n     45 days have passed since the ANDA has been filed, the patent \n     holder chooses not to bring a patent infringement action. I \n     do not believe that this provision poses constitutional \n     problems; in fact, it merely clarifies the proper application \n     of existing law.\n       To understand why, it is necessary to review the \n     Declaratory Judgment Act and its interaction with patents. \n     Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution allows federal \n     courts to exercise jurisdiction only over the enumerated list \n     of cases or controversies. U.S. Const. art. III, Sec. 2 \n     (listing cases or controversies). As Marbury v. Madison made \n     clear, federal courts are courts of limited subject matter \n     jurisdiction. For many years, it was uncertain whether \n     declaratory judgment actions fell within the definition of an \n     Article III case or controversy. Federal jurisdiction \n     certainly extends to cases in which a plaintiff is entitled \n     to a coercive remedy based on federal law. Substantial \n     hardship arises, however, in cases involving ``an actual \n     dispute about the rights and obligations of the parties, \n     and yet the controversy may not have ripened to a point at \n     which an affirmative remedy is needed. Conversely, this \n     stage may have been reached, but the party entitled to \n     seek the remedy may fail to take the\n\n[[Page S15753]]\n\n     necessary steps.'' C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice \n     and Procedure Sec. 2751. In the area of patents, ``the \n     owner of a patent might assert that a manufacturer was \n     infringing the owner's monopoly, while the latter \n     contended that his product was not an infringement or that \n     the patent was invalid. The manufacturer was helpless, \n     however, to secure an adjudication of the issue, but had \n     to await suit for infringement, unless the manufacturer \n     preferred to yield and discontinue the activity.'' Id.\n       Declaratory judgments acts first arose in the states, but \n     uncertainty initially remained as to whether such cases could \n     be heard in federal courts due to the case or controversy \n     requirements of Article III of the Constitution. Willing v. \n     Chicago Auditorium Ass'n, 277 U.S. 274 (1928). In 1927, \n     however, the Court gave res judicata effect to a state \n     declaratory judgment, Fidelity Nat'l Bank & Trust Co. v. \n     Swope, 274 U.S. 123 (1927), and in 1933 it upheld a state \n     court declaratory judgment, Nasville, C. & St. L. Ry. v. \n     Wallace, 288 U.S. 249 (1933). Immediately after Wallace, \n     Congress enacted the Declaratory Judgment Act: ``In a case of \n     actual controversy within its jurisdiction, . . . any court \n     of the United States, upon the filing of an appropriate \n     pleading, may declare the rights and other legal relations of \n     any interested party seeking such declaration, whether or not \n     further relief is or could be sought. Any such declaration \n     shall have the force and effect of a final judgment or decree \n     and shall be reviewable as such.'' Act of June 14, 1934, ch. \n     512, 48 Stat. 955, codified at 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2201(a). In \n     essence, this act allows plaintiffs to bring suit against a \n     defendant who would hold a federal right to seek a coercive \n     remedy against the plaintiff, if the defendant had chosen to \n     bring suit first. The legislative history of the Act reflects \n     that Congress was concerned about the uncertainty in business \n     and legal relations, including the case in which a patent \n     holder chose to delay litigation for patent infringement.\n       The Supreme Court soon made clear that the Declaratory \n     Judgment Act was constitutional, even though the statute \n     extended federal jurisdiction to cases in which the holder of \n     the federal right had not yet sought to enforce his \n     federal right. Finding that declaratory judgment suits met \n     Article III's case or controversy requirement, the Court \n     explained: ``The Declaratory Judgment Act of 1934, in its \n     limitation to `cases of actual controversy,' manifestly \n     has regard to the constitutional provision and is \n     operative only in respect to controversies which are such \n     in the constitutional sense. The word `actual' is one of \n     emphasis rather than of definition. Thus the operation of \n     the Declaratory Judgment Act is procedural only. In \n     providing remedies and defining procedure in relation to \n     cases and controversies in the constitutional sense the \n     Congress is acting within its delegated power over the \n     jurisdiction of the federal courts which the Congress is \n     authorized to established. . . . Exercising this control \n     of practice and procedure the Congress is not confined to \n     traditional forms or traditional remedies.'' Aetna Life \n     Insurance Company v. Haworth, 300 U.S. 227, 240-41 (1937). \n     In explaining more precisely why the Declaratory Judgment \n     Act did not include cases that were actually unripe or \n     moot, Chief Justice Hughes wrote: ``A `controversy' in the \n     sense must be one that is appropriate for judicial \n     determination. . . . A justiciable controversy is thus \n     distinguished from a difference or dispute of a \n     hypothetical or abstract character; from one that is \n     academic or moot. . . . The controversy must be definite \n     and concrete, touching the legal relations of parties \n     having adverse legal interests. . . . It must be real and \n     substantial controversy admitting of specific relief \n     through a decree of a conclusive character, as \n     distinguished from an opinion advising what the law would \n     be upon a hypothetical state of facts. . . . Where there \n     is such a concrete case admitting of an immediate and \n     definitive determination of the legal rights of the \n     parties in an adversary proceeding upon the facts alleged, \n     the judicial function may be appropriately exercised \n     although the adjudication of the rights of the litigants \n     may not require the award of process or the payment of \n     damages. . . . And as it is not essential to the exercise \n     of the judicial power that an injunction be sought, \n     allegations that irreparable injury is threatened are not \n     required.'' Id. at 240-41. In the wake of Aetna, the lower \n     courts regularly assumed jurisdiction over declaratory \n     judgment suits by an alleged patent infringer for a \n     declaration of non-infringement or patent invalidity, \n     because the declaratory defendant could have brought a \n     federal action against the declaratory plaintiff. Edelamnn \n     & Co. v. Triple-A Specialty Co., 88 F.2d 852 (7th Cir. \n     1937). In passing, the Supreme Court has approved this \n     exercise of jurisdiction because a patent infringement \n     suit by the declaratory defendant would have fallen with \n     the Article III ``arising under'' jurisdiction. See \n     Franchise Tax Board of California v. Construction Laborers \n     Vacation Trust, 463 U.S. 1, 20 n. 19 (1983); Graham v. \n     John Deere Co, 383 U.S. 1 (1966).\n       In light of these cases, it should be clear that Congress \n     intended that potential patent infringers be able to seek a \n     declaration of non-infringement, unenforceability, \n     or invalidty of a patent. Further, the Supreme Court and \n     the lower federal courts have interpreted the Declaratory \n     Judgment Act to allow these suits, and they have also \n     found such suits to fall within Article III's case or \n     controversy requirement. The proposal before you clearly \n     falls within the scope of the Declaratory Judgment Act. A \n     generic drug company wishes to manufacture and sell a \n     substance that mimics a pioneer drug for which patents are \n     listed in the Orange Book. The enforcement of the patent \n     could prevent the generic drug company from producing and \n     selling its product, nullifying its investments in \n     research and production, and potentially subjecting any \n     profits to the uncertainty of a future lawsuit. In filing \n     an ANDA, the generic drug company declares its intention \n     and ability to produce the drug, which renders the dispute \n     anything but hypothetical. The Hatch-Waxman amendments \n     even find an ANDA filing to constitute patent \n     infringement. Were the pioneer drug company to bring a \n     patent infringement action, the case clearly would fall \n     within Article III's arising under jurisdiction.\n        It is my view that such actions, as recognized by the \n     proposed amendment before you, would fall within the proper \n     application of the Declaratory Judgment Act and, as \n     interpreted by the Supreme Court and the lower federal \n     courts, within the Constitution's requirements for an actual \n     case or controversy. As the Supreme Court explained in Aetna, \n     ``[t]he controversy must be definite and concrete, touching \n     the legal relations of parties having adverse legal \n     interests. . . . It must be a real and substantial \n     controversy admitting of specific relief through a decree of \n     a conclusive character, as distinguished from an opinion \n     advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of \n     facts.'' 300 U.S. at 240-41. Here, there are clear adverse \n     legal interests between the pioneer drug manufacturer and the \n     generic drug manufacturer over the validity and application \n     of a patent. The generic drug manufacturer has invested a \n     substantial amount of resources to file an ANDA and to \n     prepare and manufacture the generic drug; that investment \n     could be lost through a patent infringement action brought by \n     the pioneer drug company. It is difficult to conceive of a \n     setting in which application of the Declaratory Judgment Act \n     would not be more appropriate. Indeed, the proposal before \n     you strikes me as simply a restatement of the proper \n     interpretation of current law.\n        Some might argue, however, that the proposal could raise \n     constitutional concerns under the case law of the U.S. Court \n     of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The Federal Circuit has \n     developed a two-part test to determine whether a potential \n     patent infringer's suit lies properly within the Declaratory \n     Judgment Act: ``First, the plaintiff must actually produce or \n     be prepared to produce an allegedly infringing product. \n     Second, the patentee's conduct must have created an \n     objectively reasonable apprehension on the part of the \n     plaintiff that the patentee will initiate suit if the \n     activity in question continues.'' EMC Corp. v. Norand Corp., \n     89 F.3d 807, 811 (Fed. Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 117 S. Ct. \n     789 (1997); see also Arrowhead Indus. Water, Inc. v. \n     Ecolochem, Inc., 846 F.2d 731, 736, (Fed. Cir. 1988). The \n     first prong is easily satisfied in ANDA declaratory judgment \n     actions: by conducting the research and expending the \n     resources necessary to complete an ANDA, the generic drug \n     manufacturer has shown it is prepared to produce the \n     allegedly infringing product. DuPont Merck Pharmaceutical Co. \n     v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., 62 F.3d 1397, 1401 (Fed. Cir. \n     1995).\n       Whether an action will meet the Federal Circuit's second \n     prong will depend on the defendant's conduct. One might \n     argue, I suppose, that a pioneer drug producer's refusal to \n     initiate a lawsuit within the 45-day period could be taken as \n     a sign that there is no ``objectively reasonable \n     apprehension.'' This conclusion, however, seems doubtful to \n     me. The Federal Circuit clearly employs a totality of the \n     circumstances approach toward determining ``reasonable \n     apprehension,'' one that looks at conduct that falls far \n     short of simply filing a lawsuit. See Shell Oil Co. v. Amoco \n     Corp., 970 F.2d 885, 889 (Fed. Cir. 1992). In some cases, the \n     Federal Circuit has looked to the activity of the patent \n     holder in regard to third parties, Arrowhead, 846 F.2d at \n     736-39, express written or oral charges of infringement by \n     the patent holder, id. at 736; Shell Oil Co., 970 F.2d at \n     889, or a threat of a suit, BP Chems. Ltd. v. Union Carbide \n     Corp., 4 F.3d 975, 978 (Fed. Cir. 1993). The proposed \n     amendment would make clear that conduct that falls short of \n     filing a lawsuit is still sufficient to support a declaratory \n     judgment action by a generic drug manufacturer concerned \n     about potential patent infringement.\n       In any event, even if one were to conclude that the \n     amendment is inconsistent with the Federal Circuit's two-\n     prong test, this would not render the proposal \n     unconstitutional. First, it does not appear to me that the \n     Federal Circuit's approach is required by Article III of the \n     Constitution, nor is it demanded by the Supreme Court's \n     interpretation of the Declaratory Judgment Act. Indeed, the \n     very point of the Declaratory Judgment Act was to allow \n     parties concerned about the uncertainty in their business and \n     legal activities created by the holder of a federal cause of \n     action who refuses to sue. Nothing in the Supreme Court's \n     case law, which has consistently upheld the constitutionality \n     of the Declaratory Judgment Act, has suggested that a \n     declaratory defendant's failure to bring a lawsuit itself \n     within a certain time period eliminates the ``actual \n     controversy'' required by both the statute and the \n     Constitution. If anything, the case here is the reverse: it \n     is because the declaratory defendant has not brought a \n     lawsuit that a plaintiff must seek a federal declaratory \n     action.\n       In this respect, it may be best to conceive of the Federal \n     Circuit's two-prong test as an exercise of its discretionary \n     powers under\n\n[[Page S15754]]\n\n     the Declaratory Judgment Act, rather than as a true test of \n     Article III justiciability. The Act itself states that a \n     court ``may declare the rights and other legal relations'' of \n     a party. 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2201 (emphasis added). The Supreme \n     Court has interpreted this language as allowing the federal \n     courts to decline to adjudicate a federal declaratory action \n     even if case or controversy jurisdiction exists. Public Serv. \n     Comm'n v. Wycoff Co., 344 U.S. 237, 241 (1952); Wilton v. \n     Seven Falls Co., 515 U.S. 277, 286-87 (1995). It seems to me \n     that the Federal Circuit's two-prong approach, which does not \n     derive directly from Article III or the Supreme Court's \n     interpretation of the Declaratory Judgment Act, therefore \n     should be seen as an exercise of the Federal Circuit's \n     discretionary authority. As such, it is clearly subject to \n     Congress's authority to set the rules of procedure that \n     govern the federal courts. Indeed, it is that same power that \n     the Supreme Court found to justify the constitionality of the \n     Declaratory Judgment Act itself. If Congress wishes to direct \n     the federal courts to adjudicate Declaratory Judgment Act \n     cases in certain circumstances, instead of declining as a \n     matter of prudence to exercise jurisdiction, that is its \n     prerogative. The proposed amendment may be seen as nothing \n     more than an effort to do just that.\n       Even if the Federal Circuit's two-prong approach were \n     thought to be an interpretation of the Article III case or \n     controversy requirement, that would still not compel a \n     conclusion that the amendment is unconstitutional. The \n     Supreme Court has never passed on the Federal Circuit's \n     ``reasonable apprehension'' test, and in its earlier cases it \n     has approved more expansive approaches to jurisdiction under \n     the Declaratory Judgment Act. As an independent, coordinate \n     branch of government, Congress has the authority to make its \n     own judgments about the meaning of the Constitution. Congress \n     has the authority to refuse to enact legislation its believes \n     to be unconstitutional, even if the courts think otherwise, \n     and, conversely, it may pass legislation at odds with \n     previous Supreme Court decisions, as it did in the Religious \n     Freedom Restoration Act at issue in City of Boerne v. Flores. \n     To be sure, the Supreme Court has long made clear that \n     Congress does not have the authority to alter the boundaries \n     of the federal judicial power as established in Article III \n     of the Constitution. See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 \n     U.S. 555 (1992). Nonetheless, Congress's authority to \n     interpret the Constitution, which is fundamental to the \n     separation of powers, certainly must include the ability to \n     reject lower court decisions in order to spark Supreme Court \n     review of whether these courts have properly interpreted \n     Article III of the Constitution. Of course, this may be \n     wholly unnecessary because the Federal Circuit has yet to \n     hold that the absence of a suit during the 45-day period is \n     sufficient per se to destroy an actual controversy in a \n     declaratory judgment act by a generic drug manufacturer.\n       Please do not hesitate to contact me if I can provide \n     further assistance. I may be reached at 202-862-5819, or at \n     yoo@law.berkeley.edu.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                         John Yoo,\n     Professor of Law.\n                                  ____\n\n         Boalt Hall School of Law, University of California at \n           Berkeley,\n                                     Berkeley, CA, August 1, 2003.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: I have been asked by the Generic \n     Pharmaceutical Association to review the testimony provided \n     to your committee by the Department of Justice on August 1, \n     2003, concerning the constitutionality of the declaratory \n     judgment provisions of S. 1. The proposal would allow a \n     generic drug manufacturer who has filed an abbreviated new \n     drug application (ANDA) to seek relief under the federal \n     Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2201, against \n     potential patent infringement claims. This letter follows up \n     on my June 16, 2003 and June 19, 2003 letters to the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee and my congressional testimony of June \n     17, 2003 that concluded that the amendment in question is \n     constitutional.\n       The Senate amendments to Hatch-Waxman would recognize that \n     ``an actual controversy'' between an ANDA filer and a patent \n     holder would exist ``sufficient to confer subject matter \n     jurisdiction in the courts of the United States'' if, after \n     45 days have passed since the ANDA has been filed, the patent \n     holder chooses not to bring a patent infringement action. \n     DOJ's letter asserts that this amendment would \n     unconstitutionally expand the jurisdiction of the federal \n     courts beyond the limits set by Article III of the \n     Constitution. I have reviewed DOJ's letter, and while I have \n     the utmost respect for the attorneys who work in the Office \n     of Legal Counsel (many of whom were my colleagues for the \n     last two years during my service there as a deputy assistant \n     attorney general), I disagree with their conclusion.\n       Both the Justice Department and I agree that Congress \n     cannot expand the jurisdiction of the federal courts beyond \n     Article III's case or controversy requirement. This is a \n     principle of federal courts law that has existed ever since \n     Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137 (1803). We also \n     agree that the Declaratory Judgment Act is constitutional, \n     and has been so upheld by the Supreme Court in Aetna Life \n     Insurance Company v. Haworth, 300 U.S. 227 (1937). We also \n     agree that many cases filed after the 45-day period would \n     meet Article III's case or controversy requirement. In this \n     class of cases, therefore, the application of the Senate's \n     amendments to Hatch-Waxman would be clearly constitutional.\n       Where the Justice Department and I differ is whether \n     Congress may extend federal subject matter jurisdiction to \n     the remaining class of cases filed after the 45-day period. \n     According to the Department, the Federal Circuit's \n     ``reasonable apprehension'' test--so called because the \n     plaintiff must have a reasonable apprehension that the \n     patient holder will sue--will exclude a certain number of \n     cases that are filed after the 45-day period. In fact, the \n     Department seems to believe that plaintiffs who file after \n     the 45 days will almost never satisfy this test, because \n     ``in light of the statutory benefit conferred on the \n     patent owner if it sues within the 45-day period, it is \n     likely that a court would consider the applicant's \n     reasonable apprehension to be diminished if the patent \n     holder does not sue for infringement within that time.'' I \n     believe that Congress may extend federal subject matter \n     jurisdiction to this class of cases, and that since this \n     category may not be large, the amendment to Hatch-Waxman \n     could not be unconstitutional on its face but only as \n     applied at best.\n       I believe that the Justice Department's opinion is in error \n     because it does not properly understand why the Declaratory \n     Judgment Act is constitutional, even though it permits suits \n     to occur before the holder of the federal right has chosen to \n     bring a lawsuit. The Act allows plaintiffs to bring suit \n     against a defendant who would hold a federal right to seek a \n     coercive remedy against the plaintiff, if the defendant had \n     chosen to bring suit first. Declaratory judgments acts first \n     arose in the states, but it was initially suggested that such \n     cases could not be heard in federal courts due to the case or \n     controversy requirements of Article III of the Constitution. \n     Willing v. Chicago Auditorium Ass'n, 277 U.S. 274 (1928). In \n     1927, however, the Court gave res judicata effect to a state \n     declaratory judgment, Fidelity Nat'l Bank & Trust Co. v. \n     Swope, 274 U.S. 123 (1927), and in 1933 it upheld a state \n     court declaratory judgment, Nashville, C. & St. L. Ry. v. \n     Wallace, 288 U.S. 249 (1933). Immediately after Wallace, \n     Congress enacted the Declaratory Judgment Act: ``In a case of \n     actual controversy within its jurisdiction, . . . any court \n     of the United States, upon the filing of an appropriate \n     pleading, may declare the rights and other legal relations of \n     any interested party seeking such declaration, whether or not \n     further relief is or could be sought. Any such declaration \n     shall have the force and effect of a final judgment or decree \n     and shall be reviewable as such.'' Act of June 14, 1934, ch. \n     512, 48 Stat. 955, codified at 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2201(a).\n       The legislative history of the Act shows that Congress was \n     concerned about the uncertainty in business and legal \n     relations, including the case in which a patent holder chose \n     to delay litigation for patent infringement. Professor Edson \n     R. Sunderland, and advocate of the Act, testified before \n     Congress that: ``I assert that I have a right to use a \n     certain patent. You claim that you have a patent. What am I \n     going to do about it? There is no way that I can litigate \n     my right, which I claim, to use that device, except by \n     going ahead and using it, and you [the patent holder] can \n     sit back as long as you please and let me run up just as \n     high a bill of damages as you wish to have me run up, and \n     then you may sue me for the damages, and I am ruined, \n     having acted all the time in good faith and on my best \n     judgment, but having no way in the world to find out \n     whether I had a right to use that device or not.''\n       The Supreme Court soon made clear that the Declaratory \n     Judgment Act was constitutional, even though the statute \n     extended federal jurisdiction to cases in which the holder of \n     the federal right had not yet sought to enforce it. Finding \n     the declaratory judgment suits met Article III's case or \n     controversy requirement, the Court explained: ``The \n     Declaratory Judgment Act of 1934, in its limitation to `cases \n     of actual controversy' manifestly has regard to the \n     constitutional provision and is operative only in respect to \n     controversies which are such in the constitutional sense. The \n     word `actual' is one of emphasis rather than of definition. \n     Thus the operation of the Declaratory Judgment Act is \n     procedural only. In providing remedies and defining procedure \n     in relation to cases and controversies in the constitutional \n     sense the Congress is acting within its delegated power over \n     the jurisdiction of the federal courts which the Congress is \n     authorized to established. . . . Exercising this control of \n     practice and procedure the Congress is not confined to \n     traditional forms or traditional remedies.'' Aetna Life \n     Insurance Company v. Haworth, 300 U.S. 227, 240-41 (1937). In \n     explaining why the Act did not include cases that were \n     actually unripe or moot, Chief Justice Hughes wrote: ``A \n     `controversy' in this sense must be one that is appropriate \n     for judicial determination. . . . A justiciable controversy \n     is thus distinguished from a difference or dispute of a \n     hypothetical or abstract character; from one that is academic \n     or moot. . . . The controversy must be definite and concrete, \n     touching the legal relations of parties having adverse legal \n     interests. . . . It must be a real and substantial \n     controversy admitting of specific relief through a decree of \n     a conclusive character, as distinguished from an opinion \n     advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical\n\n[[Page S15755]]\n\n     state of facts. . . Where there is such a concrete case \n     admitting of an immediate and definitive determination of the \n     legal rights of the parties in an adversary proceeding upon \n     the facts alleged, the judicial function may be appropriately \n     exercised although the adjudication of the rights of the \n     litigants may not require the award of process or the payment \n     of damages. . . And as it is not essential to the exercise of \n     the judicial power that an injunction be sought, allegations \n     that irreparable injury is threatened are not required.'' Id. \n     at 240-41\n       The Justice Department's letter shows no understanding that \n     the very purpose of the Declaratory Judgment Act is to allow \n     relief in cases in which a potential patent infringer needs \n     legal certainty concerning the scope of a patent before it \n     can proceed with its activities. Indeed, the Department's \n     approach would suggest that the Act itself is \n     unconstitutional.\n       There are, however, obvious adverse legal interests between \n     the patent holder and the generic drug manufacturer over the \n     validity and application of a patent. The generic drug \n     manufacturer has invested a substantial amount of resources \n     to file an ANDA and to prepare and manufacturer the generic \n     drug. The enforcement of the patent could prevent the generic \n     drug company from producing and selling its product, \n     nullifying its investments in research and production, and \n     potentially subjecting any profits to the uncertainty of a \n     future lawsuit. In filing an ANDA, the generic drug company \n     declares its intention and ability to produce the drug, which \n     renders the dispute anything but hypothetical. Were the \n     pioneer drug company to bring a patent infringement action, \n     the case clearly would fall within Article III's arising \n     under jurisdiction.\n       By failing to understand why generic drug manufacturers \n     would suffer uncertainty from the possible enforcement of a \n     patent, the Department errs in concluding that the amendment \n     would be unconstitutional. The Department asserts that the \n     amendment ``can have no effect.'' This is because, \n     apparently, many lawsuits brought after the 45-day period \n     would meet the Article III's case or controversy requirement \n     anyway, and those that did not could not fall within Article \n     III jurisdiction thanks to passage of the amendment. But then \n     the Department observes that the lack of a lawsuit within the \n     45-day period would suggest that there is no ``reasonable \n     apprehension'' present. The Department's opinion assumes \n     without question that the Federal Circuit's approach to the \n     Declaratory Judgment Act in this context--the ``reasonable \n     apprehension'' test--correctly includes all of the possible \n     cases that would meet Article III's case or controversy \n     requirement, and that application of this test to those who \n     do no sue would likely find no reasonable apprehension. \n     Therefore, according to the Department, cases in which no \n     suit is filed within 45 days indicate that there is no \n     reasonable apprehension of a lawsuit, and therefore that \n     there is no Article III case or controversy requirement.\n       This view is erroneous, however, because it assumes that \n     any patent holder who does not sue within 45 days will never \n     sue. As Congress itself believed when it enacted the \n     Declaratory Judgment Act, patent holders might choose not to \n     sue in such circumstances for many reasons, such as allowing \n     the generic drug manufacturer to run up potential damages \n     while it risks little, creating uncertainty in the market and \n     among distributors and buyers of the generic drug, and \n     causing uncertainty about the value of investments and \n     research by generic manufacturers. Indeed, testimony before \n     Congress at the time of the passage of the Declaratory \n     Judgment Act underscored that the more time that passed, the \n     more damages that a patent holder could potentially \n     accumulate. By passing the Act, Congress recognized that \n     merely by refraining to exercise their Federal rights, \n     regardless of the amount of time that passes, patent holders \n     created sufficient legal and business uncertainty to harm \n     manufacturers such as generic drug producers. It is this harm \n     that brings such cases within the Article III case or \n     controversy requirement. The Justice Department appears to \n     have no theory as to why any Declaratory Judgment Act case \n     satisfies the Article III requirement, and hence cannot \n     judge whether any new application of the Act would be \n     constitutional or not.\n       In enacting the Declaratory Judgment Act, Congress did not \n     give any indication that it required plaintiffs to show they \n     had a ``reasonable apprehension'' of a lawsuit, nor has the \n     Supreme Court ever interpreted the Act to require such a \n     result. Rather, Congress wanted to give those who could be \n     subject to a lawsuit by the holder of a federal right the \n     ability to seek legal certainty for all parties involved, so \n     that business planning and activity could occur in an \n     environment with clear legal rules.\n       As applied by the Federal Circuit, the ``reasonable \n     apprehension'' test creates an effect opposite of that \n     desired by Congress. The Federal Circuit appears to employ an \n     inherently unpredictable totality of the circumstances \n     approach to determining whether a potential patent infringer \n     has a ``reasonable apprehension'' of lawsuit. Such approaches \n     undermine the very purpose of having clear rules in the area \n     of federal jurisdiction, and instead invite wasteful and \n     excessive litigation merely to determine whether a case is \n     appropriately brought in federal court. It is certainly \n     within Congress's authority to seek to correct \n     misinterpretations of its enactments where, as here, the \n     courts have acted in a way that undermines the very purposes \n     of the statute it has passed. By adopting the amendment, \n     Congress would simply be making clear the original purposes \n     of the Declaratory Judgment Act, which the Supreme Court, \n     almost immediately after the Act's passage, had upheld as \n     constitutional. By enacting the amendments to Hatch-Waxman, \n     Congress is appropriately acting to correct a \n     misinterpretation of the Declaratory Judgment Act that goes \n     too far in narrowing its scope. By employing the reasonable \n     apprehension test, the Federal Circuit may be allowing \n     declaratory judgment actions in only a subset of the possible \n     range of cases that could be permitted by Article III's case \n     or controversy requirement. By enacting this amendment, \n     Congress would be instructing the courts that it wishes to \n     expand the exercise of federal subject matter jurisdiction \n     under the Declaratory Judgment Act to the full extent \n     permitted by the Constitution.\n       This brings me to another reason why the amendment is \n     constitutional. As an independent and coordinate branch of \n     government, Congress certainly has the authority to interpret \n     the Constitution for itself and to base its enactments on \n     that interpretation. This is exactly what happened with the \n     original Declaratory Judgment Act: some doubted whether the \n     potential defendants of enforcement actions could bring a \n     suit seeking a declaration that their actions were legal. \n     Yet, in order to create an environment in which all parties \n     could conduct their activities with legal certainty, Congress \n     enacted the Declaratory Judgment Act. In doing so, Congress \n     acted on its own interpretation of the Article III case or \n     controversy requirement that such suits were constitutional. \n     The Supreme Court subsequently agreed. Congress has even \n     fuller authority where, as here, the Supreme Court as the \n     final arbiter within the federal judiciary has never examined \n     whether Article III or the Declaratory Judgment Act impose \n     any special requirements in patent infringement cases.\n       Please do not hesitate to contact me if I can provide \n     further assistance. Also, please realize that the views I \n     express in this letter are mine alone, and do not represent \n     those of the American Enterprise Institute, where I am \n     currently a visiting fellow, or of the University of \n     California at Berkeley, where I have been a law professor \n     since 1993. I may be reached at 202-862-5819, or at \n     yoo@law.berkeley.edu.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                         John Yoo,\n                                                 Professor of Law.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nMedicare bill before the Senate. This is not a perfect bill, far from \nit. It is not the bill I would write. But it is a bill that will do \nmore for our seniors and one we can build on in the future.\n  For the past decade this body has worked on adding a prescription \ndrug benefit to Medicare. We all know it is desperately needed. The \nskyrocketing cost of drugs has put meaningful health care treatment out \nof the reach of many seniors. Medicare simply was not crafted with a \nprescription drug component. That is not to blame any of the creators \nof the landmark legislation that created Medicare. They could not have \nknown that science would eventually put the treatments and cures for \nmany diseases in pill form. They did the best they could with the \nknowledge they had at the time. And that system served seniors well for \na very long time.\n  But it does not serve them well today. The lack of prescription drug \ncoverage is a glaring omission in the current Medicare Program. It \nprevents many seniors from getting the treatments they need and \nundermines the promise of the Medicare Program--to provide health care \nbenefits to our seniors.\n  And we do not have the excuse that we are unaware of the importance \nof drug treatments. We know how these medications can improve and \nprolong the lives of countless seniors. We know that seniors urgently \nneed this benefit and the medicine it will provide.\n  As I said, the bill before us is not perfect, and many people have \nraised legitimate concerns about its shortcomings. Some have said it is \ntoo expensive; some have said it does not cover enough of the drug \ncosts for seniors. There is truth to both statements. And both sides \nhave worked to confuse our seniors. A lot of money has been spent by \nspecial interest groups to advance their opinions rather than \naccurately assess the impact of this bill.\n  Putting all the clutter and spin aside, in a time of rising Federal \ndeficits, this bill does move the ball forward. It takes a concrete \nstep toward providing meaningful coverage. And it does make some \nefforts to contain long-term costs.\n  This legislation is the first step in covering drug treatments and \nthis is a\n\n[[Page S15756]]\n\nmajor step for seniors across the country. For example, in my home \nState of Nebraska, today there are 259,000 Medicare beneficiaries. Of \nthese, about 90,000 do not currently have prescription drug coverage. \nThrough this bill, beginning in 2006, they will all have coverage.\n  The average out-of-pocket cost for drugs for a typical Nebraskan, \nincluding premiums, will decrease 35 percent from $760 to $500 per \nyear. Low-income Nebraskans receive a large benefit in this bill. \nBefore the drug benefit is implemented in 2006, low-income Nebraskans \nwill receive $600 a year for their drugs, resulting in Nebraskans \nreceiving $83 million in prescription assistance. After the drug plan \nis implemented, 108,000 low-income Nebraskans will pay little to \nnothing in premiums, deductibles and coinsurance. Because Medicare is \ntaking responsibility for dual eligibles, Nebraska will save $167 \nmillion over 8 years. And the benefits for Nebraska extend beyond the \ndrug benefit.\n  This bill will provide additional reimbursements for rural hospitals \nand health care providers. Nebraska doctors will receive $57 million \nover 2 years. Critical access hospitals will receive $11.3 million, and \nthe rest of Nebraska's hospitals will share an additional $108 million \nover 10 years. This funding will help keep rural health care vital and \navailable to rural seniors.\n  Furthermore, this bill contains a pilot program I pushed to include \nthat will create a new Medicare designation of ``rural community \nhospitals''. These hospitals will receive cost-based reimbursements for \nMedicare services. Seven Nebraska hospitals will take part in the 5-\nyear program resulting in an additional $22.5 million for these \nhospitals to help them continue to provide high quality health care in \ntheir communities.\n  Rural community hospitals are currently unable to keep pace with \ntheir costs. They are too big to qualify for additional Critical Access \nHospitals funds, yet too small to take advantage of the volume benefits \nof larger hospitals. This new pilot program will allow Nebraska's rural \ncommunity hospitals to immediately benefit from cost-based \nreimbursements for inpatient services while testing the feasibility of \nextending the program to similar hospitals across the Nation.\n  The seven hospitals are Beatrice Community Hospital, Box Butte \nGeneral Hospital in Alliance, Columbus Community Hospital, Community \nHospital of McCook, Jennie Melham Memorial Medical Center in Broken \nBow, Phelps Memorial Health Center in Holdrege and Tri County Hospital \nin Lexington.\n  Nationwide, this bill also takes steps to ensure that seniors do not \nlose their employer-sponsored health coverage. Originally, the \nconferees only handled this issue halfway through a subsidy covering 28 \npercent of costs to employers $250 and $1000. I, and others, did not \nbelieve this would do enough to protect these benefits. So we have made \nthat subsidy non-taxable; increasing the value of the subsidy by a \nthird. Because of this increase, the Congressional Budget Office has \nstated that the drop rate for seniors could decrease by half; saving \nthese benefits for millions of seniors.\n  The bill before us is not perfect, but it is a start. I do not \nbelieve this bill is the beginning of the end of Medicare, nor do I \nbelieve that it is the final solution to the skyrocketing costs of \nhealth care.\n  With passage of this legislation, for the first time, seniors will \nhave access to prescription drugs through Medicare. And we will be able \nto use this bill to build better coverage in the future. This bill goes \nfully into effect in 2 years; time that can be spent studying this \ncoverage, adapting it and making sure it works for our seniors.\n  For too long, seniors have waited for this coverage. Many of those \nseniors are not here to see it happen today. They are no longer with \nus; they never got the drug coverage they needed. It is too late for \nthem.\n  But it is not too late for millions of seniors across the country to \nbenefit from this bill. We owe it to them to pass this and get a \nconcrete start on this issue. We can make changes if we need to; but we \ncan't get back the time we will have lost if we do not move forward \nnow.\n  A vote against this bill will leave tens of thousands of seniors in \nNebraska without a prescription drug benefit of any kind. Let's pass \nthis bill before it is too late for today's seniors. We may not get an \nopportunity like this again.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I want to speak for a moment today about \nthe impact on States from this Medicare prescription drug bill. I have \nlong been concerned about our States' fiscal crisis, and I have \nsupported fiscal relief through the so-called ``FMAP'' increase, \nthrough increases in SSBG, and through general revenue sharing. And I \nam pleased that, in the long term, this bill is expected to result in \nsubstantial savings to States more than $17 billion by 2013.\n  But I remain concerned about the impact that this bill will have on \nStates in the short term. Before this bill had been finalized, when \nthere were early indications that States could be harmed by the so-\ncalled ``holdback'' formula in the first years of the drug benefit, I \ninsisted that the formula be revised. We added $4.5 billion so that the \nimpact on states of the ``woodwork effect,'' new administrative costs, \nand the ``holdback'' provisions would not ultimately put the States in \nthe red in any year of the drug benefit.\n  As sometimes happens, preliminary budget estimates did not turn out \nexactly as expected. The overall impact on State Medicaid budgets in \nthe first year of the drug benefit will still result in States spending \nmore than they will save. While I regret that, I firmly believe that, \nin the long run, this bill will strengthen State budgets and take some \npressure off of strained Medicaid programs.\n  If a longer term analysis shows that there are unexpected costs to \nStates in the early years, or the expected costs are higher than we can \nknow today, I pledge to work over the next 2 years to ensure that the \nStates are not harmed when the Medicare drug benefit goes into effect.\n  Mr. President, one of the most important provisions in the rural \npackage in this bill would reauthorize the Rural Hospital Flexibility \nGrant program for another 5 years. This grant program was created along \nwith the Rural Hospital Flexibility Program, RHFP, in the Balanced \nBudget Act of 1997.\n  The RHFP is designed to help ensure continued access to medical \nservices in rural and frontier areas of our Nation that otherwise could \nnot sustain hospital services. The BBA created a new category of \nhospital called a Critical Access Hospital, CAH. In my State of \nMontana, 36 acute care hospitals have converted to CAH status.\n  The Rural Hospital Flexibility Grant program provides the tools \nStates need to implement the RHFP. The purposes of this grant program \nare many.\n  First, it provides resources to cash-strapped rural hospitals to help \nthem make the conversion to CAH status.\n  Second, it enables States to provide technical assistance to these \nfacilities as they move through the conversion process.\n  Third, this grant program provides resources to help States further \nstabilize rural health care by fostering and developing networks of \nproviders in rural areas.\n  Fourth, the program enables States to initiate a variety of other \ninnovative approaches to stabilize and improve health care in rural \nareas. For example, in my State of Montana, Flex grant funds have \nenabled the State's CAHs to develop a pioneering quality improvement \nprogram.\n  There was strong support for reauthorization of this grant program \namong the conferees. There was also strong support for clarifying how \nthese funds could be used to ensure that as much of this money as \npossible was used for the direct benefit of CAHs and other rural \nproviders in the States.\n  In that regard, the bill was intended to specify that no more than 15 \npercent of a State's grant allocation be used for ``indirect'' \nadministrative costs. However, in drafting the bill, the word \n``indirect'' was inadvertently dropped from the language.\n  I would like to clarify the intention of the conference committee \nthat this 15-percent restriction be applied only to the amount of funds \nthat can be used for ``indirect'' administrative expenses.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the majority leader, Senator Frist, joins me \nin this\n\n[[Page S15757]]\n\nexplanation of why the conference agreement on the Medicare \nPrescription Drug and Modernization Act of 2003 does not allow \nincreased importation of drugs from outside the United States. Our \nexplanation provides important background information on this largely \nmisunderstood issue that is vital to the health and safety of \nAmericans.\n  Under current law, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \nestablishes a system under which prescription drugs must be approved by \nthe FDA and properly labeled, packaged, tested, stored, and distributed \npursuant to FDA regulatory requirements. This is the finest and most \neffective system in the world for ensuring drug safety, effectiveness, \nand quality.\n  To protect American consumers by ensuring the integrity of this \nsystem, the law generally prohibits the importation of prescription \ndrugs. Section 801(a) of the Act prohibits importation of drugs that \nare unapproved, adulterated, or misbranded. Virtually all prescription \ndrugs manufactured overseas for distribution in foreign countries fail \none or more of these standards and, therefore, cannot legally be \nimported into the United States. It is important to note in this regard \nthat just because a drug is manufactured in a facility that is subject \nto FDA inspection does not mean that the drug meets FDA approval or \nother requirements. Different countries have different manufacturing, \ntesting, labeling, packaging, and other requirements from those imposed \nby the FDA, and in fact the composition of the drug product itself may \nvary from country to country. Manufacturers may use a single facility \nto manufacture a drug for several different countries, but they must \nvary their processes to ensure that each drug lot will satisfy the \nrequirements of the intended destination country.\n  Some drugs available overseas are manufactured in the United States \nand then exported. Section 801(d) of the Act prohibits the \nimportation--sometimes called reimportation--of these drugs. Congress \nadded section 801(d) through the Prescription Drug Marketing Act in \n1988 to close a loophole under which counterfeit and substandard drugs \nwere being brought into this country. There is an exception to this \nprohibition for the original manufacturer, who is part of the U.S. \nsystem and subject at all times to FDA authority and oversight. The \nmanufacturer's own importation of drugs that have never been outside \nits control is comparable to shipments between its manufacturing plants \nand warehouses within the United States, and is completely different \nfrom the importation of drugs that have been placed into the wholesale \nand retail distribution systems of foreign countries, where they are no \nlonger subject to FDA jurisdiction.\n  In 2000, Congress authorized an additional exception to section \n801(d) in the Medicine Equity and Drug Safety Act. This law added a new \nsection 804 under which pharmacists and wholesalers would be permitted \nto import drugs from a list of designated countries, including Canada \nand the countries of the European Union. In order to protect American \nconsumers, Congress provided that section 804 would not become \neffective until the Secretary of Health and Human Services demonstrates \nto Congress that its implementation will ``pose no additional risk to \nthe public's health and safety'' and will ``result in a significant \nreduction in the cost of covered products to the American consumer.'' \nSecretary Shalala and Secretary Thompson both concluded that they could \nnot make this demonstration.\n  FDA has a written policy under which it permits an individual to \nimport a small quantity of a prescription drug for personal use, but \nonly if the drug is not available in the United States. This policy is \nintended to allow seriously ill patients to obtain unapproved drugs to \ntreat potentially life-threatening and similar conditions for which \nadequate treatment is unavailable in the United States. It does not \napply to importation of drugs that are approved in the United States or \nto any commercial activities, such as Internet or print advertising or \nimportation by persons other than individual patients. Moreover, even \nimportation within the four corners of this policy remains technically \nillegal; the policy represents only a reasonable and limited exercise \nof FDA's enforcement discretion in the interest of individual patient \ntreatment.\n  A final, and important, legal requirement is that a prescription drug \ncan only be dispensed to the patient based on a valid prescription. \nOtherwise, the drug is misbranded and cannot be imported, or shipped \ndomestically. There is extensive evidence documenting the fact that \nmany foreign interest sites ship drugs without requiring any \nprescription at all, or with an invalid prescription based on a \nperfunctory questionnaire and without any genuine medical examination--\nco-signing of prescriptions by foreign physicians who have no \nrelationship with the patient does not meet the legal requirements and \npresents serious risks, as both U.S. and foreign authorities have made \nclear. These activities put patients at risk by taking the licensed \nhealthcare professional out of the process for deciding whether to \ninitiate or continue treatment. Prescription drugs are classified as \nsuch because they cannot safely be used by laypersons without proper \nprofessional oversight. Drug importation commonly violates this basic \nsafeguard.\n  Despite the existing prohibitions on drug importation, the volume of \nimportation activity is growing as foreign pharmacies and domestic \nstorefront facilitators advertise for business, and state and local \ngovernments and others explore ways to direct American consumers to \nforeign sources for their needed medicines. All of these activities are \nillegal, and they pose threats to our health and safety.\n  According to the FDA, imported drugs are too often unapproved, \ncontaminated, counterfeit, and contain different ingredients from those \nrequired under agency regulations. These are not mere theoretical \nconcerns. A recent series of spot inspections conducted jointly by the \nFDA and the U.S. Bureau of Customs and Border Protection found that 88 \npercent of more than 1,000 examined drug packages contained unapproved \ndrugs and that they could pose ``clear safety problems.'' These \nincluded an unapproved blood thinner that could cause life-threatening \nbleeding; unapproved epilepsy, thyroid, and diabetes drugs that could \ncause life-threatening side effects; drugs that have been withdrawn \nfrom the U.S. market because of safety concerns; animal drugs not \napproved for human use; drugs with dangerous interactions; drugs \nimproperly packaged in sandwich bags and tissue paper; and controlled \nsubstances. In another case involving a Web site purporting to ship \nFDA-approved drugs from Canada, a patient received an unapproved \nseizure medicine manufactured in India. In another case involving a \nU.S. storefront operation, the Web site shipped unrefrigerated insulin, \nwhich can degrade without changing its appearance and thereby put \ninsulin-dependent diabetic patients at risk. Other examples abound, \nincluding deaths from overdoses of drugs obtained from foreign Internet \nsites, as documented in a recent press report of a year-long \ninvestigation into illegal drug importation, counterfeiting, and \ndistribution.\n\n  Another recent study also concludes that drug importation increases \nthe risk of terrorism against the United States. Huge volumes of \npackages, only a miniscule fraction of which can be inspected, present \nan inviting target for the deliberate introduction of contaminants and \npoisons. Last year, in the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism \nPreparedness and Response Act, Congress gave the FDA substantial new \npowers to protect the safety of the food supply against terrorist \nthreats. FDA has been implementing this law through new rules requiring \nadvance notice of food importations and similar measures. Imported \ndrugs present comparable threats, yet there is neither an analogous set \nof prior-notice requirements nor adequate inspection resources to \nenforce existing legal standards.\n  Proponents of loosening the existing standards for drug importation \nhave argued that we can rely on the Canadian drug regulatory system to \nensure the safety of drugs exported from that country to the United \nStates. This is simply wrong. Section 37 of the Canadian Food and Drug \nAct provides that it does not apply to exports. In a recent letter, the \nCanadian government made clear that it ``has never stated that it would \nbe responsible for the safety and quality of prescription drugs \nexported\n\n[[Page S15758]]\n\nfrom Canada into the United States.'' Health Canada also has described \nits concerns with cross-border Internet pharmacy sales as relating to \nthe health of Canadians themselves as it should be.\n  While we have no doubt that the Canadian system works for Canadians, \nFDA Commissioner McClellan has made clear that purchases of drugs by \nAmericans from Canada present entirely different concerns:\n\n       Buying between the U.S. and Canadian systems is not the \n     same thing as buying within each system. The U.S. and Canada \n     do not have integrated systems for taking timely action to \n     protect consumers in the event of a safety problem involving \n     an illegally imported drug in the U.S. Protections to assure \n     the appropriateness of a prescription, such as requirements \n     for physician contact and monitoring, may differ. And each \n     country has only limited resources to devote to their \n     existing systems for assuring drug safety for their own \n     populations, let alone to assuring the safety of an expanded \n     scope and volume of drug imports. For example, Ontario, \n     Canada's largest province . . . , has exactly one \n     investigator tasked with policing all pharmacy operations \n     there. . .\n\n  In addition, as also documented by the FDA many drugs purporting to \ncome from Canada actually were manufactured in Third World countries \nand either transshipped through Canada or shipped directly from those \ncountries to the United States, in either case without any oversight \nfrom Canadian health officials. Such transshipment is becoming \nincreasingly common, with Canadian sites now obtaining their products \nfrom countries such as Bulgaria, Argentina, and Pakistan for sale into \nthe United States.\n  Importation supporters also have suggested that anticounterfeiting \ntechnologies can be used to assure the safety of imported drugs. This, \ntoo, is a false promise. Optical anticounterfeiting measures are used \nin our paper currency, yet they have proven inadequate. Even the new \n$20 bill, which incorporates multiple anticounterfeiting measures, is \nbeing counterfeited less than a month after its introduction. \nCounterfeit drugs, of course, present far greater concerns. The FDA is \nexploring anticounterfeiting technologies for drugs but, as \nCommissioner McClellan has made clear, ``there isn't any magic bullet \navailable today,'' and these technologies are ``no substitute for a \ncomprehensive, multi-part system for assuring the safety of the actual \ndrug product.'' Moreover, even the ineffective anticounterfeiting \ntechnologies that are available would be very expensive, raising drug \ncosts by an estimated $2 billion in the first year alone.\n  Finally, the question of legal liability for adulterated or \ncounterfeit drugs remains unresolved. American companies should not be \nheld legally responsible for drugs they did not manufacture, or that \nwere adulterated after leaving their control or that they manufactured \nto comply with foreign country requirements rather than for sale in the \nUnited States. The U.S. Government should not be held legally \nresponsible for drugs that it did not actually test and approve, or \nthat were adulterated after the approval process was complete and the \ndrugs were no longer subject to FDA oversight.\n  In short, drug importation presents a wide range of serious safety \nconcerns. We cannot meet these challenges merely by writing \nprohibitions into the law. The law already requires that drugs be FDA-\napproved, yet it is abundantly clear that unapproved and other \nviolative products are streaming across our borders every day. Changes \nin the law to relax the current prohibitions on importation will only \nincrease this cross-border traffic and, in the absence of new legal \nprotections and new resources to effectively to enforce them, increase \nthe threat to the American public.\n  The United States has every right under our international agreements \nto enforce legitimate regulatory requirements relating to the health \nand safety of our citizens. There is no question that the drug \nimportation provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act meet \nthis standard.\n  Canada and other foreign countries impose price controls on \npharmaceuticals as part of their high-tax social welfare systems. No \nreasonable concept of free trade requires that our country open its \nborders to drugs whose prices are kept artificially low under these \nsystems. In fact, a leading scholar and supporter of free trade rights, \nProfessor Richard Epstein of the University of Chicago Law School, has \ndescribed drug importation as ``a perversion of the basic principle of \nfree trade.''\n  Pharmaceutical price controls are a trade issue that must be urgently \naddressed by our government so that foreign countries and their \ncitizens bear a fair share of research and development costs for new \nmedicines. Price and access controls imposed by foreign countries \nconstitute trade barriers within the meaning of our existing trade \nlaws, and we urge the administration to use the full extent of its \nauthority in bilateral and multilateral negotiations to remove these \nbarriers for the benefit of all Americans. In fact, the legislation we \nconsider today requires the U.S. Trade Representative to develop a \nstrategy for negotiating the elimination of price controls and requires \ntimely Congressional briefings on the subject.\n  Drug coverage, particularly for Medicare beneficiaries as established \nby this bill, is the most important step we can take to ensure access. \nFor those without coverage, drug importation imposes only great risks \nand offers little or nothing in the way of savings.\n  There is no evidence to suggest that drug importation actually will \nsave money for American consumers. As the FDA has stated, ``it is \nlikely that the intended cost-savings for consumers would be absorbed \nby fees charged by exporters, pharmacists, wholesalers, and testing \nlabs.'' This is confirmed by the European experience with parallel \nimportation, which demonstrates that the only real beneficiaries are \nmiddlemen in the distribution chain, not the ultimate consumers. Recent \nexperience in Canada also makes clear that Canadians will act to \nprotect the integrity and availability of drug supplies for their own \ncitizens if these are threatened by importation, which will lead to \nhigher prices for imported drugs--as well as increased transshipment \nfrom third-world drug supply sources, as discussed above.\n  In any event, claims of enormous cross-border price differentials are \nwidely exaggerated because they do not reflect intelligent comparative \nshopping or appropriate adjustments for currency and standard-of-living \ndifferences. Surveys of legitimate American pharmacy Internet sites and \nretailers show that substantial discounts can be obtained right here in \nthe United States, with full confidence in product safety, quality, and \nintegrity.\n  The myriad of questions and concerns we have raised here explain why, \nrather than allow importation of drugs, this legislation calls for a \ncomprehensive study of the risks and benefits of importing drugs and of \nhow trade negotiations can be used to begin bringing down price \ncontrols, so that Americans and everyone else in the developed world \nshare fairly in the costs of drug research and development.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise before the Senate in support of \nthe conference report accompanying the Medicare Prescription Drug and \nModernization Act. While the conference report before the Senate is not \na perfect bill, it is a good bill that will finally provide seniors a \nvoluntary prescription drug benefit through Medicare.\n  After years of having to carry the burden of high prescription drug \ncosts without any assistance from Medicare, the bill that is before the \nSenate now, which has the full support of the AARP, will finally \nprovide 40 million Medicare beneficiaries nationwide, 1.6 million in \nOhio, access to affordable prescription drugs.\n  I would like to applaud the work of our Leader, Senator Frist; our \nFinance Committee Chairman, Senator Grassley; and the Finance Committee \nRanking Member, Senator Baucus. Through their leadership, the Senate is \npoised to finally move past politics and provide seniors with a real \nprescription drug benefit.\n  Unfortunately, we have fiddled around with the issue of Medicare \nreform for far too long in Washington. The truth is, even if the Senate \npasses the bill before us today, its full implementation will not occur \nuntil 2006. For those of my colleagues who have said that we are moving \ntoo quickly in adding a prescription drug benefit, the fact of the \nmatter is that the Senate has not moved quickly enough.\n  As with the rest of the Nation, currently, Ohio's seniors are paying \ntoo\n\n[[Page S15759]]\n\nmuch out-of-pocket for their prescription drugs. The cost of these \nlife-saving drugs is increasingly becoming a large burden for seniors, \nwith some even traveling to Canada to find cheaper drugs. Seniors \nshould not have to go to a foreign country to receive the drugs that \ntheir doctors prescribe. It is time seniors receive access to \naffordable prescription drugs in the United States.\n  This legislation will finally provide Medicare beneficiaries with a \nvoluntary prescription drug benefit. This is especially important to \nthe 400,232 Medicare beneficiaries in Ohio that currently have no \npublic or private prescription drug coverage.\n  For those beneficiaries that already have coverage through another \nsource, such as through a former employer, and would like to keep that \ncoverage, this legislation supports that choice as well.\n  As my colleagues know, approximately 12 million of the 40 million \nMedicare beneficiaries currently have prescription drug coverage \nthrough former employer-based retiree health plans.\n  Many Ohioans that I have spoke to have concerns that the creation of \na new Medicare drug benefit may cause many of them to lose their \nretiree coverage. However, the bipartisan conference report encourages \nemployers to continue to provide coverage to their retirees by \nproviding assistance for retirees' health care costs, including their \nprescription drugs costs.\n  In fact, the conference report provides $86 billion in subsidies to \nassist employers who continue to provide their retirees with health \ncare coverage. This is critical because scores of retirees have lost \ntheir health care benefits over the past several years. The bottom line \nis that this bill will help employers to continue to provide their \nretirees with health care security.\n  Not only will seniors have access to affordable prescription drugs \nwith this bill, they will have access to benefits that a modern health \nplan should have, such as preventive care and disease management--\noptions that Medicare currently does not provide.\n  Moreover, these additional benefits are provided by giving seniors a \nchoice and control over their prescription drug plans and health care \nproviders.\n  While the Senate is on the brink of finally strengthening and \nmodernizing Medicare, I would be remiss if I did not take a step back \nand point out the roadmap that has lead us to this point.\n  The President has led the way to providing seniors with access to \naffordable prescription drugs. If my colleagues recall, at the \nbeginning of the year, the President provided in his budget $400 \nbillion for Medicare reform, which included adding a prescription drug \nbenefit. This substantial amount illustrated his commitment to our \nnation's seniors. That was the first step.\n  Following the President was the action taken by Congress to lay out a \nblueprint for Medicare. During the prescription drug debate in 2002, \nthe Senate operated without a budget resolution--the first time the \nSenate has not done so since 1974. However, this year Congress operated \nunder a budget resolution.\n  Through these efforts, and those of the Finance Committee, a bill \nstands before the Senate that strikes a balance between providing \nseniors and the disabled access to needed prescription drugs today and \ndoing so in a fiscally sensible way that will allow benefits to extend \nto future generations.\n  And while opponents of the bill claim that the benefits provided are \nnot large enough, $400 billion does buy an awful lot.\n  Beginning in 2004, seniors will receive a prescription drug discount \ncard that will provide immediate savings of 10 to 25 percent on most \nprescription drug purchases. On top of these discounts, the Federal \nGovernment would annually purchase the first $600 in prescription drug \ncosts for those seniors below 135 percent of poverty.\n  The implementation of the full program, which will include a new \nMedicare Part D and a Medicare Advantage program, will begin in January \n2006. All Medicare beneficiaries will receive substantial subsidies \nthrough these new benefits. However, low-income seniors will receive \nadditional assistance on top of these subsidies. In Ohio, this means \n624,416 seniors will receive additional assistance.\n  For the 152,470 neediest seniors in my State of Ohio, those who \nqualify for both Medicare and Medicaid, under this bill they would pay: \nnothing in premiums; nothing in deductibles; and a nominal cost-share \nof no more than $1 for a generic drug and no more than $3 for a name-\nbrand drug.\n  For the 492,872 seniors in my State of Ohio with incomes below 135 \npercent of poverty, and assets of no more than $6,000 per individual \nand $9,000 per couple, under this bill they would pay: nothing in \npremiums; nothing in deductibles; and A nominal cost-share of $2 for a \ngeneric drug and $5 for a name-brand drug.\n  For those 131,544 seniors in my State of Ohio with incomes between \n135 and 150 percent of poverty, and assets of no more than $10,000 per \nindividual and $20,000 per couple, under this bill they would pay: \npremiums based on a sliding scale but NO MORE than $35 per month; $50 \nannual deductible; and 15 percent co-payments up to $3,600 after \n$3,600, seniors would pay a nominal cost-share of $2 for a generic drug \nand $5 for a name-brand drug.\n  For seniors over 150 percent of poverty, the standard subsidized \nbenefit would include: $250 annual deductible; $35 average monthly \npremium; the government would pick up 75 percent of beneficiary out-of-\npocket costs for drug expenses up to $2,250; between $2,251 and $3,600, \nbeneficiaries cover all drug expenses out-of-pocket; and the government \nwould pick up 95 percent of beneficiary out-of-pocket costs for drug \nexpenses above $3,600.\n  In addition to the stand-alone benefit under traditional Medicare, \nthe conference report would establish the Medicare Advantage program. \nAll Medicare Advantage plans will be required to offer at least the \nstandard drug benefit established in H.R. 1 and would be encouraged to \noffer beneficiaries enhanced access to the latest in health care \ntechnology through disease management, chronic care, and quality \nimprovement programs.\n  These plans have the opportunity to provide seniors with better \ncoverage at affordable prices. To help ensure participation in rural \nand urban areas equally, Medicare Advantage plans would submit bids to \nthe Centers on Medicare and Medicaid Services on a regional basis. The \nFederal Government will share the risk with insurance companies and \nthese plans.\n  It should also be noted that while the thrust of this bill is to \nprovide seniors with access to affordable prescription drugs, the bill \nalso ensures that seniors will continue to have access to current \nMedicare benefits as well.\n  For instance, while the relationship between a senior and their \nphysician is paramount, last year, Medicare was scheduled to cut \nphysician payments by 4.4 percent, which threatening seniors' access to \ntheir doctors. Physicians had already received a 5.4 percent cut in \n2002.\n  Congress temporarily fixed the formula in 2003 and doctors received a \nmodest increase of 1.6 percent instead of a cut. For 2004, physicians \nwere again scheduled to take a 4.5 percent cut. However, to ensure that \nseniors have access to their physician of choice, this bill includes \nmodest increase in payments of 1.5 percent for both 2004 and 2005.\n  Additionally, physicians and their staffs have become increasingly \ninundated with regulations and paperwork from Medicare. Provisions are \nincluded in the bill to streamline some of this paperwork so that \ndoctors can spend more time with their patients rather than filling out \nreams and reams of Government forms.\n  Seniors in rural areas will also be assured of continual access to \nMedicare benefits. One of the most important aspects of the bill is the \nrural provider provisions. Through the bill, providers in rural areas \nwill be placed on an equal footing to that of their urban counterparts. \nSome of the specific rural provisions include: equalization of the \nurban and rural payments for inpatient hospital services under \nMedicare; revision of the labor-related share of the wage index used in \nMedicare's payment system. Rural hospitals, because their local wage \nlevels are lower than urban areas, are adversely affected by a high \nlabor-related share; increase in payments to home health agencies by \nfive percent for services furnished in rural areas; and increase in \npayment for physicians that serve\n\n[[Page S15760]]\n\nbeneficiaries in counties where there are a scarcity of physicians.\n  The House of Representatives has already acted and the President is \nwaiting to sign the bill into law. It is time that the Senate act and \npass the Medicare Prescription Drug and Modernization Act.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, since Medicare was established in 1965, \npeople are living longer and living better. Today Medicare covers more \nthan 40 million Americans, including 35 million over the age of 65 and \nnearly 6 million younger adults with permanent disabilities.\n  Congress now has the opportunity to modernize this important Federal \nentity to create a 21st century Medicare Program that offers \ncomprehensive coverage for pharmaceutical drugs and improves the \nMedicare delivery system.\n  The Medicare Prescription Drug and Modernization Act would make \navailable a voluntary Medicare prescription drug plan for all seniors. \nIf enacted, Medicare beneficiaries would have access to a discount card \nfor prescription drug purchases starting in 2004. Projected savings \nfrom cards for consumers would range between 10 to 25 percent. A $600 \nsubsidy would be applied to the card, offering additional assistance \nfor low-income beneficiaries defined as 160 percent or below the \nFederal poverty level. Effective January 1, 2006, a new optional \nMedicare prescription drug benefit would be established under Medicare \nPart D.\n  This bill has the potential to make a dramatic difference for \nmillions of Americans living with lower incomes and chronic health care \nneeds. Low-income Medicare beneficiaries, who make up 44 percent of all \nMedicare beneficiaries, would be provided with prescription drug \ncoverage with minimal out-of-pocket costs. In Pennsylvania, this \nbenefit would be further enhanced by including the Prescription \nAssistance Contract for the Elderly (PACE) program which will work in \ncoordination with Medicare to provide increased cost savings for low-\nincome beneficiaries.\n  For medical services, Medicare beneficiaries will have the freedom to \nremain in traditional fee-for-service Medicare, or enroll in a Health \nMaintenance Organization (HMO) or a Preferred Provider Organization \n(PPO), also called Medicare Advantage. These programs offer \nbeneficiaries a wide choice of health care providers, while also \ncoordinating health care effectively, especially for those with \nmultiple chronic conditions. Medicare Advantage health plans would be \nrequired to offer at least the standard drug benefit, available through \ntraditional fee-for-service Medicare.\n  We already know that there are many criticisms directed to this bill \nat various levels. Many would like to see the prescription drug program \ncover all of the costs without deductibles and without copays. There \nhas been allocated in our budget plan $400 billion for prescription \ndrug coverage. That is, obviously, a very substantial sum of money. \nThere are a variety of formulas which could be worked out to utilize \nthis funding. The current plan, depending upon levels of income has \nseveral levels of coverage from a deductible to almost full coverage \nunder a ``catastrophic'' illness. One area of concern is the so-called \n``donut hole'' which requires a recipient to pay the entire cost of rug \ncoverage.\n  As I have reviewed these projections and analyses, it is hard to say \nwhere the line ought to be drawn. It is a value judgment as to what \ndeductibles and what the copays ought to be and for whom. Though I am \nseriously troubled by the so-called donut hole, it is calculated to \nencourage people to take the medical care they really need, and be \naffordable for those with lower levels of income. Then, when the costs \nmove into the ``catastrophic'' illness range, the plan would pay for \nnearly all of the medical costs.\n  I am pleased that this bill contains a number of improvements for the \nproviders of health care to Medicare beneficiaries. Physicians who are \nscheduled to receive cuts in 2004 and 2005 will receive a 1.5 percent \nincrease over that time. Moreover, rural health care providers will \nreceive much needed increases in Medicare reimbursement through raises \nto disproportionate share hospitals and standardized amounts, and a \ndecrease in the labor share in the Medicare reimbursement formula. \nHospitals across Pennsylvania will benefit from upgrades to the \nhospital market basket update and increases in the Indirect Medical \nEducation. Furthermore, the bill will provide $900 million for \nhospitals in metropolitan statistical areas with high labor costs due \nto their close proximity to urban areas that provide a \ndisproportionately high wage. These hospitals may apply for wage index \nreclassification for three years starting in 2004.\n  I would note that I do have concerns with this legislation with \nregard to oncological Medicare reimbursement and the premium support \ndemonstration project for Medicare Part B coverage. Proposed reductions \nin the average wholesale price for oncological pharmaceuticals may have \na grave effect on oncologists' ability to provide cancer care to \nMedicare Beneficiaries. Every Medicare beneficiary suffering from \ncancer should have access to oncologists that they desperately need. I \nwill pay close attention to the effects that this provision has on the \nquality and availability of cancer care for beneficiaries and \noncologists' ability to provide that care. Further, the premium support \ndemonstration project for Medicare Part B premiums poses a concern. \nSome metropolitan areas may face up to a five percent higher premium \nfor fee-for-service care than neighboring areas. While these provisions \nremain troublesome, we cannot let the perfect become the enemy of the \ngood with this piece of legislation.\n  The Medicare Prescription Drug legislation has been worked on for \nmany years. I believe this bill will provide a significant improvement \nto the vital health care seniors so urgently need. I congratulate the \nmembers of the conference committee including Majority Leader Frist, \nSenator Grassley, Chairman of the Finance Committee, and the Ranking \nMember, Senator Baucus, for the outstanding work which they have done \non an extraordinary complex bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request to \nclarify plans for at least early in the morning. I ask unanimous \nconsent that when the Senate resumes the conference report to accompany \nH.R. 1 on Tuesday at 8:15 a.m., the time until 9:15 be equally divided \nbetween the chairman or his designee and the Democrat leader or his \ndesignee; further, I ask consent at 9:15 the Senate proceed to a vote \non the adoption of the conference report, with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the majority leader will yield for a question, is it \nthe intention of the majority leader to adjourn after that vote?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, through the Chair, we are currently still \nnegotiating and working on the omnibus, and we will continue to work \nfor the next probably 6 to 7 hours. So I will not be able to comment \ndefinitively until probably first thing in the morning. Again, we \ncontinue to work. Initially, we hoped to make progress even tonight on \nthe omnibus, but we were unable to do that. So we will not be \nadjourning right afterwards. We will likely be in through tomorrow and \nwould like to get as far as we can with the omnibus at that time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if the majority leader will yield for \nanother question, will there be an effort to extend unemployment \ncompensation benefits before we adjourn?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, at this point I really cannot comment \nintelligently until we further have our discussions through the night \nin terms of what the plans will be over the course of tomorrow.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, over the past few days, we have heard a \nnumber of criticisms of the bill. And there is one criticism in \nparticular that I want to address.\n  Opponents have claimed that the bill fails to contain prescription \ndrug costs. I can only presume that this criticism reflects a \nmisunderstanding--because the bipartisan agreement includes a number of \ncritical provisions to lower prescription drug costs.\n  Under the Hatch-Waxman law, generic approval is allowed when a new\n\n[[Page S15761]]\n\ndrug's patent and market exclusivity protection expires, or when a 30-\nmonth stay terminates. The intent is to provide incentives to develop \nvaluable new drug treatments through patent protection, but also to \nfacilitate access to generic versions of the drug after the innovator's \npatent expires. However, access to generic drugs has sometimes been \nimproperly delayed.\n  Earlier this Summer, the Senate voted 94-1 in favor of reforms \ndeveloped by Senators Gregg and Schumer to close existing loopholes in \nthe law. And the bipartisan agreement retains these critical reforms, \nensuring speedier access to generic drugs for all Americans. Under the \nbipartisan agreement, a new drug applicant will receive only one 30-\nmonth stay of approval of a generic's application, for patents \nsubmitted to FDA prior to the generic application. The agreement also \ntakes additional steps to reduce or eliminate the delays in the \nmovement of generic drugs to the marketplace.\n  As a result, patients will benefit from grater access to safe, \neffective, low-cost generic alternatives to brand name medicines. \nThat's why this bill is supported by the Generic Pharmaceutical \nAssociation and the Coalition for a Competitive Pharmaceutical Market. \nI would like to submit their letters of support for the Record.\n  The competition in this bill achieves significant ``bang for the \nbuck'' because it relies on drug plans to negotiate discounts. CBO says \nthe private insurance model has a cost management factor of 25 \npercent--the effect of price discounts, rebates, utilization controls, \nand other tools that a PDP might use to control spending. By relying on \nthe bargaining power of drug plans, this bill will drive down the costs \nof prescription drugs.\n  The bipartisan agreement enhances research on the comparative \nclinical effectiveness of prescription drugs. This information will be \nquickly disseminated. By giving patients, health care professionals, \nhealth plans and the Medicare program better information on the \ncomparative effectiveness of treatment options, this provision will \nensure that patients and health care consumers get the most value for \ntheir money.\n  The bill includes other key cost containments. Prescription drug \nnegotiations will not be subject to the Medicaid ``best price'' rules. \nCompeting plans will get even better prices for seniors and disabled \npersons. Last year, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that \nexempting Medicare from best price rules would save $18 billion between \n2003 and 2012.\n  The bipartisan Medicare agreement will lower prescription drug costs. \nThat is why it has been endorsed by pro-consumer groups including \nthe American Association of Retired Persons and the Coalition for a \nCompetitive Pharmaceutical Market.\n\n  However, opponents have claimed that this language ``prevents'' the \nFederal Government from negotiating drug prices.\n  The bill specifies that the government ``may not interfere with the \nnegotiations between drug manufacturers and pharmacies and PDP \nsponsors'' and ``may not require a particular formulary or institute a \nprice structure.'' In fact, this provision first appeared in May 2000 \nin a Democratic bill. The provision protects patients by keeping the \ngovernment out of decisions about which medicines they will be able to \nreceive.\n  Through this bill, we are giving seniors new access to affordable \nprescription drugs. We are speeding the pace of cheaper generic drugs \nto the market. We are providing for research on the comparative \neffectiveness of prescription drugs. We are providing a drug discount \ncard and greater relief for low-income seniors. And we are unleashing \npowerful new market forces that will drive down the costs of \nprescription drugs.\n  But some continue to advocate for so-called ``reimportation.'' This \nis unnecessary and unsafe. The FDA has much evidence of counterfeit, \nexpired, mislabeled, subpotent and superpotent drugs shipped into the \nUnited States from all over the world. Health Canada is on the record \nsaying that they will not guarantee the safety of drugs sold to \nAmericans. Numerous current and former FDA and law enforcement \nofficials have testified that this is not safe. Just last month, the \nWashington Post ran a detailed series revealing a vast, complicated \nnetwork of ``criminal profiteers, unscrupulous wholesalers, rogue \nInternet sites, and foreign pharmacies.'' The result has been deadly.\n  In St. Charles Missouri, a 61-year-old breast cancer patient was \nunknowingly sold diluted cancer medication by her local drugstore. \nSeven months after being sold the phony batch, she was dead. In \nSacramento, a wife found her 47-year-old husband on the living room \ncouch dead of an overdose of painkillers. He had obtained the pills \nfrom multiple pharmacies all over the world.\n  These disturbing reports bear directly upon the importation of \nprescription drugs. There is the faulty notion that this is a solution \nto drug costs. But as real life illustrates, the black market in \npharmaceuticals is a very dangerous place.\n  In 2000, Congress passed the Medicine Equity and Drug Safety Act. But \nin the 3 years and two administrations since the law has been in \neffect, no Health and Human Services Secretary--either Democrat or \nRepublican--has been willing to verify its safety. So this bill \nrequires the Department of Health and Human Services to undertake an \nin-depth study on whether there is a safe way to reimport drugs from \nCanada.\n  What we need are sensible policies. And in the Medicare legislation \nwe have them. The Medicare bill under consideration will make sure that \nseniors get the prescription drugs they need, with the safety they \nexpect.\n  Mr. President, Medicare beneficiaries have waited too long for this \ndebate. The practice of medicine has changed dramatically since the \ninception of the Medicare Program in 1965. Unfortunately, the program \nhas seen few changes or improvements.\n  Today we finally consider providing 41 million seniors and Americans \nwith disabilities with access to prescription drug coverage. Currently, \n9.9 million Medicare beneficiaries have NO drug coverage and many more \nhave only limited coverage.\n  Prescription drugs have become integral in the practice of Medicine \nand this legislation is critical to the health of current and future \nbeneficiaries. Beginning next year under this bill, seniors will \nreceive immediate, voluntary assistance with their drug costs. All \nMedicare beneficiaries would receive a discount drug card that will \nhelp bring down the cost of prescription drugs by 10-25 percent. \nMoreover, low-income seniors will receive $600 to help with their drug \ncosts.\n  In 2006, beneficiaries will have access to a comprehensive \nprescription drug benefit. Seniors with incomes above 150 percent of \nthe Federal poverty level will see savings of about half of their drug \ncosts as a result of this coverage.\n  Low-income seniors will no longer be forced to rely on Medicare for \nhelp with their drug costs. This legislation will provide coverage for \ndrug costs for even our lowest-income seniors under the Medicare \nprogram. Seniors with incomes below 150 percent of the Federal poverty \nlevel will receive coverage for all but a small percentage of their \ndrug costs.\n  Prescription drugs not only treat disease, but they can help to \nprevent disease when used as part of therapeutic treatment. For this \nreason I am proud to say that prescription drug coverage is only one of \nthe major improvements we will make to the Medicare Program. For the \nfirst time, the Medicare Program will put an emphasis on chronic care \ncoordination and disease management. Beneficiaries will receive \ncoverage for a welcome to Medicare physical. The preventive physical \nvisit is one of the best opportunities physicians have to measure \nhealth status, screen for various diseases and educate patients about \ntheir health needs.\n  The legislation will also add coverage for screenings for heart \ndisease and diabetes. Moreover, this bill directs the Secretary to \nintegrate disease management and chronic care coordination into the \nbasic Medicare program. Beginning immediately upon enactment with a \nlarge-scale pilot program, the Secretary will test methods to help \nbeneficiaries with chronic conditions, ensuring they receive preventive \ntests, procedures and treatments to better manage their disease and \nimprove their health status and quality of life.\n  This program will put the emphasis on prevention and treatment, \nrather than acute episodes of care. This is one of the most important \nreforms in the\n\n[[Page S15762]]\n\nconference agreement.  Beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions \naccount for the greatest share of Medicare spending. And low-income \nbeneficiaries are more likely to suffer from multiple chronic diseases \nand to have poorer health outcomes than higher income seniors.\n\n   Diabetes is a good example of how prescription drug coverage and \nprescription drug therapy along with a regular care regiment promise \nmore effective treatment and outcomes. Approximately 17 million \nAmericans suffer from diabetes and another 16 million adults are at \nrisk for developing diabetes. Undiagnosed and improperly treated, \ndiabetes can and will result in a host of complications that can result \nin disability and even death. These complications include kidney \nfailure, blindness, heart disease and loss of limb. According to the \nAmerican Diabetes Association, $91.9 billion dollars was spent last \nyear in direct medical expenses for diabetics.\n   Since 1995, five new classes of medicines have been introduced to \ntreat diabetes. These medicines, coupled with health management and \ncoordinated care programs, are powerful tools to increase health status \nand reduce complications. For example, a comprehensive disease \nmanagement program for approximately 7,000 diabetic patients produced \nsavings of $50 per diabetic patient per month. While pharmaceutical \ncosts increased under the program, total health care spending declined. \nThis was due to substantially fewer inpatient hospitalizations and \nreduced lengths of stay.\n  All that stands between seniors and prescription drug coverage, \ndisease management and improved health coverage is the upcoming Senate \nvote. I am confident that we will pass this conference report and send \nthe legislation to the President's desk. Seniors deserve no less.\n   Mr. President, millions of Americans experience serious health \ndisparities based on ethnicity, race, gender, or a lack of access to \nhealth care. Great progress has been made in narrowing health \ndisparities. Through advances in medical research and public policy, we \nare working to ensure better access to quality health care for all of \nour citizens. More, however, needs to be done. Let me list a few \nexamples of where there are still serious disparities in health.\n   The number of diabetes cases among African Americans has tripled \nsince the 1960s. Moreover, African Americans experience higher rates of \ndiabetes' most serious complications: blindness, amputation and kidney \nfailure.\n   One of seven Hispanics have diagnosed or undiagnosed diabetes and \nthe prevalence of type-2 diabetes is twice as high in Hispanic \nAmericans as in non-Hispanic whites.\n   American Indians and Alaska Natives are 2.3 times as likely to have \ndiabetes as non-Hispanic whites of similar age. Diabetes cases are more \nconcentrated among American Indians in the southeastern United States.\n  Asian Americans and other Pacific Islanders are approximately two \ntimes as likely to be diagnosed with diabetes as compared to their \nwhite counterparts.\n  When it comes to cardiovascular disease, African Americans have the \nhighest rate of high blood pressure of all groups and tend to develop \nit younger than others.\n  Stroke is the only leading cause of death for which mortality is \nhigher for Asian-American males.\n  Breast and cervical cancer also hit African American women more often \nthan their white counterparts.\n  Although deaths caused by breast cancer have decreased among white \nwomen since the 1980s, African American women continue to have higher \nrates of mortality from breast and cervical cancer. African Americans \nare more likely to develop cancer than whites and are about 30 percent \nmore likely to die of cancer than whites.\n  In the Medicare legislation before us, we have an opportunity to \naddress the problem of health disparities head on. Today, roughly 20 \npercent of all Medicare beneficiaries are members of minority groups. \nAnd the Census projects that, by 2025, minorities will compose 35 \npercent of all seniors. Racial and ethnic minorities covered by \nMedicare suffer from more illnesses and are more apt to live in poverty \nthan white beneficiaries.\n  So I am pleased that this bill particularly benefits racial and \nethnic minorities, and assures that minority seniors and disabled \npeople have access to needed medicines at affordable prices.\n  The bipartisan Medicare agreement will ensure better Medicare \ncoverage for minorities through new disease management services, a new \n``welcome to Medicare physical'' and new cardiovascular disease and \ndiabetes screening programs. Beginning in 2005, each year, nearly \n360,000 newly enrolled minority Medicare beneficiaries will be covered \nfor an initial physical examination. The initial preventive physical \nexam includes measurement of height, weight and blood pressure, and an \nelectrocardiogram, as well as education, counseling and referral \nrelated to other preventive services.\n  The bipartisan Medicare agreement includes new cardiovascular and \ndiabetes screening blood tests that do not have deductibles or co-pays, \nso beneficiaries with limited resources who might not otherwise access \nthese benefits are not deterred by the cost.\n  Disease Management is being introduced into the original Medicare \nprogram to provide beneficiaries the tools and support systems to help \nthem manage their chronic illnesses. Through these new benefits, \nconditions such as obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and asthma could \nbe made far less severe for millions of Medicare beneficiaries, \nincluding those racial and ethnic minorities who suffer most from these \nconditions.\n  The bipartisan agreement provides immediate help to those who need it \nmost: low-income Medicare beneficiaries who do not have prescription \ndrug coverage and do not qualify for Medicaid. This starts with the \nprescription drug discount card and builds on it to provide needed \nrelief to low-income seniors with a generously subsidized drug benefit \nin 2006.\n  Over 13 million beneficiaries under 65, across all racial/ethnic \ngroups, have very limited financial means. But these limitations are \nparticularly acute among some populations. In 1999, 46 percent of \nAfrican Americans and 55 percent of Hispanics had incomes below the \nFederal poverty level, compared with 15 percent of white beneficiaries. \nNearly two-thirds of African-American and Latino beneficiaries have \nincomes below twice the poverty level, compared with 41 percent of \nwhites.\n  Starting in 2006, more than 1.5 million minority beneficiaries will \ngain access to new drug coverage, including over a half million \nHispanic and nearly 700,000 African-American Medicare beneficiaries. \nThe Bipartisan Agreement will help cut their prescription drug bills in \nhalf. The poorest seniors--including nearly 2 million minority \nbeneficiaries--with incomes below 100 percent of the Federal poverty \nlevel who are eligible for Medicaid would pay no premiums or \ndeductibles, and would pay only nominal cost-sharing of $1 for a \ngeneric drug or a preferred multiple source drug and $3 for all other \ndrugs.\n  2.5 million low-income minority beneficiaries with incomes below 135 \npercent of the Federal poverty level would pay no premiums or \ndeductibles, and would only pay nominal cost-sharing of $2 for a \ngeneric drug or a preferred multiple source drug and $5 for any other \ndrug. More than 400,000 minority beneficiaries, with incomes below 150 \npercent of the Federal poverty level would get sliding scale subsidies \nfor their premiums, and pay both a lower deductible and lower cost-\nsharing compared to the standard benefit.\n  In addition to the low-income benefit, the bill provides that the \nFederal Government will assume the costs of dual-eligible \nbeneficiaries, allowing them to receive their medicines through a \nprivate-sector drug plan, remove the stigma of Medicaid coverage, and \nprovide fiscal relief to the States that currently pay for them.\n  Because only a third of African Americans and a quarter of Hispanics \nhave Medigap or employer-sponsored retiree benefits, compared to two-\nthirds of white beneficiaries, they are more likely to rely on Medicaid \nto supplement Medicare. In fact, 43 percent of dually-eligible \nbeneficiaries are minorities.\n  The bipartisan Medicare agreement improves services available to \nindividuals suffering from these diseases. The agreement particularly \nimproves access to prescription drugs and new services for low-income \nindividuals,\n\n[[Page S15763]]\n\nmany of whom are racial and ethnic minorities.\n  The agreement includes critical provisions to study and disseminate \nthe latest research on the comparative clinical effectiveness of \nprescription drugs and other health care services--including among \nspecific patient subpopulations. This will ensure that patients and \nproviders can make informed choices about their treatment options. It \nwill also make prescription drugs more affordable for all Americans \nthrough important provisions, speeding generic drugs to market.\n  Ultimately, by adding much-needed prescription drug coverage to \nservices already covered by Medicare, the agreement ensures that these \nindividuals have access to more comprehensive, higher quality health \ncare and treatment options.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I sincerely hope we do something about \nunemployment compensation benefits. We will be gone for 2 months. Nine \nmillion Americans are out of work. Three million have lost their jobs \nsince this President took office. Frankly, many of them have seen their \nunemployment benefits expire.\n  Historically, traditionally, on a bipartisan basis, we have extended \nthose unemployment benefits. I think it is a sad situation if we \nadjourn before this holiday season leaving literally millions of \nAmerican workers without the basics they need to keep their families \ntogether. I hope if we do nothing else, we achieve that.\n  Those who may be following this debate may wonder why, at 20 minutes \nto 10 this evening, on November 24, Senators are still on the floor \nspeaking about this legislation. This bill, which in its totality is \nabout 1,100 pages long--and the sponsor of it, Senator Grassley, my \nfriend, has admonished me not to say that the bill is 1,100 pages long \nbut that the bill and its committee report is that length--is a \nhistoric piece of legislation.\n  There are some of us who believe, if this bill passes tomorrow, in \nthe morning, as it is likely to do, that, frankly, for years to come \npeople will be asking questions about how various Senators felt, how \nthey voted, and what they did during the course of this debate. Those \nwho support it believe it will be good and they take great pride in it. \nThose of us on the other side believe this legislation is an \nabomination. When we consider the opportunity we had and the challenge \nwe had when this legislation was brought before us, this bill fails to \nmeet the test.\n  It fails in this respect: We started off saying we need to help \nsenior citizens pay for prescription drugs. Medicare did not include \nthat benefit, and it should have. We know now that prescription drugs \nkeep seniors healthy and strong and independent. We should give them a \nhelping hand to pay for those expensive drugs. I think everybody agreed \nwith that premise.\n  Then, when we started the debate, things started to change, because \nin order to achieve that goal many of us thought the Government would \nhave to step in with some money to help seniors but also we would have \nto say to the drug companies, you have to charge reasonable prices for \nyour drugs. I think those two go together.\n  To think that the Federal Government is going to somehow subsidize \nthe cost of prescription drugs and do nothing to bring those costs \ndown, frankly, is counterproductive. We cannot appropriate enough money \nto keep up with the meteoric rise in the cost of prescription drugs \nthat seniors and other families across America face.\n  Sadly, the Senate passed a bill, supported by Democrats and \nRepublicans, which at least moved in the direction of change but did \nnot move far enough. It did not contain any cost containment. It did \nnot challenge the drug companies in America to treat Americans fairly.\n  That bill passed and went to conference committee. We hoped it would \nbe improved, but it was not. In fact, the bill was worsened in many \nrespects.\n  As a result of that, many of us who had hoped for a prescription drug \nbenefit for seniors are going to oppose this particular legislation \nbecause it does not achieve that goal.\n  Sadly, it brings another element to the debate, for which many of us \nnever bargained. There are those in the Congress who believe we have to \nbasically dismantle and fundamentally change Medicare.\n  Medicare, a system of health insurance for seniors across America for \nover 40 years, has given seniors quality of life and quality health \ncare, and statistics prove that it has worked. Seniors live longer. \nThey are more independent. They are healthier. Medicare has proven that \nif we have Federal leadership, we can have doctors and hospitals \nproviding the best care to our mothers and fathers and our grandmothers \nand grandfathers.\n  But there are some who opposed it from the beginning, calling it \nsocialized medicine, and others who do not want to meet the obligations \nof Medicare as the baby boom generation qualifies to receive it. So \nthey have set upon a path to basically change Medicare as we know it.\n  That was never part of the bargain. This was supposed to be about \nprescription drugs and seniors. Instead, it switched into a new realm. \nThe House Republican leadership pushed into this conference committee a \ndramatic, and some say drastic, change in Medicare for its future. That \nhas forced many of us to not only oppose this bill but to oppose it \nstrongly, believing our first obligation is to protect Medicare and our \nsecond obligation is to give seniors the benefit they need for \nprescription drugs.\n\n  This bill has failed. This bill will raise Medicare premiums for \nmillions of senior citizens. It will force many senior citizens into \nHMOs. I do not have to explain HMOs to people who have tried to live \nwith them. A health maintenance organization or similar insurance \ncompany basically rations care. It picks the doctor, not the individual \ncovered or insured. But the HMO will pick your doctor and pick your \nhospital.\n  I think we have all heard the horror stories about HMOs that \nbasically have denied care, denied basic medical procedures because \nthey do not believe it is a worthwhile economic undertaking. So doctors \nmake decisions about what you need to stay healthy, and HMOs overrule \nthe doctors.\n  Senator Kennedy, who is on the floor, and will speak after I do, has \nbeen a leader in this Senate, in the Congress, on a Patients' Bill of \nRights. Why did we have to create a Patients' Bill of Rights? Because \nof the abuses of HMOs. And that is no surprise to people who have tried \nto live with them.\n  Now, this bill, pushed by the Republican leadership, wants to move \nAmerica's seniors out of Medicare and into these HMOs. They believe \nthat is a better way to go, to ration health care through HMOs. They \nwant the HMOs to pick the doctors and the hospitals. They do not want \nthe seniors to choose them, as they do now under the Medicare plan.\n  The original argument was that these private insurance companies, \nbecause they would be competing in the open market, would provide more \neconomical care for seniors. But, of course, that premise was destroyed \nby this bill because they included in the bill a $12 billion slush \nfund, $12 billion of Federal tax dollars that will go to subsidize the \nHMOs. In other words, they not only do not have to prove profitability; \nthey can enjoy a Federal subsidy as they try to lure the healthier \nseniors out of Medicare, leaving behind poorer and sicker Medicare \nrecipients who will drive up the unit cost of care under that \ntraditional program, making it more expensive to Congress and the \nAmerican people, and its critics hope will lead it into a period of \nunpopularity and perhaps abandonment.\n  I believe that is their ultimate goal. I think that is what they are \nsetting out to do. They want to force seniors into HMOs, subsidized, \nincidentally, by Federal tax dollars. They want to undercut full \nGovernment funding of Medicare.\n  That is not why I signed up for this debate. It is not the reason \nmost Senators got involved in it. It, frankly, represents a distorted \nview of what we were setting out to do.\n  It also is going to eliminate drug coverage for millions of retirees. \nThe Congressional Budget Office, which makes projections, tells us that \n2.7 million retirees in America who currently have health care \nbenefits, including prescription drugs--2.7 million will lose that \ncoverage because of this bill.\n\n[[Page S15764]]\n\n  There is already a trend in America to take away health coverage for \nretirees. It is expensive. Many of the companies would like to get rid \nof it, if they can. The CBO tells us, the Congressional Budget Office \ntells us, this bill will create a lure and a force to draw these \nretirees out of their current health care benefits in retirement into a \nsituation where they are not insured--2.7 million.\n  In my home State of Illinois, 100,000 retirees will lose their health \ncare benefits because of this bill. Was that ever part of the bargain? \nDid we go into the debate saying, we are going to provide prescription \ndrug coverage to seniors but in the process 100,000 in my State are \ngoing to lose their health care coverage?\n  That is the result, and not a result on which we are speculating. It \nis from the Congressional Budget Office, as they reported it to us.\n  There is another element here as well. There is an element that I \nthink really tells the story about why this bill is so popular in some \nquarters in Washington--not among seniors but with some special \ninterest groups.\n  You should have seen the area right outside the Senate Chamber this \nafternoon when the key votes were coming down. You could not even walk \nthrough. It was packed with lobbyists.\n  Now, there is nothing wrong with lobbyists. Lobbyists perform a \nvaluable function when they come to Government and tell us both sides \nof the story. As a Member of the House and Senate, I value lobbyists \nwho are honest and tell me their side of the story.\n  But if you took a look at the lobbyists in the hallway outside on \nthis vote, you noticed, overwhelmingly, they were lobbyists supporting \nthis bill and lobbyists representing pharmaceutical companies and HMOs.\n  Why would pharmaceutical companies support a bill that is supposed to \nlower prescription drug prices for seniors?\n  The obvious reason is that under this bill there is no cost control. \nThere is no cost containment. There is no restraint on those drug \ncompanies charging even higher prices. In two particular areas, this \nbill is going to keep drug prices high, not just for seniors but for \nfamilies across America. This bill virtually prohibits the \nreimportation of United States-made drugs from Canada and other \ncountries. We have seen the news reports. Seniors in Minnesota, \nMichigan, and New England are traveling into Canada to buy drugs, \nAmerican drugs, at a fraction of the cost. We put a provision in the \nHouse version of the bill and the Senate version of the bill to allow \nthat trade to continue so that seniors could take advantage of the \nlower prices.\n  I have always said that we are not importing drugs from Canada, we \nare importing political leadership from Canada. Canada and its \nGovernment stood up for its people and its senior citizens. Canada said \nto the drug companies, represented in our hallways by the lobbyists: \nYou can't charge whatever you want to charge. You have to keep your \ncharges reasonable.\n  Because Canada imposed these standards and would not allow the prices \nto go sky high, they deeply discount the same drugs sold in America. \nThis bill virtually closes the door for importation from Canada. It is \nthe answer to the prayer of our pharmaceutical companies that don't \nwant cheaper drugs coming to this country so they can sell more \nexpensive drugs to Americans currently living here.\n  Also, this bill prohibits Medicare from negotiating lower drug \nprices. When we started this debate on prescription drugs, virtually \nevery senior I talked to said: Senator, I don't understand why it is \ntaking so long to see the obvious. If Medicare as a program offered \nprescription drugs, that would be the best approach. It would be a \nuniversal voluntary program covering everyone under Medicare. Medicare \nas a program could bargain for lower drug prices and say to America's \ndrug companies: If you want to sell us a drug for high blood pressure, \nthen you have to give us a reasonable price or we will look to another \ncompany with a comparable drug. We do that with the Veterans' \nAdministration. We could have done it with Medicare. But this bill \nexpressly prohibits Medicare from entering into these negotiations to \nlower prices. Why? Because the same drug companies that fought \nreimportation of drugs don't want to bargain with Medicare. As a \nconsequence, the seniors are the losers. That is basically what we are \ngoing to deal with. We are going to continue to see outrageously high \nprescription drug costs.\n  Let me give an illustration of one element that I am not sure has \nbeen addressed during the course of this debate. That may be hard to \nbelieve after 3 full days and more of debate. This bill lacks any \nserious attempt to lower the cost of prescription drugs. We can \nreasonably assume that prescription drug prices will continue to rise \nabout 15 percent annually as they have in the past. It is one of the \nmost inflated costs in our health care menu of opportunities, \nprescription drug prices. One major employer in Illinois, Caterpillar \nTractor Company, self-insured for health insurance, told me the price \nof prescription drugs was the biggest single problem they are facing \nfor employees and retirees.\n  Consider the example of a senior citizen struggling to make ends \nmeet, the kind of senior we were supposed to help with this bill, a \nsenior who in 2006, when this bill will first go into effect, has an \nincome of $20,000 a year. That is probably in the high end for many \nseniors. Some survive on much less. But for purposes of illustration, \nthis senior has an income of $20,000 and is struggling to devote 25 \npercent of their income to paying a $5,000-a-year pharmaceutical bill. \nFive thousand a year is a little more than $400 a month. Believe me, I \nhave met seniors who are paying an awful lot more than that.\n\n  So here we have a senior, $20,000 in retirement income, and $5,000 in \nannual drug costs. Now let's consider what this bill is going to mean \nto that senior. This bill steps in and cuts that senior's costs by \n$1,080. That is not much. That is about 22 percent of the senior's \ncosts. I think it ought to do more, but it is something, to cut the \n$5,000 bill by $1,080. That is what this bill does. But what happens \nwhen year after year the senior's income goes up at the rate of \ninflation, roughly 3 percent, while the pharmaceutical companies' \ncharges for prescription drugs increase at 15 percent a year? Income \ngoing up 3 percent; cost of drugs going up 15 percent a year.\n  By the year 2015, 9 years after this bill goes into effect, the \nsenior's income will have grown 30 percent to $26,000. The drug costs \nof $5,000 when it started will have mushroomed to $17,600, a 15 percent \nincrease unchecked versus a 3 percent increase in income. Do you know \nhow much of that $17,600 will be paid by the Government under this bill \nwhen we have this period of time, 9 years after it goes into effect? I \ncan tell you: It is $3,800--22 percent of what the senior is supposed \nto pay. So the senior's out-of-pocket prescription drug costs, not paid \nby the Government, would be $13,800, 53 percent of the senior's income. \nSo even with the assistance under this bill, unchecked prescription \ndrug inflation will drive seniors in a decade or more from spending a \nfourth of their income on prescription drugs to spending more than half \nof their income under the scenario I have just described.\n  Why? Senior citizens' out-of-pocket drug costs go up even with this \nbill because the bill does nothing to rein in unsustainable inflation \nin prescription drug costs. That doesn't help seniors. They need us to \ntake action to bring down the cost of medication.\n  If you take a look at the pharmaceutical companies and their approach \non this bill, here is what they wanted when we started this debate. \nThey wanted private-insurer-administered drug benefits that dilute \npurchasing power. They got it. They wanted financial incentives for \nHMOs, another step away from Medicare. They got it. They wanted a \nprohibition on Medicare negotiating prices. They received it, which I \nthink is the fatal flaw in this legislation. They wanted meaningless \nreimportation. They got it. So getting drugs from Canada becomes even \nmore difficult. They wanted watered down generic drug access \nprovisions. They were successful. They wanted no public scrutiny of \nsecret PhRMA-insurer kickback arrangements. They got that protection. \nAnd, finally, they wanted huge windfall profits, and they will get it.\n  Wall Street has already costed this out. Pharmaceutical stocks, which \nwere already the most profitable in America, will continue to be such. \nThe\n\n[[Page S15765]]\n\nloser will be senior citizens who were supposed get the help. That is \nwhy the pharmaceutical companies line up outside the door to \nthe Chamber cheering for those who want to vote for this bill--because \nthey know it means more money in the bank.\n\n  What I have given you here is not an extreme example; $5,000 a year \nfor prescription drugs for a senior is sadly a reality. The seniors who \nwill face this without a helping hand from the Government in terms of \npaying these inflated costs of drugs are going to struggle, and they \nmay not succeed in paying for those drugs.\n  Let me show you this, too. Here are the compensation levels of those \nwho run HMO insurance companies I described earlier. Remember what I \nsaid: The intent of this bill is to move seniors out of Medicare into \nHMOs. These are compensation levels: For companies such as Aetna, here \nis their CEO, he received $8.9 million; Anthem, $6.8 million; CIGNA, \n$5.9 million; Coventry, $21.6 million compensation for their CEO; \nHealth Net, $6 million; Humana, $1.6 million; Oxford, $76 million for \nMr. Norman Payson, not a bad year; PacifiCare, $3 million; Sierra \nHealth, $4.7 million; and then we get down to United Health Group, this \ngroup with a CEO by the name of Mr. Channing Wheeler; he received $9.5 \nmillion in compensation.\n  I would like to stay with United Health Group for just a moment. This \nis not just another HMO, this is an HMO that is extraordinarily blessed \nby this bill. Let me tell you why. In addition to $12 billion in a \nslush fund to subsidize and underwrite HMOs that are going to compete \nwith Medicare, there is an additional provision in here that gives $6 \nbillion for a theory of health insurance called health savings \naccounts. If you have followed the debate in Washington, you may know \nthat some 9 years ago, a company based in Lawrenceville, IL, the Golden \nRule Insurance Company, dreamed up this basic insurance idea that said: \nWe will say to people that if you will take a high deductible health \ninsurance policy and do not use all that you could in terms of health \nexpenses during the course of the year, we will refund some of your \nmoney at the end of the year; so it is not only health insurance lite \nbut a chance to recoup your money. They called it medical savings \naccounts. This was the darling of then-Speaker Newt Gingrich and his \nconservative Republicans.\n  They believed this was the answer to America's prayers for health \ninsurance. We have eventually put in a demonstration project and said \nlet's at least try this concept and see how many people want to buy \ninto it. It was a dismal failure. Very few people signed up. That \ndidn't stop the efforts to include some provisions to help that concept \nof medical savings accounts--now called health savings accounts--in \nthis bill--not just to help them get started but a $6 billion slush \nfund of Federal tax dollars to underwrite health savings accounts.\n  Let me say, it is not a one-way street. In order to win the attention \nof Congress and $6 billion in Federal subsidy, Golden Rule, over the \npast 12 years, has been extraordinarily generous to political \ncandidates. They donated $3.6 million to political parties in \ncandidates--90 percent to the Republican Party. Mr. Gingrich received \nmore campaign contributions from Golden Rule than any other Federal \nofficeholder over the past 12 years. In fact, he became their poster \nchild and appeared on their television advertisements. The list goes on \nand on about Golden Rule and all the political contributions they have \nmade.\n  This bill contains $6 billion for health savings accounts, such as \nthose that have been devised by Golden Rule. This is how it works. \nConsumers or employers buy high-deductible policies. The deductible is \nat least $1,000 for individuals, $2,000 for families. The consumer or \nemployer can put as much as $5,000 a year for an individual and $10,000 \nfor a couple into the account. The contributions are tax deductible. \nMoney can accumulate tax free. Withdrawal of the money is also tax \nfree. It is virtually an unprecedented tax shelter that is being added \nhere and subsidized with $6 billion. The funds can be withdrawn to pay \nmedical expenses, including items not normally covered, such as \ncosmetic surgery.\n  The problems are numerous. First, it compromises the current health \ninsurance system. People who purchase high-deductible health insurance \npolicies are the healthiest among us. As they opt out of traditional \nplans, the risk pools in those traditional plans are compromised, \nleaving people behind to pay higher premiums.\n  Past research by Rand, the Urban Institute, and the American Academy \nof Actuaries have found that premiums for comprehensive insurance could \nmore than double if these health insurance accounts become widely used.\n  Second, wealthy Americans are likely to use these as tax shelters.\n  In 1996, HIPAA established a demonstration project of health savings \naccounts. The GAO evaluation of the investigation showed that \ninvestment firms such as Merrill Lynch entered the health savings \naccount market because of insurer perceptions that HSA enrollees were \nusing their accounts primarily as tax-sheltered savings vehicles rather \nthan sources of tax-sheltered funds for paying medical expenses.\n  So here we are setting a new precedent in tax policy. The financial \nservice industry loves it--$6 billion. Now you might ask yourself: What \ndo health savings accounts have to do with prescription drugs for \nseniors? The answer is nothing. Well, what do health savings accounts \nhave to do with Medicare and seniors in general? The answer is nothing. \nThe $6 billion subsidy in this bill for health savings accounts is \nmaking good on a promise by Republican leadership to reward their \nfriends--in this case, Golden Rule. But wait, there is more to the \nstory.\n\n  Golden Rule as an insurance company doesn't exist anymore. It sold \nout. The purchaser was United Health Group. R. Channing Wheller is \ntheir CEO who made $9.5 million. They are basically the architects of \nthe health savings account, this HMO.\n  The story gets even more interesting. This is a publication of AARP. \nIt comes from October of this year. AARP makes a lot of money by \nselling insurance to seniors. If you open here, this is page 24 and 25, \nthose two pages, you will see three advertisements from AARP on behalf \nof United Health Care Insurance Company's insurance plans. What is the \nconnection? AARP receives millions of dollars from the sale of health \ninsurance policies and stands to gain under this bill. The AARP \ninsurance-related revenues made up a quarter of their operating \nrevenues last year and one-third in 2001. They receive royalties from \npolicies marketed by United Health Group, the one that purchased Golden \nRule. Last year they earned $3.7 billion in premium revenue from their \nofferings to AARP members--$3.7 billion. This one company.\n  The royalties AARP earned as a result of that amounted to $123 \nmillion; access fees, $10 million; quality control fees, almost a \nmillion dollars. AARP also earns investment income on the premiums \nreceived from members. That is a total of $161.7 million in revenue \nfrom insurance. According to Advertising Age Magazine, AARP and United \nHealth Group hired a direct marketing agency in May to conduct a \nmarketing campaign that could cost $100 million.\n  United Health Group is going to be one of the biggest winners under \nthis bill we are considering and will vote on tomorrow. It will be a \nbig winner in at least two different directions: First, as an HMO, it \nis entitled to part of the $12 billion slush fund to lure seniors out \nof Medicare into their HMO. Secondly, because they have now bought \nGolden Rule, they will be authors of insurance policies called health \nsavings accounts, which receive another $6 billion subsidy; and guess \nwho is in on it as well. Our friends at AARP.\n  It is curious to me when seniors who belong to AARP have been asked \nwhether they like this bill, they overwhelmingly say no. Let me get \nthis figure right; I don't want to misstate it. When asked last week \nwhether they supported this bill--AARP members nationally, in a poll \nconducted--56 percent opposed it and 18 percent supported it; 56 \npercent of the seniors in AARP opposed it and 18 percent supported it.\n  Yet Mr. Bill Novelli and AARP have been leading the charge to pass \nthis bill. If it is not that popular among AARP members, what is going \non? There is money to be paid. AARP is\n\n[[Page S15766]]\n\ngoing to be selling insurance through the United Health Group with a \nmassive Federal subsidy, and through the old Golden Rule health savings \naccount with another massive Federal subsidy. They are not listening to \nseniors; they are listening to the insurance companies, to the HMOs, \nand that is a sad thing.\n  This bill squanders $6 billion that should have been paid for retiree \ncoverage of prescription drugs, creating these new health savings \naccounts that ordinary Americans cannot afford, undermining employer-\nbased coverage, $6 billion that should have been used to prevent the \nloss of retiree coverage. As I mentioned earlier, some 25 percent of \nthe revenues going to AARP came off of insurance royalties.\n  So you ask yourself if the membership of this organization doesn't \ncare for this plan and opposes this plan, by a margin of more than \nthree to one, why then is AARP front and center running ads in \nnewspapers, television, and radio across America? Because, frankly, the \nads are paid for by HMOs and pharmaceutical companies and represent an \neffort by the current leadership of AARP to jam down the throats of \nsenior citizens a proposal they do not support.\n  What I suggest to seniors across America who are following this \ntelevised debate is this: If you belong to AARP, call them first thing \nin the morning at 1-800-424-3410 and tell them to stand up for seniors, \ndon't stand up for the insurance companies. Don't stand up for \npharmaceutical companies, stand up for seniors across America.\n  I, frankly, went back to Chicago this weekend and met with many \npeople who said they have had it with AARP. They have no idea what \nhappened to an organization created to serve seniors and, frankly, is \nturning its back on the seniors who needed help the most. That, to me, \nis a sad commentary. Someone said, basically, if you want to know about \nlegislation, whether it is good or bad, ask the basic question: Who \nwants it? Who wants this bill, this 1,100-page monstrosity?\n  It isn't senior citizens. Overwhelmingly across America they say we \ndon't want it. They are calling my office and every office on Capitol \nHill. They want help to pay for prescription drugs they can understand. \nThey want it under Medicare so the costs can be contained. They didn't \nwant a full-scale attack on the Medicare system itself, and that is \nwhat has happened.\n  Sadly, we know who really wants this bill: the pharmaceutical \ncompanies that stand to make outrageous profits into the future without \nany competition, and the HMOs that, with their Federal subsidies, will \nbe luring these seniors out of Medicare.\n  This was an extraordinary and historic opportunity for the Senate and \nthe Congress to do something meaningful. Forty years ago, when we \ncreated Medicare, the doctors across America opposed it saying it was \nsocialized medicine. They did not want the Government involved. A few \nyears after the fact, they realized Medicare was not only great for \nseniors but not bad for the medical profession either. They have been \nable to expand their practices, create more hospital care, and make for \na healthier America.\n  It worked to everyone's advantage, but the special interest group at \nthe time, the AMA, was opposed to it. Today this is a product of \nspecial interest groups. This is not a product that was designed for \nseniors. It was a product that was designed to reward friends--the \npharmaceutical companies that have spent $139 million lobbying Congress \nover the past 6 months, as well as the HMOs, Golden Rule, and all the \nold buddy network.\n  They may win tomorrow, but this I will predict: When this bill goes \ninto effect in 2006, conveniently after the next Presidential election \nso that all of the bad impact of it won't be realized, when this bill \ngoes into effect and seniors across America realize they have been had, \nthe telephone calls that Congressmen and Senators are receiving today \nwill pale in comparison.\n  Woe to those Senators and Congressmen who stand for reelection having \nvoted for this bill when it goes into effect in 2006. When the seniors \nrealize how complicated it is, how unfair it is, the gaps in coverage, \nthe fact there is no control on the price of drugs, the fact that the \ncost of Medicare is going to increase and that they are going to be \nforced into HMOs with no choice of doctor or hospital, there is going \nto be a reaction which you will not forget.\n  I served in the House when we passed something called catastrophic \ninsurance. We thought it was a pretty good idea. I voted for it. The \nseniors read the fine print and rejected it. When they rejected it, we \nwere forced to repeal that law. It is the only time I recall in my \ncongressional career we have done that.\n  Trust me, after this goes into effect in 2006, this Congress is going \nto be scrambling to repeal the most outrageous portions of this bill. \nAnd all those who think we are going to get by with a slogan about \nprescription drugs for seniors are in for a rude awakening.\n  The seniors across America are men and women who have worked hard all \ntheir lives, people of common sense who are not going to fall for what \nthe AARP and so many organizations are now pushing in their faces and \nsaying they must accept. They are going to reject it, and when they \nreject it, they will reject those who voted for it. I hope my \ncolleagues will think twice before they vote tomorrow morning.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). Who seeks time? The Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. There was a time in America when our citizens worked \nhard their entire lives and prepared themselves as well as they could \nfor their own retirement. But for millions of Americans, retirement \nmeant misery, poverty and abandonment. They were on their own with no \nfinancial security and no health care in what was called, with great \nirony, the golden years of their lives. But all that changed in the \nwake of the Great Depression.\n  The scandalous neglect and serious hardship of the elderly was no \nlonger tolerable. In the 1930s, Congress and the administration made a \npromise to our people. We guaranteed that any American who works hard, \nplays by the rules, and pays taxes will earn well-deserved financial \nsecurity in retirement. A generation later, we added health care to \nthat commitment. And ever since, the two most successful and beloved \nprograms in the nation have been Social Security and Medicare.\n  The legislation before us today is a shameful attempt to break that \npromise. It's a right wing Republican assault on Medicare in the guise \nof a prescription drug program, and Republicans know it. They know that \nthis bill will force millions of seniors into HMOs, and deny them their \nchoice of doctor and hospital. They know that this bill does nothing to \ncontrol the skyrocketing cost of prescription drugs. They know that \nit's a fat deal for HMOs and pharmaceutical companies--and a raw deal \nfor the elderly. They know it's a dress rehearsal for the coming \nassault on social security.\n  It's a con job on America's seniors, and they are trying to rush it \nthrough Congress before anyone knows what's going on.\n  Why else would Republicans rig a vote to pass it in the House of \nRepresentatives in the dead of night?\n  Why else would they shamelessly ram it through the Senate over a \nweekend?\n  Why else would they vote to overturn the senate rules so that this \nconference report can pass?\n  In the few hours of this debate, the proponents of this flawed \nlegislation have described their proposal in the most benign--and \nmisleading--terms. They say that this bill gives seniors the freedom to \nchoose among competing plans. They say at least it gives protection to \nthe poorest of seniors. They say it will lower drug prices through \ncompetition. They are absolutely wrong on all of these points.\n  This partisan proposal has been carefully and coldly calculated, not \nto protect Medicare but to destroy it, and leave the millions of senior \ncitizens who rely on it today without a lifeline in the future.\n  It is the first step towards a total dismantling of Medicare. In \nexchange for destroying Medicare, it offers senior citizens a limited \nand inadequate drug benefit. The moment it is implemented, it will make \nnine million senior citizens--almost one quarter of all senior \ncitizens--worse off than they are today.\n  Seniors already have the most important choice they want--the choice \nof\n\n[[Page S15767]]\n\nthe doctors and hospitals they trust. That it the choice they will lose \nif they are forced to join HMOs or other programs that say an insurance \ncompany will choose their doctor for them.\n   Senior citizens already have the choice to join a private insurance \nplan competing with Medicare if they choose. But nine out of ten prefer \nto keep their Medicare. The bipartisan bill that passed the Senate \nearlier this year provided a reasonable additional choice--to receive \nprescription drug coverage under Medicare, or to receive that coverage \nthrough a private-sector drug plan.\n  But the conference report adopted the unacceptable House approach of \nending Medicare as we know it. It establishes a massive demonstration \nprogram that will subject seven million senior citizens--one out of \nevery six--to a so-called premium support program. The only purpose of \npremium support is to raise the premium in regular Medicare so that \nsenior citizens will have to join HMOs to get affordable health care. \nThat's not competition. That's compulsion.\n  If that weren't bad enough, the conference report lavishes massive \nsubsidies on HMOs and other private insurers to help them ``compete.'' \nFor every senior citizen who joins an HMO, the government will pay a 25 \npercent mark-up--almost $2,000--more than it would cost to provide that \nsame senior citizen with the same service under Medicare. As a result \nof this bill, insurance company revenues will increase by $150 billion \na year. That's not competition. It's corporate welfare. It's robbing \nMedicare and robbing senior citizens to enrich powerful special \ninterests and big campaign contributors. It's creating a grossly tilted \nplaying field on which Medicare cannot compete and senior citizens will \nbe the losers.\n\n  Proponents of this plan admit that the benefits for most seniors are \nsmall. But, they say, look at how much we are helping low income \nseniors. What they don't say is that 6 million of the poorest of the \npoor senior citizens and disabled beneficiaries who currently receive \ndrug benefits under this bill will actually be worse off. Medicaid will \nbe prohibited from supplementing Medicare coverage. These poorest of \nthe poor will find the cost of the drugs they need increased and their \naccess to needed medicines reduced. Their rates of hospitalization, \ninjury, and even death will go up.\n  In addition, almost 3 million seniors, many with low incomes, with \ngood retirement drug coverage today will lose it as the result of this \nbill. That's not progress. It's a massive retreat. As the old saying \ngoes, our Republican Colleagues really do love the poor, because they \nare creating so many of them.\n  Some low income seniors may get better drug coverage under this plan, \nbut only at the price of the destruction of the Medicare that all \nseniors love, low and moderate income alike. No senior citizen should \nbe faced with this Sophie's choice between the drug benefits they need \nand the dismantled Medicare they will face under the GOP plan. We \npassed a bipartisan bill in the Senate and that did not sacrifice \nMedicare on the altar of right-wing ideology. If we voted down the \ndestructive, partisan bill before us, the Senate will have another \nopportunity to do the job right.\n  The drug industry too will reap a bonanza under this bill. If \nprescription drug prices continue to rise at double-digit rates, the \nminimal savings this bill provides to the average senior will be wiped \nout in no time by higher drug costs. This bill does nothing meaningful \nto hold prices down. In fact, far from moderating increases in drug \ncosts, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that they will \nactually rise as the result of this legislation. No wonder the stock of \nour four leading drug companies went up $8 billion today.\n  It doesn't allow drugs to be imported from Canada. It even bans the \nSecretary of HHS from bargaining for better drug prices for Medicare.\n  The Senate is on trial today, and we will soon vote on whether to \nstop this charade. I urge my colleagues to stand up and fight. Fight it \nfor the worker who paid into his company's' retirement fund for 20 \nyears. Fight for the three million retirees like him who will lost \ntheir health insurance because of this bill.\n  Fight for city workers like those in Springfield, MA, whose brave \nmayor plans to obtain cheaper prescription drugs for them from Canada.\n  Fight it for the elderly grandmother on Medicaid, and the 7 million \npoor Americans like her, who count every penny, who can't begin to pay \nfor their prescription drugs under this bill.\n  Fight for the 36 million seniors who want to stay in the Medicare \nthey love, and with the doctors and hospitals they choose.\n  Fight it to keep billions and billions of Medicare dollars that come \nout of your paycheck from lining the pocketbooks of big drug companies \nand HMOs. That's your money going to your Medicare, and it should pay \nfor your prescription drugs, not inflated profits of the drug industry \nand the insurance industry.\n  Fight for a nation that keeps its commitments to our seniors--who \nfought our wars, raised our families, and built our economy. How can we \nturn our backs on them now?\n  The more the American people learn about this legislation, the more \nthey dislike it. The more senior citizens learn about it, the more they \noppose it. Let us not turn our back on Medicare now. Let us not turn \nour back on senior citizens so that insurance companies and \npharmaceutical companies can earn higher profits. Let us vote no on the \ndisgraceful bill, and come back and do the job right.\n  And we will do that job right, even if it takes the election of a new \nCongress and a new President to do it.\n  The Democratic Party fought for years to enact Medicare. We will \nfight for as long as it takes to save Medicare and to provide senior \ncitizens the comprehensive prescription drug benefit they need.\n  We will fight today. We will fight this year. We will fight next \nyear. We will fight this issue in every State and congressional \ndistrict in 2004--and we'll keep fighting until, once again, the \nfundamental values of compassion and justice rate higher than more \nwealth for those who are already wealthy, and more power for those who \nare already powerful.\n  For those who have not been following this debate in detail, let me \nreview the particulars of this conference report. The more the American \npeople understand what this bill does, the more they will demand that \nit be rejected.\n  Medicare is a solemn commitment between the government and the \npeople. It says, ``Pay into the system during your working years, and \nwe will guarantee you affordable, quality health care in your \nretirement years.'' For 40 years, a fundamental part of that commitment \nis a guarantee that senior citizens can choose the doctors and \nhospitals they trust to provide them the medical care they need.\n  Today, there are those who want to break that commitment. They want \nto force the elderly into HMOs, where insurance company bureaucrats, \nnot patients, choose the doctor. They want to replace the solid \nguarantee of affordable Medicare anywhere in the country with a system \nwhere what you pay depends where you live. They want to take our \ncountry back to the 19th century, when Government was by the wealthy \nand powerful and for the wealthy and powerful--and the weak, the poor, \nthe members of working families, and the elderly were left out and left \nbehind.\n  For a number of years, we have been working to improve Medicare by \nadding a much-needed prescription drug benefit. Democrats and \nRepublicans alike have campaigned on that issue. Democrats and \nRepublicans alike have promised senior citizens and their families to \nfill the largest gap in Medicare protection--its failure to cover the \nhigh cost of prescription drugs. How in the world, the American people \nare asking, did we get from that non-partisan objective of improving \nthe Medicare program with a prescription drug benefit to a partisan \nproposal to radically alter Medicare for the benefit of the insurance \nindustry?\n  In July, the United States Senate passed a bipartisan program to add \nprescription drug coverage to Medicare. Seventy-six members of the \nSenate, Republicans and Democrats alike voted for the legislation. Ten \nRepublicans and 10 Democrats voted no.\n  By contrast, the House of Representatives passed a bill to radically \nchange Medicare.\n  It included prescription drug coverage--but only as a trojan horse \nfor\n\n[[Page S15768]]\n\nthe radical changes that were their real objective. Their bill was \ndesigned to privatize Medicare, to force senior citizens to join HMOs \nand other private insurance plans, and to benefit the wealthy and \npowerful at the expense of senior citizens. It was a radical program \ndesigned to by those who, in their arrogance, believe they know what is \nbest for senior citizens. Senior citizens may not want to join HMOs or \nother private insurers--but in the view of the writers of this \nlegislation, that's because they just don't know what's good for them.\n  The House bill picked up where President Bush left off. The President \nproposed that senior citizens couldn't get a prescription drug benefit \nat all unless they joined an HMO or other private insurance plan. That \nplan generated such a wave of public outrage that Republicans had to \nwithdraw it. But the House bill achieved the same objective by \nproposals that were less blatant but equally effective.\n  Because the House bill was about radically restructuring Medicare \naccording to the right wing blueprint, it could not command bipartisan \nsupport. It passed by the House by a narrow partisan majority of a \nsingle vote.\n  The report the conference produced--with all but two of the \nDemocratic conferees excluded from the deliberations--was the partisan \nHouse proposal all over again. That's why the vote in the House this \nmorning was just as partisan, just as narrow, and only achieved by the \nmost extraordinary perversion of House rules. Now it is up to the \nSenate to prevent this travesty from becoming law.\n  This is no longer a bill to provide senior citizens a drug benefit. \nIt is a bill to reward powerful special interest and to force senior \ncitizens into the unloving arms of HMOs and insurance companies. It is \na right wing program to privatize and voucherize Medicare. It asks the \nelderly to swallow unprecedented and destructive changes to the \nMedicare program in return for a limited, inadequate, small \nprescription drug benefit. It does nothing to drug costs. It gives the \npharmaceutical industry a free ride--and sticks senior citizens with \nthe bill. And this conference report is so ill-conceived that not only \ndoes it put the whole Medicare program at risk; it makes nine million \nseniors--almost one-quarter of the Medicare population worse off the \nday this program is implemented than they are today.\n\n  One of the most important of these destructive changes is a concept \ncalled ``premium support.'' It should really be called senior citizen \ncoercion support, or maybe it's called ``premium support'' because it \nuses Medicare premiums to support HMO profits. It replaces the stable, \nreliable premium that senior citizens pay for Medicare today with an \nunstable, unaffordable premium.\n  Here's how it works. Today, Medicare premiums are set at 75 percent \nof the costs for Part B of the Medicare program, the part that pays for \ndoctor care. Beneficiaries pay the remaining 25 percent. The premium is \nthe same no matter where you live. It increases from year to year at \nthe same rate as Medicare doctor costs. It is a stable, reliable \namount.\n  Premium support stands this system on its head. The Government \ncontribution to private plans would no longer be based on a fixed \namount. Neither would the charges to Medicare beneficiaries. Instead, \nthe Government contribution to both private plans and Medicare would be \nbased on the average of what plans charge and Medicare costs. If plan \ncharges were lower than Medicare costs, the Government payment to \nMedicare will go down--and Medicare premiums will go up. And instead of \nMedicare premiums being a single, reliable, fixed amount that goes up \nonly with increases in Medicare costs, Medicare premiums will be \ndifferent in every county in the country.\n  And they will fluctuate wildly from year to year, depending on what \nprivate plans choose to do and how many people enroll in them.\n  We all know what is going on. Insurance companies can make big money \nby offering low-cost health insurance to healthy senior citizens. This \nprogram will drain healthy seniors from Medicare, and leave behind \nthose who are sick and need help the most. It will send Medicare \npremiums through the roof--and it leave the elderly and disabled in the \ncellar holding the bag.\n  Under premium support, the administration's own estimates show that \naverage Medicare premiums will initially jump 25 percent. Several years \nago, the estimate was a whopping 47 percent. The truth is that no one \nreally knows how high Medicare premiums could rise. But we do know \nthis. Over time, the increase will become higher and higher. And that's \njust average premiums. Under premium support, how much you pay will \ndepend on where you live and the amount could change dramatically from \nyear to year.\n  In my own state of Massachusetts, a senior citizen who happens to \nlive in Barnstable county will pay $500 a year more for their Medicare \nthan one who lives in Hampden County.\n  In Florida, you will pay $900 in Osceola and $2,000 if you live in \nDade County. And it's the same all over the country. In Washington \nState, you'll pay $1,225 if you live in San Juan and $700 if you live \nin Clark. In California, you'll pay $1,700 if you live in Los Angeles \nand $775 if you live in Yolo. In Oregon, you'll pay $1,325 if you live \nin Yamhill and $675 if you live in Columbia.\n  Why would anyone want to make these destructive changes to the \nMedicare program that has served senior citizens so well for almost \nforty years? The answer is a radical ideology that says Medicare is \nbad. HMOs and PPOs are good. And if senior citizens don't agree, we'll \nmake sure that their premiums keep going up until they are forced to \ngive up the doctors they trust to get the medical care they need.\n  Some of supporters of this program claim it is just a demonstration--\nnothing to get excited about. But it's not a demonstration. It is a \nvast social experiment using senor citizens as guinea pigs. Under the \nterms of the demonstration, 7 million senor citizens could be forced \ninto this program. That's one out of every six seniors in the country. \nHalf the States in this chamber have local areas where senior citizens \ncould be forced to take part in this demonstration.\n  And that is just today. Tomorrow, the proponents of this misguided \npolicy will ram through changes that will force 10 million senior \ncitizens, or 20 million, or the whole country into this plan. If we \npass this bill, we're not just putting the camel's nose under the tent. \nWe're putting the head and the hump in, too.\n  The people who support this program make no secret of what they want \nto do. They are on record as thinking the Medicare is outdated, that it \nshould be scrapped, and that seniors should be forced into HMOs. That's \nthe same philosophy the President embraced when he initially proposed \nto give senior citizens a drug benefit only if they joined an HMO or \nPPO. I respect their opinions, but it is wrong to use senior citizen's \nneed for prescription drugs as a club to force through a radical change \nin Medicare that could never pass muster on its own.\n  Premium support is only one of the ways that this plan would \nprivatize Medicare and force senior citizens to choose between the \ndoctors they trust and the prescription drugs they need. The conference \nreport pumps up the payment to private plans to a level where Medicare \ncould be uncompetitive.\n  It's fiscally irresponsible and unfair. It's using the elderly's own \nMedicare money to destroy the program they depend on.\n  The bill lavishes largesse on the private sector by stealing from \nMedicare in three ways.\n  First, the payment formula in the conference report is the same as \nthe House's--and it raises payments to private plans so that they are \n109 percent of Medicare's costs for caring for the same person.\n  Is that not odd? The private sector is supposed to be more efficient \nand save Medicare money--but Medicare, under this report, is paying \nthem 9 percent more than it would provide Medicare to cover the same \nservices.\n  But that is only the beginning. According to the CMS's own studies, \nMedicare pays an additional 16 percent in excess of Medicare's own \ncosts to private insurance companies because the senior citizens who \njoin Medicare HMOs are healthier than those who do not.\n  So under this bill, Medicare is going to be paying a 25 percent \nmarkup for\n\n[[Page S15769]]\n\nevery senior citizen that goes into an HMO--nine percent for the \npayment differential put into this bill and 16 percent for the health \ndifferential--and that is before you add in a $12 billion slush fund \nfor PPOs that this bill also contains.\n  The Medicare trust fund--that today's retirees paid into and rely \non--will be robbed to lavish billions of dollars on HMOs and insurance \ncompanies. Senior citizens will pay for this largesse not only in the \ndepletion of the Medicare trust fund, not only in lesser resources for \nbenefits they need, but in higher Medicare premiums. Why? So HMOs and \ninsurance companies can profit.\n  Last week, I released a new report by the staff of the Health \nCommittee analyzing the impact of this program on HMO and insurance \nindustry revenues and profits.\n  The data is drawn from the projections of the Medicare actuary, the \nMedicare Trustee's report, and publicly reported data on the insurance \nindustry. The results are sobering. As the result of this bill, annual \nrevenues of the insurance industry will increase by an incredible $150 \nbillion a year. Profits from Medicare business will increase by 500 \npercent. And this huge bonanza to the private insurance industry will, \nin the words of the Medicare actuary, ``increase Medicare costs \nsignificantly.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the study be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   The Impact of Republican Medicare Proposals on Insurance Industry \n                          Revenues and Profits\n\n\n A Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Minority \n                    Staff Report, November 20, 2003\n\n        H.R. 1, the House Medicare Prescription Drug and \n     Modernization Bill passed by the House of Representatives \n     earlier this year, includes a number of provisions described \n     by its sponsors as intended to enhance Medicare beneficiary \n     choices and encourage competition. Most of the relevant \n     provisions of the proposed conference report are identical to \n     H.R. 1. This report by the minority staff of the Senate \n     Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions examines \n     the impact of these proposals on the revenues and profits of \n     Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs), Preferred Provider \n     Organizations (PPOs), and the private health insurance \n     industry.\n        The report concludes that Medicare revenues of HMOs and \n     PPOs will increase from $31 billion this year to $181 billion \n     in 2010 under the Republican plan. Profits will increase by \n     $4.4 billion based on an average profit margin, or $18 \n     billion based on profits of the most successful plans. \n     Overall, Medicare revenues and profits of the private \n     insurance industry will increase by 490 percent in 2010 under \n     the Republican plan. Increases under the premium support \n     program, which begins in 2010, will be even higher.\n\n                               Background\n\n     Competition with the Private Sector in the Medicare Program \n         Today\n        Senior citizens already have a choice today between \n     Medicare and private insurance plans offering Medicare \n     benefits through the Medicare+Choice program. The program is \n     open to most types of insurance plans--HMOs, PPOs, and fee-\n     for-service indemnity plans--but almost all the participating \n     plans are HMOs. Eleven percent of Medicare beneficiaries are \n     enrolled in Medicare+Choice plans.\n        Under Medicare+Choice, participating plans must offer \n     Medicare benefits. They receive a payment from Medicare that \n     is supposed to represent what it would have cost Medicare to \n     serve the same enrollees under the regular Medicare program. \n     Originally, the Medicare payment was set at 95 percent of \n     Medicare's cost, on the theory that those who would enroll in \n     private sector plans were healthier than the average Medicare \n     beneficiary. As a result of subsequent modifications in the \n     payment formula, Medicare payments to private sector plans \n     now average 103 percent of Medicare costs.\n       Adjusting for the fact that those who enroll in private \n     sector plans are healthier than the average Medicare \n     enrollee, the extra cost to Medicare when a beneficiary \n     enrolls in a private plan is substantially higher than three \n     percent. According to a study by the Department of Health and \n     Human Services, Medicare+Choice plans are overpaid by 16.3 \n     percent, solely because their enrollees are healthier than \n     those who remain in traditional Medicare. The combination of \n     the current payment formula and the difference in health \n     between those who receive services from traditional Medicare \n     and those who enroll in Medicare HMOs means that private \n     insurance plans are paid almost 20 percent more than it costs \n     Medicare to provide the same services.\n     Competition with the private sector under Conference proposal\n       The conference proposal changes the terms of competition \n     between Medicare and the private sector in three ways: It \n     establishes a new category of private plans--regional PPOs--\n     eligible to enroll Medicare beneficiaries and receive \n     Medicare payments for their care. It increases Medicare \n     payments to private plans to an average of 109 percent of \n     Medicare costs, compared to 103 percent today. Beginning in \n     2010, it establishes a new system of payments for both \n     private plans and Medicare called ``premium support.''\n       Under the premium support system, the Medicare payment to \n     private plans and the Medicare contribution to the cost of \n     the Medicare Part B program are no longer fixed amounts \n     Instead, they are based on a weighted average of the Medicare \n     ``benchmark''--the payment that would be made to private \n     plans under the old system--and the charges of the private \n     plans. If the charges of the private charges and Medicare \n     will contribute less to the cost of those who enroll in \n     Medicare--raising the premiums that Medicare would otherwise \n     charge to beneficiaries. In addition, since the Medicare \n     premium is now based on the charges of private plans in the \n     same area, the Medicare premium will vary depending on where \n     the beneficiaries live. It will no longer be a uniform \n     nationwide premium.\n     Revenues and Profits of HMOs and Private Health Insurers\n       In 2003, the revenues of HMOs and other private health \n     insurers are estimated to be $580 billion. Profits are \n     estimated to be $16.8 billion, and the industry average \n     profit will be 2.9 percent. Some HMOs have significantly \n     higher profit margins than the industry average. United \n     HealthCare's profit margin averaged 8.7 percent in 2002, and \n     profits are expected to increase by more than a third for \n     2003, to 12 percent.\n\n   Impact of Conference Proposal on Revenues and Profits of HMO and \n                        Private Health Insurers\n\n       Revenues. The CMS Medicare Actuary has estimated that if \n     H.R. 1 is enacted, 43 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries \n     will be enrolled in private health plans by 2010, an increase \n     from their current 11 percent enrollment. The relevant \n     provisions included in the conference report are similar to \n     H.R. 1. Medicare payments to private health plans are \n     expected to increase by $150 billion to a total of $181 \n     billion.\n       Profits. Under the average profit assumption, Medicare \n     profits of the industry will increase by 490 percent to $5.3 \n     billion in 2010. Under the higher profit assumption, Medicare \n     profits of the industry will increase by 2316 percent to \n     $21.7 billion. Industry analysts estimate even higher \n     potential additional profits of $25 billion.\n       Cost to Government. The Medicare Actuary has not provided \n     an estimate of the impact of H.R. 1 on this cost. However, in \n     a letter to Congressman Thomas, Chairman of the House Ways \n     and Means Committee, dated June 4, 2003, the Actuary states \n     that these provisions of the bill `` would increase Medicare \n     costs significantly.''\n       Premium Support. The Medicare Actuary has not provided an \n     estimate of the proportion of Medicare beneficiaries who \n     would enroll in private insurance plans under the premium \n     support program. Since the Actuary has estimated that premium \n     support would raise average Medicare premiums by as much as \n     25 percent however, it is reasonable to assume that a larger \n     proportion of beneficiaries would leave Medicare and join \n     HMOs or other private insurance plans under a full-blown \n     premium support program, further increasing industry revenues \n     and profits.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, there you have it. This legislation is by \nthe insurance industry, for the insurance industry, and of the \ninsurance industry. It is about privatizing Medicare so that HMOs can \nimprove their bottom line and raise their stock prices. Senior citizens \nshould not be forced to give up the doctors they trust to get the \nmedical care they need. The only rationale for this misguided policy is \nan ideology that says higher profits for powerful special interests is \nthe highest public good.\n  No wonder President Bush and the Republic leadership is fighting so \nhard for this bill. No wonder they are insisting on radical changes to \nMedicare that have nothing to do with prescription drug coverage for \nsenior citizens. And no wonder senior citizens all over this country--\nand the organizations that represent them--are outraged and urging \nmembers of Congress to vote no.\n  The two most beloved and effective programs our government has ever \ncreated are Medicare and Social Security. Every American should \nunderstand that this debate is the dress rehearsal for the coming \nassault on Social Security. If the Republicans are successful with the \nlegislation we are considering, they will have turned over Medicare to \nthe insurance industry, so that their powerful friends can reap huge \nprofits at the expense of senior citizens. But that is just the \nbeginning. Once the HMOs and health insurance companies get their cut, \nit will be time for the stock brokers and the bankers.\n\n[[Page S15770]]\n\n  A story in the Washington Post yesterday exposed the Republican plan. \nIt said:\n\n       President Bush's aides are reviving his long-shelved plan \n     to let workers divert some Social Security taxes into stocks \n     as a reelection issue, gambling that market drops have not \n     soured voters on the politically risky idea.\n\n  It goes on:\n\n       A Republican official said the White House has signaled \n     Capital Hill that Bush's campaign ``wants to spend a lot of \n     money'' on advertising promoting the issue. A presidential \n     advisor says that Bush is intent on being able to say that \n     reworking Social Security is ``part of my mandate.''\n       Aides said Karl Rove, Bush's senior advisor, has argued \n     internally and to the President's key supporters that recent \n     polling and election results show that changing Social \n     Security is no longer the ``third rail of American \n     politics.''\n\n  The article concludes:\n\n       Republican leadership aides on capital hill said [the \n     Social Security issue] is more likely to be a winner if \n     Congress passes the G.O.P. plan to add a prescription drug \n     benefit to Medicare.\n\n  There it is, in the Republicans own words. Hold on to your hat. \nToday, Medicare, Tomorrow, Social Security.\n  It is no wonder that the Republican leadership wants to rush this \nbill through. It is no wonder that the House leadership violated its \npledge to allow the members three days to review it. This bill can't \nstand the light of day. Every hour that passes, we find more outrageous \nprovisions tucked away in this 600 plus page bill.\n  Let me review for the members some of the things that have been \nuncovered in just the last twenty-four hours.\n  The legislation the Senate approved earlier this year included an \neffective guarantee that seniors who wanted to remain in traditional \nMedicare would have a choice of at least two prescription drug only \nplans. If this simple two-plan test was not met for any reason, the \nFederal government would provide a fallback plan. This assured that \nseniors who wanted to stay in Medicare would have a choice of plans to \nprovide their drug benefit--or the Federal Government would provide the \nbenefit directly, as it does other Medicare benefits.\n  The supporters of the conference report claim that they have \nguaranteed that every senior could stay in Medicare and get their \nprescription drugs from the government if the private sector doesn't \nprovide a choice of two plans. What they don't say is that their two-\nplan requirement would be fulfilled if there is only one drug only plan \nand one PPO in an area.\n  That means that seniors have to take what one-drug only plan offers--\nno matter how high-priced, no matter how inadequate the formulary, no \nmatter how poor the service--or be forced to leave Medicare. It looks \nlike President Bush's plan to deny senior citizens drug coverage unless \nthey give up their Medicare and their right to choose a doctor hasn't \nbeen scrapped; it has just been repackaged.\n  The supporters of this conference report tout the limited $600 \nbenefit that some very low income senior citizens will get next year \nalong with their prescription drug card. But what they don't say is \nthat the price of getting this benefit is your loss of personal \nprivacy. Major corporations will have unfettered access to your tax \nrecords--without so much as a ``by your leave?'' All those of you who \nthink that's a good idea will love this bill--but anyone who thinks \nthat drug companies and insurance companies have no business prying \ninto your financial records had better call your Senator to tell them \nto reject this legislation.\n  To comply with the bill's requirement that these drug benefits are \ntied to a person's income, the bill allows HHS to disclose a senior's \ntax records to any ``offices, employees, or contractors'' of the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services. That's practically anyone--\nincluding the huge corporations that run the drug card programs. In the \nwords of the bill, just applying for the card ``shall be deemed \nconsent'' for this monstrous invasion of privacy.\n  Another dirty little secret tucked away in this drug bill is the \nfreedom it gives the insurance companies offering the drug benefit to \nconstruct their formularies so that senior citizens can be sure that \nthere will be a drug to meet their needs on the formularies. The \nconference report says that there must at least two drugs on the \nformulary in each therapeutic class. The Senate bill says the \ntherapeutic classes must be approved by the Secretary. The conference \nreport says the plan gets to decide. The plan could decide to make a \ncategory as broad as pain-killers and leave the senior citizen with a \nchoice of aspirin or Tylenol--and no access to the more sophisticated \ndrugs that so many must use.\n  Whether the issue is choice of drug plans, or privacy of tax records, \nor availability of drugs the senior needs, or the size of the PPO slush \nfund, this bill is not what has been advertised. No wonder Republicans \nwant to get the legislation off the Senate floor and onto the \nPresident's desk before all the rocks are turned over.\n  One of the most troubling aspects of this legislation is that a \nprogram that is supposed to improve the lives of senior citizens will \nmake almost one-quarter of them worse off the day it is implemented.\n  Six million senior citizens and disabled people on Medicaid--the \npoorest of the poor--will be victimized. Their out-of-pocket payment \nfor drugs will be raised, and they may not even have coverage for the \ndrugs they need the most.\n  The people we are talking about are truly the poorest of the poor. In \nmost cases, their incomes are well below poverty. And the impact of \neven small co-payments is devastating. Study after study finds that \nwhen the poor have to pay more for drugs, they end up hospitalized, in \nnursing homes, or dead.\n  You couldn't make up some of the provisions that are actually in this \nbill. It sounds like something out of Charles Dickens to say that the \nlaw might force a widow to give up her jewelry or sign away the burial \nfund she has scraped together to get the prescription medication she \nneeds. People wouldn't believe you if you told them the that Congress \nis considering a law to force some of America's senior citizens to make \nthose kind of choices.\n  I think everyone would acknowledge that the drug benefit contained in \nthis legislation is inadequate to meet the needs of senior citizens. It \nhas a high deductible and a coverage gap of thousands of dollars. \nOverall, we are providing only $400 billion toward the $1.8 trillion in \ndrug costs our senior citizens and disabled will incur in the next 10 \nyears.\n  Given the limitations on the new Medicare benefit, the last thing we \nshould be doing is causing people with good, solid retirement health \ncoverage to lose it. But that is exactly what this bill does, because \nit provides a discriminatory benefit. People who have retirement \ncoverage get a lesser Medicare benefit than every other beneficiary. \nThe result: employers will drop the coverage they now provide. The CBO \nand a new study just released by Professor Ken Thorpe of Emory \nUniversity show that 2.7 million people--one retiree in four--will lose \nthe good coverage they have today.\n  So between the 7 million poor people on Medicaid who will be worse \noff and the 3 million retirees who will lose their coverage--almost \none-quarter of all Medicare beneficiaries will be worse off the day \nthis bill is implemented than they are today. If this legislation \npasses, Americans will ask: What were they thinking of? Why would any \nSenator vote to make 9 million senior citizens and disabled people \nworse off and undermine Medicare to boot.\n  And finally, this program undermines the health insurance of all \nAmericans.\n  It puts in place an unrestricted program of health savings accounts, \nwhat used to be called medical savings accounts. They provide billions \nof new tax breaks for the healthy and wealthy.\n  This program encourages the healthy and wealthy to take high \ndeductible policies--policies that require you to pay thousands of \ndollars before you get benefits. That is fine for people who can afford \nto put money into a tax-free savings account, but it is not good for \nordinary working Americans and people who are sick.\n  The Urban Institute and the American Academy of Actuaries have \nestimated that because the healthiest people are pulled out of the risk \npool for regular, comprehensive policies by these health savings \naccounts, premiums for regular, comprehensive coverage will skyrocket. \nIf this program becomes law and you want to keep your insurance policy, \nyour premiums will increase 60 percent according to\n\n[[Page S15771]]\n\nthe Urban Institute and 61 percent according to the American Academy of \nActuaries.\n  Isn't that astounding? The Senate started out with a bipartisan \nprogram to add prescription drug coverage to Medicare, and now we are \nasked to vote on a conference report that not only undermines Medicare \nbut could raise health insurance premiums through the roof for younger \nAmericans.\n  Senior citizens do not want this bill. The disabled do not want this \nbill. This bill is not a drug program for senior citizens. It is an \nattack on Medicare--and the Senate has the duty to reject it.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I am deeply disappointed by the \nPresident's choice of James Oberwetter to be the next U.S. Ambassador \nto Saudi Arabia. My disappointment does not stem from doubts about Mr. \nOberwetter's integrity or professional accomplishment. Indeed, in both \ncategories he has my respect and admiration. However, I simply do not \nbelieve that Mr. Oberwetter possesses the proper experience to assume \nwhat has become one of the most important posts in our Nation's fight \nagainst terrorism. And while I will not stand in the way of Mr. \nOberwetter's appointment, I believe it is important that the record \nshow that the President's choice could certainly have been better.\n  Saudi Arabia is one of the primary battlegrounds in the war on \nterror. This is not simply because 15 of the 19 hijackers from 9/11 \nwere Saudi. Top anti-terror officials tell us that Saudi Arabia is also \na hub for terrorist financing and extremist incitement. The \ninflammatory content of its educational textbooks promotes anti-\nAmerican sentiment in the Kingdom and its support for extremist \nmadrassas schools in Pakistan, southeast Asia and Africa gives life to \ninstitutions that are incubators for the next generation of terrorists \nabroad.\n  Given this sad state of affairs, there are several reasons why Mr. \nOberwetter should not be our nation's next Ambassador to the Kingdom of \nSaudi Arabia. First, he has absolutely no official diplomatic or anti-\nterror experience. As I have said many times before, we live in a post-\n9/11 world where the old rules simply do not apply. Given that Saudi \nArabia is one of the most important fronts in the war on terror, our \ntop representative there can no longer be a run-of-the mill political \nappointee; rather, the American Ambassador to Saudi Arabia must be a \nseasoned diplomatic expert and someone with an extensive background in \ncombating terrorist financing and religious extremism.\n  Mr. Oberwetter's more than 25 years as an oil industry insider \nprovide him with no background to assume this key position in the fight \nagainst terrorism. Indeed, his oil industry pedigree is another reason \nwhy he is an inappropriate choice to serve as Ambassador. While I have \nno doubts about Mr. Oberwetter's personal integrity, his proximity to \nthe oil industry suggests that commercial rather than security \ninterests appear to have taken precedence in the administration's \ndecisionmaking.\n  I simply do not understand this business-as-usual approach to \ndiplomatic appointments when American lives are at stake. Surely there \nis someone more qualified than an oil executive that we could choose \nfrom the distinguished ranks of our Nation's diplomatic and security \ncorps to occupy this important post in the war on terror. Mr. \nOberwetter's nomination is a disappointment and does a disservice to \nour national security.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/24/senate-section/article/S15804-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15804-S15805]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     ON YESTERDAY'S ATTACK IN MOSUL\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I express my outrage at events that \ntranspired this weekend in Iraq. No one expects terrorists to follow \nthe rules, but what they did to two soldiers from the 101st Airborne \nDivision this weekend in Mosul is beyond the pale. We have lost 431 men \nand women in the conflict in Iraq; my heart goes out to the families \nand friends of each and every one.\n  Here is how the Associated Press describes what happened, as reported \nin The Tennessean and a number of other papers across the country:\n\n       Iraqi teenagers dragged two bloodied 101st Airborne \n     soldiers from a wrecked vehicle and pummeled them with \n     concrete blocks yesterday, witnesses said . . .\n       Witnesses to the Mosul attack said gunmen shot two soldiers \n     driving through the city center, sending their vehicle \n     crashing into a wall. The 101st Airborne Division said the \n     soldiers were driving to another garrison.\n       About a dozen swarming teenagers dragged the soldiers out \n     of the wreckage and beat them with concrete blocks, the \n     witnesses said.\n       ``They lifted a block and hit them with it on the face,'' \n     Younis Mahmoud, 19, said.\n       It was unknown whether the soldiers were alive or dead when \n     pulled from the wreckage.\n\n  That is what the Associated Press wrote. I ask unanimous consent the \narticle be printed in full in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. One can't help but feel a sense of anger when reading \na story like that. CSM Jerry Wilson and SP Rel Ravago were on their way \nfrom one garrison to another. The terrorists laid waiting for the \nsoldiers to drive by, and ambushed them. Even worse, they made every \neffort to be as brutal and bloody as possible. It makes me sick to my \nstomach.\n  At the same time, we also remember how many of our troops have lost \ntheir lives in this struggle. 431 men and women from our Armed Forces \nhave given their lives since Operation Iraqi Freedom commenced. Forty-\neight of them were from the 101st Airborne, based in Fort Campbell on \nthe border of Kentucky and Tennessee. 2,067 have been wounded overall. \nAnd as much as we all wish it weren't the case, more will follow.\n  Nothing can prepare you for the loss of a loved one, especially loved \nones as young as those that are serving our country in Iraq. We can \nonly hope the knowledge that these soldiers died fighting to keep us \nsafe will provide some comfort in this time of grief. To those \nfamilies, we can only say this: the hopes and prayers of a grateful \nnation are with you.\n  But in the midst of this sorrow, we must remember why our troops are \nin Iraq. We must strengthen our resolve. Iraq is freer today than it \nhas been for more than a generation. An evil dictator has been toppled, \nhis regime is gone. The people of Iraq, by and large, are grateful; \naccording to polls, the vast majority of them support continued \nAmerican presence in their country.\n  In fact, in the horrible incident involving the two soldiers in \nMosul, U.S. troops were alerted to the attack by sympathetic Iraqis.\n  We are making progress in Iraq: the power is on, schools are re-\nopened, markets are buzzing, the southern port is open. But danger \nlurks.\n  And we must labor on. A stable, democratic Iraq in the midst of the \nMiddle East could become our greatest ally in the War on Terror. It \nwould change the world. But if we give up and throw in the towel, an \nunstable Iraq would quickly become a hotbed of terrorism far worse than \nAfghanistan. The stakes are high. Failure is not an option.\n  Our troops and their families bear the burden of this cause more than \nany other. Their sacrifice will never be forgotten.\n  In a few days, we will celebrate Thanksgiving. In the first \nThanksgiving proclamation, President George Washington ``recommend[ed] \nto the people of the United States a day of public thanksgiving and \nprayer, to be observed by acknowledging with grateful hearts the many \nand signal favors of Almighty God, as a people, with devout reverence \nand affectionate gratitude.''\n  Ours is a blessed nation, and we have much to be grateful for. This \nThanksgiving we should be especially grateful for the men and women of \nour Armed Forces, fighting the terrorists over there so fewer can \nattack us here, at home. Whether helping to open a new school in Kirkuk \nor securing the area around Baghdad International Airport; our troops \nare standing in harms way. They are doing it for us.\n  For thousands of families, the Thanksgiving table will have an empty \nspace this year. It will be hard. We should all save a place in our \nhearts for those military families this Thanksgiving. We give thanks \nfor their courage, too.\n  So today, I say thank you to the men and women of our Armed Forces. \nWe stand in awe of your strength. We are humbled by your sacrifice. We \nare grateful for your courage.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the TENNESSEAN, Nov. 24, 2003]\n\n                    Two 101st Soldiers Die in Ambush\n\n       Mosul, Iraq--Iraqi teenagers dragged two bloodied 101st \n     Airborne soldiers from a wrecked vehicle and pummeled them \n     with concrete blocks yesterday, witnesses said, describing \n     the killings as a burst of savagery in a city once safe for \n     Americans.\n\n[[Page S15805]]\n\n       Another soldier was killed by a bomb, and a U.S.-allied \n     police chief was assassinated.\n       The U.S.-led coalition also said it grounded commercial \n     flights after the military confirmed that a missile struck a \n     DHL cargo plane that landed Saturday at Baghdad International \n     Airport with its wing aflame.\n       Nevertheless, American officers insisted they were making \n     progress in bringing stability to Iraq, and the U.S.-\n     appointed Governing Council named an ambassador to \n     Washington--an Iraqi-American woman who spent the past decade \n     lobbying U.S. lawmakers to promote democracy in her homeland.\n       Witnesses to the Mosul attack said gunmen shot two soldiers \n     driving through the city center, sending their vehicle \n     crashing into a wall. The 101st Airborne Division said the \n     soldiers were driving to another garrison.\n       About a dozen swarming teenagers dragged the soldiers out \n     of the wreckage and beat them with concrete blocks, the \n     witnesses said. ``They lifted a block and hit them with it on \n     the face,'' Younis Mahmound, 19, said. It was unknown whether \n     the soldiers were alive or dead when pulled from the \n     wreckage.\n       Initial reports said the soldiers' throats were cut. But \n     another witness, teenager Bahaa Jassim, said the wounds \n     appeared to have come from bullets. ``One of the soldiers was \n     shot under the chin, and the bullet came out of his head. I \n     saw the hole in his helmet. The other was shot in the \n     throat,'' Jassim said.\n       Some people looted the vehicle of weapons, CDs and a \n     backpack, Jassim said. ``They remained there for over an hour \n     without the Americans knowing anything about it,'' he said. \n     ``I. . . went and told other troops.''\n       Television footage showed the soldiers' bodies splayed on \n     the ground as U.S. troops secured the area. One victim's foot \n     appeared to have been severed.\n       The frenzy recalled the October 1993 scene in Somalia, when \n     locals dragged the bodies of Marines killed in fighting with \n     warlords through the streets.\n       In Baqouba, just north of Baghdad, insurgents detonated a \n     roadside bomb as a 4th Infantry Division convoy passed, \n     killing one soldier and wounding two others, the military \n     said.\n       In Baghdad, Brig. Gen. Mark Kimmitt confirmed the Mosul \n     deaths but would not provide details. ``We're not going to \n     get ghoulish about it,'' he said.\n       The savagery of the attack was unusual for Mosul, once \n     touted as a success story in sharp contrast to the anti-\n     American violence seen in Sunni Muslim areas north and west \n     of Baghdad.\n       In recent weeks, however, attacks against U.S. troops have \n     increased in Mosul, raising concerns that the insurgency is \n     spreading. Simultaneously, attacks have accelerated against \n     Iraqis considered to be supporting Americans--such as \n     policemen and politicians working for the interim Iraqi \n     administration.\n       Yesterday gunmen killed the Iraqi police chief of \n     Latifiyah, 20 miles south of Baghdad, and his bodyguard and \n     driver, American and Iraqi officials said. No more details \n     were released. The assassination occurred one day after \n     suicide bombers struck two police stations northeast of \n     Baghdad within 30 minutes, killing at least 14 people. Gunmen \n     Saturday also killed an Iraqi police colonel protecting oil \n     installations in Mosul.\n       In Samara, about 75 miles north of Baghdad, Iraqi police \n     said six U.S. Apache helicopter gunships blasted marshland \n     after four rocket-propelled grenades were fired at the \n     American military garrison at the city's northern end. One \n     Iraqi passer-by was killed in the air attack, police said.\n       In Kirkuk, 150 miles north of Baghdad, a bomb exploded at \n     an oil compound, injuring three American civilian contractors \n     from the U.S. firm Kellogg Brown & Root. The three suffered \n     facial cuts from flying glass, U.S. Lt. Col. Matt Croke said. \n     KBR, a subsidiary of Halliburton, also has a significant \n     presence at Baghdad's Palestine Hotel, which was rocketed by \n     insurgents Friday, wounding one civilian. ``We all know that \n     Americans are being threatened,'' Croke said.\n       Kimmitt told reporters in Baghdad that witnesses saw two \n     surface-to-air missiles fired Saturday at a cargo plane \n     operated by the Belgium-based package service DHL as it left \n     for Bahrain. The plane was the first civilian airliner hit by \n     insurgents, who have shot down many military helicopters with \n     shoulder-fired rockets. The coalition authority ordered DHL \n     and Royal Jordanian, the only commercial passenger airline \n     flying into Baghdad, to suspend flights.\n       Despite the ongoing violence, U.S. officials said the \n     occupation was going well. ``If you look at the \n     accomplishments of the coalition since March of this year, it \n     has been enormous,'' Marine Gen. Peter Pace, vice chairman of \n     the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in Tikrit. He is touring \n     Afghanistan and Iraq.\n       Despite the surge in the scope and ferocity of the attacks, \n     Kimmitt dismissed any threat posed by the guerrillas, whom he \n     described as occasionally clever but overall ``a pretty poor \n     group of insurgents.''\n       ``We have nothing at this point that causes us to be \n     concerned,'' he said. ``This is not an enemy that can defeat \n     us militarily.''\n       Also yesterday, Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari said \n     veteran Washington lobbyist Rend Rahim Francke was appointed \n     Iraq's ambassador to the United States. Francke, an Iraq \n     native who has spent most of her life abroad, led the Iraq \n     Foundation, a Washington-based pro-democracy group and has \n     helped plan Iraq's transition from Saddam Hussein's rule. The \n     appointment will renew the diplomatic ties between Washington \n     and Baghdad severed in 1990 when Saddam invaded Kuwait.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/24/senate-section/article/S15805-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15805]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, on Friday, I was pleased to introduce the \nEmployee Free Choice Act, which is sponsored by 24 Members of the \nSenate.\n  For decades, labor unions have led the fight for the 8-hour day, and \nthe 40-hour week, for overtime pay, for the minimum wage, for safe and \nhealthy workplaces, for health insurance, for retirement security, and \nmany other basic rights. Millions of union members in communities \nacross America benefit today from the long hard battles of the past.\n  Union workers earn wages 25 percent higher than nonunion workers. \nUnion workers are more than four times as likely to have a secure \npension plan. Union workers are 40 percent more likely to have health \ninsurance coverage.\n  These and many other longstanding benefits of union membership are \nundisputed. But too many workers who want to be members of a union are \nunable to do so. The reason is clear. Too often, employers discourage \nit in any way they can.\n  For years, illegal employer tactics have been common whenever \nemployees attempt to form a union. Each year, employers are charged \nwith over 20,000 instances of violating workplace labor rights. In over \nhalf of these claims, a worker was punished or even fired for union \nactivity. A recent survey found that employers illegally fire employees \nin one quarter of all union organizing drives.\n  Even employees who manage to form a union often can't get a contract, \nbecause employers refuse to bargain. Only half of the unions who win an \nelection are able to get a first contract.\n  Often, companies hire expensive consultants and launch campaigns to \nintimidate workers and keep them from supporting a union.\n  Anti-union companies often give their managers pamphlets with titles \nlike ``A Manager's Toolbox to Remaining Union Free.''\n  They close down departments that succeed in unionizing. Employers spy \non workers and use one-on-one confrontations to intimidate workers or \nbreak the union.\n  Too often, Federal labor laws intended to protect workers from \ncoercion have no teeth. If workers are fired, they may not get their \njobs back for years. At most, the employer will owe back wages. \nCompanies treat such payments as just another cost of doing business.\n  America's workers deserve better. American democracy deserves better.\n  That is why we are here today to introduce the Employee Free Choice \nAct. Free Choice means: the freedom to associate freely in the \nworkplace; the freedom to choose your own labor representative; and the \nfreedom to bargain for better wages, better health care, and other \nbenefits.\n  Our bill recognizes a specific right of workers to choose a union \nthrough a process called a card check. If a majority of employees sign \na card asking for representation by a union, the employer must comply.\n  The bill also requires employers to come to the table to negotiate a \nfirst contract. And it levels the playing field for employees who are \nattempting to organize a union or obtain a first contract. It provides \nfor court orders to stop employers from firing or threatening these \nworkers. The bill also puts real teeth in the law by strengthening the \npenalties in current law for workers that support a union.\n  These protections are long overdue. For too long, we have acquiesced \nin the anti-labor, anti-worker, anti-union tactics that are far too \nprevalent in the workplace. We like to think that workers are free to \njoin a union, but too often that basic aspect of freedom is denied in \nour modern society, because hard-line corporate managers succeed in \ndenying a fair choice by workers.\n  At a critical time like this when we are fighting for the basic \nfreedoms of other peoples in other lands, we cannot fail to take a \nstand for the basic freedoms of the millions of American workers who \ndepend on us to protect their rights at home.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/24/senate-section/article/S15806-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15806]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S15806]]\n        EXTENSION OF TEMPORARY UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for \nextending the Temporary Unemployment Compensation Program.\n  As we approach the holiday season, many unemployed workers are \napproaching the end of their eligibility for unemployment insurance. \nUnemployed workers who exhaust their benefits between now and the end \nof the year will be eligible for 13 weeks of extended benefits but \nthose who exhaust their eligibility after December 31 will be out of \nluck. The program will have terminated and they will not be eligible \nfor extended benefits.\n  According to the most recent reports from the Department of Labor, \nthere are 337,000 people unemployed in Ohio, an increase of 39 percent \nfrom November 1999. In Michigan, 379,000 are unemployed, up 105 percent \nfrom November 1999. Another 177,000 are looking for work in Wisconsin, \nan increase of 90 percent. To put these numbers in perspective, during \nthe last recession from November 1987 to November 1992, unemployment in \nOhio increased by 21 percent, Michigan unemployment increased by 17 \npercent and in Wisconsin unemployment actually fell by 7 percent.\n  Even these numbers do not fully describe the challenges facing low \nand semi-skilled workers in the midwest. Although the Labor \nDepartment's household survey indicates more than 337,000 individuals \nare unemployed in Ohio, our state Department of Jobs and Family \nServices report that only about 130,000 are collecting unemployment \ninsurance benefits. The remaining 200,000 workers have either exhausted \ntheir benefits or never qualified for them in the first place because \nthey have been existing on a series of part time and temporary jobs \nthat do not count toward unemployment compensation. DJFS reports also \nindicate that 2,000 to 2,500 individuals per week exhaust their state \nlevel unemployment benefits and apply for TEUC benefits. The number of \nindividuals receiving TEUC benefits--about 25,000--has remained almost \nunchanged since July of 2002, indicating that as one cadre of \nindividual leaves the system, another group takes their place.\n  Although the recent employment numbers from the Department of Labor \nappear hopeful, they may promise more than they deliver. Over the past \n4 years, summer and fall employment gains in Ohio have been followed by \nwinter and spring job losses. This cycle has remained consistent for \nthe past 4 years. Equally important, the data appear to indicate that \neven if weekly unemployment claims are leveling out, they are doing so \nat twice the level of comparable times of the year in 1999. \nConsequently, unless we extend the TEUC program, many individuals will \nexhaust their state unemployment benefits during the most difficult \nperiod of the year to find employment but have no eligibility for TEUC \nbenefits to tide them over until hiring picks up in the summer.\n  The dead of winter is a particularly difficult time to be out of work \nin Ohio. Jobs are more difficult to locate and heating bills drive up \nhousehold expenses. This is not the time to be making life more \ndifficult for the low- and semi-skilled workers who are having the most \ndifficult time readjusting to the realities of the new economy. \nAlthough I hope and pray the improving economy will generate new jobs \nfor Ohio workers, we continue to have about 130,000 individuals \ncollecting unemployment insurance each week. Unless we extend the TEUC \nprogram, many individuals will exhaust their state unemployment \nbenefits just when they need them the most. We need to address this \nissue before Congress adjourns to ensure that people receive the help \nthey need.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/24/senate-section/article/S15806-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15806-S15807]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           FAIR AND ACCURATE CREDIT TRANSACTIONS ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, Saturday evening the Senate passed by \nvoice vote the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003. I \nwant to congratulate Chairman Shelby, Chairman Oxley and Congressman \nFrank and all the conferees on the successful completion of the \nconference on this bill. This is an important piece of legislation and, \nas I have previously done, I want to acknowledge the thorough \nexamination of these important issues provided by the comprehensive \nseries of six hearings on this subject that Chairman Shelby held in the \nBanking Committee. The bill passed unanimously out of the Banking \nCommittee on a voice vote on September 23, 2003 and was adopted 95-2 on \nthe floor on November 5, 2003. These votes, I believe, are a testament \nto our chairman's willingness to work on a bipartisan basis.\n  I believe the same can be said of Chairman Oxley and Congressman \nFrank. Their bill was voted out of the House Financial Services \nCommittee by 63-3 on July 24, 2003, and was passed overwhelmingly on \nthe floor 392-30 on September 10, 2003. The conference report was \npassed on the floor of the House on Friday night on a vote of 379-49.\n  While there were a number of differences between the Senate and House \npassed versions, I think the conference successfully took many of the \nbest provisions from each bill. Although I would have liked to have \ngone further in a few areas--in the affiliate sharing section to \nprovide more protection for the financial privacy of consumers, and \nalso in preserving the rights of States to act--I believe a good \ncompromise was reached. Among other things, this legislation provides \nconsumers with free credit reports annually from the national credit \nbureaus and provides consumers with an easy method to obtain their free \ncredit reports, and easier access to their credit scores; requires that \nconsumers be given a summary of their right to opt out of prescreened \noffers; provides for accuracy guidelines; requires financial \ninstitutions to send their customers written notice prior to submitting \nnegative information about them to a national consumer reporting \nagency; lengthens the statute of limitations for all Fair Credit \nReporting Act violations; extends the situations in which consumers are \nnotified when adverse actions have been taken against them; prohibits \nthe sale, transfer, or collection of identity theft debt, so that such \nbad debt will not be perpetuated in the credit system; limits the \nsharing of medical information in the financial system; with certain \nlimitations, provides consumers with the right to opt out of \nsolicitations for marketing purposes that result from affiliate \ninformation sharing; and helps enhance the financial literacy of all \nAmericans.\n  This legislation contains a number of important consumer protections, \nand I want to address some of these provisions more thoroughly.\n  First I would like to note a significant consumer right contained in \nthe legislation--the right to obtain a free credit report annually. \nThis legislation will, for the first time, allow consumers to make one \nrequest, and obtain their credit report free annually from each of the \nnational credit bureaus. Financial institutions rely heavily on credit \nreport information to make credit decisions, and it is extremely \nimportant that consumers be aware of the information contained in their \ncredit reports. Providing consumers with the right to obtain this \nimportant information free is a major step forward in ensuring \nconsumers' knowledge of, and control over, their financial information.\n  In addition to obtaining free reports, under this legislation \nconsumers will be informed when negative information is added to their \ncredit reports. This important provision, combined with the consumer's \nright to a free report, will help improve Americans' access to and \nunderstanding of information contained in their credit reports.\n  This legislation will also help ensure that consumers are aware of \nhow to opt out of the prescreening process which results in many of the \nunsolicited offers of credit that consumers receive in the mail. Under \nthe FCRA, credit reporting agencies may generate for creditors \nprescreened lists of individuals with certain characteristics to be \ntargeted to receive a direct mailing. The success of the FTC's ``Do-\nNot-Call'' Registry has highlighted Americans' frustration with \nunsolicited telephone offers. Under this legislation, creditors making \nsuch unsolicited offers of credit to consumers by mail will be required \nto include a summary of consumers' right to opt-out of prescreening in \ntheir offers to consumers. The FTC in consultation with\n\n[[Page S15807]]\n\nthe banking agencies and the National Credit Union Association will be \nrequired to write rules on the size and prominence of the disclosure of \nthe opt-out telephone number that is included with offers of credit to \nconsumers.\n  In order to ensure that consumers are aware of the many rights \nprovided for them under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, this bill \ndirects the FTC to undertake an educational campaign. The FTC is \ndirected to actively publicize, and conspicuously post on its website, \na number of important FCRA consumer rights. Among these are the right \nto obtain free credit reports annually, and other circumstances in \nwhich consumers may obtain free credit reports; the right of a consumer \nto dispute information in his or her credit report; the consumer's \nright to obtain a credit score from a consumer reporting agency, and a \ndescription of how to obtain a credit score; and the consumer's right \nto opt out of prescreened lists, and the toll-free telephone number \nmaintained by the national credit bureaus by which consumers may opt \nout. This FTC campaign will help ensure that Americans are informed of \ntheir rights under the FCRA, including the new rights afforded to them \nby this Act.\n   This legislation will also add a new provision to the FCRA that \nwould provide consumers with a notice when they receive less favorable \ncredit terms, based on their credit report. Receiving the notice would \ntrigger the consumer's right to examine his or her credit report free \nof charge. Although the new provision would give the Federal Trade \nCommission and the Federal Reserve Board broad authority to make rules \nregarding the form and content of the notice and when it should be \ndelivered, the notice, by its very logic, must be given after the terms \nof the offer have been set based on whole or in part on the credit \nreport. The notice should be provided as early as practicable in the \ntransaction after the terms have been set.\n   This legislation will also benefit consumers by requiring Federal \nagencies to provide greater oversight of the accuracy and integrity of \ncredit reports. Under this act, Federal banking regulators and the \nFederal Trade Commission will, for the first time, establish and \nmaintain guidelines regarding the accuracy and integrity of information \nprovided by data furnishers to credit reporting agencies. The Act also \nrequires these agencies to prescribe regulations requiring creditors \nand other furnishers of information to credit bureaus to establish \nreasonable policies and procedures for implementing these guidelines. \nFor the purposes of this section, ``accuracy'' relates to whether the \ninformation that is provided by data furnishers to credit reporting \nagencies is factually correct. The term ``integrity'' relates to \nwhether all relevant information that is used to assess credit risk and \nto grant credit is accurately provided. Integrity of information is not \nachieved when furnishers do not fully provide data that, by its \nabsence, could have a positive or negative effect on a consumer's \ncredit score, or on his or her ability to obtain credit under the most \nfavorable terms for which he or she qualifies.\n   The bill also contains important provisions relating to financial \ncompanies' ability to market to their customers based on private \nfinancial information of the customers that has been shared among \naffiliates. For the first time, the bill will require affiliates who \nshare customer information to make solicitations for marketing purposes \nto disclose this sharing to consumers, and to provide consumers with an \nopportunity to opt out of marketing resulting from such sharing. \nExceptions are provided for pre-existing customers, solicitations based \non existing shared data, solicitations contracted for by employers, \ncompliance with State insurance laws, service providers, and responding \nto consumer requests.\n   In addition to providing an opt-out of marketing based on affiliate \nsharing, this legislation helps protect consumers' private financial \ninformation by including a number of important identity theft \nprevention and protection provisions. I want particularly to note \nSenator Cantwell's leadership in the area of identity theft. Senator \nCantwell's identity theft legislation passed on the floor of the Senate \nlast year, and several of the provisions from her bill have been \nincorporated in the FACT Act, including an extension of the statute of \nlimitations, provisions allowing consumers to block identity theft \ninformation from appearing on their credit reports, and a provision \nallowing consumers to obtain copies of business records reflecting any \ntransactions that have been carried out in their name by identity \nthieves. I believe that these provisions will be beneficial to identity \ntheft victims, and I want to commend Senator Cantwell's leadership in \nthis area along with that of Senators Enzi and Feinstein.\n   After careful consideration by the conferees, the conference report \nprovides for preemption of the States with respect to conduct required \nby specific listed provisions of the Act on identity theft. This \nnarrowly focused preemption will leave States free to supplement these \nprotections and to develop additional approaches and solutions to \nidentity theft.\n   I would also like to highlight the important steps this legislation \ntakes to improve the financial literacy of consumers by establishing a \nFinancial Literacy and Education Commission which will coordinate \npromotion of Federal financial literacy efforts, and will develop a \nnational strategy to promote financial literacy and education. I want \nto commend Senators Enzi and Stabenow, along with Senators Corzine, \nAkaka and others, for their leadership in the Senate in this area. The \nHouse had a strong interest in the development of this title, and \nadded, among other provisions, an authorization of $3 million dollars \nfor the development of a national public service multimedia campaign \nthat will be consistent with the national strategy.\n   In closing, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge the \noutstanding work done by the staff of the Committee on this \nlegislation. On my staff, I would like to express my deep appreciation \nfor the work done by Lynsey Graham as well as Dean Shahinian, Aaron \nKlein, Marty Gruenberg and Steve Harris.\n   It was a pleasure working with the staff of Chairman Shelby who are \nto be congratulated for their outstanding work. I particularly want to \nacknowledge the work of Mark Oesterle, Doug Nappi and Chairman Shelby's \nstaff director, Kathy Casey.\n   I would also like to thank Laura Ayoud from Senate Legislative \nCounsel, who has worked tirelessly and, as always, effectively, to put \nthis package together.\n   I would also like to acknowledge the vital role played in developing \nthis legislation by all of our Senate conferees: Senators Bennett, \nAllard, Enzi, Dodd and Johnson, and in particular by the Chairman, \nSenator Shelby.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/24/senate-section/article/S15807-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15807]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in Naples, \nFL. In May of 2003, a 17-year-old reportedly drove around the parking \nlot of a downtown bar, yelling homosexual epithets while attempting to \nrun one man down and to attack another. Michael R.

Mr. President, the death of Bill Simpson on November 20 \nat the Veterans Medical Center here in Washington was very much like \nhaving a death in the family of the Senate.\n  Bill was known to many of us as the well-respected and effective \nAdministrative Assistant of former Senator James O. Eastland of \nMississippi. He\n\n[[Page S15808]]\n\nserved for 10 years on Senator Eastland's staff and was widely known in \nMississippi as the person to call to get things done in our State.\n  I first met him when he became a member of the staff of Governor Paul \nB. Johnson, Jr. Bill was a talented speech writer as well as an astute \npolitical tactician for Governor Johnson. They accomplished a great \ndeal in that 4-year term because of the thoughtful leadership of \nGovernor Johnson and the able assistance of Bill Simpson. The \n``Shipyard of the Future'' was built by Litton Industries at Pascagoula \nand the Mississippi Research and Development Center was established in \nJackson.\n  When I was elected to the Senate in 1978 to replace Senator Eastland, \nI tried to talk Bill Simpson into staying on as a member of my staff, \nbut President Carter was more persuasive, and Bill left the Senate to \nserve as an assistant to Hamilton Jordan, the Chief of Staff in The \nWhite House.\n  Bill Simpson grew up on the Mississippi Gulf Coast and graduated from \nSt. Stanislas College in Bay St. Louis and the U.S. Merchant Marine \nAcademy at Kings Point, NY. His father served as Mayor of Pass \nChristian and his brother, Jim Simpson, Sr. was a 7-term member of the \nMississippi House of Representatives.\n  Bill's nephew, Jim Simpson, Jr., carries on the family tradition in \nMississippi politics as a respected member of the House of \nRepresentatives from Harrison county, and his son, Bill Simpson, Jr., \nserves on the staff of the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n  Bill enjoyed the love and support of a devoted family and the \ncamaraderie of countless friends. As chairman of the board of the 116 \nClub he would hold court and tell stories about the Senate and our \nState of Mississippi with a twinkle in his eye and love in his heart.\n  We extend to his wife, Evelyn, and his children, Bill, Jr. and Ellen, \nand his three grandchildren, our sincerest condolences.\n\n                       HONORING THE ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                   sergeant major cornell w. gilmore\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I seek recognition to honor a Virginia \nSoldier, Sergeant Major Cornell W. Gilmore, who was tragically killed \nin action in Iraq on Friday, November 7th, 2003. I want to express \ngratitude, on behalf of the Senate, for his service to our Nation. The \nAmerican people, I am certain, join me in expressing their prayers and \ncompassion to his family.\n  As the Sergeant Major of the Army's Judge Advocate General Corps, he \nserved as the primary adviser to the judge advocate general on all \nmatters concerning the health and welfare of all the enlisted soldiers \nwithin that command. A heavy responsibility that he bore freely and he \nserved with great effect. He accompanied his commanding general, Major \nGeneral Thomas J. Romig, to Iraq to ensure the soldiers legal needs \nwere being met while away from home. Major General Romig stated that he \nwas ``one of the most dynamic leaders I ever met.''\n  Sergeant Major Gilmore leaves behind his wife, Donna; his daughter, \nDawnita; his son, Cornell, Jr.; his father William; and his mother, \nLouise.\n  Sergeant Major Gilmore was both an exceptional soldier and a caring \ncitizen, giving his time freely to community and his church. At every \npost throughout his career he has been a mentor to many through his \nlove of God and music, most recently serving as the music minister at \nthe Shilo Christian Church in Stafford, VA. The local media reported \nthat 100 former pupils served in the choir during his funeral service \nwith more than 1300 mourners present.\n  His family members are brave Americans who have sacrificed so much \nfor this Nation. We owe them and the other families who have lost their \nloved ones a debt of gratitude. Sergeant Major Gilmore was an \nexceptional man with a bright future and family in front of him. His \nwife stated, ``he lived and died doing what he loved best--being with \nsoldiers.'' I cannot craft a finer eulogy, the Commonwealth of Virginia \nand the entire Nation shall mourn his loss.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/24/senate-section/article/S15808-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15808]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 NOBEL PEACE PRIZE WINNER RALPH BUNCHE\n\n  Mr. TALENT.

Mr. President, I am pleased to report that, last Friday, \nS. 1720 was presented to the President for his consideration, after \nreceiving the unanimous approval of both the House and Senate. I \nsponsored S. 1720, joined by Senator Huthinson, because I believe that \nthis legislation is necessary to ensure that all of the citizens of \nNorth Texas have access to justice in the Federal courts.\n  S. 1720 authorizes the United States District Court for the Eastern \nDistrict of Texas to hold court in the City of Plano. Such legislation \nwas first endorsed by the Judicial Conference of the United States and \nthe Eastern District of Texas in 1991. Yet although, prior to this \nyear, the House had already approved such legislation five times since \n1991, it has never received the approval of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee and the Senate until this year.\n  Federal law does not currently authorize the Eastern District of \nTexas to hold court in Plano--making the Eastern District, of all 93 \njudicial districts across the United States, the only judicial district \nin which its largest city cannot hold Federal court. The nearest \nEastern District judge is in the city of Sherman, a 100-mile or more \nroundtrip drive away. As a result, Federal prosecutors, public \ndefenders, other attorneys, and law enforcement officials must waste \nprecious time and resources conducting even the most simple court \nbusiness. The people of the Eastern District of Texas are woefully \nunderserved as a result.\n  S. 1720 enjoys strong support among officials across the State of \nTexas. Most notably, U.S. Attorney Matthew D. Orwing, First Assistant \nU.S. Attorney Rebecca Gregory, Chief Judge John Hannah, Jr., and Judge \nRichard A. Schell worked closely with my office in this effort, and I \nam grateful to each and every one of them for working with me to ensure \nthat the people of North Texas enjoy adequate access to justice in the \nFederal courts.\n  The judges of the Eastern District firmly believe that this \nlegislation is good for the citizens of Sherman as well as Plano. On \nJune 13, 2003, on behalf of all the judges of the Eastern District, \nChief Judge Hannah issued General Order No. 03-15, which resolves, ``if \npending legislation passes that authorizes Plano as a place of holding \ncourt, to have half the Sherman Division caseload docketed and tried in \nSherman, and the other half of the caseload docketed and tried in \nPlano. If Judge Brown ceases holding court in Sherman, a new resident \njudge shall be designated to hold court in Sherman as soon as possible, \nand pending the new judge's residing in Sherman, 50 percent of civil \nand criminal cases shall be docketed and tried in Sherman, and the \nclerk's office in Sherman shall remain staffed sufficiently to support \na resident judge.''\n  Relying on this general order, the Grayson County Bar Association, \nwhich includes Sherman, and the Collin County Bar Association, which \nincludes Plano, recently approved a joint resolution endorsing this \nlegislation. Furthermore, consistent with the terms of the order, \nCongressman Ralph Hall inserted the following statement into the \nCongressional Record just moment before House approval of S. 1720 last \nWednesday:\n\n       Both Sherman and Plano shall have a resident United States \n     District Judge. Fifty percent of the cases filed in or \n     transferred to the Sherman Division of the United States \n     District Court for the Eastern District of Texas shall be \n     assigned for trial and tried in Sherman by either the \n     resident United States District Judge sitting in Sherman or\n\n[[Page S15809]]\n\n     another United States District Judge assigned to hold court \n     in Sherman. The remaining 50 percent of the cases shall be \n     assigned for trial and tried in Plano by either the resident \n     United States District Court Judge sitting in Plano or \n     another United States District Judge assigned to hold court \n     in Plano. If the resident judge in Sherman or Plano retires \n     or dies, 50 percent of the cases shall continue to be tried \n     in Sherman and 50 percent tried in Plano while a new resident \n     judge is being assigned. This provision shall not prevent the \n     transfer of a case to another judge or division of the United \n     States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas or \n     another United States District Court for trial, if such \n     transfer is permitted by applicable law.\n\n  This language reflects the intentions of the judges of the Eastern \nDistrict of Texas as stated in General Order No. 03-15--as confirmed by \nChief Judge Hannah last week. Accordingly, I am pleased to join \nCongressman Hall in inserting this statement into the Congressional \nRecord.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/24/senate-section/article/S15809-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15809]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       ON THE LIFE OF EDITH NASH\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I pay tribute today to a good \nfriend and a great Wisconsinite who recently passed away, leaving \nbehind an inspiring legacy of community leadership, of creativity, and \nof true benevolence.\n  In Wisconsin, Edith's enterprise was evident in both her dedication \nto the arts and her success in the private sector. A community leader, \nshe served as a board member of the Meiklejohn Educational Association, \nas administrator of the Wisconsin Rapids Community Company of Players, \nand as a member of the Wisconsin Academy of Sciences, Arts and Letters. \nPrivately, she was vice president and later president of her family's \nbusiness, the Biron Cranberry Co.\n  Never one to stand still, Edith continued to reinvent herself time \nand time again, even late in life. After selling the Biron Company, \nEdith delved into poetry, publishing five books and founding a writers' \ngroup when she was well into her eighties.\n  Earlier in her life, Edith lived in Washington, DC, where she was \ndismayed and outraged at the state of the city's segregated public \nschool system. So, with her husband Philleo, she founded one of the \nDistrict's first integrated schools in 1945, the Georgetown Day School. \nLater, she served as the school's director for 14 years.\n  While at the Georgetown Day School, Edith challenged her new students \nby telling them that ``If you really don't like the idea of standing on \nyour own two feet and beginning to be the master of your own life--if \nyou'd rather be a chip in the ocean with the mammoth water raising and \nlowering you and you making no effort at all--don't come to Georgetown \nDay School. Ask your folks to help you find a regular school where \nyou'll not have so much to do yourself.''\n  Edith followed her own words; as a poet, mother, philanthropist, \nacademic, and businesswomen, she was no chip in the ocean. And even in \nher ninth decade, she continued to work hard and inspire new \ngenerations. Her work and ideas knew no bounds.\n  Edith Nash's death is a great loss to all of us who knew her, and all \nthose whose lives were touched by her many good works. I am deeply \nsaddened by her passing, but I know that her leadership, creativity and \ngenerosity have left a lasting mark on our State and our \ncountry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/24/senate-section/article/S15809-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15809]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        HONORING JACK K. NORRIS AND THE LATE JEAN DONKERS NORRIS\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to honor an Idahoan who \nwill soon celebrate his 88th birthday, Payette native Jack K. Norris. \nJack is a hero, not only for Idaho, but for the entire Nation. Jack was \nborn in Payette, ID, on November 30, 1915, but he has spent much of his \nlife in service to our country. He was a member of the Class of 1939, \nU.S. Military Academy at West Point, and served throughout the world \nduring World War II. His numerous awards include: a Purple Heart, \nSilver Star with Oak Leaf Cluster and a V for Valor, Legion of Merit \nwith Oak Leaf Cluster, Bronze Star with Oak Leaf Cluster, Combat \nInfantry Badge, Presidential Unit Citation, French Croix de Guerre, \nBelgian Order of the Crown, Belgian Croix de Guerre, and five European \nTour of Duty campaign stars. These many honors speak to his exceptional \nservice to country, and his outstanding military knowledge. This \nknowledge was cultivated and expanded through years of military courses \nand training including graduation from the Battalion Commander's \nCourse, Command and General Staff College, British Staff College, Army \nWar College, Army Aviation School-Senior Officers Course, fixed and \nrotary wing qualification, and Senior Officers Aircraft Maintenance and \nLogistics course. In his own words, Jack describes his decision to \nenlist in the Army as: ``probably the best thing that ever happened to \nme.''\n  After many years in the Armed Forces, Jack retired from the service. \nUnable to slow down, he began teaching at North Georgia College, where \nhe was named Commandant of Cadets in the ROTC program. After leaving \nNorth Georgia College, and with an insatiable appetite for learning and \naccomplishment, Jack decided to study law. He received his license and \npracticed until 1983. Jack did all of these things while caring for the \nmost important individuals in his life: his wife and three children. \nHis tree sons have all made service to country a part of their lives, \npresumably as a result of their father's influence.\n  I also want to pay tribute to Jack's wife, Jean Donkers Norris, who \npassed away in 1983. Much of their lives together revolved around the \nmilitary. She met her sweetheart at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center \nand married him at the Main Post Chapel in San Antonio, TX. Jean kept \nthe home fires burning while Jack was away at war. She was the model \nmilitary wife and moved frequently to accommodate Jack's career, and \nthat required many sacrifices on her part. She was always ready to \nserve--whether it be a meal to a visiting officer or thirty, or to \nsupport other military spouses. I wanted to relate a couple of stories \nabout Jean. Once she had to shovel coal for heat in the family's \ntemporary quarters, and commented that she was grateful white gloves \nwere in fashion so she could hide the coal stains on her hands when she \nhad to go out.\n  When Jack was a post commander, he and Jean visited every soldier who \nwas in the hospital or in jail on Christmas Day and brought them some \nof her homemade cookies. She was known for her compassion and \ndedication to her own family as well as the U.S. Army family.\n  Jack and Jean had a true partnership and were exceptional role models \nfor their children and their daughters-in-law. In today's world, as we \nagain see the necessity of American troops deployed and in action, \npeople like Jack and Jean bring home to us the importance of dedication \nto family and country. Even during trying, testing times Jack and Jean \nshowed their commitment to a cause and their commitment to each other. \nTheir exceptional example is worthy of praise. I am profoundly grateful \nfor their service to our country. I send Jack all of my best for a very \nHappy Birthday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/24/senate-section/article/S15809-3", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15809-S15810]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SERVICE LEADERS SUMMIT\n\n Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today to tell you about the \nextraordinary young Hoosiers I recently had the privilege to meet. Last \nmonth, I hosted my first annual Service Leaders Summit to honor high \nschool students from across Indiana for their service and dedication to \ntheir communities and hopefully to inspire them to continue serving \nthroughout their lives.\n  The young men and women I met last month have answered the call to \nservice. Some of them have helped build homes, some tutored and \nmentored younger students, and others have raised money for cancer \nresearch and to feed the hungry. Several of the young men and women \nstarted service clubs to address the problems in their schools and \ncommunities. Each one of the students I met spent hours making a \ndifference in their hometowns and together they impacted the lives of \nthousands of Hoosiers.\n  The student leaders heard from Hoosiers of all backgrounds who have \nchosen to dedicate their lives to serving others. The speakers focused \non the different aspects that go into a successful service project: \ninspiration, organization, dedication, evaluation and reflection. \nFollowing the speeches, the students broke up into different groups\n\n[[Page S15810]]\n\nand participated in service projects throughout Indianapolis. Some \nstudents distributed coats to children of needy families, while others \nplanted trees in the rain, cleaned up a park and beautified a \nneighborhood. Through their work together, the leaders were able to \nexperience the dramatic results of the power of service.\n  Robert F. Kennedy once said that ``Some men see things as they are \nand say `Why?' I dream of things that never were and say, `Why \nnot?''Sec. ' Each one of the young men and women have already asked \nthemselves ``why not?'' and have worked to make positive changes in \ntheir communities. These students represent a new generation of promise \nwith the potential to make a real difference across Indiana and the \nnation.\n  I would like to thank each one of the following individuals for \nparticipating in the summit and for their service to their communities: \nRuchika Agrawal, Brooke Allen, Santiago Alvarez, Ricky Anderson, Tracy \nAnderson, Mary Anderson-Clark, Todd William Ault, Audrey Ballinger, \nKatherine Ban Wyk, Brenda Banks, Meghan Beeman, Nicole Blauvelt, \nStephanie Bobcek, Jared Michael Bond, Thomas Borders, Jason Born, \nSamantha Brown, Brittany Brumfield, Michael Brunsman, Jordan Bruse, \nJeremy Burton, Danielle Cave, Brett Claxton, Erin Clifford, Heather \nCoffman, Sarah Copley, Donald Davenport, Adrienne Davis, Matthew J. \nDay, Emily DeCamp, Todd Dell'Aquila, Hallie Denstorff, Rachel \nDickerson, Carrie L.

Mr. President, I rise today with great \nadmiration, to recognize the 2003 Winston Cup Champion, Matt Kenseth. \nOn November 16, Kenseth was crowned champion of NASCAR's 2003 Winston \nCup Series.\n  Kenseth was born on March 10, 1972, in Cambridge, WI. For Kenseth, \nracing is a family tradition. When he was 13, his father, Roy purchased \na race car and made Matt a deal. Roy would drive the car if Matt would \nwork on it. When Matt turned 16, he could get in the driver's seat.\n  Kenseth started his stock car racing career at the young age of 16, \nwinning his first event in only his third race. Within his first three \nseasons, Kenseth racked up 10 racing victories from all around \nWisconsin. His name recognition grew in Wisconsin racing hotbeds like \nSlinger and Lake Geneva. In 1995, Kenseth took his racing skills to the \nSouth, the heart of American stock car racing. It didn't take long \nbefore Kenseth became noticed throughout the racing world. Kenseth had \ngreat success while racing in the Busch Grand National Series. In 1998, \njust his first full Busch Series season, Kenseth finished second in the \nstandings. He followed that season up with a strong third place finish \nin 1999 while also making five Winston Cup starts. Kenseth's arrival to \nthe Winston Cup Series was heard loud and clear as he won Rookie of the \nYear honors in 2000.\n  But the 2003 season was simply magical. Kenseth finished the season \nwith 25 top 10 finishes, more than any other driver. He also set a \nrecord spending 33 straight weeks in the Winston Cup Standings No. 1 \nposition, breaking the record of racing legend Dale Earnhardt. \nWisconsin is very proud of Matt's accomplishments and we wish him the \nbest of luck next season as he defends his championship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/24/senate-section/article/S15810-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15810-S15811]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            DR. TOM GOODWIN\n\n Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one \nof Arkansas's and America's preeminent educators, Dr. Tom Goodwin of \nHendrix College. Dr. Goodwin was honored last week with a United States \nProfessor of the Year Award as the Outstanding Baccalaureate College \nProfessor of the Year by the Council for the Advancement and Support of \nEducation and the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. \nHe was one of four, in the entire Nation to be honored for their \ndedication to undergraduate education and teaching and their commitment \nto students.\n  It is not often, that one gets recognized for one's life's work. It \nis even less often that the recognition comes when the recipient is \nstill at the height of his career. I wish to congratulate Dr. Goodwin \non behalf of all Arkansans for this wonderful accomplishment. Dr. \nGoodwin has dedicated his entire professional life, over 25 years, to \nthe education of young people. During a time when many are concerned \nwith publishing, research, and the advancement of their own careers, \nDr. Goodwin has remained focused on the reasons he entered academia--\nthe fostering and development of the leaders and great thinkers of the \nnext generation. And I, for one, agree with him. He has done what so \nmany teachers try to do. Some are more successful than others. Some are \noutstanding researchers who make wonderful discoveries that further the \nscientific knowledge of mankind. Some are great administrators who \nmanage the machinery from which these great discoveries are churned. \nStill, Dr. Goodwin has made the greatest discovery of all. He has \ndiscovered that all of the advancements of the human race, all of the \ngreat mechanizations from which these advancements come mean nothing \nwithout the continuity of people teaching other people. Knowledge in a \nvacuum, doesn't further the human condition. For the human condition to \nmove forward, to change for the betterment of all, we must learn. We \nmust teach. ``For the end of man is to know.'' That's one of my \nfavorite literary quotes, from Robert Penn Warren's All The King's Men. \nThe end of man keeps moving farther, just beyond the outstretched reach \nof our hands. To reach the ends, man must continue to know. Dr. Goodwin \nhas found the best way to accomplish this; the best way to achieve the \nend is through a partnership between teacher and student. The \ndisbursement of knowledge; what it is, how to get it, where to find it, \nbecomes the primary objective for a multigenerational team working \ntogether. Dr. Goodwin has achieved this elusive goal. A seamless \npartnership between professor and student, with both benefiting from \nthe contributions of the other, both contributing toward the end of \nman.\n  But don't take it from me. His colleagues and his students realize \nthe impact Dr. Goodwin has had on the minds and motivations of young \npeople. They refer to him not only as teacher and scholar, but also as \nmentor and friend. Dr. John Churchill, secretary of the Phi Beta Kappa \nSociety and former Dean of Hendrix College notes, ``To see Tom Goodwin \nwith students is to feel the power of his expectations. It is also\n\n[[Page S15811]]\n\nto feel the warm, personal support, extended toward their efforts. He \nepitomizes the tension of the best undergraduate liberal arts \nprofessors: demanding rigor and providing support. He takes a wide-\nranging interest in his students' education. He helps them grow into \nwell-rounded intellects.'' His colleagues in the Chemistry Department \nat Hendrix College, Dr. Liz Gron, testifies to the amount of time and \nattention Dr. Goodwin gives his work. ``He wants every student to \nsucceed and he provides a number of different venues in order to \nsupport different learning styles. Tom schedules four help sessions a \nweek, as well as time-independent exams to accommodate students that \nsynthesize concepts more slowly.'' His students agree. ``Dr. Goodwin \noffered many, many hours of his personal time, both in the laboratory \nand the classroom, to help me conquer the very difficult subjects I was \nstudying,'' says Daniel Mwanza, a former student at Hendrix. Many other \nformer students agreed and wrote statements similar to Mr. Mwanza's in \nsupport of his nomination for this award. So you see, this man is \nimportant to his students, important to his colleagues and institution, \nand important to education across this country. I am proud to serve him \nand I am proud he is my constituent. Dr. Goodwin represents the highest \ntradition of education in this country. He inspires his students to \nachieve more than they would alone. He is deeply deserving of this \naward, and I wish to congratulate him for this monumental \nachievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/24/senate-section/article/S15811-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15811]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              CHARLES ``CHARLIE'' EDWARD BYRD: IN MEMORIAM\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I share with my colleagues the \nmemory of former Siskiyou County Sheriff Charles ``Charlie'' Edward \nByrd who passed away on September 23, 2003 in Weed, CA. Charles Byrd \nhad a remarkable career in law enforcement in Siskiyou County, and will \nbe remembered as the first black sheriff in California.\n  A native and lifetime resident of Weed, Charles Byrd was born on July \n6, 1947. He attended local schools and was a standout football player \nearning the ``Lineman of the Year'' honor from Weed High School in \n1965. In 1967, while attending the College of the Siskiyous, Charles \nByrd began his career in law enforcement as a reserve police officer \nwith the Weed Police Department and became a full-time officer the \nfollowing year. In April of 1975 he was promoted to Police Chief, and \nin 1986 he was elected Sheriff of Siskiyou County.\n  Charles Byrd's career in law enforcement broke color barriers as he \nwas both the first black police officer in the town of Weed, and the \nfirst black sheriff in California. During his 16 years as Sheriff, \nCharlie Byrd's motto for the department was ``We Can.'' This motto led \nto countless improvements for Siskiyou County, including the \ndevelopment of the Siskiyou County Inter-Agency Narcotics Task Force, \nexpansion of public safety programs, establishment of the Domestic \nViolence Response Team and Advisory Committee, formation of a detective \nbureau and expansion of technology and training within the department.\n  Dedication to his community was also a top priority for Charles Byrd. \nIn addition to making the Sheriff's Department accessible to the \ncommunity at public events, he was a member of several professional and \ncommunity organizations. Among the many associations to which Sheriff \nByrd devoted his time were: the California Peace Officers' Association, \nCalifornia Police Chiefs' Association, Weed Chamber of Commerce, Weed \nRotary Club, Habitat for Humanity, Weed Baptist Church, College of the \nSiskiyous Auxiliary Foundation Board of Directors, California State \nSheriffs' Association and Western States Sheriffs' Association.\n  Siskiyou County Supervisor LaVada Erickson commented, ``Sheriff Byrd \nlooked upon Siskiyou County as an extension of his personal family, and \nwe were treated as such. Law enforcement was his first pledge and \ncommitment. He was very aware of our at-risk youth and was committed to \nencouraging the continuation of education for the enhancement it would \nbring to their lives. He was a quiet giant of a man with a heart that \ncontained only the best for Siskiyou.''\n  Charles Byrd is survived by his mother, Eddie Byrd; sisters Ella \nByrd, Charlene Byrd, Rose Applewhite; and brothers Larry Byrd, Arnold \nByrd and Al Bearden.\n  Sheriff Charles Byrd will always be remembered for his many \ncontributions to law enforcement and to the betterment of Siskiyou \nCounty. His legacy will be cherished by his community for years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/24/senate-section/article/S15811-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15811]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      33RD ANNIVERSARY OF THE FRESNO METRO MINISTRY IN FRESNO, CA\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to recognize the 33rd \nanniversary of the Fresno Metro Ministry in Fresno, CA.\n  More than three decades ago, Fresno Metro Ministry began tackling \nsome of Fresno's most difficult social problems. In the 1970's the \nministry built a coalition of religious and secular organizations that \nworked to alleviate the hardships caused by racism through a variety of \nefforts, ranging from empowerment programs to community projects. \nThrough its youth task force the ministry began the alternative \nsentencing program that provided young individuals with alternative \npunishments that worked to redirect their lives in a positive \ndirection.\n  Understanding that a good home breeds a successful child the ministry \ndeveloped ``Parenting With Justice'' training that helped minority \nparents teach their children to deal with challenges in their lives, \nthereby empowering the entire family.\n  As the ministry grew, so did its vision. With its success came a \nbroader focus. In the 1980's the Fresno Metro Ministry began to focus \non city wide issues. The ministry led in the creation of a City of \nFresno Human Relations Commission that celebrates the rich cultural and \nreligious diversity in the Fresno area and mediates differences between \nand among groups. The commission has worked to identify and address \npatterns of discrimination.\n  In the last decade, Fresno Metro Ministry became a leader in the \ncommunity hunger coalition. It also helped break a log-jam that slowed \nprogress on the construction of the new Regional Medical Center campus \nin downtown Fresno.\n  When Fresno and the Central Valley were suffering the effects of the \n1998 freeze, the Fresno Metro Ministry coordinated with other groups to \nprovide relief to people who had lost their jobs during this difficult \ntime.\n  I also want to give special recognition to the leadership of the \nReverend Walt Parry. For the last 18 years, under Reverend Parry's \ndirection, the ministry has made a great difference in the lives of \nmany people. He and the Fresno Metro Ministry deserve the recognition \nthey are receiving during this 33rd anniversary observance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/24/senate-section/article/S15811-3", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15811]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/24/senate-section/article/S15811-4", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15811]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination and a treaty which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/24/senate-section/article/S15811-5", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15811]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ENROLLED JOINT RESOLUTION SIGNED\n\n  The following enrolled joint resolution was signed on Friday, \nNovember 21, 2003 by the President pro tempore (Mr. Stevens).\n\n       H.J.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exclude \nfrom unrelated business taxable income the gain or loss on the sale or \nexchange of certain brownfield sites, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague Senator \nInhofe, and my other Senate colleagues in introducing the Brownfield \nRevitalization Act of 2003. Given the nature of this legislation--\nestablishing tax incentives to encourage cleanup of environmentally \ncontaminated property across the country--it is appropriate that this \nbe a joint introduction between the Chairman of the Senate Environment \nand Public Works Committee and the Ranking Member of the Senate Finance \nCommittee. This legislation is bipartisan, but it is also bicameral. A \ncompanion bill was introduced earlier this week in the House of \nRepresentatives by Congresswoman Nancy Johnson and Congressman Xavier \nBecerra.\n  Across the United States, environmentally contaminated sites endanger \npublic health, impede economic development, and negatively impact tax \nrolls. The United States has an estimated 1,000,000 such properties \nscattered across our inner cities and rural areas alike.\n  In my own State of Montana, there are well over 5,000 such sites. \nThis may seem surprising for a state like Montana that is relatively \nundeveloped and pristine. But we are by no means unaffected by the \nscourge of environmental contamination. In addition to contamination \ncaused by leaking underground storage tanks and contamination caused by \nother light industries, Montana also has been impacted by significant \ncontamination left behind by some of the very industries that built our \ngreat state.\n  Contaminated sediments can be found along the Clark Fork River from \nButte, MT, downstream for 140 miles to Missoula and on into Idaho--a \nlegacy of the copper mining and smelting operations at Butte and \nAnaconda.\n\n[[Page S15814]]\n\nTremolite asbestos contamination is prevalent at numerous sites around \nLibby, MT, including the local high school and middle school tracks--a \nlegacy from the Zonlite Mine that began operating in the 1920s and \nproduced 80 percent of the world's supply of vermiculite. These \nindustries created wealth and jobs for generations of Montanans. Today, \nhowever, contamination from wood processing facilities, abandoned \nmines, and numerous other activities have harmed human health and the \nenvironment and continue to stifle the development of new business in \nMontana. These sites are well known to Montanans: Sites such as \nMissoula Sawmill site and the White Pine Sash site in Missoula, the \nMissouri River Corridor site in Great Falls, and sites in Helena, \nBozeman, Billings and numerous other communities all across Montana. We \ncan and must do more to help revitalize these important areas.\n  Congress has undertaken a number of initiatives to address the \nbrownfield problem in this country. I am proud to have been able to \nplay a leadership role in passing the Brownfields Revitalization and \nReinvestment Act of 2001. That bill has helped provide new Federal \nfunds for evaluation and remediation of brownfield sites and has helped \nto resolve some of the liability issues that were inhibiting \nremediation of these contaminated properties.\n  But, We must do more. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has estimated that \nat the current rate of cleanup, it will take 10,000 years for us to \nremediate all of the contaminated sites in America. The United States \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, in an analysis conducted with George \nWashington University, concluded that the remediation ``costs for all \nof the brownfields located within the United States have been estimated \nto exceed $650 billion,'' and that, consequently, ``it is imperative \nthat private capital be attracted to the redevelopment of \nbrownfields.''\n  Late last year, Senator Grassley and I entered a colloquy in the \nCongressional Record expressing our concern that certain provisions in \nthe tax code are having the unintended consequence of discouraging \ninvestment in the remediation and redevelopment of our nation's \npolluted sites. In that colloquy, we pledged to get our arms around \nthis issue and to draft legislation to correct this problem. I am \npleased that we are standing here today to introduce legislation to do \njust that.\n  Let me briefly describe the basis for this bill and the means by \nwhich this legislation will dramatically accelerate the remediation of \ncontaminated lands in America.\n  Today, tax-exempt investors such as university endowments, private \npension funds, and charitable foundations can invest their capital in \nthe stock market and certain real estate transactions that do not clean \nthe environment without fear of incurring an Unrelated Business Income \nTax, or UBIT, on any gains they make from their investments.\n  Because UBIT-sensitive entities hold over $6 trillion dollars in \nfinancial assets and routinely deploy more capital in real estate \nprojects than any other category of investor, the unintended \nconsequence of UBIT has been to drive our nation's biggest and most \nactive real estate investors away from projects focused on the \nremediation and redevelopment of polluted properties.\n  This bill seeks to address this problem by allowing eligible tax-\nexempt entities to invest in the cleanup and redevelopment of qualified \ncontaminated properties without incurring unrelated business income tax \nat the time they sell the property.\n  The legislation accomplishes this goal by concentrating on three \nbasic tasks: 1. focus investment on moderately and heavily polluted \nproperties, 2. require taxpayers to work with the State authorities and \nthe public to ensure adequate clean up, and 3. ensure that the \nlegislation is tightly crafted to prevent abuse.\n  First, this bill focuses on moderately and heavily polluted \nproperties.\n  Section 198 of the tax code contains a structure under which \ndesignated state environmental agencies certify contaminated property \nthat is eligible for special rules concerning deductions of remediation \ncosts. This bill uses this existing structure to identify and certify \ncontaminated sites that are eligible for inclusion within this bill. \nPrior to requesting certification from a state agency, the taxpayer is \nrequired to provide the agency with site characterizations, assessments \nand other documentation illustrating the scope and character of the \npollution problem at the target site.\n\n  The legislation maintains its focus on moderately and heavily \ncontaminated properties by requiring taxpayers to expend on remediation \nof each site the greater of $550,000 or 12 percent of the fair market \nvalue of the site, assessed as though the site were not contaminated. \nThese remediation thresholds have intentionally been set higher than he \ntypical range of costs reported to the Environmental Protection Agency \nto clean up brownfield sites nationwide. By establishing such high \nremediation thresholds, the legislation excludes incidentally or \ntrivially contaminated property and focuses new capital investment on \nthose sites most in need of additional assistance.\n  Second, this bill requires taxpayers to work with affected states and \nthe public to ensure adequate clean up.\n  In addition to requiring high levels of remediation expenditures on \neach site, the legislation contains numerous other safeguards designed \nto ensure that remediation of each site is performed to state \nspecifications and with full public involvement.\n  Similar to the front-end certification that is required to classify \nproperties as truly contaminated, the legislation requires the taxpayer \nto obtain a tail-end certification from the state agency indicating \nthat the site has been cleaned up and is no longer considered a \nbrownfield. Prior to applying for this certification, the taxpayer must \nprovide the State agency with sufficient information and documentation \nto allow the state agency to make this determination. In particular, \nthe taxpayer must certify and provide documentation that: there are no \nlonger hazardous substances, pollutants or contaminants on the property \nthat are complicating the redevelopment or reuse of the site, \nenvironmental remediation is complete or substantially complete in \nconformance with all applicable federal, state and local environmental \nlaws and regulations, the property is suitable for more economically \nproductive or environmentally beneficial uses than at the time of \nacquisition, if additional activities are required to complete \nremediation, sufficient financial assurances and institutional controls \nare in place to complete the remediation in as short a time as \npossible, and the public was notified and given the opportunity to \ncomment on the remedial actions taken to clean up the property and, if \nnecessary, on any longer-term remediation activities.\n  The provisions in this legislation are designed to create substantive \nthresholds that the tax-exempt entity must meet in order to qualify for \nthe exemption from UBIT. This legislation does not alter the complex \nweb of existing federal, state or local environmental laws, regulations \nor standards.\n  Third, this bill ensures that the legislation is tightly crafted to \nprevent abuse.\n  It is worth noting that this legislation has been drafted to contain \nnumerous safeguards to prevent abuse of this program. The anti-abuse \nexamples include the following. The taxpayer cannot be the party that \nhas caused the pollution and cannot be otherwise related to the \npolluter. Also, all transactions, purchase of the property, sale of the \nproperty, expenditure of remediation funds, etc., must be arms-length \ntransactions with parties unrelated to the taxpayer. Further, the \ntaxpayer is not allowed to count any Federal funds, e.g. grants, etc., \nor other types of government payments and benefits toward and required \nremediation thresholds. There are also restrictions on how the taxpayer \nmay treat costs across multiple properties, requiring that an election \nbe made specifying when and which properties are considered for such \npurposes; this is intended to prevent cherry-picking among different \nproperties once the election has been made. Moreover, the legislation \ncontains special restrictions addressing the use of the legislation's \nprovisions by partnerships and other pass-through entities including \nrequiring that all partnerships under the bill be fractions-rule \ncompliant.\n\n[[Page S15815]]\n\n  Because this legislation is narrowly crafted, and because tax-exempt \nentities are not currently investing in these sites, and thus are not \npaying UBIT, the Joint Committee on Taxation has concluded that this \nlegislation will actually generate revenue for the Federal treasury \nduring the first three years after enactment and that it will cost $10 \nmillion over five years and $192 million over ten years.\n  Further, because the legislation will accelerate cleanup of \nbrownfield sites, create jobs, stimulate the economy, reduce blight and \npublic health concerns, and because the bill has an acceptable fiscal \nimpact, this legislative approach has been endorsed by Environmental \nDefense, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Taxpayers Union, \nand the U.S. Conference of Mayors, as well as numerous local, state and \nregional organizations and municipalities.\n  Passage of this bill will dramatically increase the speed at which \nour country's contaminated properties are remediated and brought back \ninto productive taxable use. This narrowly crafted legislation will \ncreate jobs, increase tax revenues, and protect the environment--all \naccomplished without creating new government programs or regulations \nand all at a minimal cost to the Federal treasury.\n  I am pleased to be introducing this legislation with my colleague \nfrom Oklahoma. I look forward to working together to enact this \nlegislation into law.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1936\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to curtail \nthe use of tax shelters, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Tax Shelter \nTransparency and Enforcement Act. I am pleased to be joined by my good \nfriend, the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Chairman \nGrassley.\n  He and I introduced similar legislation in the last Congress. And, \njust this year, the Finance Committee approved this legislation as part \nof the CARE Act, the energy bill, the Jobs and Growth Act, and the \nJumpstart Our Business Strength Act.\n  But why do we need this legislation? It has been more than 2 years \nsince the collapse of Enron.\n  Since then, numerous other corporate scandals have come to light, \nthousands of employees have lost their jobs and pension savings, and \nthe after-shock has yet to settle down in the stock market.\n  But there is one thing that has not happened. This Congress has \nfailed to send to the President one single piece of tax legislation \ndesigned to shut down the kinds of abusive tax shelters we saw Enron \nuse and that we know many others use.\n  Every day that we fail to address this scandal, honest taxpayers pay \nthe bill.\n  A recent study commissioned by the IRS estimated that abusive \ncorporate tax shelters alone cost honest taxpayers from $14 billion to \n$18 billion each year. That means up to $180 billion over ten years.\n  Simply put, this abuse of our tax laws has got to stop.\n  Abusive tax shelters are wide-spread--and not new.\n  As early as 1995, the Clinton Administration undertook a \ncomprehensive, multi-faceted effort to tackle the problem of corporate \ntax shelters. This included legislative proposals to halt the\n\n[[Page S15817]]\n\nsale and marketing of shelters. Regulatory action to clamp down on \nillicit activity. And steps to better identify and pursue abusive \ntransactions.\n  The current Administration has added to the list of identified tax \nshelters and supported legislative proposals to ensure greater \ndisclosure.\n  This is not--and should not be--a partisan issue.\n  The proliferation of abusive tax shelters hurts the entire tax \nsystem. Specifically, it places a greater tax burden on those Americans \nwho are honestly and patriotically paying their fair share of taxes--\nwhether they are republican, democrat, or independent.\n  These shelters undermine the confidence of the American people in the \nfairness of the tax system. Abusive tax shelters place honest corporate \ncompetitors at a disadvantage.\n  And shutting down these abuses presents a great opportunity for \nCongress to restore fairness in the system.\n  We should do no less.\n  Let me take a few moments to discuss the nature of these tax \nshelters. Why they are wrong. And how purportedly reputable companies \nand professional advisors are participating in a disturbing race to the \nbottom.\n  First, what are these tax shelters?\n  Let me give you just one example of a tax shelter.\n  On October 20th, the Finance Committee held a hearing on tax \nshelters. This hearing was a follow-up to a hearing earlier this year \nto review the Committee's investigative report on the collapse of \nEnron.\n  At our hearing last month, we heard how some American corporations \nare purportedly buying and then leasing bridges, dams, subway systems, \nand other infrastructure through corporate tax shelters.\n  It's like the old line: If you think these tax shelter transactions \nare legitimate--or what Congress intended--have I got a bridge to sell \nyou.\n  A former leasing industry executive, who testified before the Finance \nCommittee, described complex transactions where U.S. companies make a \nsingle payment to a municipality to lease a bridge or other public \ninfrastructure. These companies then lease the infrastructure back to \nthe city. All along, the company takes a deduction on its U.S. taxes \nfor the depreciation of the high valued asset.\n  The companies never pay any real lease payments to the cities. And \nthe cities never pay any lease payments to the companies. The cities \nnever risk losing control of the bridge, dam, or subway system.\n  But the companies--who include major banks and Fortune 500 \ncompanies--take millions and millions of dollars in deductions for what \nis essentially a paper transaction. And the American taxpayer is left \nholding the bill.\n  The witness testified: ``[M]uch of the old and new infrastructure \nthroughout Europe has been leased to, and leased back from, American \ncorporations.''\n  In essence, in these transactions, the American people, through their \ntax dollars, are providing these companies a subsidy, part of which the \ncompanies pocket, and part of which they transfer to these cities.\n  As Yale law school Professor Michael Graetz once said, a tax shelter \nis a ``deal done by very smart people, that, absent tax considerations, \nwould be very stupid.''\n  This is nothing more than an unwarranted tax subsidy to U.S. \ncompanies courtesy of honest taxpayers. It is simply wrong. It rewards \na transaction with no real economic substance.\n  This has got to stop. And it is up to Congress and the President to \nput an end to this kind of abuse.\n  So how did this tax shelter industry develop?\n  If there is one thing that we should have learned from the Enron \nscandal, it is the pervasive role of lawyers and accountants.\n  Why did some of the country's leading professional firms devote so \nmuch effort to spinning reported earnings out of nothing? And what does \nthat say about the erosion of ethical standards for accountants and \nlawyers?\n  In 1908, the American Bar Association adopted its first code of \nethics.\n  The preamble to their Model Rules states that a lawyer serves his \nclient, but is also ``an officer of the legal system and a public \ncitizen having special responsibility for the quality of justice.''\n  It also states that a lawyer should ``further the public's \nunderstanding of and confidence in the rule of law and the justice \nsystem because legal institutions in a constitutional democracy depend \non popular participation and support to maintain their authority.''\n  In 1946, the Executive Director of the American Institute of \nAccountants--the predecessor to the American Institute of Certified \nPublic Accountants--stated that:\n\n       The very existence of the accounting profession depends on \n     public confidence in the determination of certified public \n     accountants to safeguard the public interest. This confidence \n     can be maintained only by evidence of both technical \n     competence and moral obligation. One item of evidence is \n     promulgation and enforcement of rules of professional \n     conduct.\n\n  So, why did the legal and accounting profession fail to follow their \nown principles. And, why did they fail to police themselves?\n  Part of the problem stems from the 1990s practices of investment \nbankers and venture capitalists--taking a piece of the deal or a piece \nof the upside performance. This behavior spread into almost every \npublic company.\n  And, following their clients, accountants and lawyers also began \nadopting these practices. Add to this an enormous pressure on company \nexecutives to hit revenue and earnings targets on a quarterly basis.\n  Amidst this obsession with short-term results, no one was left to \nlook after the company's long-term survival.\n  At the same time, lawyers and accountants faced their own profit \npressures as their compensation was tied to their ``book of business'' \nand their success in cross-selling different services to their clients.\n  These cultural conflicts presented a threat to professional values.\n  For auditing firms, traditional professional values mean attesting to \ninvestors and lenders that the company's financial statements are \nproperly prepared and reflect all material issues.\n  The business culture, however, encouraged the auditor to serve \ncompany executives--not only to refrain from pushing back, but also to \naffirmatively help them achieve their personal goals.\n  Furthermore, audit services themselves became more and more of a low-\nprofit business, as audit firms battled each other to gain the inside \naudit position--which could help them market high-profit services. The \nbig money was in selling tax-engineered products.\n  Finally, the private interests of the accounting professional and the \ncorporate executive converged on one kind of activity that has proved \nparticularly toxic--the proprietary financial maneuver that boosted \nreported earnings. That means, manipulate the bottom line of the \nfinancial statements.\n  Such maneuvers satisfied the executives' need to feed the markets and \nkeep stock prices afloat.\n  They also satisfied the accountant's need for generating large \nprofits for their firm and for their own bonus formula.\n  Similarly, for law firms, the traditional professional values are \nassociated with loyalty to the client and advocacy of the client's \ninterests within the bounds of the law.\n  Yet, loyalty to the corporate client and attention to corporate risks \ncame to be sorely tested in many instances.\n  A company executive could well be more interested in getting a deal \ndone--and getting the legal opinion needed to support the accounting \nanalysis--than in gaining an accurate understanding of the legal merits \nof the issue and the associated risks to the company.\n  A law firm might even have its own stake in getting the deal done--\nbecause of a bonus or contingency fee associated with completing the \ndeal--or because of having assisted a promoter in developing the deal.\n  In many accounting and tax schemes, executives simply did not want a \nfrank assessment of legal merits and risks.\n  Instead, what they sought was a professional opinion that would \njustify hiding the true nature of a transaction from readers of \nfinancial reports and tax returns.\n  This was not legal advice on the merits--it was advice that was \nneeded to justify hiding the ball.\n  Clearly, some accounting firms and law firms have abandoned ethics \nfor the big dollar bonus.\n  As an extreme example, there were many people in the Arthur Andersen\n\n[[Page S15818]]\n\nHouston office who knew about the destruction of Enron documents. Not \none appears to have realized that what they were doing was terribly \nwrong. Apparently, not one of these professionals even thought to check \nwith anyone elsewhere in the firm about whether or not what they were \ndoing was wrong.\n  Professional firms also have been all too willing to let themselves \nbe compartmentalized. This way, they could say ``That wasn't my job'' \nwhen things went wrong.\n  Consider the case of prominent law firms that provided tax opinions \nfor investment banks and other promoters to use in selling tax shelter \nproducts.\n  These opinions described the consequences of complicated tax \nmaneuvers--based on the assumption that the future tax shelter \npurchaser would have a valid business purpose. And on the assumption \nthat the transaction would not be tweaked further to reduce financial \nrisk to almost nothing.\n  It may have been true that these firms were asked to provide advice \nbased on those implausible assumptions. But that does not justify \nallowing the firm's professional reputation to be used to market tax \nshelters. The lawyers simply must have known that no purchaser could \nrealistically be expected to supply the critical assumed facts.\n  The Enron case of using tax shelters to generate phantom financial \nearnings also seems to reflect a cycle of ``That wasn't my job'' role-\nplaying.\n  The tax lawyers found a business purpose for the transaction because \nit generated financial earnings.\n  The accountants found financial earnings because the transaction \npromised future tax reductions. It all seems a bit circular.\n  And it all assumes that creating misleading earnings reports is in \nthe real business interest of the corporation. Again, the professionals \nappear to have lost track of who their real client was.\n  Now, what do we need to do about this?\n  Congress and Federal regulators started to address these issues with \nthe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\n  For example, Sarbanes-Oxley calls for lawyers practicing before the \nSEC to report evidence of securities violations ``up the chain'' of \ntheir corporate clients--ultimately to corporate boards.\n  And the Act calls for auditors to report directly to the corporate \nboard's audit committee. And, provide a number of safeguards to assure \nthat audit committees have the independence and autonomy needed to \nrepresent corporate interests and not personal interests.\n  The Sarbanes-Oxley Act also addresses auditor independence in ways \nthat respond to the business pressures that I described earlier.\n  Audit partners cannot be compensated based on cross-selling. Audit \npersonnel must be rotated periodically. And a one-year cooling off \nperiod is required in the case of individuals moving between employment \nat an audit firm and employment at an audit client.\n  Public companies are prohibited from obtaining certain non-audit \nservices from their auditor, and all other non-audit services require \nprior approval of the board's audit committee.\n  But these changes just nibble at the edges of the bigger problem. We \nhave to reign in these lawyers, accountants, and investment bankers who \nare out there manipulating the tax code to come up with tax shelter \nschemes.\n  The tax shelter legislation that Chairman Grassley and I introduce \ntoday goes to the heart of the tax schemes problem.\n  For example, the bill ensures that transactions are done for \nlegitimate business purposes. That means that transactions must have \neconomic substance and are not done merely to avoid taxes.\n  It makes it explicit that achieving a particular kind of financial \naccounting treatment does not provide the needed ``business purpose'' \nto satisfy tax requirements.\n  The bill also provides for stiff penalties that are needed to back up \nTreasury's new shelter disclosure requirements.\n  As a Treasury official pointed out, ``[I]f a promoter is comfortable \nwith selling a transaction. If a practitioner is comfortable with \nadvising that the transaction is proper. And if a taxpayer is \ncomfortable with entering into that transaction. Then they should all \nbe comfortable with the IRS knowing about the transaction.''\n  Our bill also broadens the IRS's ability to enjoin tax shelter \npromoters and allows the agency to impose monetary penalties--in \naddition to suspension or disbarment--on disreputable tax advisors or \ntheir firms.\n  And more may be needed, from both government and the private sector.\n  For one thing, we need to also pass Senator Levin's bill, S. 1767, \nthe Auditor Independence and Tax Shelters Act. I am pleased to be an \noriginal co-sponsor of that legislation. The Auditor Independence and \nTax Shelters Act compliments the legislation that I am introducing \ntoday.\n  Senator Levin's legislation shuts down tax shelter promotion from the \naudit and financial statement side of the equation. Specifically, S. \n1767 would strengthen auditor independence by prohibiting them from \nproviding tax shelter services to their audit clients.\n  The legislation would also reduce potential auditor conflicts of \ninterest by codifying four auditor independence principles to guide the \naudit committees of the Board of Directors of a publicly traded \ncompany, when that committee is required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to \ndecide whether the company may provide certain non-audit services to \nthe corporation.\n  Next, the SEC and the new Public Accounting Oversight Board should \ndevote significant resources to considering ways to improve the clarity \nof the tax footnote in the company's financial statements.\n  They should also undertake a comprehensive review of financial \nreporting of income taxation. These agencies should also ensure that \nthey have tax experts to ensure proper oversight investigations and \nreviews of the financial statement tax disclosures.\n  The IRS should improve the clarity of the already-required \nreconciliation between book and tax earnings on the corporate tax \nreturn--the Schedule M-1.\n  And we need to have better communication and coordination between the \nvarious federal departments and agencies with oversight over lawyers, \naccountants and investment bankers. The Department of Treasury, the \nIRS, the Department of Justice, the SEC, and the Public Accounting \nOversight Board should talk to each other and not fall into the ``it's \nnot my job'' mindset.\n  The Sarbanes-Oxley Act also empowers the Public Company Accounting \nOversight Board to describe new non-audit services that public \ncompanies could not acquire from their auditors, even if they are not \nexplicitly described in the statute as a prohibited service.\n  The Accounting Oversight Board should review the record of SEC \nrulemaking in this area, as well as ongoing business practices, and \ntake action if it is needed to assure the public interest in auditor \nindependence.\n  Finally, professional firms need to cultivate professional cultures. \nThe Enron scandal should serve as a wake-up call to all of us, but \nparticularly the professionals.\n  Law firms and accounting firms must be sure that their members and \nemployees understand the nature of corporate representation and who the \nclient is.\n  Everyone who works at the firm needs to understand that the firm is \ncommitted to integrity and quality. And to understand that the firm's \nleaders will listen and react if legitimate questions arise.\n  Professionals should resist the tendency to avert their eyes to \nobvious issues on the grounds that they are technically someone else's \nresponsibility.\n  In the best traditions of both the accounting and legal professions, \nthe work of the professional must be guided by commitments to \nprofessional duty, fair dealing, and honesty.\n  I hope that the leaders of the accounting and legal professions \nunderstand how important this is, and take the actions needed to give \nnew vitality to these great traditions.\n  Every Spring, Americans sit down at the kitchen table, or at their \nhome computer, and figure out their taxes.\n  With quiet patriotism, these Americans step up and pay their fair \nshare.

Mr. President, I rise today to co-sponsor legislation, \nthe ``Tax Shelter Transparency and Enforcement Act\"to address the \ncontinuing proliferation of tax shelters. This bill reflects tax \nshelter measures that have been passed by the Senate Finance Committee \nin the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Act of 2003, the CARE Act, the JOBS \nAct, and the Energy bill. The full Senate has passed these shelters \nprovisions twice this year.\n  We have known for many years that abusive tax shelters, which are \nstructured to exploit unintended consequences of our complicated \nFederal income tax system, erode the federal tax base and the public's \nconfidence in the tax system. Such transactions are patently unfair to \nthe vast majority of taxpayers who do their best to comply with the \nletter and spirit of the tax law. The Finance Committee produced its \nfirst draft of tax shelter legislation in 1999, and has produced \nseveral subsequent bills, each of which were enhanced to attack new \ndevelopments in abusive tax shelters. The most recent Finance Committee \nbill was the Tax Shelter Transparency Act in May 2002. Today's bill \nbuilds on that 2002 legislation by adding certain corporate governance \nprovisions, the recommendations from the Finance Committee's tax \nshelter investigation of Enron, and a proposal to clarify the judicial \neconomic substance doctrine.\n  The Finance Committee has worked exceedingly hard over many several \nyears to develop a legislative response to tax shelters, and the bill \nwe offer today may not be the final word in that response. Thoughtful \nand well-considered comments on the provisions in this bill have been \ngreatly appreciated by the staff and members of the Finance Committee, \nand will be considered in further refining today's bill, particularly \nwith respect to clarification of the economic substance doctrine.\n  In our ongoing efforts to end tax shelters, we have attacked the \nissue on several fronts. We have introduced numerous measures to end \nspecific shelter abuses as they are discovered. We have offered \nlegislation attacking corporate inversions, individual expatiations, \nand corporate deductions for phony leases of tax-payer funded subways, \nbridges, and water lines. I have pursued public disclosure of the \ndifferences in the income on financial statements reported by public \ncompanies to their shareholders, and the income the company reports to \nthe IRS on its tax return. I have written to the President, Treasury \nand SEC to encourage them to consider this idea.\n  During the Senate's 2002 deliberation of the Sarbanes-Oxley bill, I \nattempted to add an amendment that would have prohibited auditors from \nopining on the financial statement results of tax shelters that they \nhad sold to an audit client. I was blocked in my attempt to offer that \namendment, with several members expressing skepticism about the need \nfor such a measure. I suspect that today, however, few members would \nhave such reservations.\n  On October 21st, 2003, the Senate Finance Committee conducted a \nhearing to determine if tax shelters were a continuing problem. Not \nonly are they continuing, they are now expanding to mid-level companies \nand wealthy individuals, many of whom have been duped into engaging in \nshelter transactions. During our hearing, we heard testimony from \ntaxpayers who relied on reputable tax professionals and accounting \nfirms for sound tax advice, but unknowingly purchased tax shelters that \nwere peddled by those trusted professionals through a web of collusion \nand deception. We also heard from employees of large accounting firms \nand major corporations who testified regarding the pressure exerted on \nthem to bless transactions that, in their professional opinions, would \nconstitute abusive tax shelters. The price for their integrity was the \nloss of their jobs and the ruin of their career. Tax shelter abuse must \nbe stopped for the sake of fairness, the integrity of our tax system, \nand the protection of honest tax professionals.\n  Our years of work on this issue was recently reaffirmed in a hearing \nbefore the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which explored \nabusive shelters that were promoted by purportedly reputable tax \nlawyers and accounting firms. Following that hearing, there has been \nconsiderable discussion of promoting an amendment similar to the one I \noffered in 2002 during the Sarbanes-Oxley debate, and I am appreciative \nof that effort. I hope we are able to construct a measure that can be \nreadily enforced by the Public Accounting Oversight Board and the SEC, \neven though that agency lacks expertise in, or jurisdiction over, \nfederal tax matters.\n  At its core, however, the problem is not an SEC matter, but is a \nproblem of ongoing abuse of the tax code by very smart people doing \nsome very ugly business. The only way to end this problem is to put it \nout in the open. Even the most cynical tax advisor does not want their \ndirty laundry in the public eye, particularly if that public includes \nthe IRS. That is why disclosure of abusive or potentially abusive \ntransactions is so important in solving this problem.\n  The Tax Shelter Transparency and Enforcement Act requires taxpayer \ndisclosure of potentially abusive tax avoidance transactions. It is \nsurprising and unfortunate that taxpayers, though required to disclose \ntax shelter transactions under present law, have refused to comply. The \nTax Shelter Transparency and Enforcement Act will curb non-compliance \nby providing clearer and more objective rules for the reporting of \npotential tax shelters and by providing strong penalties for anyone who \nrefuses to comply with the revised disclosure requirements.\n  The legislation has been carefully structured to reward those who are \nforthcoming with disclosure. I wholeheartedly agree with the remarks \noffered by a former Treasury Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy, that \n``if a taxpayer is comfortable entering into a transaction, a promoter \nis comfortable selling it, and an advisor is comfortable blessing it, \nthey all should be comfortable disclosing it to the IRS.'' Transparency \nis essential to an evaluation by the IRS and ultimately by the Congress \nof the United States as to whether the tax benefits generated by \ncomplex business transactions are appropriate interpretations of \nexisting tax law.\n  It is time to get this bill done. The Finance Committee has worked on \nrooting out tax shelters for nearly five years, and we have debated the \nissue long enough. The time to act is now. I will vigorously pursue \nenactment of an anti-tax shelters bill in the upcoming year. I think we \ncan all take pride in the Senate's consistent action of passing the \nmeasures in today's bill. We must press forward to put a final end to \nthe seemingly endless abuse of tax shelters.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORZINE (for himself, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Lautenberg, and Mr. \n        Reed):\n  S. 1938. A bill to amend the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources \nPlanning Act of 1974 and related laws to strengthen the protection of \nnative biodiversity and ban clearcutting on Federal land, and to \ndesignate certain Federal land as Ancient forests, roadless areas, \nwatershed protection areas, and special areas where logging and other \nintrusive activities are prohibited; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, today along with Senators Schumer, \nLautenberg, and Reed, I am introducing the Act to Save America's \nForests. This important legislation is designed to protect our national \nforests from needless clearcutting, safeguard our roadless areas, and \npreserve the last remaining stands of Ancient forests in this country.\n  There used to be over one billion acres of forest on the land that is \nnow\n\n[[Page S15828]]\n\nthe United States. Over 95 percent of that original forest has been \nlogged, and less than one percent is in a form large enough to support \nall the native plants and animals. This land is under continuous \nthreat, and if we don't act now to protect these Ancient forests we \nmight lose many of them forever.\n  Our national forests also are under attack by clearcutting. Removing \nhuge groups of trees at once creates a blighted landscape, destroys \nwildlife habitats, increases soil erosion, and degrades water quality. \nIn the last ten years, over a quarter-million acres of our national \nforests were clearcut. Clearcutting destroys a vibrant, ecologically \ndiverse natural forest, which is usually replaced, if at all, with a \nsingle species tree farm: tightly packed rows of the most profitable \ntrees. This is forest management focused solely on economics, not \necology. And it is not the way to save America's forests.\n  This bill is a balanced, scientific approach to forest management. It \nbans all logging operations in roadless areas, Ancient forests, and \nforests that have extraordinary biological, scenic, or recreational \nvalues. These are our most fragile ecosystems and need to be protected. \nThis bill also bans clearcutting in our national forests except in \nspecific cases where complete removal of non-native invasive tree \nspecies is ecologically necessary.\n  However, this bill does not ban all logging in our national forests. \nIt allows a method of logging called ``selection management,'' which \ncuts individual trees instead of the whole forest, leaving a healthy, \ndiverse woodland. Selection management is less harmful to the soil, \nless destructive to wildlife, and less disturbing to people who enjoy \nthe scenic beauty of our forests. Selection management can be \nsustainable and profitable, as demonstrated by a number of private \nforests around the country.\n  This legislation emphasizes biodiversity and sustainable management, \nallowing ecologically sound logging practices in some of our national \nforestland and fully protecting the rest. That's why over 600 \nscientists, including Dr. Jane Goodall and Dr. E.O. Wilson, and the \nUnion of Concerned Scientists, support this bill. I am proud to \nintroduce this legislation to protect and restore America's public \nforests, and I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1938\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) Federal agencies that permit clearcutting and other \n     forms of even-age logging operations include the Forest \n     Service, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, and the \n     Bureau of Land Management;\n       (2) clearcutting and other forms of even-age logging \n     operations cause substantial alterations in native \n     biodiversity by--\n       (A) emphasizing the production of a limited number of \n     commercial species, and often only a single species, of trees \n     on each site;\n       (B) manipulating the vegetation toward greater relative \n     density of the commercial species;\n       (C) suppressing competing species; and\n       (D) requiring the planting, on numerous sites, of a \n     commercial strain of the species that reduces the relative \n     diversity of other genetic strains of the species that were \n     traditionally located on the same sites;\n       (3) clearcutting and other forms of even-age logging \n     operations--\n       (A) frequently lead to the death of immobile species and \n     the very young of mobile species of wildlife; and\n       (B) deplete the habitat of deep-forest species of animals, \n     including endangered species and threatened species;\n       (4)(A) clearcutting and other forms of even-age logging \n     operations--\n       (i) expose the soil to direct sunlight and the impact of \n     precipitation;\n       (ii) disrupt the soil surface;\n       (iii) compact organic layers; and\n       (iv) disrupt the run-off restraining capabilities of roots \n     and low-lying vegetation, resulting in soil erosion, the \n     leaching of nutrients, a reduction in the biological content \n     of soil, and the impoverishment of soil; and\n       (B) all of the consequences described in subparagraph (A) \n     have a long-range deleterious effect on all land resources, \n     including timber production;\n       (5) clearcutting and other forms of even-age logging \n     operations aggravate global climate change by--\n       (A) decreasing the capability of the soil to retain carbon; \n     and\n       (B) during the critical periods of felling and site \n     preparation, reducing the capacity of the biomass to process \n     and to store carbon, with a resultant loss of stored carbon \n     to the atmosphere;\n       (6) clearcutting and other forms of even-age logging \n     operations render soil increasingly sensitive to acid \n     deposits by causing a decline of soil wood and coarse woody \n     debris;\n       (7) a decline of solid wood and coarse woody debris reduces \n     the capacity of soil to retain water and nutrients, which in \n     turn increases soil heat and impairs soil's ability to \n     maintain protective carbon compounds on the soil surface;\n       (8) clearcutting and other forms of even-age logging \n     operations result in--\n       (A) increased stream sedimentation and the silting of \n     stream bottoms;\n       (B) a decline in water quality;\n       (C) the impairment of life cycles and spawning processes of \n     aquatic life from benthic organisms to large fish; and\n       (D) as a result of the effects described in subparagraphs \n     (A) through (C), a depletion of the sport and commercial \n     fisheries of the United States;\n       (9) clearcutting and other forms of even-age management of \n     Federal forests disrupt natural disturbance regimes that are \n     critical to ecosystem function;\n       (10) clearcutting and other forms of even-age logging \n     operations increase harmful edge effects, including--\n       (A) blowdowns;\n       (B) invasions by weed species; and\n       (C) heavier losses to predators and competitors;\n       (11) by reducing the number of deep, canopied, variegated, \n     permanent forests, clearcutting and other forms of even-age \n     logging operations--\n       (A) limit areas where the public can satisfy an expanding \n     need for recreation; and\n       (B) decrease the recreational value of land;\n       (12) clearcutting and other forms of even-age logging \n     operations replace forests described in paragraph (11) with a \n     surplus of clearings that grow into relatively impenetrable \n     thickets of saplings, and then into monoculture tree \n     plantations;\n       (13) because of the harmful and, in many cases, \n     irreversible, damage to forest species and forest ecosystems \n     caused by logging of Ancient and roadless forests, \n     clearcutting, and other forms of even-age management, it is \n     important that these practices be halted based on the \n     precautionary principle;\n       (14) human beings depend on native biological resources, \n     including plants, animals, and micro-organisms--\n       (A) for food, medicine, shelter, and other important \n     products; and\n       (B) as a source of intellectual and scientific knowledge, \n     recreation, and aesthetic pleasure;\n       (15) alteration of native biodiversity has serious \n     consequences for human welfare, as the United States \n     irretrievably loses resources for research and agricultural, \n     medicinal, and industrial development;\n       (16) alteration of biodiversity in Federal forests \n     adversely affects the functions of ecosystems and critical \n     ecosystem processes that--\n       (A) moderate climate;\n       (B) govern nutrient cycles and soil conservation and \n     production;\n       (C) control pests and diseases; and\n       (D) degrade wastes and pollutants;\n       (17)(A) clearcutting and other forms of even-age management \n     operations have significant deleterious effects on native \n     biodiversity, by reducing habitat and food for cavity-nesting \n     birds and insectivores such as the 3-toed woodpecker and \n     hairy woodpecker and for neotropical migratory bird species; \n     and\n       (B) the reduction in habitat and food supply could disrupt \n     the lines of dependency among species and their food \n     resources and thereby jeopardize critical ecosystem function, \n     including limiting outbreaks of destructive insect \n     populations; for example--\n       (i) the 3-toed woodpecker requires clumped snags in spruce-\n     fir forests, and 99 percent of its winter diet is composed of \n     insects, primarily spruce beetles; and\n       (ii) a 3-toed woodpecker can consume as much as 26 percent \n     of the brood of an endemic population of spruce bark beetle \n     and reduce brood survival of the population by 70 to 79 \n     percent;\n       (18) the harm of clearcutting and other forms of even-age \n     logging operations on the natural resources of the United \n     States and\n\n[[Page S15829]]\n\n     the quality of life of the people of the United States is \n     substantial, severe, and avoidable;\n       (19) by substituting selection management, as required by \n     this Act, for clearcutting and other forms of even-age \n     logging operations, the Federal agencies involved with those \n     logging operations would substantially reduce devastation to \n     the environment and improve the quality of life of the people \n     of the United States;\n       (20) selection management--\n       (A) retains natural forest structure and function;\n       (B) focuses on long-term rather than short-term management;\n       (C) works with, rather than against, the checks and \n     balances inherent in natural processes; and\n       (D) permits the normal, natural processes in a forest to \n     allow the forest to go through the natural stages of \n     succession to develop a forest with old growth ecological \n     functions;\n       (21) by protecting native biodiversity, as required by this \n     Act, Federal agencies would maintain vital native ecosystems \n     and improve the quality of life of the people of the United \n     States;\n       (22) selection logging--\n       (A) is more job intensive, and therefore provides more \n     employment than clearcutting and other forms of even-age \n     logging operations to manage the same quantity of timber \n     production; and\n       (B) produces higher quality sawlogs than clearcutting and \n     other forms of even-age logging operations; and\n       (23) the judicial remedies available to enforce Federal \n     forest laws are inadequate, and should be strengthened by \n     providing for injunctions, declaratory judgments, statutory \n     damages, and reasonable costs of suit.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to conserve native \n     biodiversity and protect all native ecosystems on all Federal \n     land against losses that result from--\n       (1) clearcutting and other forms of even-age logging \n     operations; and\n       (2) logging in Ancient forests, roadless areas, watershed \n     protection areas, and special areas.\n\n                        TITLE I--LAND MANAGEMENT\n\n     SEC. 101.

A bill to require the President to submit to Congress a \nquarterly report on the projected total cost of United States \noperations in Iraq, including military operations and reconstruction \nefforts, through fiscal year 2008; through fiscal year 2008; to the \nCommittee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I am introducing today a bill that will \nensure that we properly budget for what we are now learning will be a \nlong and costly war in Iraq. This legislation, which requires the \nPresident to submit a report every 90 days on the projected total costs \nof military operations and reconstruction efforts to Iraq is identifcal \nto an amendment I offered to the supplemental appropriations bill to \nOctober. That announcement was agreed to by unanimously consent. \nUnfortunately, it was removed in conference.\n  In recent days, the Administration has finally begun to acknowledge \nwhat Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld wrote in an internal \nmemorandum last month: that Iraq will be a ``long, hard slog.'' This \npast Thursday, November 20, President Bush told us that quote, ``We \ncould have less troops in Iraq, we could have the same number of troops \nin Iraq, we could have more troops in Iraq, whatever is necessary to \nsecure Iraq.'' The following day, the New York Times, citing a ``senior \nArmy officer,'' reported that the Army was planning to keep about \n100,000 troops in Iraq through early 2006.\n  For over a year, this Administration has downplayed the costs of the \nwar in Iraq. Last September, after White House economic advisor \nLawrence Lindsay put the figure at between $100 billion and $200 \nbillion, OMB Director Mitch Daniels insisted that that estimate was, \nquote: ``very, very high.'' Mr. Lindsay, whose candor reportedly cost \nhim his job, was the Administration official to provide anything close \nto a realistic estimate. In December, Director Daniels put the figure \nat $50 billion to $60 billion. A few weeks later, Secretary of Defense \nDonald Rumsfeld told us that the war would cost under $50 billion.\n  As the Administration planned for war, it stopped making any public \nestimates at all. As Deputy Defense Secretary Wolfowitz said in \nFebruary, quote: ``I think it's necessary to preserve some ambiguity of \nexactly where the numbers are.'' Administration officials also insisted \nrepeatedly that Iraq would pay for its own reconstruction. To quote \nDeputy Secretary Wolfowitz again: ``There's a lot of money there, and \nto assume that we're going to pay for it is just wrong.''\n  The Administration failed to include any military or reconstruction \ncosts in its Fiscal Year 2004 budget estimate, and refused to submit to \nCongress a budget amendment. As a result, we passed a budget resolution \nthat included enormous, fiscally irresponsible tax cuts but no money \nfor a war that was already upon us. Even after President Bush had \nissued his ultimatum to Saddam Hussein, the Administration, along with \nmy Republican colleagues, opposed a series of efforts to put aside \nbetween $80 billion and $100 billion for the war. Only the following \nweek, after the budget resolution was passed, did we receive the first \nsupplemental request, for nearly $75 billion, of which nearly $60 \nbillion was for defense and nearly two and a half billion was for the \nreconstruction of Iraq.\n  Even with the war having begun, the Administration continued to \ndownplay the expected costs of reconstruction. On March 27, Deputy \nSecretary Wolfowitz stated, quote: ``We're dealing with a country that \ncan really finance its own reconstruction, and relatively soon.'' And, \non April 10, Secretary Rumsfeld said, quote: ``I don't know that \nthere's much reconstruction to do.''\n  These reassurances were contradicted flatly by outside experts. In \nMarch, a panel led by former Nixon and Ford Secretary of Defense James \nSchlesinger estimated that the cost of postwar reconstruction would be \nat least $20 billion a year. The panel, which included the first \nPresident Bush's ambassador to the United Nations, Thomas Pickering, \nformer Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff John Shalikashvili, and \nformer Reagan U.N. ambassador Jeanne Kirkpatrick, concluded that \nPresident Bush had failed, quote: ``to fully describe to Congress and \nthe American people the magnitude of the resources that will be \nrequired to meet the post-conflict needs'' of Iraq.\n  But the Administration continued to insist otherwise. In April, USAID \nAdministrator Andrew Natsios was asked whether the Administration was \nsticking to its estimate of total costs. He responded, quote: ``That is \nour plan and that is our intention. And these figures, outlandish \nfigures I've seen, I have to say, there a little bit of hoopla involved \nin this. Three months later, OMB Director Josh Bolton promised, quote: \n``We don't anticipate requesting anything additional for the balance of \nthe year.''\n\n  Then we got the bill: a second supplemental request for $87 billion, \nof which more than $20 billion was for the reconstruction of Iraq.\n  This war--which I opposed--has been far more costly to the American \ntaxpayer than was necessary. The Administration's blind assumption that \nwe would be greeted as liberators has resulted in unnecessary costs. \nThe failure to prevent looting, for example, or to anticipate sabotage, \nhas made reconstruction more expensive than the Administration \npromised.\n  The Bush Administration's unilateral approach to the war has also \ncost U.S. taxpayers. It is worth remembering that while the first \nPersian Gulf War cost more than $61 billion, our allies paid for all \nbut $4.7 billion. Had President Bush managed to enlist more of our \nfriends and allies in this effort, the American taxpayer would not be \nfooting this enormous bill practically alone.\n  We are also paying for the vast majority of reconstruction costs, and \nmay be paying more in the future. The World Bank has estimated Iraq's \nreconstruction costs to be $56 billion. Iraq also has $120 billion in \ndebts that have not yet been restructured. Outside contributions have \nbeen relatively meager. The recent donors' conference in Madrid \nproduced pledges of $13 billion, but two thirds of that amount was in \nthe form of loans. As for Iraqi oil, next year's revenues will be used \nentirely for government operations, leaving nothing for reconstruction.\n  It is long past time for the Administration to be more forthcoming \nabout the future costs of operations in Iraq. Right now, the only \nestimates come from outside sources, such as the Congressional Budget \nOffice, which earlier this month estimated that with 67,000 to 106,000 \nmilitary personnel in Iraq, the annual cost of the occupation would be \nbetween $14 billion and $19 billion. Given recent revelations about the \nArmy's current planning, we might now expect those upper range costs, \nat least through 2006. And even these figures seem low considering that \nwe are now spending in Iraq at the rate of $4 billion a month, which \nwould translate into $48 billion per year.\n  We cannot continue to play guessing games with the war in Iraq, our \nnational defense, or our children's future. The Congressional Budget \nOffice has estimated the Fiscal Year 2004 ``on-budget deficit'' to be \n$644 billion. We have serious domestic needs in everything from health \ncare, to education, to the environment. We are not adequately \nprotecting ourselves against terrorism, denying our first responders\n\n[[Page S15838]]\n\nthe resources they need and leaving critical infrastructure such as \nchemical facilities unguarded. We are underfunding veterans' benefits \nat a time when thousands of new veterans are returning home from Iraq \nwounded and disabled. And we are overstretching our troops and may have \nto consider a significant increase in end-strength. All of these \npriorities are put at risk so long as we fail to budget for future \ncosts of the war and occupation in Iraq.\n  The Senate clearly recognized the seriousness of this problem when it \nagreed unanimously last month to this legislation. There is simply no \nreason why we should not expect the Administration to plan for the \nfuture costs of the occupation of Iraq, to budget accordingly, and to \nkeep Congress and the American people informed.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1942\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Future Iraq Costs Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REPORT ON PROJECTED TOTAL COST OF UNITED STATES \n                   OPERATIONS IN IRAQ.\n\n       (a) Quarterly Report.--Not later than 30 days after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, and every 90 days \n     thereafter, the President shall submit to each Member of \n     Congress a report on the projected total cost of United \n     States operations in Iraq, including military operations and \n     reconstruction efforts, through fiscal year 2008.\n       (b) Explanation of Changes in Projected Cost.--The \n     President shall include in each report submitted under \n     subsection (a) after the initial report under that subsection \n     an explanation for any change in the total projected total \n     cost of United States operations in Iraq from the projected \n     total cost of such operations stated in the preceding report.\n       (c) Termination of Reporting Requirement in Fiscal Year \n     2008.--No report is required under this section after \n     December 31, 2007.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ENSIGN (for himself, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Coleman, \n        Mr. Graham of South Carolina, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Reid, Mr. Bayh, \n        Mr. Edwards, Mr. Allard, Mr. Smith, Mr. Allen, and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 1944. A bill to enhance peace between the Israelis and \nPalestinians; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, a lot has changed in the climate of the \nMiddle East since I was there in 1995, but unfortunately not enough has \nchanged.\n  In 1995, the Oslo Accords were signed and suicide bombers detonated \nthemselves on buses around Jerusalem. Eight years later, Israelis \ncontinue to face the daily threat of terrorism on their buses, in their \ngrocery stores, in their restaurants, and in their cafes. For them, \nevery single day is September 11. It's hard to imagine that kind of \nreality and the strength it takes to continue each day not knowing \nwhere the next attack will occur.\n  I think about September 11 here in the United States, and the shock \nmany Americans felt--not just at the terrible loss of life, but the \nfact that terrorists had targeted our people here in our own country--\nwhere they live and work. I remember one commentator back then said--\ntoday, every American learned what it is like to be an Israeli.\n  We came together as a nation to comfort each other, but also to do \nwhatever we could to prevent another attack on our soil and to \neliminate the world of the evil terrorists who had targeted our \ninnocent victims. In those moments and days that followed, leaders from \naround the world called to express their condolences. There were no \ncalls to the United States to show restraint in responding to the \nterrorists. And it there were, they would have fallen on deaf ears. The \nworld knew that President Bush and the United States would do whatever \nit took to keep our citizens safe. The security of our nation would \nalways be our priority.\n  But when September 11 happens on a daily basis in Israel, the calls \nthey get are not to express sympathy, but to urge restraint in \nresponding to the attack. Not only is Israel criticized for doing \nexactly what the United States has done--respond to attacks against its \ncitizens by going after the terrorists where they hide--Israel is even \ncriticized for taking steps to secure its homeland security and prevent \nfurther attacks.\n  So where do we go from here?\n  Well, the legislation I am introducing with my colleagues, the junior \nSenator from Florida, focuses on the fact that Israel has a right to \nmake the security of their country a priority and that such security is \na major and enduring national security interest of the United States.\n  The bipartisan Israeli-Palestinian Peace Enhancement Act of 2003 \ncontains strong, unequivocal expressions of the Senate's support for \nthe President's June 24, 2002, speech and the vision of two states \nliving side-by-side in peace and security.\n  However, it expresses the Senate's expectation that the Palestinian \nAuthority must meet certain conditions before a Palestinian state is \nrecognized, including: a leadership not compromised by terrorism; a \nfirm commitment to peace with Israel; the dismantling of terrorist \ninfrastructures in the West Bank and Gaza; sustained security \ncooperation with Israel; and an end to anti-Israel incitement.\n   It provides concrete, positive incentives for the Palestinians to \nachieve the reforms called for by President Bush and a negotiated peace \nwith Israel by authorizing significant United States assistance, and a \ncommitment to organize international assistance, to build the new state \nwhen it comes into being and has been recognized by the United States \nand Israel--conditions that can only occur in the absence of terrorism.\n   Ambiguous promises of non-aggression are not enough. Lasting peace \nmeans the absence of terror. Without legitimate guarantees for the \nsecurity of the state of Israel, there can be no lasting peace in the \nregion.\n   Words are cheap--and nowhere are they cheaper than in the Middle \nEast. Until there is Palestinian leadership that is committed to \neliminating the terrorist infrastructure, that is serious about making \npeace with Israel, and that envisions two states existing together, \npeace will not be known.\n   Who can we trust to support Israel in this hour of crisis?\n   Well, I believe we can trust President Bush. Particularly after \nSeptember 11, the President understands thee can be no peace without \nsecurity. He made that clear on June 24, 2002, when he gave an address \nin the Rose Garden that went above and beyond any other official United \nStates position on the Middle East. He made clear that unless and until \nIsrael has a trustworthy partner on the Palestinian side, there can be \nno lasting peace. And he emphasized that a Palestinian state could \nbecome a reality only after new leaders--not compromised by terror--\nwere elected and a practicing democracy, based on tolerance and liberty \nwas built.\n   That statement should be the road map to peace. That is why we have \ntaken the principles the President laid out in his June 24 speech, and \nturned them into legislation.\n   In closing, I would like to thank the original cosponsors of the \nIsraeli-Palestinian Peace Enhancement Act of 2003, including Senator \nBill Nelson, Senator Coleman, Senator Lindsey Graham, Senator Crapo, \nSenator Reid, Senator Bayh, Senator Edwards, Senator Allard, Senator \nGordon Smith, Senator Allen, and Senator Boxer for joining me in \nworking toward a lasting and true peace in the Middle East.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORZINE:\n  S. 1946. A bill to establish an independent national commission to \nexamine and evaluate the collection, analysis, reporting, use, and \ndissemination of intelligence related to Iraq and Operation Iraqi \nFreedom; to the Select Committee on Intelligence.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I am introducing today a bill to \nestablish an independent, bipartisan commission to examine intelligence \nissues related to Iraq. This commission is necessary because what we \nhave discovered on the ground in Iraq has shown our intelligence to be \nwrong. It is necessary because Administration officials misused \nintelligence--that is, they made public statements and submitted \nreports to Congress that the Administration knew at the time to be \nunsupported by the available intelligence. And it is necessary because \ninaccurate and misused intelligence played a role in leading us to war.\n\n[[Page S15839]]\n\n  Accurate, objective, and credible intelligence is a fundamental \ncornerstone of our national security, particularly in an age of shadowy \nterrorist networks and clandestine weapons programs. Unless we improve \nour intelligence, we risk failing to identify serious threats to the \nUnited States and being distracted by lesser dangers at the expense of \nlarger and more urgent security concerns.\n  This effort must include not only the collection and analysis of \nintelligence, but the use, reporting, and dissemination of intelligence \nassessments. If the American people are asked to go to war to preempt \nan attack, or--as in the case of Iraq--to prevent a possible future \nthreat from emerging, it is critical that the public statements of our \nofficials be supported by the available intelligence. If members of \nCongress are to consider authorizing the use of force, particularly \nagainst countries that have not attacked the United States, they must \nbe provided with honest and complete intelligence. And if our allies \nare to be asked to join us in confronting these threats, the \nintelligence that we share with them and that we rely on to bolster our \ncase must be credible in the eyes of the world.\n  I first proposed an independent commission to examine intelligence \nrelated to Iraq last summer, when it became clear that President Bush \nhad made an important but unsubstantiated claim in his January 2002 \nState of the Union address. That claim was, quote: ``The British \ngovernment has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant \nquantities of uranium from Africa.''\n  Although this statement has been dismissed as the ``16 words,'' its \nsignificant cannot be overstated. The State of the Union address is the \nmost important, the most scrutinized speech the President delivers. The \nstatement concerned the most important topic a President can discuss--\nwhether to send Americans to war. And this claim was the most important \nelement of the President's argument for war: that there was evidence \nthat Saddam Hussein might have the necessary materials to produce a \nnuclear bomb. As for the reference to the British government, it is \nhard to imagine how the use of the word ``learned'' could imply \nanything other than that the United States independently believed that \nthe claim was true.\n\n  It turns out that the Bush Administration had ample reason to know at \nthe time that what the President was telling the nation could not be \nsubstantiated. The CIA had sought to dissuade the White House from \nmaking claims about uranium purchases. And on February 5, a week after \nthe State of the Union address, Secretary of State Powell made a \npresentation to the Untied Nations in which he omitted the claim \nprecisely because it was not supported by the available intelligence.\n  Despite this knowledge, the Administration never issued a \nclarification. As a result, the President's statement stood, as an \nimportant element of the Administration's case for war. Only last \nsummer, after Americans learned from Ambassador Joe Wilson and others \nwhat Administration officials knew at the time, did the Administration \nacknowledge that the uranium allegation should never have been included \nin the State of the Union Address.\n  The case generated outrage across party lines. Republicans as well as \nDemocrats expressed serious concern about the credibility of the \nAdministration and the country. They stressed that cabinet members, the \nvice president, and the entire administration are responsible for \nhonestly representing intelligence. They called for someone in the \nAdministration to be held accountable. The Senate passed a resolution \nby voice vote. The chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee \npromised to undertake a, quote ``very aggressive review.'' And the Bush \nAdministration insisted that it would cooperate. As White House \nspokesman Ari Fleischer stated on June 11, quote: ``The Administration \nwelcomes the review. It's important.''\n  In July, when I first sought to establish this commission, there was \nno dispute that the use of intelligence, as well as the collection and \nanalysis of intelligence, should be examined. Republicans who voted \nagainst the commission did so, they said, because the commission would \nintrude on the jurisdiction of the Intelligence Committee. I was, and \nremain supportive of efforts by the committee to look into the use of \nintelligence related to Iraq, an inquiry that is clearly included \nwithin the committee's jurisdiction. But it was and is my belief that \nan independent, bipartisan commission, building on the findings of \nCongressional and other investigations, could undertake the most \nthorough, depoliticized review possible.\n  Now, however, it seems an independent commission is the only \nremaining means left to examine the use, or misuse, of intelligence. On \nNovember 13, the Chairman of the Intelligence Committee announced that \nthere would be no examination of how intelligence was used by \npolicymakers. I deeply regret this decision by the chairman and \nfervently hope the committee will ultimately exercise its role, \nestablished in the resolution laying out its jurisdiction, \nin overseeing the, quote: ``use or dissemination'' of intelligence. In \nthe meantime, I would expect that an independent commission would \nreceive strong bipartisan support.\n\n   It is now beyond question that our intelligence on Iraq was \ninaccurate. After months of searching, investigative teams have yet to \nfind stockpiles of chemical or biological weapons. David Kay, who heads \nup the Iraqi Survey Group, has stated that Iraq's nuclear program was \nonly at the, quote: ``very most rudimentary level.'' The Administration \nhas yet to produce evidence of the high-level ties between Iraq and al \nQaeda that it warned of prior to the war. And now, tragically, we must \nadd to the list of intelligence failures the inability to anticipate \nthe current resistance to U.S. occupation. Clearly, the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding these failings warrant a detailed and \nsystematic review.\n   But what of the use of intelligence? As important as the State of \nthe Union address was, that speech was only part of a larger case made \nby the Administration for war. Administration officials made many \nclaims--particularly those related to chemical and biological weapons--\nthat were expressed in terms that were more specific and more certain \nthan the intelligence may have supported. Most troubling, however, were \nthe highly dubious assessments and suggestions related to nuclear \nprograms and terrorism with which the Administration built its most \npowerful and emotionally potent argument. That argument had three \nelements: 1. That Iraq had a nuclear weapons program, and possibly even \na nuclear weapon; 2. that Saddam Hussein was allied with al Qaeda, and \nthat he may have been involved with the terrorist attacks of September \n11; and 3. that the threat was imminent.\n   The Administration began to make its argument in the summer of 2002. \nAs vice President Cheney stated in an August 26 speech, quote: ``Simply \nstated, there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass \ndestruction.'' In an indication of how Administration officials would \nmake their case over the next seven months, the vice president insisted \nthat the intelligence indicated no doubt, no internal disagreement, and \nno uncertainty.\n   Then, on September 12, President bush, in his speech to the United \nNations, went further, stating, quote: ``right now, Iraq is expanding \nand improving facilities that were used for the production of \nbiological weapons.'' the President also made two statements regarding \nIraq's alleged nuclear program. The first was that Iraq had made, \nquote: ``several attempts to buy high-strength aluminum tubes used to \nenrich uranium for a nuclear weapon.'' He failed to mention that \nneither the Department of Energy nor the Department of State's Bureau \nof Intelligence and Research believed that the tubes were intended for \nthat purpose. The President's second statement added the missing \ningredient: the uranium itself. As the President stated, quote: \n``Should Iraq acquire fissile material, it would be able to build a \nnuclear weapon within year.'' This was the context for the President's \nclaim made in the State of the Union address that Iraq had sought to \npurchase uranium from Africa.\n\n  The Administration continued making its case throughout the fall of \n2002, adding claims concerning ties between Saddam Hussein and al \nQaeda. One of many examples was Secretary Rumsfeld's September 26 \nstatement that the\n\n[[Page S15840]]\n\nAdministration had, quote: ``very reliable reporting of senior level \ncontacts going back a decade.''\n  As Congress deliberated whether to authorize the use of force against \nIraq, the Administration officials made increasingly alarming \nstatements about Iraq's ties to al Qaeda and about its nuclear weapons \nprogram. On October 7, three days before the vote in the House of \nRepresentatives and four days before the vote in the Senate, President \nBush gave a speech in which he said, unequivocally, that, quote: ``We \nknow that Iraq and al Qaeda have had high-level contacts that go back a \ndecade,'' and, quote: ``The evidence indicates the Iraq is \nreconstituting its nuclear weapons program.'' He repeated the \nallegations about uranium tubes and the warning about purchases of \nuranium. Then the President put it all together--the implication that \nIraq was connected to the September 11 attacks, the implication that \nIraq could have a nuclear bomb at any time, and the warning that Saddam \nHussein could decide on any day to explode a nuclear bomb in the United \nStates. Here is what the President said: ``Why do we need to confront \nit [Saddam] now? And there's a reason. We've experienced the horror of \nSeptember the 11th. We have seen that those who hate America are \nwilling to crash airplanes into buildings full of innocent people. Our \nenemies would be no less willing, in fact, they would be eager, to use \nbiological or chemical, or a nuclear weapon. Knowing these realities, \nAmerica must not ignore the threat gathering against us. Facing clear \nevidence of peril, we cannot wait for the final proof--the smoking \ngun--that could come in the form of a mushroom cloud.''\n  This was the most powerful, dire, and convincing warning a President \ncould give. And it was based on one inference that the President has \nacknowledged he never had any evidence of, that Saddam was tied to \nSeptember 11, and another which had already been refuted by many within \nthe Administration, that Iraq was reconstituting its nuclear program.\n  Later statements included Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld's claims to \nspecific knowledge of the whereabouts and movements of biological \nand chemical weapons. On March 11, he stated, quote: ``We know he \ncontinues to hide biological and chemical weapons, moving them to \ndifferent locations as often as every 12 to 24 hours, and placing them \nin residential neighborhoods.'' On March 30, he said, quote: ``We know \nwhere they are. They're in the area around Tikrit and Baghdad and east, \nwest, south and north somewhat.''\n\n  The Administration also continued to insist that the threat was \nimminent--a claim that served to counter arguments that the United \nNations should be given more time. On February 6, the day after \nSecretary of State Powell made his presentation to the UN, Secretary of \nDefense Rumsfeld made an appeal for immediate action. ``Why now?'' he \nasked. ``The answer is that every week that goes by, his weapons of \nmass destruction programs become more mature.'' That same day, Deputy \nSecretary Wolfowitz stated, quote: ``Connections with terrorists, which \ngo back decades, and which started some 10 years ago with al Qaeda, are \ngrowing every day.''\n  Finally, on March 16, the day before President Bush's ultimatum to \nSaddam Hussein, Vice President Cheney went beyond claims that Iraq had \nthe intent to produce nuclear weapons, and even beyond the claims that \nIraq was seeking centrifuge equipment or uranium. Rather, the vice \npresident stated flatly, quote: ``We believe he has, in fact, \nreconstituted nuclear weapons.'' This assertion, which the vice \npresident has recently acknowledged was a misstatement, was not \ncorrected. Instead, it was allowed to stand as nearly the final word on \nwhy we were going to war.\n  Questions surrounding the Administration's use of intelligence extend \nbeyond public statements, to include reports to and testimony before \nCongress. One example of unsubstantiated reporting was the January 20 \nreport to Congress, mandated by the use of force resolution, that cited \nIraq's failure to declare its, quote: ``attempts to acquire uranium and \nthe means to enrich it''--the same unsubstantiated claim made in the \nPresident's State of the Union address.\n  This commission would be authorized to examine other intelligence \nissues related to Iraq, as well. The Administration made claims related \nto weapons delivery systems, including President Bush's assertion on \nOctober 7 that, quote: ``Iraq has a growing fleet of manned and \nunmanned aerial vehicles that could be used to disperse chemical or \nbiological weapons across broad areas,'' and that Iraq could use them \nfor, quote: ``missions targeting the United States.'' There has never \nbeen evidence that Iraq had UAVs with ranges of thousands of miles.\n  Administration officials made claims related to the occupation, \nincluding Vice President Cheney's March 16 assertion that, quote: ``I \nreally do believe that we will be greeted as liberators,'' and Deputy \nDefense Secretary Wolfowitz's November 17 analogy to, quote: ``post-\nliberation France.''\n\n  The Administration also downplayed the costs of the occupation. \nDespite White House economic advisor Lawrence Lindsey's estimate that \nthe occupation would cost between $100 and $200 billion--an estimate \nfor which he was apparently fired--Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld on \nJanuary 19 put the figure at, quote: ``something under $50 billion,'' \nOn February 27, Deputy Defense Secretary Wolfowitiz stated that, quote: \n``there's a lot of money there, and to assume that we're going to pay \nfor it is just wrong.'' And, on March 27, Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz \nstated, quote: ``We're dealing with a country that can really finance \nits own reconstruction, and relatively soon.''\n  The independent commission I propose would be authorized to examine \nthe relationship between policy makers and the intelligence community. \nWere members of the intelligence community pressured to produce \nanalyses that conformed to the Administration's policies? Did \nAdministration officials seek to bypass the normal analysis process by \ncherry-picking bits of intelligence that suited their agenda, through \nthe Office of Special Plans in the Department of Defense or through \nother special or ad hoc arrangements? Did the Administration base its \nanalyses on foreign intelligence sources of dubious credibility? These \nquestions must be answered, and corrective measures undertaken, if our \nintelligence community is to be as effective and objective as we need \nit to be.\n  Perhaps the most egregious undermining, indeed betrayal, of the \nintelligence community was the identification by senior Administration \nofficials of a covert CIA operative. The operative is the spouse of a \nperson who has been called a national hero by President George H.W. \nBush but who questioned the current Administration's statements \nregarding Iraq. The leak of this operative's identity sent an implicit \nwarning to others in the intelligence community who might disagree with \nthe Administration's positions. It potentially endanged the life of the \noperative and those with whom the operative worked. And it rendered the \noperative's skills, experience and sources permanently useless, thus \nwasting precisely the kind of intelligence asset that the United States \nso desperately needs right now.\n  The purpose of this commission is to identify ways in which we can \nlearn from past mistakes and thus improve our collection, analysis, \nreporting, use and dissemination of intelligence. The commission's \nmembers, who will come from both parties, will be prominent Americans \nwith experience in intelligence, the armed forces and other relevant \nareas. Their work will build on relevant Congressional and other \ninvestigations.\n   The commission, through an objective, independent, highly \nprofessional examination process, will help depoliticize an extremely \ncomplicated and sensitive topic. By reviewing intelligence related to \nIraq beginning in 1998, it will draw conclusions about the use of \nintelligence by a Democratic as well as Republican Administration. And \nby reporting its recommendations directly to the President and to \nCongress, it will serve as a valuable resource outside the context of \nopen political debate. In this respect, I disagree with the Chairman of \nthe Intelligence Committee who has stated that the full Congress and \nthe public could ``decide for themselves whether the intelligence was \naccurately represented by government officials.''\n   This issue is far too serious to simply ignore. Over one hundred \nthousand brave Americans are currently serving\n\n[[Page S15841]]\n\nin Iraq, facing challenges that require accurate and objective \nintelligence. We have an obligation to pursue every opportunity to \nimprove that intelligence. Meanwhile, the United States faces other \nthreats--from despotic regimes with nuclear, chemical, or biological \nweapons, from terrorism, and from the horrible possibility that \nterrorists could acquire these weapons. Our ability to confront these \nthreats requires that our intelligence be accurate and objective. And, \nas we seek to enlist our friends and allies in our efforts to address \nthese common threats, we must ensure that our intelligence is credible.\n   Unless we identify and correct the mistakes of the past, we will not \nbe safer.\n   I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n   There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1946\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish The Return of Talent Program to allow \naliens who are legally present in the United States to return \ntemporarily to the country of citizenship of the alien if that country \nis engaged in post-conflict reconstruction, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, one of the greatest challenges we face \ntoday is how to address the needs of failed states--or countries that \nare on the verge of becoming failed states--and how to rebuild post-\nconflict countries. It is a critical issue, and one that we cannot \nafford to get wrong--for the sake of the people living in those \nnations, and for the sake of our own security.\n  Last January, a bipartisan commission organized by the Center for \nStrategic and International Studies and the Association of the U.S. \nArmy found to no one's surprise that ``failed states matter--for \nnational security as well as for humanitarian reasons. If left to their \nown devices, such states can become sanctuaries for terrorist networks, \norganized crime and drug traffickers, as well as posing grave \nhumanitarian challenges and threats to regional stability.''\n  The most obvious case in point is the reconstruction of Iraq. I've \nspent many hours on this floor making clear that we have to get it \nright in Iraq. And in addition to Iraq, unfortunately, we can talk \nabout many other states that are either unstable, or are tenuously \nrecovering from past conflicts including Liberia, Afghanistan, East \nTimor, Kosovo, Bosnia, Haiti, and Somalia. We need comprehensive \nstrategies to address the many needs in rebuilding all of these \nstruggling countries.\n  A significant component of reconstruction, in my view, is to tap into \nthe store of human as well as financial resources here in the United \nStates. We should allow, and indeed encourage, immigrants from post-\nconflict countries to use their skills, talents,and knowledge to be \npart of the efforts to rebuild. In fact, the diaspora presents one of \nthe best collective resources that exists: these people know the \ncommunities. They know the culture. They know the language--more than \nany contractors, more than any humanitarian workers from the outside, \nno matter how well-trained, no matter how much expertise they may have.\n  So today, Mr. President, I am introducing legislation creating a visa \n``Return of Talent'' program.\n  The idea is simple: a Return of Talent program would allow legal \nimmigrants in the United States to return home to help with \nreconstruction. ``Legal Permanent Residents'' will be able to return \ntemporarily to their countries after a conflict to help rebuild, \nwithout their time out of the United States affecting their ability to \nmeet their requirements for U.S. citizenship.\n  Under current law, a Legal Permanent Resident who want to apply for \nU.S. citizenship is required to be physically present in the United \nStates for at least half of the five years immediately preceding the \ndate of filing the naturalization application.\n  This residency requirement could be particularly difficult to meet \nfor those who may have family and friends at home who are in desperate \nneed of help. We should not stand in their way of going home, holding \nover them their hope for citizenship here in the United States. We \nshould be helping them bring their talent and expertise home, helping \nthem help their country of origin at a time of greatest need.\n  Recent press articles have highlighted stories of such indivduals--\nengineers, bankers, teachers and translators--who are willing to \ncontribute to reconstruction efforts. They simply cannot do so without \njeopardizing their immigration status.\n  This legislation would encourage those skilled and committed \nindividuals to return to their countries of origin to revive the \nbusiness, industry, agriculture, education and other sectors that have \nbeen weakened or destroyed after years of conflict.\n  The Return of Talent program would include any individual who \ndemonstrates an ability and willingness to make a material contribution \nto the post-conflict reconstruction in their countries of origin.\n  The program would apply to immigrants from countries where U.S. armed \nforces are, or have engaged in the past ten years, in armed conflict or \npeacekeeping, or to immigrants who are from countries where the United \nNations Security Council has authorized peacekeeping operations in the \npast ten years.\n  Estimates of individuals who could participate in this program are \nrelatively low. For example, the United States admitted 1,764 Afghani \nand 5,196 Iraqi immigrants in 2002, and similar levels since 1992, who \nare not Legal Permanent Residents eligible to pursue U.S. citizenship. \nYet, while the program would have a small impact on the U.S. \nnaturalization process, the contributions of even a few hundred \nindividuals could have a tremendous positive effect on post-conflict \nreconstruction work.\n  In simple terms, a Return of Talent program makes sense. Everybody \nwins: The United States is able to support rebuilding efforts; \nimmigrants are able to use their skills and resources to help rebuild \ntheir communities without jeopardizing their immigration status; and \npost-conflict countries, and the people in them, receive much-needed \nassistance.\n  We have not done enough in Iraq, Afghanistan and many other countries \nthat are--or are on the verge of becoming--failed states. As the \n``Winning the Peace'' report also states, ``Despite over a decade of \nrecent experience in trying to address the challenges of . . . \nrebuilding countries following conflict, U.S. capacity of addressing \nthese challenges remains woefully inadequate.''\n\n[[Page S15844]]\n\n  A Return of Talent program is an important piece of our overall \nstrategy to stabilize and rebuild countries torn by conflict. I urge my \ncolleagues to support his legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord as follows:\n\n                                S. 1949\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Such lands are, \n     therefore, appropriate for transfer to the cabin owners in \n     exchange for lands that will have higher public use values.\n       (4) In return for the privatization of such encumbered \n     lands the Secretary of Agriculture has been offered \n     approximately 495 acres of non-Federal land (known as the Q \n     Ranch) within the Tonto National Forest, east of Young, \n     Arizona, in an area where the Secretary has completed \n     previous land exchanges to consolidate public ownership of \n     National Forest lands.\n       (5) The acquisition of the Q Ranch non-Federal lands by the \n     Secretary will greatly increase National Forest management \n     efficiency and promote public access, use, and enjoyment of \n     the area and surrounding National Forest System lands.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to authorize, \n     direct, facilitate, and expedite the consummation of the land \n     exchanges set forth herein in accordance with the terms and \n     conditions of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 2.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       [(a) Findings.--The Congress finds that:\n       [(1) Dr. Carter G.

Woodson \n     Home dated June 2002, found that the Carter G. Woodson Home \n     is suitable for designation as a unit of the National Park \n     System, and is feasible for designation so long as property \n     adjacent to the home is available for National Park Service \n     administrative, curatorial, access, and visitor \n     interpretative needs.\n       [(7) Establishment of the Carter G.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. 1947, which was introduced \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1947) to prohibit the offer of credit by a \n     financial institution to a financial institution examiner, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to join my friend and distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Leahy, in the introduction of the Preserving \nIndependence of Financial Institution Examiners Act of 2003. This bill \nmodifies two criminal statutes, sections 212 and 213 of title 18 of the \nUnited States Code, which impose criminal penalties on bank examiners \nwho are offered, or who accept, a loan or gratuity from a financial \ninstitution they are examining. These revisions are needed to reflect \nthe changes in our national banking system.\n  When originally enacted, the criminal statutes were designed to \nensure that bank examiners were not subjected to undue and improper \ninfluences from the subject banks. With the increased consolidation and \nglobalization of the banking industry, it is difficult in today's \nbanking economy for examiners, particularly those who examine credit \ncard banks, to obtain nationally available credit cards. The statutes, \nwhich were originally enacted in 1948, include no exception for \nroutine, ordinary business transactions that were never intended to \nfall within the ambit of the statutes. The proposed legislation \nprovides an exception to the statutes for bank examiners who hold \neveryday credit cards and residential home mortgage loans from the \nbanks they are examining. The exceptions are narrow and the purposes of \nthe statutes to prohibit such conflicts of interest will remain intact.\n  I want to thank Senator Leahy for his willingness to address this \nproblem. I urge my colleagues to support this measure and quickly pass \nit.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today's passage of the Preserving \nIndependence of Financial Examinations Act of 2003 is an example of \nsolid, efficient bipartisan work on a needed legislative reform. I am \npleased to have seen its passage so swiftly through the U.S. Senate and \nI thank my friend from Utah, Senator Hatch, for his assistance and \nadvice.\n  The bill provides a logical and necessary modification to important, \nbut outdated, criminal statutes originally written to ensure the \nobjectivity and integrity of financial institution examinations. \nSections 212 and 213 of title 18 of the United States Code, first \ndrafted in 1948, appropriately provide criminal penalties for bank \nexaminers who are offered, or who accept, a loan or gratuity from the \nfinancial institution they are examining. This bill exempts from the \nlaw's reach ordinary credit card and residential home mortgage loans \nsought and held by bank examiners in their everyday lives.\n  Several factors supported the proposed blanket credit card and \nresidential loan exceptions. Most important, consolidation within the \nbanking industry made it increasingly difficult for examiners to obtain \nnationally available credit cards and mortgage loans and for the \nbanking agencies to assign examiners to work.\n  The Leahy-Hatch bill strictly defines the circumstances under which \nthe exceptions to the criminal statute apply with a keen eye on \npreserving the independence of financial institution examinations and \nthe original legislative intent of the statute.\n  I thank Senator Hatch for his assistance in this bill forward and \nmaking it possible for bank examiners to engage in arms-length and \nroutine business transactions without fear of prosecution. I also thank \nour friends in the banking agencies, including the Federal Reserve \nBank, the Office of Thrift Supervision and the Federal Deposit \nInsurance Corporation for bringing this important issue to our \nattention.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that the \nbill be read three times and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, with no intervening action or debate; and that any \nstatements relating to this measure be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 1947) was read the third time and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1947\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Banking \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of S. 811 and the \nSenate now proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 811) to support certain housing proposals in the \n     fiscal year 2003 budget for the Federal Government, including \n     the downpayment assistance initiative under the HOME \n     Investment Partnership Act, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, we spend a lot of time talking about \nhomeownership, both in the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs \nCommittee and back in our States. I want to spend just a moment \nreminding everyone why some of us put so much effort into achieving \nthis very important goal for so may American families.\n  Homeownership is an asset-building engine for families and \nneighborhoods, indeed for society as a whole. When a family buys a \nhome, they are buying more than bricks and mortar. They are buying into \na community. With each homeowner, we create another anchor in a \nneighborhood, another advocate for better schools, safer streets, and \nsmall business development.\n  Expanding homeownership, particularly in struggling areas, will help \nreplace the vicious cycle of decline that we see in some neighborhoods \nwith a virtuous cycle of wealth accumulation and economic growth. Once \nyou own a home, you are able to build equity, equity that can be used \nto send your children to college, finance your retirement, and serve as \na needed reserve to protect against emergencies.\n  Increasing homeownership, and especially minority homeownership, has \nlong been a national goal. In fact, the Joint Center for Housing \nStudies at Harvard points out that the 1990s was a period of \nsignificant growth in minority homeownership and in mortgage lending to \nminorities. Unfortunately, over the last few years, we have seen that \nprogress level off as the economy has cooled down.\n  Today, we bring before the Senate S. 811, the American Dream \nDownpayment Assistance Act, originally introduced by my colleague on \nthe Banking Committee, Senator Allard. This bill authorizes $200 \nmillion for a downpayment assistance program targeted to first time, \nlow-income homebuyers. I support this legislation, and I appreciate the \nefforts of the Senator from Colorado, as well as Chairman Shelby. I \nalso note that the bill includes important provisions to expand the \nsupply of affordable rental housing. Senator Corzine amended the bill \nto raise the FHA multifamily loan limits to account for the rising \ncosts of producing rental housing. This amendment will facilitate the \nannual construction of up to 6,000 units of multifamily housing \naffordable to working families around the country. This is an important \ncontribution to the legislation we are considering.\n  Likewise, Senator Johnson has contributed a provision to make the FHA \nsingle family adjustable rate mortgage, ARMs, insurance program more \neffective. ARMs are an important tool in helping families achieve \nhomeownership, and the Johnson amendment will be a welcome addition to \nthe FHA program.\n  Finally, I would like to thank Senator Stabenow for bringing to the \nattention of the committee the special needs of a growing segment of \nour population, families headed by grandparents. The legislation \nincludes an amendment that will create a demonstration program to \nexamine how existing HUD programs can better serve these families. It \nalso requires HUD to study ways in which barriers to existing programs \nfor these families may be reduced.\n  Again, I want to thank Chairman Shelby, as well as Senators Allard \nand Reed, chair and ranking member of the Housing Subcommittee, for all \ntheir work on this legislation and for their willingness to work in a \nbipartisan way to produce a good final product. I also want to thank \nChairman Oxley, Ranking Member Frank, and the other members of the \nHouse Financial Services Committee for their contributions to this \nprocess and this product.\n  I support passage of the American Dream Downpayment Assistance Act \nand urge it passage.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I ask unanimous consent that the substitute amendment at \nthe desk be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read the third time and \npassed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any \nstatements related to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2216) was agreed to.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The bill (S. 811), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/24/senate-section/article/S15874-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15874]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             EXTENSION OF NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN.

Mr. President, it is late tonight and we will be in \nsession early tomorrow morning, but I did want to take a brief moment \nand give thanks to a very special group of people around this \ninstitution. There are a number of professional and dedicated \nindividuals who spend each and every day working to keep this body \nfunctioning. But I want to give special thanks to one group of people \ntonight, and that is our Senate pages.\n\n[[Page S15879]]\n\n  These are hard-working young men and women who help us each day with \na broad range of tasks. They do really pretty much everything from \npreparing these desks today--as you look around here and see what is on \nthese desks, you can see that that can be a huge task--to running \nerrands for Members, errands that we greatly depend upon as we try to \njuggle our various responsibilities of the day, to making copies of \namendments literally just one after another. In fact, you see the \ncopies of the Medicare legislation on the desks today. When you look at \nthem, you know that somebody has generated each and every one of those \ncopies. The duties really go on and on.\n  In the middle of my talk last night, I was speaking from this desk. \nAnd I thought, I have to get rid of this. How will I do it? I was \nthinking, and all of a sudden the page came and slipped it away so I \ncould continue my discussion at the time.\n  I thank them and praise the tremendous work they do each and every \nday. This past week we have had very busy days. It has been unusual \nworking through last week, through Saturday, through Sunday, through \nMonday, today. Very late seems to be the norm these last few days, as \nwe have really worked to complete our work before the holidays. It is \nthe pages who have been with us in the past few days where we had not \nanticipated being here this late.\n  We have had very special pages with us. I will slip out in a few \nminutes as we close down, and they will still be here as they tidy up \nfor early tomorrow morning. They will soon be out for their \nThanksgiving holiday as well. I really do I want to thank them, several \nof whom are sitting right here looking at me on the floor tonight. I \nthank them for their hard work these last several days: Yael Bortnick, \nEmily Holmgren, Ferrell Oxley, Sarah Smith, Melissa Meyer--and it is \nher birthday today--Margaret Leddy, and Krista Warner. In particular, I \nwant to thank Melissa Meyer. But I thank them again for their \ntremendous work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/24/senate-section/article/S15879-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15879]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AUTHORIZING PRODUCTION OF RECORDS\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
