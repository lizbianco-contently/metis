Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, there \nwill be a period of morning business until 11 a.m. There are several \nlegislative and executive matters that the Senate will consider during \ntoday's session.\n  Following morning business, it is possible that the Senate will \nresume consideration of the Defense authorization bill, as provided \nunder the consent agreement of May 23. Under that order, we should be \nable to finish action on that bill within a couple of hours and then \nsend it to conference with the House.\n  We will also resume consideration of the Energy legislation today. We \nmade very good progress on the ethanol issue yesterday. However, I \nunderstand that additional amendments will be offered on that matter. \nIt is my hope that Members offer their ethanol amendments so the Senate \ncan then begin to consider other energy-related amendments.\n  In addition, discussions are underway to devise a process for \nconsideration of the child tax credit legislation, as we talked about \nyesterday on the floor. We are now discussing the best way to address \nthis very important issue. It will be addressed and, over the course of \nthe morning, a final decision will be made on what is the fairest and \nmost efficient way to address the child tax credit legislation.\n  The chairman of the Finance Committee introduced his legislation \nyesterday and is working with many colleagues on the best course of \naction so that we can expeditiously consider that bill.\n  We are also working to clear additional nominations during today's \nsession. Members should expect votes throughout the day, and Senators \nwill be notified when the first vote is scheduled. I am going to make a \nvery brief statement on Medicare. I will proceed with that and then we \ncan proceed in morning business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/04/senate-section/article/S7269-7", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7269-S7270]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                MEDICARE\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, 5 years ago, this body launched a \nbipartisan commission on Medicare with the purpose of addressing both \nthe short-term, mid-term, and long-term challenges we have with \nsustaining Medicare, preserving Medicare, and strengthening Medicare. \nThat bipartisan commission did develop a solid bipartisan proposal. \nSince 1999, the Senate Finance Committee has held 29 hearings on \nMedicare, and 7 of those hearings specifically focused on adding a \nprescription drug benefit to Medicare coverage.\n  We have discussed the issue, we have debated the issue, we have \ndissected it, and we have deliberated on the issue of Medicare \nmodernization and Medicare improvement for years now--for 6 years since \nwe first began talking about the Medicare commission.\n  I sincerely believe that the stars are aligned for legislative action \nand a vote to preserve Medicare and strengthen and improve it and \naddress the prescription drugs issue right now, this month. It is now \ntime for us not to just talk about the issue again but to act on the \nissue.\n  Since I became majority leader, I have made it clear that it would be \nmy intention to address the issue using the\n\n[[Page S7270]]\n\nnormal order of business, and that is to have a proposal that is \ndeveloped and generated in a bipartisan way through the Finance \nCommittee, bring that bill to the floor of the Senate for further \ndebate and further amendment. The Finance Committee is progressing \nwell. The action of the Finance Committee is on course to accomplish my \ngoal.\n  Our leadership goal is bringing this to the floor on about June 16, 2 \nweeks from now. I am pleased with the progress to date. I understand we \nhave a long way to go. It is a complex piece of legislation, but a very \nimportant piece of legislation that I am absolutely convinced we can \nbring to resolution for the benefit of seniors and individuals with \ndisabilities.\n  We will have approximately 2 weeks on the floor of the Senate. I have \nmade that very clear as well so that people, for the last several \nmonths, have been able to prepare and think through what is important \nto them, talk to their constituents, talk to their counselors to make \nsure we address this in a very thoughtful way.\n  I think we will be able to work together--both sides of the aisle--to \ncull the very best of our ideas and give America's seniors a Medicare \nsystem that will do what we want to do: provide our seniors and \nindividuals with disabilities real health care security.\n  I believe we need to work to make sure that seniors do have the \nchoice and the flexibility to be able to choose the type of coverage \nthat best meets their individual needs. We need to make sure that \ncoverage is available to every senior, everywhere. There has to be a \nspecial focus, as we all know, on the issues that pertain directly to \nthe rural population. You can do that, for example, by requiring plans \nto bid in large geographic areas across the country, instead of just \ncherry-picking, whether it is urban, or suburban, or just a rural \npopulation. I think we can get rid of the cherry-picking that has \nemerged in the current system. If a health coverage plan wants to serve \npatients in a high-cost, densely populated suburban or urban area, they \nwill also have to offer coverage in rural areas, whether it is Maine, \nWisconsin, Montana, or in Iowa.\n  We can do all of this if we focus on the big picture for the future. \nOur fellow citizens are clearly relying on us and we need to focus on \nthem. Now is the time for us not to just get by another year but to \ntransform this system in a positive way.\n  Seniors deserve choice. They deserve having a system that is focused \non the patient, one that is really patient centered. They deserve care \nthat is flexible, with less paperwork and bureaucracy. They deserve \ncare that focuses on prevention and not just in response to acute \nepisodic injury, so that you can capture that early heart disease \nbefore it becomes what is called a cardiomyopathy or a chronic \ncongestive heart failure. It ends up being less expensive, more \nvaluable, and certainly keeps patients healthier. They need to be \nprotected from catastrophic out-of-pocket expenditures. Most seniors do \nnot realize today that if they get very sick, there is no limit as to \nthe out-of-pocket costs they have to pay. We need to protect them \nespecially in those events surrounding catastrophe.\n\n  I think seniors should be in a system that allows them the \nopportunity to see the doctors they choose. Thus, it is my hope and \nintention that we will vote on final passage before leaving for the \nIndependence Day recess. Once passed, I am very hopeful that the bill, \nwhatever its final shape, will begin to help seniors as soon as \npossible.\n  Whenever we bring up to date or strengthen a system, it takes time to \nimplement that plan in a careful and systematic way. I think as we \ndevelop that plan and begin to implement it, there are ways we can \nimmediately begin to help those seniors who need help with prescription \ndrugs.\n  In 1963, when leading the fight to enact Medicare, President John F. \nKennedy said:\n\n       A proud and resourceful nation can no longer ask its people \n     to live in constant fear of a serious illness for which \n     adequate funds are not available. We owe the right of dignity \n     in sickness as well as in health.\n\n  Medicare, as I mentioned yesterday in this Chamber, has served a \ngeneration of America's seniors very well. Our challenge now is to take \na system which is out of date--if you look at the way state-of-the-art \ncare is delivered--and bring it up to date so we can serve the current \ngeneration and next generations of seniors equally well.\n  We have an opportunity to do that now. We have an obligation, I would \nargue, to do that now so that we can provide real security for \ngenerations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/04/senate-section/article/S7270-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7270]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        AFRICAN AMERICAN MUSEUM\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, there are many issues that will be before \nus this morning and during the course of this week, such as the Energy \nbill, which, of course, is of great importance to the security of the \nUnited States of America. We have had amendments on that bill over the \nlast several days. But we will also be considering an important issue \nfor millions of Americans, and that is the cost of prescription drugs. \nIt is an issue which families face all the time, particularly if they \nhave someone in the family with a serious illness. It is particularly \ndifficult as well for senior citizens on a fixed income.\n  There are two different issues that are going to be tested in this \nChamber. There is a Republican approach which suggests we need to \nbasically privatize Medicare, that we need to basically abandon the \nsystem of health insurance protection for seniors which has been \neffective for over 40 years.\n  There are many on the Republican side of the aisle from a \nconservative political viewpoint who really do not care much for our \nMedicare system. They have been fairly outspoken about it. One of them \nis Senator Santorum of Pennsylvania, one of the leaders on the \nRepublican side. This is what he said recently about Medicare:\n\n       The standard benefit, the traditional Medicare program, has \n     to be phased out.\n\n\n[[Page S7271]]\n\n\n  ``Has to be phased out,'' he said. That was a statement by Senator \nSantorum, a Republican leader, in the New York Times on May 21.\n  What the Republicans will bring us in terms of prescription drugs is \nreally the first and critical step toward phasing out Medicare. It is \ntheir belief that Medicare should be eliminated and replaced with \nprivate insurance coverage, but most American families know, if they \nhave been at the mercy of a health insurance company, that, frankly, \nthat is not a very wise tradeoff, nor a very fair one. That is why we \ncome down to some fundamental differences between Democrats and \nRepublicans when it comes to prescription drugs.\n\n  We on the Democratic side believe that a prescription drug benefit \nshould be part of Medicare; that it should be a voluntary program; that \nthere should not be any coverage gaps; that there should be reliable \ncoverage all across America; and that we ought to lower the cost of \nmedicine for everyone by ensuring access to generic drugs.\n  On the Republican side, they have serious gaps in coverage in \nprescription drugs. If you are paying for prescription drugs on a \nmonthly basis for a serious illness and expect to pay for it throughout \nthe course of the calendar year, there are periods in the beginning \nwhen Republicans would protect you for a short period of time and then \nlong periods of months when there is no protection whatsoever before \nyour bills get so huge you qualify for catastrophic coverage. That is \nnot very much protection for a family or a sick person.\n  They also, on the Republican side, will force seniors out of Medicare \nand into unreliable HMOs where seniors will not be able to choose their \nown doctors. Do you remember the debate we had over 10 years ago about \nthe future of health care in America? Wasn't one of the serious issues \nwe talked about one's ability to choose one's own doctor? The \nRepublican approach on prescription drugs, the suggestion we privatize \nMedicare, that we move people into HMOs, will take away the ability of \nseniors to choose their own doctors, their ability to choose the \ndoctors they trust. That is pretty fundamental.\n  Also, the Republicans suggest spending billions to privatize Medicare \nand turning this over to big insurance companies. Have you spoken \nrecently to someone who has had to deal with health insurance \ncompanies, the rates they charge, and the conditions on coverage? I \nhave; I sat down with small business people in Illinois. I find it \nabsolutely scandalous what is going on. These insurance companies are \ncherry-picking. They are deciding who they will insure and who they \nwill not insure. They are deciding the length and duration of coverage \nand the type of coverage.\n  If you, during the course of the calendar year when you are covered, \nturn in any claim relative to any part of your body or any illness, you \ncan virtually bet that next year, when you go to sign up for health \ninsurance, it will be excluded; you are on your own. Is that the kind \nof coverage which we want to see in America?\n  The Republicans say that is a choice; we are giving people a choice. \nLet me tell you, Mr. President, the seniors of America have chosen for \nover 40 years the right choice, and that choice is Medicare. Medicare \nis a system which protects all Americans. It is a system with low \nadministrative costs. It is a system which has worked. It has worked \nbecause the life expectancy of seniors has increased. It has worked \nbecause hospitals across America provide benefits to seniors. That is \nwhat is at stake in this debate.\n  I say to my colleagues who argue this is just a question of choice, \nit is the wrong choice. The best choice is to stick with Medicare, to \nstick with protection.\n  In closing, I wish to speak about cost. There will be those who come \nto this Chamber and say: You Democrats and those who support a plan \nunder Medicare have to understand how expensive it is.\n  They will say, you do not understand the expense of your proposal. I \nwish those same critics could remember the debate just 2 weeks ago on \nthe Senate floor when the Bush administration came in and asked for us \nto provide over $350 billion in tax breaks for some of the wealthiest \npeople in America. Two years ago, that same administration asked for \nover $1 trillion worth of tax breaks for the elite investors in \nAmerica. The money was there for tax breaks for the wealthiest people \nin America but, sadly, when it comes to providing health insurance \ncoverage, when it comes to prescription drug coverage, time and again \nthe same people who voted so willingly for tax breaks for the wealthy \nwill not come up with the dollars necessary for real prescription drug \ncoverage that will cover our seniors across America.\n  That is what this debate is about, the future of Medicare, a fair \nprogram to protect all senior citizens and to provide for cost of \nprescription drugs.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/04/senate-section/article/S7271-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7271]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, just before the Memorial Day recess, the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer and I had the great honor of \nintroducing bipartisan legislation, S. 1157, to create a National \nMuseum of African American History and Culture within the Smithsonian \nInstitution.\n  We were joined in that effort by 44 of our colleagues, and I might \npoint out that another four have joined since that time, bringing the \ntotal number of cosponsors to this legislation to 48. I presume before \nthe day is out we will have a clear majority of our colleagues who \nendorse the legislation introduced by the distinguished Senator from \nKansas.\n  Senator Brownback and I introduced similar legislation in the last \nCongress and I am pleased that we have such strong continuing interest \nfrom our colleagues, ensuring this important museum be created.\n  This long overdue legislation will guarantee that the compelling \nstories and invaluable contributions of African Americans to our Nation \nwill finally be shared with all Americans, indeed all peoples of the \nworld.\n  This legislation also allows us to publicly display the contributions \nof African Americans to the founding of our Nation and educate students \nof all ages about the importance of their experience. This museum is \nnot intended to replace the numerous museums and institutions of \nAfrican American culture and history that already exist in our country. \nInstead, it will bring a national focus and prominence to the \ncontributions and experiences of African Americans.\n  In New Haven, CT, for example, we are fortunate to be the home port \nof the 19th century freedom schooner, Amistad. The recreated Amistad is \na floating classroom and reminder of the devastating effects of the \ntransatlantic slave trade. Amistad America is dedicated to promoting \nthe legacies of the Amistad incident of 1839 and to celebrating and \nteaching the historic lessons of perseverance, leadership, justice, and \nfreedom experienced by African Americans during that incident, and \nsimilar ones like it during the centuries before 1839.\n  It is my hope, of course, that organizations such as Amistad America \nand numerous others will be able to work with the Smithsonian to ensure \nthat these important stories may be told. I am pleased that we have \nbeen able to provide support for these numerous organizations and \nassociations, such as Amistad, in this bill as well.\n  During my tenure as chairman of the Senate Rules Committee, I was \npleased to work with colleagues to pass legislation to establish the \nPresidential Commission on the National Museum of African American \nHistory and Culture action plan.\n  In April, the Presidential commission issued its report in which it \ndocumented the voices of African Americans across the Nation, calling \nfor a national place to tell their individually collective stories. \nThis long overdue\n\n[[Page S7272]]\n\nlegislation will provide such a place, and I commend the distinguished \nPresiding Officer for his leadership on this issue.\n  The mission statement contained in that report sums up the purpose of \nthis legislation:\n\n       This museum will give voice to the centrality of the \n     African American experience and will make it possible for all \n     people to understand the depth, complexity, and promise of \n     the American experience.\n\n  It is that very goal, of completing the American story of our quest \nfor freedom and truth by publicly incorporating the experience and \ncontribution of African Americans, that is the essence of this \nlegislation. This museum offers the promise and the hope that all \nAmericans can come to understand the full story of how this Nation was \nformed. It is past time that we publicly acknowledge and incorporate \nthe African Americans' experience into our collective identity and this \nmuseum will provide the appropriate means for accomplishing that very \ngoal.\n  Again, I congratulate my colleague, Senator Brownback, and I want to \nspecifically highlight the tremendous contribution of Representative \nJohn Lewis of Georgia, who is the lead sponsor in the House of \nRepresentatives for this bill, on their perseverance in this matter. I \nam honored today to join them as their lead sponsor on this side of the \naisle.\n  I see my colleague from Mississippi, who I know has some comments he \nwants to make on this as well. I thank him for his leadership. As the \nchairman of the Rules Committee, he will have a lot to say about how \nthis bill moves through the committee and comes to the floor.\n  My congratulations to the Presiding Officer from Kansas and all \nothers who have joined with us in this collective effort this morning.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from the great State of \nMississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield myself 5 minutes of the time reserved for the \nSenator from Kansas, Mr. Brownback.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues today in \ncosponsoring and supporting the introduction of legislation to create \nthe National Museum of African American History and Culture. I \nparticularly want to commend Senator Brownback, the Presiding Officer \nthis morning, for his leadership on this issue. This legislation could \nnot be introduced today in a way that it can be considered and acted \nupon without his willingness to stay behind it, to work through some of \nthe problems that did exist and to work with the Rules Committee and \nour staff to make sure we had legislation that could have broad-based \nsupport and could actually be passed by the Senate.\n  I am pleased to see my colleague from the Rules Committee, the \nranking member, Senator Dodd, as a cosponsor, as well as Senator Frist, \nSenator Stevens, Senator Santorum, Senator Smith, and Senator Daschle. \nObviously, leadership on both sides of the aisle has decided to join in \nsponsoring this truly historic legislation.\n  The National Museum of African American History and Culture will be \nbuilt and operated within the Smithsonian Institution and be a full-\nfledged Smithsonian Museum. That is a critical point to be made. It \ngives additional stature, credibility, and supervision that will be \nvery helpful in the years ahead as we try to make sure this museum \nexhibits the way it should and is fully utilized by the American people \nand supported by the Congress.\n\n  I rise to express my support for the legislation because this museum \nwill showcase not only the history and the culture of African American \nexperience, but it will serve as a vivid display of the countless \ncontributions that African Americans have made to the United States and \nin fact to the world.\n  Back in 2001, I had an unusual experience. It was one of those rare \nweekends when I stayed in Washington and my family, including my wife, \nwere all back home in Mississippi. So I took a bicycle ride down the \nMall and I wound up at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. I parked my \nbicycle across the way kind of in the edge of the bushes and just \nwatched people. I do not know what really started me to doing that, but \nI guess I was struck, as I pulled up, at the number of people there and \nhow they were relating to this memorial. They touched it. They shed \ntears there. They stood there. It was obviously a moving and spiritual \nexperience, a connecting experience, maybe an experience of closure for \nsome people. It struck me what an important monument and memorial that \nsite is.\n  Later on that same week, I was meeting with a group of African \nAmerican business leaders and we ended up talking about how to properly \nand adequately recognize the contributions of African Americans and \ntheir role in shaping American history. I conveyed to them the story of \nmy experience at the Vietnam Memorial and how it seemed to positively \naffect the people that came there, and that it caused me to recognize \nthat every American needs a monument, a memorial, that is sort of \ntheirs that reflects their heritage. It could be of all kinds of \nbackgrounds in America. We have talked about the need for the Native \nAmerican monument somewhere in this city to honor what they have \ncontributed to this country. So I believe the creation of this museum \nwill go a long way toward a similar type healing process for African \nAmericans, and I am honored to be a part of it.\n  The Smithsonian is no doubt one of the world's leaders in preserving, \ndisplaying, and telling the story of the American experience. Often \ncalled the ``Nation's Attic,'' the Smithsonian houses the great \ncollections of the United States and educates the public on our rich \nhistory and the importance of ensuring that knowledge passes from one \ngeneration to the next.\n  However, our national attic currently has some voids and we should \nwork to fill those voids in a very careful, thoughtful, and responsible \nway. Having this museum is one of those voids that needs to be \naddressed.\n  Last year, a Presidential commission was appointed to study the \npossibility of creating a museum dedicated to African American history \nand culture. The commission spent thousands of hours researching the \npossibilities of bringing this museum to light. The commission held \ndozens of forums and meetings across America and received feedback from \na broad spectrum of citizens and leaders within the African American \nand other communities. These forums and discussions were thoughtful, \ncalculated, and complete. The feedback was resoundingly clear--a \nnational museum is the proper vehicle for showcasing and telling the \nworld about the African American experience. I could not agree more.\n\n  I am delighted to join in sponsoring this legislation. The history \nand culture of African-American life in this country is a very \nimportant part of the history of our culture and all that is America. \nIts story needs to be included in the sacred places in this city.\n  I commend Senator Brownback for his leadership. I am glad to join in \na bipartisan effort to get this legislation approved.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I add my voice to those of Senator Lott \nand Senator Dodd and others in expressing my support and commendation \nto the Presiding Officer for his leadership, as well as to Senator Dodd \nand Senator Lott, Senator Santorum, Senator Stevens, and others who \nhave taken the initiative to show such leadership on this very \nimportant project.\n  If I could think of one word as I consider the prospect of the \nNational Museum of African American History and Culture, it would be \n``overdue.'' It is overdue. It is long past due. I hope on a bipartisan \nbasis we continue to demonstrate our recognition of the remarkable \ncontributions of African American culture and African American \nleadership to our country. One cannot understand the story of America \nwithout understanding the story of African Americans.\n  I hope we continue to work to move this project along. Again, I \ncommend those directly involved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/04/senate-section/article/S7272-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7272-S7274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           PRESCRIPTION DRUGS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, let me talk briefly about the important \nlegislation addressed by the distinguished majority leader. He had \nspoken\n\n[[Page S7273]]\n\nabout the importance of our effort this month on prescription drugs. I \napplaud him for making this a priority. When I was majority leader \nalmost a year ago, we made that same commitment. Of all my \ndisappointments, the one that perhaps may be at the top of the list \nlast year was our inability to pass the legislation. We got 52 votes. \nThe majority of the Senate went on record in support of the plan that \nwas taken up by the Senate. We did not have the 60 votes because there \nwere opponents to the legislation that made points of order that kept \nthe Senate from accomplishing our goal of getting to conference and \nmoving through the bill.\n  Let me simply list five concerns I have as we begin. Hopefully, all \nof the concerns can be addressed. It is critical we consider them very \ncarefully. The first concern is procedural. The distinguished majority \nleader noted that we have had 29 hearings on Medicare since 1999 and, \nindeed, we have studied this issue a good deal. What I am concerned \nabout now, however, is that we did not have a bill before the Senate. I \nknow Senator Grassley is working tirelessly with others to provide a \nvehicle to allow us the opportunity to debate this issue. The \nadministration, of course, has come out with their recommendations that \nSenator Durbin addressed a moment ago. However, we ought to have a \nhearing on the bill itself once it is written so we can walk through it \nand make sure we know exactly what we will be voting on and \nconsidering. Having that hearing on the bill seems to me to be an \nessential aspect of the procedural requirements we have to consider as \nwe prepare for the debate on the Senate floor itself.\n  The second issue has to do with the context. Some will use Medicare \nand prescription drugs as a Trojan horse to privatize the Medicare \nsystem. How tragic that would be if in the name of providing good \nprescription drug benefits to seniors, we end up with a system that \nmost seniors will not recognize.\n  Before Medicare was created in 1965, less than half of Americans over \nthe age of 65 had health insurance. Now, 95 percent of seniors over the \nage 65 have health insurance. The reason they do is because of \nMedicare.\n  If we privatize Medicare, seniors in rural areas, in particular, will \nsuffer. Let us not privatize the system. Let us not destroy a system \nthat works so well for so many.\n  I find it interesting that those who laud the advantages of private-\nsector health care have difficulty explaining why Medicare can have \nsuch low administrative costs. Medicare's administrative costs are \nabout 2 to 3 percent. The private sector administrative costs today are \nabout 15 percent--5 times greater than the administrative costs of \nMedicare. We should think about that. I hope we are absolutely certain \nthat in the name of prescription drugs we do not remove, we do not \neliminate, we do not undermine a system that has worked so well for \nseniors, whether they are in urban or rural areas.\n  The third concern is what kind of a package we will provide. The one \nthing seniors tell me they need is a clear understanding of what \nbenefits they are going to get so they can compare whatever choices \nthey may be offered. They need to know what the benefit plan is going \nto be. So let's make sure we define the benefits, describe them and put \nthem in writing, so that no one has any question what it is we are \ngoing to do.\n  Seniors also need to know what premium they will be asked to pay. We \nhave to define that premium right in the bill itself.\n  I hope our colleagues would all share that point of view, as well. Be \nas transparent when it comes to benefit and premiums as we can be so \nthat seniors know what their benefits will be and can have confidence \nthat those benefits will be there when they're needed.\n  Fourth and finally, I hope, more than anything else, that we make the \nbenefits consistent. For us to say seniors will be covered for a while, \nand then not covered even though they continue to pay premiums, and \nthen covered again, would be a terrible mistake. Such coverage gaps, or \nsickness penalties, would lead to a deep-seated cynicism not only among \nseniors but among all Americans. I hope we recognize how important it \nis that we avoid any coverage gaps by including defined benefits and \ndefined premiums.\n  That is, in essence, what we are hoping we can achieve. As we draft \nthe bill, let's simply do this: Let's make sure we have hearings so we \nknow what is in it. Make sure that, in the name of prescription drugs, \nwe don't privatize Medicare and dramatically change a system seniors \ndepend on. Then let's tell seniors three things. They are going to get \na defined benefit, a defined premium, and defined coverage all year \nwith no sickness penalty. If we can agree on these principles, we can \nget broad bipartisan support for the bill at the end of this month.\n\n  Again, I compliment the majority leader for his determination to \ncontinue the efforts we made in the last Congress on prescription \ndrugs. We have a chance to do it right. We have a chance to do it in a \nbipartisan fashion. We have a chance to ensure that at long last we \nmake a real contribution to health care in America, for seniors in \nparticular. That is our opportunity that awaits us as we take up the \ndrug bill later this month.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to.\n  Mr. REID. I have listened to both the majority leader and you, the \nDemocratic leader, this morning. I ask the Senator from South Dakota, \nthe distinguished Democratic leader, if he is aware of some statements \nthat have been made by Republican Senate leaders talking about doing \naway with Medicare.\n  Let me be more specific. Our friend, the distinguished Senator from \nPennsylvania, said just 2 weeks ago:\n\n       I believe the standard benefit traditional Medicare program \n     has to be phased out.\n\n  Is the Senator aware the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania made \nthat statement?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The comment was made. I was not aware of it until just a \nfew days ago. But I think it goes to the heart of what I was talking \nabout. I appreciate the Senator from Nevada raising this question.\n  Unfortunately, we have a much larger question at hand, if there are \nthose on the other side who will see this as an opportunity to \nprivatize--to eliminate the Medicare system, as the comments of the \nSenator from Pennsylvania suggest. If they want to eliminate Medicare, \nthen I think all hope of accomplishing something regarding prescription \ndrugs will be lost. If this is a Medicare debate, if we have to back up \nand first defend Medicare and make sure it is protected and kept \nintact, then we will never have an opportunity to get to prescription \ndrugs.\n  I hope the Senator from Pennsylvania would recognize the consequences \nof words of that magnitude. Obviously, we are prepared to have a debate \nabout Medicare. But it will be at the expense of a debate about \nprescription drugs and whether we can add prescription drugs to \nMedicare sometime this year, hopefully this month.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. The distinguished Senator from Utah, Senator Bennett, a \nlong-time friend of this Senator, stated about 7 weeks ago:\n\n       Medicare is a disaster. We have to understand that Medicare \n     is going to have to be overhauled. Let's create a whole new \n     system.\n\n  Is the Senator aware our friend from Utah has made that statement?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. There are those on the other side--and I assume from \nthat comment that Senator Bennett may be among them--who believe that \neliminating or dramatically altering Medicare is the only option \navailable to us. Frankly, I am troubled by that. I think Medicare has \nbeen one of the greatest health care success stories in our Nation's \nhistory.\n  My mother is a beneficiary of Medicare. The remarkable consistency \nand the extraordinary access to health care that Medicare has provided \nto her and tens of millions of other seniors simply cannot be \noverestimated.\n  As I said earlier, the administrative cost for Medicare is about 3 \npercent. The administrative cost for private health care plans is 15 \npercent, 5 times greater.\n  Medicare provides every senior in South Dakota a chance to get health \ncare. There are no private sector plans in large parts of South Dakota \nbecause HMO's and PPO's don't serve rural America. So from an access \npoint of view, from an administrative point of view, from a benefit \npoint of view, from an assurance and confidence point of view for \nseniors, I don't know how you could do much better than Medicare.\n\n[[Page S7274]]\n\n  Can it be improved? Absolutely. Could we provide more preventive and \nwellness care? Absolutely. Can we provide a prescription drug benefit? \nAbsolutely.\n  But when we draw down the Medicare trust fund to pay for tax cuts, we \nare, in essence, stealing from that very fund that will be needed in \nfuture years to provide the kind of health care that our parents, our \ngrandparents, and our families depend upon.\n  The quotes from our Republican colleagues are very disconcerting and \ntroubling. As I say, if that becomes the debate, if the debate is about \nthe future existence of Medicare itself, we will never be able to get \nto a drug benefit debate.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for one final question? I know there \nare others here wishing to speak. This will be the last question.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to.\n  Mr. REID. The State of Nevada has two large metropolitan areas, Reno \nand Las Vegas, but most of the State population is in small towns--\nMesquite, Ely, Hawthorne, Battle Mountain, Tonopah--places that have no \nmanaged care. If we change Medicare drastically, I don't know what will \nhappen to the seniors in those rural communities.\n  I have heard the Senator today and on other occasions speak about the \nproblems in South Dakota, which has many rural communities in it. If we \ndo not take care of Medicare in the traditional fashion so that it is a \nlevel playing field no matter where you live, I think our Medicare \nProgram as we have known it, that has been so successful, will leave \nmany seniors simply without any medical care. Does the Senator agree \nwith that statement?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I couldn't agree more. In fact, what troubles me is \nthere are those who would turn Medicare into a great big HMO. I don't \nknow many people who are enthusiastic about the kind of care they get \nfrom their HMO. There are some good ones, I certainly would not deny \nthat. But I must say, HMOs are not the panacea. There is not a one-\nsize-fits-all HMO, health maintenance organization, or PPO, for that \nmatter, preferred provider system, that would work in rural areas.\n  We know. We have seen from our own experience. They have tried it. \nThey have attempted to create managed care systems in rural areas. The \ndemographics don't work. Our health care delivery system in rural areas \ndoes not allow for a managed care system that works. Perhaps it does in \nWashington DC, or Los Angeles or New York.\n  So we cannot have a one-size-fits-all system. That is the beauty of \nthe Medicare system. The Medicare system has adapted over the years, \norganizationally and administratively, to fit Alaska and South Dakota \nand Nevada in a way that has worked far beyond the expectations, I am \nsure, of many who created the system in the 1960s.\n  Let us not throw out a system that has worked well. Let's improve it. \nLet's build on it. Let's provide better benefits through it. But to \nprivatize Medicare--to eliminate it and replace it with a new HMO in \nthe name of Medicare--is a mistake that we will fight to the last day. \nThat would be a real tragedy because we have an opportunity to debate \nhow to provide a good prescription benefit. Let's agree in a bipartisan \nway to have that debate. This is our moment and our opportunity and I \nhope we seize it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to join several colleagues who \nhave already made presentations here today about the introduction of a \nbill for a National Museum of African American History and Culture. We \ncurrently have 48 cosponsors of this bill. I hope after today we will \nhave a strong and clear majority sponsoring this legislation.\n  I want to particularly thank Senator Dodd, who is the lead Democrat \nsponsor of this bill, and Senator Lott, who chairs the Rules Committee \nthrough which it will go, both of whom are cosponsors of the bill, \nalong with the majority leader and the Democratic leader who are also \ncosponsors of the bill, for pushing this issue, making it go forward.\n  I cannot go forward without recognizing Congressman John Lewis from \nGeorgia, who has been the lead sponsor in the House, along with J.C. \nWatts, before he left that body, being the inspirational leader behind \nmoving this issue forward.\n  Over 200 years ago, there was a dream that was America for a group of \nindividuals who were brought to our shores in shackles, a dream so \npowerful it compelled a race of people to fight for the liberty of \nothers when they were in bondage themselves, a dream that not only \nserved as a catalyst for physical liberation in the African-American \ncommunity but removed societal shackles from our culture and enabled us \nto realize the ideals set before us in the Constitution--that all men \nare created equal under God.\n  Today, we celebrate this magnificent history, a history of a people's \nquest for freedom that shaped this Nation into a symbol of freedom and \ndemocracy around the world. I am proud to stand here today with my \ncolleagues and introduce once again to this body a bill that will \ncreate the National Museum of African American History and Culture.\n  I would specifically like to mention Senator Dodd, Senator Stevens, \nSenator Lott, Senator Santorum, and the other 48 cosponsors who are \npushing this museum forward.\n  The National Museum of African-American History and Culture \nPresidential Commission--signed into law by President Bush--stated that \nthe time is now. Indeed the time is now to honor this incredible \nhistory that has shaped this great Nation.\n  I thank the Presidential Commission for their hard work and effort in \nrecommending to Congress that we should build this museum, and that \nthere is sufficient interest in the philanthropic community to \nfinancially support this museum, and that there are sufficient \nartifacts to fill this museum.\n  So many Americans will be able to share in the celebration of this \nmuseum--a uniquely American museum, one that we can celebrate. I \nremember when I met with the Dean of the Afro-American Studies at \nHoward University. He told me of a story about his grandfather who \nfinished a bowl the day the Emancipation Proclamation was authorized. \nHis grandfather decided to keep the bowl because it no longer was the \nproperty of a slave master but the man who made it--his grandfather.\n  The dean has this bowl in his home--an incredible piece of history, \nand I am sure there are many more pieces out their waiting for a home, \na national home.\n  Today, we are not just introducing a bill; we are completing a piece \nof American history by introducing the National Museum of African-\nAmerican History and Culture, which will create a museum to honor \nAfrican-American contributions to this Nation--which is an \nextraordinary story of sacrifice and triumph.\n  This bill will create this museum within the Smithsonian \nInstitution--America's premier museum complex. We have worked very hard \nwith the Smithsonian Institution to craft a bill that will compliment \ntheir programs. And, indeed, we have done just that.\n  This bill is very similar to the American-Indian Museum, slated to \nopen next year. And I know that the Smithsonian Institution will create \nanother national treasure--one that tells the story of African-\nAmericans in this country--a proud history, a rich history.\n  This bill charges the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian \nInstitution, along with the Council of the National Museum to plan, \nbuild, and construct a museum dedicated to celebrating nationally \nAfrican-American history--which is American history.\n  In addition, this bill charges the board of regents with choosing a \nsite on or adjacent to the National Mall for the location of the \nmuseum.\n  Additionally, the bill establishes an education and program liaison \nsection designed to work with educational institutions and museums \nacross the\n\n[[Page S7275]]\n\ncountry in order to promote African-American history.\n  Finally, the bill sets forth a Federal-private partnership for \nfunding the museum, and authorizes $17 million for the first year in \norder to begin implementation of the museum council, which will be \ncomprised from a mixture of leading African-Americans from the museum, \nhistorical, and business communities.\n  It has been well over 70 years since the first commission was formed \nto seek ways to honor nationally the contributions of African-\nAmericans--70 years. It is about time that we move forward with it.\n  It has always been my hope that this museum will not only showcase \nnationally the accomplishments of African-Americans--which are great--\nbut will also serve as a catalyst for racial reconciliation in our \nNation. Indeed we have triumphed over our difficulties in this area, \nbut we must continue to do more.\n  I can see a number of people going through this museum with a lot of \ntears coming out as they see the progression of people coming to this \ncontinent in shackles and moving forward in triumph. There are going to \nbe a lot of tears along that trail. The beautiful thing about tears is \nthat they don't have color; they just cleanse. I think they will be \ntears of cleansing.\n  I do not pretend that this museum is a panacea for racial \nreconciliation, which this country desperately needs. It is, however, a \nproductive step in recognizing the important contributions and the debt \nall Americans owe to African Americans.\n  I close my comments with a quote from Dr. Martin Luther King, a \nprophet in his time and now a prophet to us. He said this that could \nhave been said about the museum in this time we are in:\n\n       That the dark clouds of [misconceptions] will soon pass \n     away and the deep fog of misunderstanding will be lifted from \n     our fear-drenched communities and in some not too distant \n     tomorrow the radiant stars of love and brotherhood will shine \n     over our great Nation with all their scintillating beauty.\n\n  We are one step closer to that today.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, are we currently in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, there are two things I want to address \nvery briefly this morning.\n  I rise to pay tribute to Estella Reyes Naranjo, a great citizen of my \nState of Texas.\n  I think it is important to recognize contributions such as those of \nEstella, which are primarily in the area of the education of the \nchildren of San Antonio, my hometown, and her 50 years of unselfish \nservice to the city of San Antonio, the State of Texas, and to the \nUnited States of America.\n  Estella has taught for 40 years in Texas public schools and for \nanother 10 years in Catholic schools. Through her dedicated service in \nthe classroom and the community, she has been a positive influence for \ncountless lives, and for thousands of young Texans.\n  Estella earned a bachelor's degree from Texas A University in \nKingsville and has served as the president of the Pan American League. \nDuring her tenure, the league donated more than $1 million toward a \ncenter to assist San Antonio's inner city, and contributed over \n$250,000 in scholarships administered through The University of Texas \nat San Antonio.\n  Estella has been honored with an outstanding service award for her \ndedication and hard work in the public school system, and has received \na leadership award for her many contributions to the Catholic school \nsystem. She has also been honored by the International Good Neighbor \nCouncil for her work to promote the ``Principles of Good-\nneighborliness'' between Mexico and the United States.\n  As a teacher, a volunteer, and a diligent leader, Estella is an \ninspiration to her family, her friends, and her community. She is truly \nan important part of what President Bush calls ``the armies of \ncompassion.''\n  I have always believed that patriotism is not just expressed by \nflying the flag. It is about more than that. Patriotism means we all \nshare a part in something larger than ourselves. In all of our \ndifferences, there are some things we all have in common. In all our \ndiversity, each of us still has a bond with our fellow man.\n  The fact that dedicated individuals, working faithfully in their \ncommunities, can accomplish more than any government program is well \nestablished, and it is established again in the life that we celebrate \ntoday.\n  Alexis de Tocqueville described it this way:\n\n       Countless little people, humble people, throughout American \n     society, expend their efforts in the betterment of the \n     community, blowing on their hands, pitting their small \n     strength against the inhuman elements of life.

Madam President, I wish to also, in the brief time I have \nallotted, say a few words about a very important subject to our \nGovernment and to our Nation. I wish to say a few words about the \nimportance of continuity of our Nation's Government.\n  Today, the Continuity of Government Commission, a joint project of \nthe Brookings Institution and the American Enterprise Institute, is \nreleasing a report to the Congress on this matter. I express my \nappreciation to the commission for their responsible and forthright \nassessment of needed constitutional reforms in this area. Their report \nwill be an invaluable addition to this ongoing discussion, and it will \nprovide a sound basis for hearings I plan to hold in the Senate \nJudiciary Committee's Subcommittee on the Constitution later this year.\n  I was not here serving in Washington in this body when the attacks \ncame on September 11. Like so many other Americans, I was at home, \npreparing for work, when I heard the terrible news and saw it displayed \non the television set. But I know that many of my friends and \ncolleagues who were here on that horrific day feel a very personal debt \nto the heroes of flight 93.\n  The brave passengers on that flight did more than just save the lives \nof their fellow citizens. Absent their courageous sacrifice, it is \nlikely that flight 93 would have reached its final destination in this \nvery building, in an attack that would have virtually eliminated an \nentire branch of our Government.\n  Even as we have dedicated ourselves to fighting terror at home and \nabroad, even as we hope and pray that the tragedies of September 11 \nwill never be repeated, we must always remain conscious of our promise \nas Senators to serve the people of our States and our Nation and to \nsupport and defend the Constitution of the United States.\n  In the aftermath of those attacks, it is now increasingly clear that \nour current system providing for the continuity of government in the \nevent of a disaster is inadequate in the reality of the post-9/11 \nworld. If an attack of this nature occurred again, and was even \npartially successful, our Government and our Constitution would be ill \nprepared for the sudden ramifications.\n  As unthinkable as another attack of that magnitude may be, we in the \nlegislative branch must be ready for the worst. We must provide for the \nstable\n\n[[Page S7276]]\n\ncontinuance of government, despite all possible calamities. We owe it \nto the American people to ensure that our Government remains strong and \nstable even in the face of disaster.\n  What the evildoers who committed this terrible act on 9/11 will never \nunderstand is that America cannot be destroyed by weapons, by armies, \nor by terrorist attacks. No matter how many weapons they try to make, \nno matter what secret schemes they concoct, no matter what buildings \nthey destroy, as long as the dream of freedom lives within our hearts, \nAmerica endures, a beacon of light shining for all the world to see.\n  The passengers on flight 93 were everyday Americans, men and women \nwith jobs, with families, and dreams. Like all of us, they made \npromises to their loved ones before they boarded that plane: promises \nof vacations and baseball games, of presents and anniversaries.\n  Some promises are not cheap, others cost nothing, others require that \nwe risk all, even our very lives. The crash site left behind by the \nheroes of flight 93, nestled in the hills of Pennsylvania, is filled \nwith memories of the promises they made and will never keep. That \nhallowed ground marks their last promise: a promise carried on to the \nNation, their children, their loved ones left behind--a promise that \nsays freedom will not end here in the violent acts of evil men. It \npersists, it endures, and it will not be destroyed.\n  Our Government must not fail the children of flight 93. This body \nmust not fail them. We must prepare for all contingencies, fulfilling \nour oaths of office, to ensure that the promise of our free \nGovernment--a government of laws, not men--shall not perish from this \nEarth.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak for up to 15 minutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, last Thursday the New York Times of May \n29 had a front-page picture, a big, color picture on the front page, of \nthe President signing the tax cut bill in the East Room of the White \nHouse. As I looked at this picture, I thought: This really is \nappropriate. Pictures say a thousand words. Here is a picture of the \nPresident signing the tax bill, and he is in the East Room, with all \nthe big crystal chandeliers, all the trappings of power, and an \naudience.\n  I was looking at this audience. I thought: Who are these people? I am \nlooking at them all. Do you know what? This looks like the rich and the \npowerful of America sitting there with all these chandeliers and \ngetting all these big tax cuts. There is not one person of color \nsitting in that audience, not one. Now, there may be. I cannot see back \nbehind where the picture was taken. Maybe there was one. Maybe one of \nthe ushers back there was an African American. But it just kind of \nleaps out at you that these are the people who really benefit from that \ntax cut.\n  Why didn't the President take that tax cut signing down to middle \nAmerica someplace? Why didn't he take it down to a small community of \nmiddle-income taxpayers? Why didn't he take it to a low-income area, \nsay--well, I don't care, pick a city: Newark, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, \nDes Moines, IA, Houston, TX; maybe Detroit, MI or Flint, MI--and go to \nan area of that city that is low-income where people go to work every \nday, where they are struggling to make ends meet, where they have to \nfind some child care for their kids so they can go to work to put bread \non the table to maybe have a little bit of a decent lifestyle, and they \nare having trouble finding decent child care and other costs of raising \nchildren? Why didn't the President go down there and sign that tax cut \nbill?\n  Well, because the sentence right under the picture says why he did \nnot do that:\n\n       Tax law omits $400 child credit for millions.\n\n  Look at the picture: All the trappings of power, all the rich and \npowerful of America sitting in that audience. Right below it: ``Tax law \nomits $400 child credit for millions.'' One picture says a thousand \nwords. And right underneath, it tells you why the President signed the \nbill in front of all these people and not out in middle America.\n  So now we are just beginning to find out. We are just beginning to \nfind out, as the New York Times said, that:\n\n       Because of the formula for calculating the child care tax \n     credit, most families with incomes from $10,500 to $26,625 \n     will not benefit.\n\n  Zero, nada, nothing.\n\n       The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal \n     group, says those families include 11.9 million children or \n     one of every six children under 17.\n\n  Madam President, 11.9 million children left out of the tax bill.\n  You don't see them sitting in the audience. You don't see single \nmoms, for example, sitting in this audience when they are signing the \ntax bill, balancing a couple kids on their knees. You don't see that.\n\n       ``I don't know why they would cut that out of the bill,'' \n     said Senator Blanche Lincoln, the Arkansas Democrat who \n     persuaded the full Senate to send the credit to many more low \n     income families before the provision was dropped in \n     conference. ``These are the people who need it the most and \n     who will spend it the most. These are the people who buy the \n     blue jeans and the detergent . . .''\n\n  As I said, the New York Times picture and the story underneath it say \nit all.\n  The Des Moines Register, closer to my home, had an editorial from May \n31: ``A Tax-Cutting Disgrace.'' This is from the Des Moines Register \neditorial:\n\n       Congress looked out for investors in the last-minute \n     revision of the tax bill President Bush just signed into law.\n       As a result, millions of low-income families won't get the \n     extra $400-a-kid check from Uncle Sam this summer.\n       But most families earning $10,500 to $26,625 annually will \n     be left out. Giving them the credit would have cost about \n     $3.5 billion and would have required sending checks to some \n     who don't pay enough income taxes to deliver the credit as a \n     refund.\n\n  People of low income work hard. They go to work every day. They may \nmake just above the minimum wage, but they are not paying income taxes. \nBut they have child care needs, and they are left out.\n\n       House Republicans contend that a $350 billion cap on the \n     tax cut package didn't leave enough room to give the child \n     credit to low-income families.\n\n  To quote the Des Moines Register: ``Nonsense.''\n\n       They easily could have done less for the richest Americans \n     and more for Americans who barely scrape by. And it's \n     unconscionable that they didn't.\n\n  Well, just look at that picture in the New York Times, look who is \nthere. Then read the articles in the paper, read the Des Moines \nRegister editorial, and you will find out what this tax bill was all \nabout.\n  Now we find something else out about this tax bill as we open up the \nnewspaper this morning, the Washington Post from today: ``Middle Class \nTax Share Set To Rise.'' Well, well, well. ``Studies say the burden of \nthe rich to decline.''\n  Here is what the Washington Post said this morning:\n\n       Three successive tax cuts pushed by President Bush will \n     leave middle income taxpayers paying a greater share of all \n     Federal taxes by the end of the decade, according to new \n     analyses of the Bush administration's tax policy. As critics \n     of the tax cuts in 2001, 2002 and 2003 have noted, the very \n     wealthiest Americans, those earning $337,000 a year or more \n     per year, will be the greatest beneficiaries of the changes \n     in the nation's tax laws.\n\n  So what will happen? They go on to point out, the middle class will \npay more and more. As the rich pay less and less, the middle class will \npay more and more of their share of taxes. Thus, ``Middle Class Tax \nShare Set To Rise.''\n  That brings us to what is going on right now with Medicare. Again, \none may wonder what the connection is between the tax cut bill and the \nproblems that we are confronting ahead in Social Security and Medicare. \nDon't take my word for it. Just read the Financial Times, not \na Democratic newspaper or anything like that. The Financial Times of \nFriday May 30, front-page story: ``Bush Aware of `Crushing' Deficit \nThreat.'' This is the article. I have it blown up here in the chart, \n``Bush Aware Of `Crushing' Deficit Threat.''\n\n  Ari Fleischer, White House spokesperson told a press briefing.\n  Listen to this quote:\n\n       ``There is no question that Social Security and Medicare \n     are going to present [future]\n\n[[Page S7277]]\n\n     generations with a crushing debt burden unless policymakers \n     work seriously to reform those programs.''\n\n  Now it becomes clear. Huge tax breaks and cuts for the wealthy. The \nmiddle class tax share is to rise. Low-income families who have child \ncare credit needs are written out. Because of the huge gap that is \ngoing to happen in the next 10 years because of the lack of revenues \nfor the Federal Government, we are going to have problems in Social \nSecurity and Medicare. And so what does Mr. Fleischer say? We are not \ngoing to rescind the tax cuts. We are not going to ask the wealthiest \nto pay a greater burden. No, we are going to reform Social Security and \nMedicare.\n  What does he mean by ``reform''? That is just a fancy, two-syllable \nword for a one-syllable word, ``cuts.'' Reform to Mr. Fleischer, the \nBush White House, and the Republicans means cuts--cut Social Security, \ncut Medicare. Again, don't take my word for it. On May 21, the third \nranking Republican in the Senate, my friend from Pennsylvania, Senator \nSantorum, said:\n\n       I believe the standard benefit, the traditional Medicare \n     program, has to be phased out.\n\n  Senator Robert Bennett, on March 19, the Senator from Utah said:\n\n       Medicare is a disaster. . . . We have to understand that \n     Medicare is going to have to be overhauled. . . . Let's \n     create a whole new system.\n\n  And then to kind of wrap it all up, yesterday at a hearing here on \nthe Hill, before the Senate Special Committee on Aging, who did they \nhave as a lead-off witness? Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who, in \n1995, said Medicare should wither on the vine.\n  Well, it looks as if the withering is taking place, the huge tax \ncuts, quotes by my fellow Senators from the other side of the aisle. \nThey want to get rid of Medicare. They want to phase it out. They want \nto take all the elderly and put them in private HMOs. There isn't one \nMedicare HMO in the entire State of Iowa. So it is an anti-rural, anti-\nsmall-State approach, but you see the pattern. Wither on the vine, huge \ntax cuts that benefit the wealthy, no child credit to help those with \nlow income, and as the Post pointed out this morning, a greater share \nof the taxes to the Government are going to be borne by the middle \nclass. What are more middle-class programs than Medicare and Social \nSecurity? Those are the middle-class programs. Those are the programs \nwe have had for years to make sure that people who work hard and play \nby the rules, who raise their families, when they reach retirement age \ncan retire with dignity and decent health care coverage.\n  Now we see the game plan of the Republicans and of this President: \nCut Social Security. Cut Medicare. That is what their reform means.\n  Now they are going to use the argument that we will not have enough \nmoney to pay for the Medicare benefits, to pay for a decent \nprescription drug benefit, and to keep Social Security benefits going. \nWe don't have enough money. Why? It all went to the wealthy. As I \npointed out on the Senate floor during the tax cut debate, the \nprojected shortfall in Social Security over the next 75 years would be \nmore than made up by the shortfall in revenue of the tax cut bills, if \nthey are extended as the President desires.\n  So you have to ask yourself, what is more important to the middle \nclass in America? Is it making sure that Warren Buffett, the third \nrichest man in the world, gets a $310 million tax break, which he \nhimself said was wrong and that he should not be getting? He said the \ntax cut ought to go to the middle class, and I commend him for his \nhonesty and forthrightness. What is more important? Is it giving him a \n$310 million tax break or is it more important to the middle class, to \nmake sure we have a decent prescription drug benefit, to make sure we \nhave a decent Medicare Program and a sound Social Security program? \nThat is what is important to the middle class. That is what has been \ntaken away by the tax cut bill. That is what the Republicans are trying \nto take away with cuts to Medicare, and that is what they are going to \ntry to continue to take away with further cuts to Social Security. That \nis why we have to be out here to fight every day for the middle class \nin America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/04/senate-section/article/S7277-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7277-S7279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HEALTH CARE FOR OLDER AMERICANS\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I wish to follow what my friend and \ncolleague from Iowa was speaking about earlier in terms of the \nimportance of Medicare. I think his comments were so right on point.\n  I find interesting--I was not around at the beginning for the \ndebate--the debate on Medicare. I understand that in 1960, originally, \nthere were proposals to provide a broad universal care for all \nAmericans and that, in true compromise form, the Congress and the \nPresident, when there was not support for that, ended up with a plan \ncalled Medicare for seniors and the disabled in this country. So it was \na compromise. It was viewed as a first step, not a last step, in \nproviding universal care for all Americans.\n  I believe Medicare has been a great American success story. We have \nseen both Medicare and Social Security bring our seniors out of \npoverty. Today, we have about 10 percent of our seniors in poverty \nrather than close to 50 percent prior to Social Security and Medicare.\n  During that debate, if one reads the Record, there was a major \nconcern about who could provide health care to seniors better--the \nprivate sector or the public sector through Medicare.\n  The reason the Congress, in its wisdom, decided to move forward with \nMedicare was because at least half the seniors could not find or could \nnot afford health care insurance in the private sector. Seniors and all \nof us who are getting older and using more medications and going to the \ndoctors more frequently understand that older Americans require more \nhealth care, more costs, and are not exactly the prize group an \ninsurance company goes for. They want my son and daughter in their \ntwenties and younger healthier people to balance out those of us who \nare getting older and needing more care.\n  We believed, as a great American value, it was important that older \nAmericans have health care. It was important that those who are \ndisabled have health care, be able to pick their own doctor, be able to \ngo where they choose to receive their care but that they would know it \nwas always there, it was stable, a constant premium; they would know \nwhat it would cost; they could pick their own doctor; and it has \nworked.\n  Since that time, there have been a lot of debates, and we have one \ngoing on today, about how to provide Medicare prescription drug \ncoverage. But the real issue is beyond that. It is about how to provide \nhealth care for older Americans.\n  The next big change that happened of which I was aware in 1997 when I \nwas in the House was to offer private Medicare HMOs. Also at that time, \nthere were major cuts made in Medicare for providers. I believe they \nwent way too far. Many of us have been trying to change that ever \nsince. There were cuts to hospitals, home health agencies, and doctors \nthat have affected people being able to get care.\n  At that time, something was put in place that was touted as this \ngreat new program. In fact, Tom Scully at the time predicted an \nOklahoma land rush of moves to private health plans in 1999. He said: \nYou are going to see seniors pouring into managed care Medicare.\n  In fact, that did not happen. That is not what happened. But what we \nhave seen happen, unfortunately, is what the former Speaker, Newt \nGingrich, talked about in terms of a strategy of cutting off resources \nso Medicare would wither on the vine, an effort to convince people that \nMedicare was not working, even though the majority of seniors know it \nis because they use it every day.\n  I found it interesting that back in 1997 there was a strategy paper \nput out by the Heritage Foundation, an extremely conservative \norganization that I know does not support Medicare as we have it today, \nadvising my Republican colleagues. They recommended a strategy to move \nto the private sector by doing four things: First, to convince \nAmericans that Medicare provides inferior medicine and poor financial \nsecurity. They set out to do that. We are\n\n[[Page S7278]]\n\ngoing to hear a lot about that in this Chamber, that it is inferior \nmedicine, even though seniors know that is not true. There is not \nevidence that is true, but we are going to hear a lot of talk--and we \nhave for 5 years--about how Medicare is not as good.\n\n  Second, convince Americans that Medicare cannot be sustained for \nlong. We have heard continually that we cannot afford it anymore. As my \ncolleague from Iowa pointed out, if there is concern about being able \nto afford it, it is only because we are spending the money on tax cuts \nfor the privileged few instead of beefing up Medicare and Social \nSecurity. So it is a conscious choice. It is a question of values and \npriorities that we have to decide every day, just as American families \ndo.\n  Third, compare or reform the Medicare system to the Federal Employees \nHealth Benefits Program. We hear a lot about that now: Seniors should \nhave the same kind of plan that we do. I happen to agree with that, but \nduring the tax debate I offered an amendment that simply said we are \ngoing to defer the tax cut to the privileged few at the very top, less \nthan 1 percent of folks who already received a tax cut 2 years ago; we \nare going to defer the next one until we can fund Medicare at the level \nthat Senators and House Members and other Federal employees receive. My \ncolleagues voted no on that issue. It would cost twice as much as in \nthe budget resolution--$800 billion instead of $400 billion--and, \nunfortunately, the majority voted no. But we are going to continue to \nhear about how we should have private sector plans instead of Medicare, \nand it should be the same as we receive.\n  I agree with that, and I am happy to offer my amendment any time \nfolks want to support it so we can pay for that benefit and make it \nreal for our seniors.\n  Finally, fourth, they said protect current beneficiaries. They said \nthe calculation was the private alternatives generated by the voucher-\nstyle option, private HMOs, would be so much more efficient and so much \nmore attractive that fewer and fewer seniors would decide to remain in \nthe traditional system. Hence, Speaker Gingrich's remarks that the \ntraditional Medicare system would wither on the vine because the demand \nfor that option would decline sharply over time.\n  Obviously, that is not true. Nine out of ten seniors in this country, \nwhen given a choice, have picked Medicare. Seniors have made their \nchoice. Since 1997 when they were given the option of private HMOs, \nthey have overwhelmingly said no.\n  It is very interesting; 89 percent of the seniors in this country \nright now are covered under Medicare, and 11 percent are covered under \na private sector HMO. Some do not have that option. In Iowa, there is \nnot a private sector HMO. In Michigan, only 2 percent of beneficiaries \nhave that option. Of the 64 percent of the seniors who have that \noption, only 11 percent of them have chosen to go into a private sector \nHMO.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an \nadditional 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, today I wish to debunk the myths we have heard and are \ngoing to keep hearing so that we can get through what is fact and what \nis myth and focus on what we need to be doing, which is to strengthen \nMedicare to cover prescription drugs.\n  I agree with Secretary Thompson who says we need to focus more on \nprescriptions. We can do that through traditional Medicare in which \nseniors overwhelmingly have voted to remain. We can make sure they have \ntheir own doctor, the stability of knowing what their cost is for their \npremium and their copay, and still update the system to modernize it, \nusing more technology, making sure we have more prevention, and making \nsure we have prescription drugs.\n\n  Fundamentally, I do not believe that is what this debate is about. If \nwe can agree that we are going to do it through Medicare, then I \nbelieve we can sit down with the dollars available and work up \nsomething together, and I hope we will because the seniors of this \ncountry have waited long enough. I am very hopeful we will be able to \ndo that.\n  I will briefly debunk what we are going to hear, unfortunately, and \nthat we have to get beyond.\n  First, seniors want the choice to be in a private plan. Obviously, \nnot true.\n  The private sector plans will offer seniors more choices, including \nprescription drugs. Unfortunately, many seniors do not have access to \nthe private plans, and there is not one offered in 80 percent of the \ncounties nationwide. So the choice is not available to them.\n  I find it interesting that my mother, who is a very healthy 77-year-\nold woman and plays on three golf leagues--I am so glad I have her \ngenes. I am very hopeful I will have the same opportunity she has had \nto enjoy her retirement. As a retired nurse, she chose an HMO. She is \nvery healthy. She wanted prescription drug coverage. She could get it \nthrough an HMO, so she chose a Medicare HMO. The problem was she got \ndropped. This has happened to thousands of seniors where the HMO \ndecides it is no longer financially viable for them to cover older \nadults under Medicare, and so they drop them. So my mother lost her \ndoctor. She liked the HMO she was in. It worked for her. She lost that \nopportunity.\n\n  So even in situations where people chose Medicare+Choice, the HMOs go \nin and out of the market. Forty-one thousand people in Michigan chose \nMedicare+Choice, and they were dropped because the plans go in and out. \nSo it is not dependable, it is not reliable. That is why the majority \nof seniors did not pick it--because they wanted the reliability of \ntheir own doctor, knowing it would be there, knowing it was not going \nto be complicated by new systems and new paperwork. They like Medicare.\n  We also hear that private plans will give seniors more choices while \nletting them continue to use their own doctor. Of course, that is not \ntrue because if one goes into an HMO or even a PPO and their doctor is \nnot part of that system, they do not have the opportunity to go to that \ndoctor or they may have to pay more to go to that doctor.\n  The private sector Medicare plans will save money; how many times \nhave we heard that? We hear that they are more efficient. In fact, it \nis just the opposite. They are not more efficient and, in fact, cost \nmore money than being in traditional Medicare.\n  In the year 2000, the General Accounting Office estimated that \npayments to Medicare HMOs exceeded the costs that would have been \nincurred by treating patients directly through traditional Medicare by \nan annual average of 13.2 percent. So it cost more for the folks who \nwent into the HMO, it cost Medicare more than if they had stayed in \ntraditional Medicare.\n  Two recent studies found that private health plan fees are about 15 \npercent higher than Medicare: This is the other part of the myth. \nFrankly, I think our providers would love it if we funded Medicare at \nthe same level as private insurance does because on average they would \nget 15 percent more dollars. We are cutting our doctors, hospitals, \nhome health agencies, and nursing homes. In the private sector, on \naverage, in some cases it is much higher than 15 percent more for the \nsame services. Surgical procedures I believe are closer to 25 percent \nmore in the private sector. So in terms of dollars, we would see higher \ncosts and higher rates.\n  The private sector plans have lower administrative costs than \ntraditional Medicare: How many times have we heard that? Many studies \nhave shown that Medicare has a lower overhead rate than private plans. \nMedicare has a 2 to 3 percent administrative cost. Private Medicare \nHMOs, on average, spend 15 percent on administrative costs, and some \nspend as much as 30 or 32 percent. So, again, it does not cost less. \nThe administrative costs are not less under private plans.\n  Finally, the myth that we can provide a Medicare drug plan like \nFederal employees benefits for under $400 million over 10 years, which \nis in the budget resolution--in fact, the numbers we have been given \nindicate to us that it would cost twice as much as what is in this \nbudget resolution. When given the opportunity, our colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle voted no on funding the same level that we \nreceive through Federal employee health insurance.\n\n[[Page S7279]]\n\n  So let's talk about myth, let's talk about facts, and let's get \nbeyond all of this and say seniors of this country have chosen \noverwhelmingly to stay in Medicare. They like Medicare. It works. It \njust does not cover prescription drugs.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator from Michigan yield for a question?\n  Ms. STABENOW. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. HARKIN. First, I preface my question by thanking the Senator from \nMichigan for her depth of understanding of the whole Medicare issue and \nalso for her clarity of argument. I should say her clarity of \nexposition, for exposing what this is all about. It is not about \ntinkering around with it; it is really about an assault on the Medicare \nsystem itself. So I thank the Senator from Michigan for pointing that \nout, and I hope the Senator will continue to do this so that the \nAmerican people understand what this is really about. It is about a \nfight for Medicare, whether we are going to have it.\n  Now, my question is this: As the Senator pointed out, Mr. Scully and \nothers, back when Medicare+Choice came in, were lauding it, saying we \nwere going to see seniors pouring into managed care Medicare. The \nSenator talked about how Mr. Scully said this was going to be an \nOklahoma land rush to move to private health plans, and the Republicans \nwho put up Medicare+Choice had all of these visions that seniors would \ngo into it. But as the Senator from Michigan pointed out, that did not \nhappen, did it? It did not happen.\n  Ms. STABENOW. That is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Now we only have 11 percent of seniors who chose that. I \nask the Senator from Michigan, does it somehow appear that since \nvoluntarily the Republicans could not get seniors into HMOs and private \nhealth care plans, there now seems to be an approach that we are going \nto force them into HMOs by doing away with the Medicare system and \nrestructuring it into a private HMO type system that would force the \nelderly to do what the elderly do not want to do? Does that seem to be \nthe kind of thing we see laid out in front of us?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Well, I think my colleague is very wise in pointing \nthat out. I often say that seniors made their choice and now our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle have said: We do not like \nthat choice. Pick again. You cannot have this choice. Door No. 1 is \nclosed and locked. You can only pick door No. 2. That is really what is \nhappening. Even among the fancy words, now we are hearing that under \nMedicare there will be the same prescription drug proposal, the same \nplan as our private plans; we are going to give the same prescription \ndrug plan. But then we hear, but other things will be better in the \nprivate sector plans, such as we will have more prevention; we will \nhave a better catastrophic cap; we will have other things that are \nbetter. So they are moving the words around.\n  It may appear that the prescription drug part is the same, but other \nthings will be better because of the belief--and there is a genuine \nphilosophical difference, there is a divide, about what is the best way \nto proceed. There are colleagues who believe that probably Medicare \nshould never have been enacted. I have heard it said it is a big \ngovernment program, it should be private insurance run, and they would \nlike very much to get back as close as they can to a privately run \nsystem.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Again, I thank the Senator for pointing this out. As the \nSenator knows, the majority of Republicans voted against Medicare when \nit came in, in 1965. Even my good friend Senator Dole, when he was \nrunning for President, said he voted against Medicare and he was proud \nof it.\n  Now I would give them that that is their philosophy, and that is \nwhere they are coming from. I understand that. I understand when Newt \nGingrich says he wants to have Medicare wither on the vine. I \nunderstand when the third ranking Republican in the Senate says the \nMedicare benefit ought to be done away with. That is their philosophy \nand that is where they are headed.\n  So again, I thank the Senator for pointing out that this is really \nthe goal.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Absolutely.\n  Mr. HARKIN. This is the goal that is out there, to destroy the \nMedicare system.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Absolutely.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Again, I ask the Senator from Michigan, when Medicare \ncame in, was it not because the private sector had failed in terms of \nelderly health care in America?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Absolutely.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Was that not the history? And if one has these private \nplans, that they are going to pick and choose, and they are going to \ncherry pick, and they are going to have a segregation of elderly pushed \noff in some corner someplace, begging for some kind of health care if \nwe do not have a universal Medicare system? Is that not what might \nhappen?\n  Ms. STABENOW. I think the Senator is absolutely correct. It is not \nthat there is not a place for private sector insurance, but when \nMedicare came into place, it was because half the seniors in the \ncountry could not find a private plan that would cover them or they \ncould not afford it. So there was such a huge need.\n  We as Americans have a basic value about making sure older Americans \ncan live in dignity and have access to health care and a quality of \nlife that they deserve, as well as those who are disabled. This is a \ngreat American value. I believe it is a great American success story. \nEven though there are those who since that time have been trying in \nsome way to undermine it, we should be proud as a country. I absolutely \nagree with colleagues who say it needs to be modernized. We can focus \nmore on prevention strategies.\n\n  In addition to prescription drug coverage, there are other ways we \ncan make the system better. We can use more technology, less paperwork, \nall of which are good. If we could get beyond the debate that says we \nshould move back toward the private sector, and somehow that is cost \neffective and saves money and the dollars will go further--none of \nwhich is true; there is no evidence of that--if we could get beyond \nthat, we could come up with a bipartisan plan that would be meaningful. \nThe seniors have been waiting for us to get the message. They want \nMedicare. They just want prescription drug coverage. They want it \nmodernized. But they want Medicare. They have been saying that loudly \nand clearly.\n  I hope we can get the message and work together to actually get it \ndone.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for her leadership on this issue.\n  Ms. STABENOW. We appreciate the opportunity to share this today.\n  We have a real opportunity here, as Members on both sides of the \naisle, to do something very meaningful. I hope we will do that rather \nthan debate whether or not Medicare has been successful and seniors \nwant choices. I believe we should look at the choice they made. It is \nvery clear. They want us to work together and get something done, and \ndo it in a way that will allow seniors to know that medicine, which is \nsuch a critical part of their lives and a great cost to their \npocketbook, will be covered or partially covered and they will receive \nsome assistance to be able to afford such a critical part of health \ncare today, which is outpatient prescription drugs. It is too important \nto people. We do not want them choosing between food and medicine in \nthe morning. We want them to have confidence that Medicare will cover \nand help with the costs of prescription drugs.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 847.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy], for himself, \n     Mr. Brownback, Mr. McCain, Mr. Reid, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. \n     Durbin, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Inhofe, Mrs. \n     Clinton, Mr. Kerry, and Mr. Schumer, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 847.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Amendments \nSubmitted.'')\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of \nmyself, Senators Brownback, McCain, Reid, Bingaman, Durbin, Cantwell, \nLeahy, Cornyn, Inhofe, Clinton, Kerry, and Schumer.\n  First, I wish to express my very sincere appreciation to the floor \nmanagers for giving us an opportunity to address this issue which is of \nenormous importance to a number of our servicemen and servicewomen. We \nhave debated matters of enormous importance in terms of our national \nsecurity during the consideration of the Defense authorization bill. I \nappreciate the patience given by the chairmen of the committee, Senator \nWarner, and Senator Levin, and I appreciate their willingness to give \nan opportunity for the consideration of this amendment.\n  I am very hopeful that after discussion of it there will be a \nwillingness to accept the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I understand we have a half an hour. I yield myself \nsuch time as I might use.\n  Mr. President, the amendment we are offering is a bipartisan effort \nintended to recognize the enormous contributions by immigrants in the \nmilitary. It gives immigrant men and women in our Armed Forces more \nrapid naturalization, and it establishes protections for their families \nif they are killed in action.\n  In all our wars, immigrants have fought side by side and given their \nlives to defend America's freedoms and ideals. One out of every five \nrecipients of the Congressional Medal of Honor, the highest honor our \nNation bestows on our war heroes, has been an immigrant. Their bravery \nis unequivocal proof that immigrants are as dedicated as any other \nAmericans in defending our country.\n  Today, 37,000 men and women in the Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force, \nand Coast Guard have the status of permanent residents. Another 12,000 \npermanent residents are in the Reserves and the National Guard. Sadly, \n10 immigrant soldiers were killed in Iraq. The President did the right \nthing by granting those who died posthumous citizenship, but it is \nclear that we must do more to ease the path to citizenship for all \nimmigrants who serve in our forces.\n  This amendment improves access to naturalization for lawful permanent \nresidents serving in the military. It provides expedited naturalization \nfor members of the Selected Reserves during military conflicts, and it \nprotects spouses, children, and parents of soldiers killed in action by \npreserving their ability to file for permanent residence in the United \nStates.\n  Specifically, the amendment reduces from 3 to 2 the number of years \nrequires for immigrants serving in the military during times of peace \nto become naturalized citizens. It exempts them from paying \nnaturalization filing fees, and it enables them to be naturalized while \nstationed abroad. Affordable and timely naturalization is the least we \ncan do for those who put their lives on the line to defend our Nation.\n  During times of war, recruiting needs are immediate and readiness is \nessential. Even though the war in Iraq has ended, our commitment to \nending global terrorism will continue, and more and more of these brave \nmen and women will be called to active duty. Many of them are members \nof the Selected Reserves.\n  I point out, for the benefit of my colleagues, we are just looking at \nthe Selected Reserves. There are a number of aspects to the Reserve \nunits. We have the Selected Reserves as a part of the Ready Reserve, \nbut we are just targeting this on the Selected Reserves. It does not \napply to the individual Ready Reserves, the inactive National Guard, \nStandby Reserve, or Retired Reserve. These are individuals who must \nkeep their competency up under regular kinds of training programs and \nare very much involved and integrated into the military units. Many of \nthe Selected Reserves have already been activated in the Reserve and \nNational Guard units, and many more expect to be called up at a \nmoment's notice to defend our country and assist in military \noperations.\n\n  Over the years, many Reserve and Guard units have become full \npartners with their active duty counterparts.\n  We saw that in Operation Iraqi Freedom, where you had the highest \nmobilization of our Reserves and Guard in recent years. Their active \nduty colleagues cannot go to war without them. Being a member of the \nSelected Reserves is nothing less than a continuing commitment to meet \nvery demanding standards, and they deserve recognition for their \nbravery and sacrifice. The amendment allows permanent resident members \nof the Selected Reserves to expedite their naturalization applications \nduring war or military hostilities.\n  Finally, the amendment provides immigration protection to immediate \nfamily members of soldiers killed in action. Provisions reached through \ncompromise will give grieving mothers, fathers, spouses and children \nthe opportunity to legalize their immigration status and avoid \ndeportation in the event of the death of their loved one serving in our \nmilitary.\n  It just permits them to be a permanent resident alien. Then they take \ntheir chances in moving along to become citizens.\n  We know the tragic losses endured by these families for their \nsacrifices, and it is unfair that they lose their immigration status as \nwell.\n  The provisions of the amendment are identical to those in S. 922, the \nNaturalization and Family Protection for Military Members Act, which \nalso has strong bipartisan support and is also endorsed by numerous \nveterans organizations such as the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Air \nForce Sergeants Association, the Non-Commissioned Officers Association, \nand the Blue Star Mothers of America.\n  The amendment is a tribute to the sacrifices that these future \nAmericans are already making now for their adopted country. They \ndeserve this important recognition. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to see that these provisions are enacted into law.\n  Th provisions of this amendment, reached through compromise, give \nimmigration protection to the family members of some slain soldiers. \nThey do not, however, offer protection to all family members, \nparticularly the ones who are undocumented.\n  Our duty to soldiers who give their lives does not depend on how \ntheir parents or spouses or children entered the United States. \nDeportation is never fair pay for the death of a family member. As we \ntogether enact these provisions, I will continue working to make sure \nthat we uphold our duties to all of our immigrant soldiers.\n  Mr. President, I have had a chance to talk to the chairman of the \ncommittee and the ranking member of the committee and to work with \ntheir staffs over a period of time to respond to a number of their very \nimportant questions that they have had, and I am hopeful that the \nSenate will accept this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this amendment will expedite the \nnaturalization process for noncitizen soldiers serving on active duty, \nin the Select Reserves, and will enact safeguards to protect\n\n[[Page S7281]]\n\nnoncitizen immediate relatives of American and noncitizen soldiers who \nare killed in action.\n  More than 48,900 noncitizens are currently serving in the United \nStates military on active duty and in the Selected Reserves. Hundreds \nare serving from the State of Nevada. They place their lives on the \nline for our country every day.\n  In recognition and appreciation of their service, they deserve a \nnaturalization process that does not unnecessarily delay the grant of \ncitizenship or impose other restraints because they are stationed in \nanother country.\n  These noncitizen soldiers love America so much they are willing to \nmake great sacrifices to protect us and promote our values and even \ndefend the Constitution--although they do not fully enjoy its \nprotections. They deserve better treatment than they currently receive.\n  Like many Americans, I am moved by the story of Airman Dilia DeGrego, \nwho is a legal resident of the State of Nevada.\n  Airman DeGrego's story is a tale of exemplary courage. She was born \nin Mexico and came to the United States at the age of 4. Airman \nDeGrego's family wanted so much for her to be a citizen that her mother \nrelinquished her parental rights and gave full custody of Airman \nDeGrego and her two sisters to her aunt and uncle who live in the \nUnited States.\n  Airman DeGrego joined the Air Force, in her words, because she wants \nto serve her country. Her Country. Airman DeGrego knows no other home \nthan the United States.\n  She is a proud member of the Air Force family and is a true patriot.\n  I am honored to tell you that last night Airman DeGrego sent a short \nmessage to my office stating that she has been granted an interview \nwithin the Office of Citizenship. She completed her message with two \nsimple yet overwhelmingly powerful statements. ``I have been blessed. \nGod, bless America.''\n  Who can say that active duty Airman DeGrego, citizen or not, is any \nless of a hero?\n  These noncitizen heroes have defended our liberty in every single \nGreat War in which our Nation has participated and represent over 20 \npercent of the recipients of the Congressional Medal of Honor.\n  This amendment will provide necessary relief to current noncitizens \nserving in active duty and the selected reserves within the United \nStates military by setting forth an expedited process of \nnaturalization.\n  The amendment will also provide protections for noncitizen spouses, \nunmarried children, and parents of citizen and noncitizen soldiers who \nare killed as a result of their service, to file or preserve their \napplication for lawful permanent residence.\n  This amendment is supported by the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the \nNational Guard Association of the United States, the Air Force \nSergeants Association, the Air Force Association, the Non-Commissioned \nOfficers Association, the Blue Star Mothers of America, the National \nCouncil of La Raza, the National Asian Pacific American Legal \nConsortium, the National Federation of Filipino American Association, \nthe National Association of Latino Elected Officials, the Mexican \nAmerican Legal Defense Fund, and the American Immigration Lawyers \nAssociation.\n  I rise today in support of action that will recognize and honor \ncurrent noncitizen soldiers serving in the United States armed forces \nand will honor the legacy of all of our soldiers who have been killed \nin action by providing fair and sympathetic treatment of their \nimmediate relatives seeking legal permanent residency.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter written by \nAirman Dilia DeGrego, who portrays exactly what the Senator from \nMassachusetts is saying about the tremendous sacrifice made by these \npeople who are willing to fight for our country--and they should be \ntreated accordingly--be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     To Whom It May Concern:\n       My name is Airman Dilia DeGrego, I am a United States \n     permanent resident presently active-duty military trying to \n     become a U.S. citizen. I was born in Mexico June 3, 1984 and \n     have been in the U.S. for about 15 years. I was brought here \n     by my aunt Martha Ayala, who is a U.S. permanent resident as \n     well, and my uncle, Antonio Ayala Jr. who is a U.S. citizen. \n     I lived with them until I left for the Air Force. When I was \n     12 my biological mother gave full custody of myself as well \n     as custody of my two younger sisters to my aunt and uncle. \n     The adoption was complete approximately two years later. My \n     parents sponsored my sisters and I and we received our \n     permanent residency about three years later in April of 2002. \n     I applied for my citizenship May 30, 2002. I have not \n     received a response from the immigration office. My dates are \n     not exact, but the INS has record of it all. February of this \n     year I got married in El Paso, TX to Brian Andrew DeGrego, \n     whom I love dearly and is also active-duty Air Force, \n     currently serving a remote tour in Osan Air Base, Korea. My \n     sisters received a permanent ``green card'' in October of \n     2002 and I did not receive anything. When I asked all I was \n     told was that because my citizenship was pending I would not \n     receive it. My original temporary permanent residency card \n     expired April 21, 2003. I currently have a duplicate that \n     expires December 21, 2003. I hope to receive some word about \n     my citizenship before then because if not I will have to take \n     leave and fly to El Paso, TX where my records are currently \n     being held. I have mailed in a change of address form with a \n     copy of my orders to the immigration office letting them know \n     that I am currently assigned at Nellis AFB, Nevada. I did not \n     receive word that they received my information. I currently \n     do not know my status. Pardon me for complaining, but I don't \n     think it's fair that I will have to keep renewing my ``green \n     card'' and not actually getting a permanent card. I went to \n     the Air Force and asked if I could apply through them to help \n     my situation. I was told I could not and would have to wait \n     until I get a reply from the INS office before the Air Force \n     could do anything. I have called the immigration office in El \n     Paso and received nothing more than a machine I have left \n     messages. As far as I know I have to wait three years of \n     being in the service or three years of being married to my \n     husband. If the bill is passed I will be able to apply for my \n     citizenship again August 2004. I don't understand where I am \n     now in my situation. Anything you could do to help would \n     be greatly appreciated.\n       I joined the Air Force to serve my country like many other \n     permanent residents and U.S. citizens. To me this is the \n     family that status did not matter, but I have experienced \n     difficulty in my career as Public Affairs. I am unable to get \n     an e-mail account or finish my security clearance thus unable \n     to go on the flight line. I am unable to perform my job \n     effectively. I am the base only staff writer for the base \n     paper ``The Bullseye'' it is my job to work with people on a \n     daily basis as well as all kinds of information. I cannot \n     attend certain meetings if there is any unclassified \n     information mentioned. I understand their reasons, but my job \n     is communication and because I am not a U.S. citizen I cannot \n     do my job the way it is suppose to be done. I am part of the \n     Air Force family and I will fight to do all I can to do the \n     best I can. It's unfortunate that I am in this situation, but \n     sometimes you have to get tossed around to finally settle in \n     somewhere. I love the Air Force and hope to be a proud member \n     for the years to come, because despite what any paper says in \n     my heart, I am a citizen. Serving as a member of the U.S. Air \n     Force only makes me a prouder one. I know my situation may be \n     common and that is why I can sincerely say that it would only \n     help my brothers and sisters if this bill is passed. Thank \n     you for your time and concern. God bless America!\n\n                                           Amn. Dilia DeGrego,\n\n                                       Air Warfare Public Affairs,\n                                                   U.S. Air Force.\n\n  Mr. REID. So I commend and applaud the Senator from Massachusetts for \noffering this amendment. And, of course, as he indicated, I am a proud \ncosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I commend my colleagues on this timely and \nvery compassionate initiative. I particularly thank, on my side, \nSenator Sessions, Senator Cornyn from Texas--who momentarily will \naddress this issue--and Senator Kyl, who talked to me this morning. He \nexpressed that the two of you had reconciled, in large measure, some \nconcerns that he had.\n  So I say to Senator Kennedy, we thank you for taking this initiative. \nWe have all worked diligently as a team to provide this situation. Each \nof us knows the distinguished service by those who come from lands \nabroad in the Armed Forces of the United States. It is a part of our \nhistory, and it is a traditional means of demonstrating the allegiance \nand commitment to the ideals of this Nation to which these individuals \nhave come to join our society.\n  I believe this amendment--which would shorten the waiting period from \n3 years to 2 years for noncitizen service members, both Active Duty and \nReserve, and which eliminates fees for\n\n[[Page S7282]]\n\nprocessing, and which extends an accelerated naturalization process to \ncertain spouses and parents and children of deceased alien members--has \ngreat merit and should be supported.\n  At this time, Mr. President, I yield such time as the distinguished \nSenator from Texas desires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee on which I \nserve, for his courtesy as well as that of Senator Levin, the ranking \nmember. And I especially state my appreciation to Senator Kennedy and \nthose others who have cosponsored this amendment. I am proud to be one \nof them.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to say a few words about this amendment, \nthe Naturalization and Family Protection for Military Members Act of \n2003.\n  In every war our Nation has fought, from the Revolutionary War to \nOperation Iraqi Freedom, brave immigrants have fought alongside \nAmerican-born citizens. They have fought with distinction and courage. \nTwenty percent of the recipients of the Congressional Medal of Honor, \nour Nation's highest honor for war heroes, have been immigrants.\n  One in 10 active duty military personnel call my home State of Texas \ntheir home. And as a member of the Armed Services Committee, I am \ndedicated to doing everything I can to look out not only for their \ninterests but for the interests of all military personnel, including \nimmigrants.\n  That is why earlier this year I introduced the Military Citizenship \nAct that will expedite the naturalization process for 37,000 men and \nwomen serving in our Armed Forces who are not U.S. citizens. I believe \nthere is no better way to honor the heroism and sacrifice of those who \nserve than to offer them the opportunity for American citizenship they \ndeserve.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of this amendment because I believe it \nfulfills a crucial responsibility to welcome those who fight for our \nNation and to help immigrants become naturalized citizens, providing \ntheir families easy access to naturalization and family immigration \nprotections.\n  All you need to do is look at this chart which sets out the scheme \nfor an alien military service member to seek naturalization under \ncurrent law. As you can tell, it is a sea of redtape and needless \nbureaucracy and is overly burdensome on those who want nothing more \nthan to earn the opportunity of American citizenship and who have \ndemonstrated their commitment to this Nation's ideals and values by \ntheir very service.\n  I believe it is time to do away with this sort of thing once and for \nall. This amendment and the provisions of this bill streamline the \nprocess and make it one that welcomes immigrant service members for \ntheir bravery and sacrifice and not one that sets up unnecessary \nobstacles to their becoming citizens.\n  I thank my distinguished colleagues for supporting the bill. I again \nexpress my appreciation to Chairman Warner for including language in \nthe Defense authorization bill that directs the Department of Defense \nto determine if any additional measures can be taken to assist in the \nnaturalization of qualified service members and their families.\n  I also strongly support the action of the President, retroactive to \nSeptember 11, 2001, to exempt military members from the requirement to \nserve 3 years on active duty before applying for citizenship. We must \nalways remember that our own freedom was not won without cost but \nfought and paid for by the sacrifices of generations who have gone on \nbefore us. We must honor the heroic dead for their courage and \ncommitment to the dream that is freedom, and we must honor the worthy \nheroes who fight today and embrace them as our fellow citizens.\n  In 1944, Winston Churchill spoke at Royal Albert Hall to the combined \nBritish and American troops and reminded them of a greater cause they \nserved, regardless of the bounds of nations or cultures. He said:\n\n       We are joined together in this union of action which has \n     been forced upon us by our common hatred of tyranny, shedding \n     our blood side by side, struggling for the same ideals, until \n     the triumph of the great causes which we serve shall be made \n     manifest. . . . Then, indeed, there will be a day of \n     Thanksgiving, one in which all the world will share.\n\n  In Iraq, the brave men and women of our Armed Forces and the \ncoalition forces fought against those who hate our Nation's values. \nThey hate us because we believe that all men are created equal \nregardless of their nation of birth, regardless of their religious \nfaith. They hate us because we believe in the God-given rights to life, \nliberty, and the pursuit of happiness, rights that extend to all \nmankind. They hate us because we still say: Give me your tired, your \npoor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.\n  These brave immigrant soldiers are taking on the uniform of our \nNation, serving under the flag of our Nation, and fighting the enemies \nof our Nation and our values. It is only right that they should be \nwelcomed as citizens of this great Nation.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, to my knowledge, there are no other \nspeakers on this side of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I commend Senator Kennedy and all of his \ncosponsors for offering this amendment. The Senator from Massachusetts \nhas identified a significant shortcoming in our current naturalization \nlaw. When we have people who are here legally, legal immigrants who \nhave green cards, who join the Armed Forces, who put their lives on the \nline for our Nation, the least we can do is to make it easier for them \nto become citizens through the naturalization process.\n  A number of things in this amendment highlight the clear and simple \nmessage we are trying to send to the men and women who are willing to \ngo into harm's way for us and to make the commitment to our Nation that \nmilitary service involves.\n  Just a few elements: Naturalization can be carried out abroad. Right \nnow that is not possible. Men and women of the military would have to \ncome here, back to the geographical limits of the United States, in \norder to become naturalized. They could be assigned abroad, on duty \nabroad, and surely we want to make it possible for them to file their \nnaturalization papers, to be interviewed, to take the oath to this \nNation abroad at U.S. embassies or consulates or military \ninstallations.\n  We also ought to take care of the members of the family of those who \nare killed or who die as a result of injury or disease that is incurred \npursuant to military service. Those families, those noncitizen spouses \nand unmarried children and parents, who could become citizens while the \nloved one is alive surely should not lose that status and protection \nwhen the loved one is killed or lost in action or as a result of injury \nor disease.\n  So what is done here is fundamentally human but also fundamentally \nsignificant in terms of what this Nation is all about. The men and \nwomen who are willing to join our Armed Forces to go and put their \nlives on the line for this Nation surely are owed a major debt by our \ncountry. One way we can in part pay this debt to them as well as to all \nmembers of the Armed Forces is to adopt the Kennedy amendment.\n  Again, I commend him and all the cosponsors for offering it.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to support this amendment, \nwhich provides a more expeditious naturalization process for the brave \nnoncitizens who serve in our Nation's military. It is a recognition of \nand an expression of appreciation for their dedication and sacrifice \nduring this time of conflict. Moreover, this amendment reflects our \nNation's compassion and gratitude to those who gave their lives in \ndefense of our freedom, as it grants, for the first time, derivative \nbenefits to the immediate family members of these fallen men and women \nwho only became citizens posthumously.\n  Senator Kennedy's amendment allows members of the military to apply \nfor naturalization after 2 years of service instead of 3 years. It also \nprovides for naturalization proceedings overseas so that the servicemen \nwho serve abroad may become citizens without having to travel back to \nthe United\n\n[[Page S7283]]\n\nStates at their own expense. In addition, the amendment benefits the \nimmediate family members of servicemen who died in combat and are \ngranted posthumous citizenship. Now, these family members will have at \nleast an opportunity to derive immigration benefits based on the \nposthumous grant of citizenship. Indeed, this amendment allows these \nfamily members to stay in the country for which their loved ones gave \ntheir lives.\n  I thank Senator Kennedy for his effort in reaching out for bipartisan \nsupport on this amendment, and for his willingness to accept the input \nand suggestions from Democrats and Republicans alike. In particular, I \nam grateful that Senator Kennedy accepted my proposal to close some \nloopholes so that alien smugglers and other worthy individuals do not \ninadvertently reap a benefit from this amendment. I am confident that \nthis amendment now appropriately reflects the values and virtues that \nare inviolable to all of us as Americans.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I am pleased to support this amendment \nto provide for the men and women who serve in our armed forces. I \nparticularly want to express my heart-felt appreciation to the families \nof servicemen who gave their lives in our fight for freedom and victory \nin Iraq.\n  This amendment accomplishes three purposes. First, for permanent \nresidents who serve honorably in our Armed Forces, it changes the \nwaiting period from 3 years to 2 years of service in order to begin the \nnaturalization process. This provision also requires the Department of \nDefense to formulate a policy to ease and facilitate naturalization for \nthese men and women.\n  Secondly, the amendment provides a process of immediate \nnaturalization for our selected reserve Armed Forces serving during a \ntime of hostility. In today's military, we rely heavily and \nstrategically on our reservists, and it is only fair to extend this \nbenefit to reserve as well as active duty personnel serving our country \nin a time of war.\n  Thirdly, the amendment benefits the immediate family members of \nservicemen who are U.S. citizens killed in combat. These immediate \nfamily members may be non-immigrants who rely on the citizenship of \ntheir spouse, father or mother, or even son or daughter to adjust their \nstatus to become permanent residents and eventually citizens \nthemselves. In honor and respect of U.S. citizens who die in combat, \nthis amendment will provide their families the temporary ability to \ncontinue the immigration process.\n  This amendment further compliments a bill that my Georgia colleague, \nSenator Miller, and I passed in the Senate 2 months ago. That \nlegislation expedites the granting of posthumous citizenship to \nimmigrant soldiers who die in combat. Our bill and the amendment \noffered today reduce the waiting periods, eliminate the red tape, and \nreward those who serve in our armed services and especially those who \nmake the ultimate sacrifice while defending freedom.\n  Today we will adopt an amendment to further respect servicemen like \n19-year-old Diego Rincon from Conyers, GA, who was killed in Iraq. \nThese members of our armed forces, whether citizens or permanent \nresidents, and their families should be fully appreciated for their \nservice to our country, and in some cases, receive the benefit of \ncontinuing the process to become citizens.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Kennedy \nand McCain today in submitting an amendment to honor the contributions \nof immigrants who have shown their dedication both to this country and \nto creating a better future for themselves by joining the military. \nThis amendment will do two critically important things: it will offer \neasier access to naturalization for immigrant men and women of our \narmed forces, and it will establish immigration protections for their \nfamilies if they are killed in action.\n  Having just been through a tough period of war, it is especially \nimportant to recognize those who fight on our behalf to preserve our \nfreedom and our way of life. This is particularly true for those \nimmigrants who have too often given their lives to defend our \nprinciples.\n  This is poignantly illustrated by an anecdote from the President's \nvisit to Bethesda Naval Hospital with his wife, Laura, back in April. \nIn the press conference afterward, visibly moved by the heroes he met, \nhe noted a special moment for him--witnessing two wounded soldiers \nsworn in as citizens of the United States. As the President put it \nhimself, ``You know we got an amazing country where so powerful, the \nvalues we believe, that people would be willing to risk their own life \nand become a citizen after being wounded. It's an amazing moment. \nReally proud of it.''\n  The President's words speak to exactly why this legislation is so \nimportant--and so worthwhile. These men and women are willing to risk \ntheir own lives on our behalf, even though they are not yet citizens of \nthis country.\n  In fact, there are more than 30,000 noncitizens on active duty in the \nU.S. military--approximately two percent of the total U.S. forces--who \nare willing to risk their lives on our behalf without the privileges of \ncitizenship. In the Reserves and the National Guard are another 20,000 \nnoncitizens. These immigrants have proven a dedication to our country \nby joining the military or the Reserves or National Guard, dedication \nwhich should be recognized and rewarded.\n  Our amendment will do that. First, it provides easier access to \nnaturalization to members of the armed services who are already lawful \npermanent residents. Currently, being a member of the armed services \nallows a permanent legal resident to reduce their wait time for \nnaturalization from five years to three years--our legislation would \nreduce the time to only two years. It would also ease this process by \nallowing naturalization interviews and oath ceremonies abroad at U.S. \nembassies, consulates, and overseas military installations, and by \nwaiving naturalization fees.\n  In addition, the language provides for the immediate families of \nimmigrant service personnel killed in action by either giving them the \nopportunity to legalize their immigration status or by allowing them to \nproceed with their own applications for naturalization as if the death \nhad not happened. By protecting their immigration status, this element \nprovides critical acknowledgment of the sacrifices that the families of \nour military members make as well.\n  Finally, the amendment remembers those courageous men and women who \nensure that in times of war or hostility, our country is ready and our \nrecruiting needs are met, by saying that members of the Reserves or \nNational Guard will have expedited naturalization during times of war \nor hostile military operations.\n  It is easy to see why so many groups are supporting this amendment--\nfrom the Veterans of Foreign Wars to the Non-Commissioned Officers \nAssociation to the National Council of La Raza to the National Asian \nPacific American Legal Consortium, among others.\n  This amendment on the naturalization and family protection for \nmilitary members is a vitally important piece of legislation that both \nhonors and rewards immigrants to this nation. They are already legal \npermanent residents--this simply ensures that they have the opportunity \nto truly become a part of this country through citizenship. Therefore, \nI urge my colleagues to support this amendment today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I observe no other speakers to this \nimportant amendment. The managers of the bill are prepared to take it \non a voice vote. Therefore, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Massachusetts yield back \nhis time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 847.\n  The amendment (No. 847) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we will proceed to a second amendment. \nPrior to that being done, I wish to advise the Senate there is a third \namendment regarding the BRAC process which will\n\n[[Page S7284]]\n\nbe introduced by the Senator from North Dakota and the Senator from \nMississippi. At this time, so the Senate is aware, we will ask for the \nyeas and nays on the amendment that will be offered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no amendment offered.\n  Mr. WARNER. We will wait.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from North Dakota is here. If I \nyield, he can go forward. I am happy to withhold.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am waiting for Senator Lott. I know he \nis near the Chamber. As soon as he arrives, we are ready to go. The \nSenator from Nevada may proceed first.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 848\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 848.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for himself, Mr. \n     McCain, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. \n     Jeffords, Ms. Collins, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. \n     Murray, and Mr. Biden, proposes an amendment numbered 848.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To permit retired members of the Armed Forces who have a \n service-connected disability to receive both military retired pay by \n reason of their years of military service and disability compensation \n     from the Department of Veterans Affairs for their disability)\n\n       At the appropriate place in title VI, add the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. FULL PAYMENT OF BOTH RETIRED PAY AND COMPENSATION \n                   TO DISABLED MILITARY RETIREES.\n\n       (a) Restoration of Full Retired Pay Benefits.--Section 1414 \n     of title 10, United States Code, is amended to read as \n     follows:\n\n     ``Sec. 1414. Members eligible for retired pay who have \n       service-connected disabilities: payment of retired pay and \n       veterans' disability compensation\n\n       ``(a) Payment of Both Retired Pay and Compensation.--Except \n     as provided in subsection (b), a member or former member of \n     the uniformed services who is entitled to retired pay (other \n     than as specified in subsection (c)) and who is also entitled \n     to veterans' disability compensation is entitled to be paid \n     both without regard to sections 5304 and 5305 of title 38.\n       ``(b) Special Rule for Chapter 61 Career Retirees.--The \n     retired pay of a member retired under chapter 61 of this \n     title with 20 years or more of service otherwise creditable \n     under section 1405 of this title at the time of the member's \n     retirement is subject to reduction under sections 5304 and \n     5305 of title 38, but only to the extent that the amount of \n     the member's retired pay under chapter 61 of this title \n     exceeds the amount of retired pay to which the member would \n     have been entitled under any other provision of law based \n     upon the member's service in the uniformed services if the \n     member had not been retired under chapter 61 of this title.\n       ``(c) Exception.--Subsection (a) does not apply to a member \n     retired under chapter 61 of this title with less than 20 \n     years of service otherwise creditable under section 1405 of \n     this title at the time of the member's retirement.\n       ``(d) Definitions.--In this section:\n       ``(1) The term `retired pay' includes retainer pay, \n     emergency officers' retirement pay, and naval pension.\n       ``(2) The term `veterans' disability compensation' has the \n     meaning given the term `compensation' in section 101(13) of \n     title 38.''.\n       (b) Repeal of Special Compensation Programs.--Sections 1413 \n     and 1413a of such title are repealed.\n       (c) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections at the \n     beginning of such chapter is amended by striking the items \n     relating to sections 1413, 1413a, and 1414 and inserting the \n     following:\n\n``1414.

Mr. President, I rise today with Senators McCain, Dorgan, \nInhofe, Bill Nelson, Jeffords, Collins, Edwards, Bingaman, and Murray \nto offer an amendment on behalf of our Nation's disabled veterans.\n  This amendment would end the longstanding injustice that prevents \ndisabled veterans from drawing the disability compensation and \nretirement pay they have rightfully earned. It sounds unusual, but it \nis true. This prohibition on ``concurrent receipt'' has plagued our \nveterans for more than a hundred years.\n  First, I thank Senators Levin and Warner for their support on this \nissue year after year. As a result of their dedication, deliberation \nand fairness in conference, we have been able to make some progress \neach year, and I commend them for the work they have done. The \nestablishment of the special compensation programs has ensured that \nabout 30,000 veterans can receive the benefit of both retirement pay \nand disability pay. But there are still hundreds of thousands of \ndisabled veterans who need our help.\n  Many people wonder why we return to this issue year after year in an \nattempt to keep this fight alive. After all, the White House and the \nPentagon are opposed to concurrent receipt, and we are told by OMB \nthere is no money for it. So why take up the struggle year after year \nin this environment?\n  For me, it is simply a matter of fairness. Why would we deny a \nveteran who served honorably for 20 years the right to the full value \nof his retirement pay because his service caused him to become \ndisabled? That is what this terribly unfair law does. A retired and \ndisabled veteran must deduct from his retirement, dollar for dollar, \nthe amount of disability compensation received. In many cases, the \neffect is to totally wipe out the retirement pay. The end result is \nthat the disabled military retiree loses all the value of his 20 or \nmore years of service to our Nation. We don't subject any other Federal \nretiree to this kind of offset--only our disabled military retirees.\n  Let me give you a specific example that strikes close to home for \nthis Senator. MAJ Len Shipley is a decorated Marine Corps officer from \nHenderson, NV. He served combat tours in Vietnam and in the first Gulf \nWar. He retired in 1993 with 26 years of honorable service--13 years \nenlisted and 13 years as an officer. Tragically, last year, Major \nShipley developed Lou Gehrig's disease, a terminal illness for which \nthere is no cure. This disease kills most of its victims within 18 \nmonths of diagnosis. There are exceptions, of course, and I hope Major \nShipley is one of them. But in all likelihood, he doesn't have much \ntime left to live.\n  Subsequent to this diagnosis, the VA found Major Shipley to be 100 \npercent service-connected disabled. He was drawing his full retirement \npay prior to receiving his disability rating, but once he was found to \nbe entitled to disability compensation, he lost almost $2,400 of his \nmonthly retirement pay because of the prohibitions on concurrent \nreceipt. Major Shipley's wife, already a Navy reservist, has been \nforced to work overtime as a nurse in the local hospital to make ends \nmeet. Her husband's disability--and now the loss of the retirement pay \nhe has been collecting for more than a decade--has impacted her family \nseverely.\n  We should be doing things to make Len Shipley's life better, not \nworse. He served his country honorably. The restriction on concurrent \nreceipt is fundamentally unfair, unwise, and unsound policy. We should \nfix it.\n  I understand the new special compensation programs were designed to \nhelp veterans like Len Shipley, but he was told he does not qualify for \nthis Severely Disabled Compensation Program because he received his \ndisability rating more than 4 years after his retirement. Mr. \nPresident, Lou Gehrig's disease does not pause to consider when its \nvictims retired from the military.\n  We still don't know whether Major Shipley will qualify under the \nCombat Related Special Compensation Program. I hope the program will be \nfairly administered, but I am already concerned about a Pentagon ruling \nthat excludes the National Guard and Reserve forces from eligibility \nfor special compensation benefits. I hope this is simply a mistake by \nthe Pentagon that will be corrected immediately. If you are combat \ndisabled and retirement eligible, why should it matter whether\n\n[[Page S7285]]\n\nyou served on active duty, the National Guard, or the Reserves? It was \nnever the intent of Congress to exclude the National Guard and Reserves \nfrom the Special Compensation Program.\n  But these special compensation programs are necessary only because \nthis ancient prohibition on concurrent receipt is still on the books. \nIt is time to finally end the prohibition, get rid of the special \ncompensation programs, and lift this unfairness from the backs of the \ndisabled veterans.\n  The support for concurrent receipt in the Congress is clear. I have \nmentioned a few cosponsors of this most important amendment, but I \nbelieve if we shopped it, most of the Senate would sign on. About 90% \nof the entire 107th Congress was on record supporting full concurrent \nreceipt in the 2003 National Defense Authorization Act. Disabled \nmilitary retirees were extremely disappointed when the legislation fell \nshort after a veto threat by President Bush.\n  So it is time for us to demonstrate a sense of fairness to our \nretired disabled veterans. Let's end this prohibition once and for all. \nI urge my colleagues to support this most worthy amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I commend Senator Reid for his constancy \nand his commitment to this cause. His leadership has been nothing less \nthan extraordinary. Last year, the legislation, which he initiated, to \nrepeal this prohibition had 82 cosponsors. He has continued to fight \nfor this repeal, fight the administration's significant opposition. I \nsupport that effort, and I think it is particularly important at a time \nwhen we have troops being shot at in Iraq and in Afghanistan. We know \nsome of our service members are going to suffer injuries and \ndisabilities because of that service and service elsewhere. We must \nassure them that if they complete a military career, they will not be \ndeprived of the benefits they have earned. So I support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, our committee through the years has \naddressed this very important amendment. I, too, commend the \ndistinguished Senator from Nevada, who has been the spearhead, together \nwith others, on this issue. He has enumerated others, including Senator \nMcCain on this side, who have fought so hard for this measure. Senator \nLevin just spoke of his endorsement, and I now add mine.\n  I don't wish to prolong this because in last year's record I spoke \nextensively on this measure. Each time I have addressed it, I have \nmentioned I have had two brief tours of active military duty, but \npretty much of a lifetime association with the Reserves and the Guard \nin my State and others. My military career is insignificant compared to \nthat of many valiant members of the Armed Forces, generations of whom, \nhopefully, are to be benefited, quite properly and justifiably and \nfairly, by this legislation.\n  I see no further speakers on our side.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I may say one thing, the Senator from \nVirginia has stated--and I heard him say this--his military career is \ninsignificant. The Senator's military career, of course, was \nsignificant. Anybody who serves in the military adds to the dimension \nof our defense posture in the country.\n  I want the record to reflect that the armed services, the men and \nwomen who serve in the U.S. military, have been improved as a result of \nthe service of the Senator from Virginia as a member of the Senate. He \nhas been devoted to the committee that is now handling this \nlegislation, and the teamwork the Senator from Virginia has shown with \nthe Senator from Michigan--talk about insignificant, mine is really \ninsignificant; I have had no military service. I proudly serve in the \nSenate, doing what I can to help those people who have served in the \nmilitary and are serving in the military.\n  My service in trying to accomplish what I think is important for the \nmilitary is really insignificant compared to the work done by the two \nmanagers of the bill. When the history books are written about this era \nof our country, there will have to be a chapter about what has been \ndone by the two Senators who are managing this bill for their \ncooperation, partnership, and for moving this legislation forward.\n  It would be very easy to have a very agitated relationship. We do not \nhave that here. Senator Warner and Senator Levin set an example for the \nrest of the Congress as to how people can work together, even though \ntheir views may not always be in sync, to work together for the \nbetterment of the country.\n  I thank them very much for working so hard on this legislation, as \nthey have over the years. But for the two of them, as I have already \nstated on the record, we would not be anywhere. We can pass all kinds \nof legislation in the Senate, but when it passes Statuary Hall and goes \nto the House, many times issues are gone.\n  As a result of the work of Senator Warner and Senator Levin, veterans \nin this country will forever be helped.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator from Nevada yield?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield, but before yielding--I was going \nto say this--the Senator from North Dakota has been--I am trying to \nfind a word to describe the push and pull, the ability to put \nlegislation at the forefront of what we do. The Senator from North \nDakota has done a remarkable job. But for him, we would not be where we \nare.\n  I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wish to observe that what the Senator \nsaid about the chairman and ranking member is something most all of us \nin the Senate believe. They are two extraordinarily able people, and I \nam proud to serve with both of them. I think they produced a good piece \nof legislation.\n  I especially wish to say, as coauthor of the concurrent receipt \nlegislation with Senator Reid, I am pleased this will be accepted. My \nunderstanding is this will be part of the bill in the Senate. It is the \nright result for disabled veterans. I am very pleased they are allowing \nus to make this a part of the bill today. I thank Senator Reid for his \nleadership.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am deeply humbled by Senator Reid's kind \nremarks. I wish to say, certainly this is not about my own career. I \nalways felt I benefited more from my brief tour of military service \nthan did the military for my service in those days. I tried to, in a \nsense, pay back so that other members of the service today can have the \nsame and greater benefits than I had. I would never have received a \ncollege education in all probability had it not been for the GI bill.\n  Although I did serve twice, I never placed myself in the category of \ncombat arms and the valorous heroes of this great country but did my \nduty, as millions of others have, and was privileged to do so.\n  On the Committee of Armed Services, no one could have a more \nwonderful working partner than my colleague from Michigan. We have sat \nside by side this quarter of a century, but we have achieved a high \nwater mark of bipartisanship because we are really there to be \nresponsive to the needs of the men and women of the Armed Forces and \nthe overall security needs of our country. As each President has sent \nforth his message to the Congress, we have done our best to fulfill \nthat message.\n  I thank my colleague from Nevada and thank my colleague from \nMichigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I must add a word of gratitude to Senator \nReid for his always gracious commentary. This institution could just \nsimply not function as well as we do with all of the roadblocks we face \nwithout Senator Reid. He is utterly unique in this institution in terms \nof moving the process forward. When we have setbacks or differences, he \nhas overcome more of those than any other person in this Chamber as he \nserves as our assistant Democratic leader. I think everybody on both \nsides of the aisle is very much in his debt for his work, as well as \nfor his excessively flattering comments for which I am personally \nindebted. I thank Senator Dorgan as well for his comments.\n  One word about Senator Warner. Like him, I always look forward to our \nwork on the Armed Services Committee. To put it in a nutshell, I have\n\n[[Page S7286]]\n\nbeen blessed to have him as a partner. I just cannot conceive of having \nsomebody with whom I would rather work on issues than having Senator \nWarner working on them as he does day in and day out. I agree with \nSenator Reid, it would not diminish his contribution militarily----\n  Mr. WARNER. We must move on, Mr. President.\n  (Laughter.)\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will take that as my time is up. I yield back the \nremainder of my time on Senator Warner.\n  Mr. WARNER. Senator Levin should know my sentiments.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I want to discuss Senator Reid's \namendment, which would permit retired members of the Armed Forces who \nhave a service-connected disability to receive both their full military \nretired pay and disability compensation.\n  On March 27, I held a Personnel Subcommittee hearing with my \ncolleague Senator Nelson specifically about this issue of concurrent \nreceipt. Our colleague, Senator Reid of Nevada, was the first to \ntestify, and he was followed by Undersecretaries Dan Cooper and Charlie \nAble and several experts from the General Accounting Office, \nCongressional Budget Office, and various veterans groups. There was a \nlot to learn about the intricacies of Federal benefits and \ncompensation, but ultimately the hearing reinforced the fact that this \nlegislation is extraordinarily complex and expensive.\n  All said though, I intend to support this amendment because this \ncompensation is long overdue for our Nations' veterans. It is \nunfortunate that the cost of concurrent receipt is so high, but \nAmerica's veterans have earned their benefits through their long \nservice to our Nation.\n  Last year, Congress funded a form of special compensation for retired \nsoldiers who had certain combat-related disabilities. The first check \nfor this limited compensation will be cut on July 1, 2003, and this is \ngood news for those veterans who qualify. This is an important step in \nthe fight to help our nation's veterans but we must do more.\n  These benefits for veterans and their families are important and we \nshould honor those who interrupted their lives and the lives of their \nfamilies to defend this country and preserve our freedom.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in strong support of the \namendment offered by my friend and colleague from Nevada. This proposal \nto overturn current law that prohibits concurrent receipt of retired \npay and disability benefits for military retirees with 20 years of \nservice is long overdue. I believe the current policy is unfair and \nthat our military retirees should receive their entire benefits \npackage, just as any other Federal worker would.\n  Last year, the administration and leaders of the House and Senate \nArmed Services Committees negotiated a compromise that partially \nrepealed the dollar-for-dollar offset for certain military retirees who \nalso receive VA disability pension benefits. Although the passage of \nthis provision represented a step in the right direction, I recognize \nthat many veterans who sacrificed to defend our freedom did not benefit \nunder the compromise signed into law last year. That is why I am proud \nto support, once again, the amendment before us today to fully repeal \nthe dollar-for-dollar offset.\n  I have the highest respect for the men and women who have served our \nNation in uniform. I congratulate the Senator from Nevada for his \nleadership on this important issue and I am pleased to join him and \nothers today in honoring the sacrifice of the veterans in my State who \nhave served our Nation so well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 848.\n  The amendment (No. 848) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we are about to turn to an amendment by \nour colleague from North Dakota and our colleague from Mississippi. I \nsay to these two fine, outstanding colleagues, while I must oppose this \namendment, I have rarely seen such extraordinary tenacity as exhibited \nby these two Senators in their strong convictions with regard to the \nmatter that is about to be put forward. I wonder if the two Senators \nwill offer the amendment, and then I wish to do a housekeeping measure \nwith regard to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 849\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk on behalf \nof myself, Senator Lott, Senator Durbin, Senator Boxer, Senator Snowe, \nand Senator Bingaman, and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota (Mr. Dorgan), for himself, \n     Mr. Lott, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Boxer, Ms. Snowe, and Mr. \n     Bingaman, proposes an amendment numbered 849.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wonder if I may ask for the yeas and \nnays on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the reading of the \namendment is dispensed with.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To repeal the authorities and requirements for a base closure \n                             round in 2005)\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, add the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. REPEAL OF AUTHORITIES AND REQUIREMENTS ON BASE \n                   CLOSURE ROUND IN 2005.\n\n       (a) Repeal.--The Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act \n     of 1990 (part A of title XXIX of Public Law 101-510; 10 \n     U.S.C. 2687 note) is amended by striking sections 2906A, \n     2912, 2913, and 2914.\n       (b) Conforming Amendment.--Section 2904(a)(3) of that Act \n     is amended by striking ``in the 2005 report'' and inserting \n     ``in a report submitted after 2001''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that any votes \nordered with respect to H.R. 1588 be postponed to occur at 2:50 p.m. \ntoday; provided further, that immediately following disposition of any \npending amendments, the bill then be read a third time and the Senate \nproceed to a vote on passage, as provided for under the previous order. \nI further ask unanimous consent that passage of S. 1050 be vitiated, \nand that following the passage of H.R. 1588, the Senate substitute be \nprinted as passed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my understanding is we have 15 minutes on \nour side in support of the amendment; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment has 30 minutes equally divided. \nThe Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wish to be reminded when I have consumed \n5 minutes.\n  This amendment is really quite simple. It would rescind the \nprovisions of law that now exist authorizing a round of military base \nclosures in the year 2005. The Senate actually voted on this a couple \nyears ago, in a relatively close vote, regarding an amendment offered \nby Senator Bunning, supported by Senator Lott and myself.\n  I bring the amendment to the floor with my colleague, Senator Lott \nfrom Mississippi, today for a number of reasons. Let me begin to \ndescribe them.\n  First of all, President Bush says--and he is right--we are at war, a \nwar against terrorism. We do not know when the war will end. We do know \nthat on 9/11 2001, this country was struck by terrorists. Since then we \nhave sent our forces to fight a war in Afghanistan and a war in Iraq, \nand we know there are significant other challenges that confront us. \nYet the 2005 base-closing round, the one that provides for a BRAC \nCommission, was conceived prior to 9/11.\n  The shadow of 9/11 is long and has changed virtually everything. But \nwe have not changed our pre-9/11 notion that we should have a base-\nclosing round in 2005. Before 9/11 Secretary Rumsfeld said: Let's close \nas many bases in one round as we did in all four previous base closure \nrounds.\n  There are two reasons I think this is a bad idea. No. 1 is a military \nreason. We do not know what the military is going to look like 5, 10, \nand 20 years from now. We do not know how big it is going to be. We do \nnot know the force\n\n[[Page S7287]]\n\nstructure. We do not know where our troops will be based. We have no \nidea how many troops will be based in Asia, in Europe, or the United \nStates.\n  If we bring troops home from Europe, for example, where will we base \nthem in the United States? We have mechanized divisions in Europe that \nwere there to protect Western Europe against the Communist threat from \nEastern Europe. But, of course, the Warsaw Pact and Communist Eastern \nEurope no longer exist. So will we bring those divisions home? If so, \nwhere will we house them?\n  We know the Army does not have enough large mobilization bases. That \nwas proved when we mobilized the Guard and Reserve in the war against \nIraq.\n  So all of these issues beg this question: What is the threat? Is the \nthreat different now since 9/11? The answer is, yes. Do we know the \nanswers to how will we reconstruct, reconfigure, and reformulate our \ndefense establishment and our military to respond to this new threat? \nAs it is now, before we develop the answers to that question, we will \nbe propelled into a round of base closings that, in my judgment, could \nbe very counterproductive to our military preparedness.\n  We might need more bases for homeland security purposes in this \ncountry, rather than fewer bases. I do not know. But before we know, \nthe Pentagon wants to go ahead with a round of base closings which \nitself will be very expensive and very costly.\n  Two things: One, everything has changed since 9/11, except we still \nhave in place this requirement for a BRAC round in 2005. It ought to be \nstruck at this point. If there is unneeded capacity, let us respond to \nthat and do it in a thoughtful way. But let's not put every military \ninstallation in this country at risk of being closed.\n  Second, I cannot think of a worse time to be considering this. We \nhave an economy that is sputtering in this country. It is weaker than \nwe would like it to be. In every major city, where there is a military \ninstallation, if an investor is told, oh, by the way, this military \ninstallation could very well be closed as a result of a 2005 BRAC \nround, what do you think an investor is going to do? What do you think \na lender is going to do? They are going to say, we have to wait.\n  There is no quicker way to stunt economic growth in cities with \nmilitary installations than to say there is going to be a BRAC round in \n2005. Virtually every single military installation will be at risk of \nclosure. In some States, and in some communities in those States, that \nclosure of a military installation, according to studies, will mean \nthere will be 20- to 30-percent unemployment.\n  Do you think it stunts the economic growth in those communities right \nnow to have that specter in front of their military installation? The \nanswer is, yes, of course.\n  So for two reasons, one a military reason and the other dealing with \nthe precarious position of this country's economy, we ought to scrap \nthe 2005 base-closing round. That does not mean that we should not be \nable to close some military installations that represent excess \ncapacity. Of course, we should. But we ought not to create a commission \nthat is required to meet in 2005, with a judgment that every military \ninstallation in this country will be at risk and potentially on the \nlist. We ought not do that in contradiction to what we know is in the \nbest interest of this country's military needs and also economic needs.\n  That is why Senator Lott and I have offered this amendment. We have \nhad some close votes on these issues, and they should not be \nrepresented as votes between people who believe we should never close a \nbase versus those who believe we should always use a BRAC. I think \nthere is room in between. It is just that at this time, at this place, \nat this intersection, with respect to our military needs and also our \neconomic requirements, we ought not leave in law a requirement for the \n2005 base-closing round. So I hope very much that we will receive a \nfavorable vote on our amendment.\n  I am mindful that the White House senior advisers would recommend a \nveto to the President if this bill had this in it. I am sure my \ncolleagues will point that out.\n  I cannot conceive of a President vetoing this bill because of this \nparticular provision. This bill is a big bill. It is a good bill. \nSenator Warner and Senator Levin have given the administration almost \nall they want and need in this bill. This is a significant Defense \nauthorization bill. I cannot conceive of an administration upset that \nwe scrapped the 2005 base-closing rounds and then decide that they \nshould veto this bill. I simply do not think that will happen. They \nhave every right, of course, to use that as a technique prior to our \nvote to say vote for this and we will veto the bill, but I do not think \nthere is a ghost of a chance of them doing that.\n\n  I do think it is in the public interest, both for military and \neconomic reasons, for the amendment that Senator Lott and I are \noffering to be passed by this Senate and to go to conference in the \nDefense authorization bill with the House of Representatives.\n  I know my colleague from Mississippi wishes to speak. I thank him for \nhis cosponsorship. He has worked on this issue for a long while, not \njust this year or just last year. Senator Lott has felt very strongly \nabout the process of BRAC and its consequences, and I am pleased to \njoin with him to express these concerns today and hope that we will get \na favorable vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the generous effort \nput forward by the Senator from Virginia, Mr. Warner, and his ranking \nmember on the Armed Services Committee, Mr. Levin, to make sure we had \nan opportunity to offer this amendment. He could have been so disposed \nto try to block it or stiff us or in some other way undermine the \neffort to have a full debate and a vote on this issue but he chose not \nto do that. I do appreciate it very much. He is always generous and \nkind, and he has proven that is the way he is proceeding on this \namendment and this bill also. So I thank him.\n  I have worked very closely on Defense authorization bills ever since \nI came to the Senate some 15 years ago. I served on the Armed Services \nCommittee for a number of years, I think almost 7 years. I worked there \nwith Senator Warner, Senator McCain, and others in a bipartisan way. I \ncan remember struggling as leader to find the time to carve out for the \nDefense authorization bill to be passed so the appropriators did not \nhave to just move forward without an authorization bill, which I think \nis not a good way to proceed. Quite often, it took a couple of weeks to \nget it done. This year, this bill, which is I think one of the best \nDefense authorization bills I have seen in a long time, got through in \nalmost record time, at least in recent history.\n  We were told that it might actually get through in 2 days. Well, I \ndid not believe that, but I think when all of it is added up it may be \n5 days, which with a bill of this importance and this magnitude, it is \nstill warp time, and it is because the committee did a good job. They \nhave a good bill, and I commend them for that. So my support of \nthis amendment in no way should be an indication that I do not \nappreciate the work that has been done and the considerations that have \nbeen given of the issues that I really do care about and that are in \nthis bill.\n\n  I think the record will also show that I have been consistent on this \nBRAC idea. Just a little history that maybe I should offer today, going \nback to when I was in the House of Representatives and I was the \nRepublican whip in the House and on the Rules Committee. One day I was \nambling up the center aisle and I met up with this young Congressman, \nmaybe on his first or second term, named Dick Armey from Texas. He had \nthis brilliant idea called BRAC, the Base Realignment and Closure Act. \nHe wanted to know how he could get that done. I look back on it and \nquestion my judgment, but I told him as a member of the Rules Committee \nand the Republican leadership, well, this is probably how you would \nneed to do that and how you would need to proceed, and explained what \nhappened in the Rules Committee.\n  At that point, I said I do not agree with what you are trying to do. \nI think this is an abdication of responsibility. We should not be doing \nthis, and if you think this is going to take politics out of it or make \nit easier, you have not been around long enough.\n\n[[Page S7288]]\n\n  Well, dang if he did not go out and do it. So I am partially to \nblame, I guess, for the process that was put in place by that young \nCongressman who went on, of course, to be the majority leader.\n  The reason why I think it is an abdication of responsibility is, \nlook, we have closed bases before. We did it after World War II. We did \nit after the Korean war. We did it after the Vietnam war. How do I \nknow? I know of bases all around my region of the country: Brookley Air \nForce Base in Mobile, AL, the Greenville base, the Grenada base, the \nGreenwood base in my own State, lots of bases. How was that done? The \nPentagon, particularly the military service personnel, looked at these \nbases, at what the requirements were and where the redundancy was. They \nmade recommendations to Congress of what bases needed to be closed. In \nmany instances, I do not know exactly how it worked, they either had to \naffirmatively approve it or, if they did not disapprove it, they could \nbe closed. We could work that process out but, no, no, we want a \nprocess where we can say, no, I do not see it; I do not hear it; I am \nnot involved, do not tell me about it; I do not want it.\n  What is the responsibility of the executive branch and the \nlegislative branch? That is to do our job. I think this process takes \nout the considerations that can be given by a Congressman or by a \nSenator who knows about a base in Virginia or Montana or wherever it \nmay be. They know all the ramifications, what the needs are, what the \nproblems would be if it is closed.\n  I have never liked this process. The process has not been that unfair \nto me or to my State. We fared pretty well but then we do not have a \nwhole lot of bases as compared to other States. But we were on the \nlists. Oh, yes, we were on the lists. There were bases that really \nshould not have even been on the list. It does affect the economy and \nit does affect the people.\n  The cities and the States go out and hire Washington people who used \nto work on the Hill or worked at the Pentagon to be lobbyists.\n  Millions of dollars will be spent across America in fearful \nanticipation of this next round of BRAC, even in places where they are \nnot going to be closed.\n  I have urged those responsible, if you are going to do this, target \nit where there is redundancy and there needs to be closure; specify \nthose areas, and do not say, well, it could be every base. If you \ndon't, hundreds of bases will be on the list. If they have been on the \nlist before, they may be again. Everyone will run out and start trying \nto deal with this problem.\n  Some say people are not really worried about it. Once a month, I do a \nsatellite feed to television stations in my State. Almost every month I \nget a question: What is happening on BRAC? Are we going to be on the \nlist? They are in fearful anticipation. One in particular I refer to \nprobably will not be on the list, but they are scared to death.\n  I question it on that basis. If you think this takes politics out of \nthe process, take a look at the last process during the 1990s. There \nwas a lot of concern about some on the list or taken off the list. \nHuman beings are involved. They will use every tool they can to affect \nit or protect themselves. We should not think this is some pure \nprocess. It is not.\n  Also, the timing. We have been through 2\\1/2\\ rounds. We still are \ndealing with some of the aftermath of that, the cleanup. Could we \nreacquire them? Have they been transferred to the cities and States? \nWhen will we know the full benefit or the detriment of that? Sometime \nlater on. The timing now is what bothers me.\n  We have troops all over the world, thousands in Asia and Europe and \nAfghanistan and Iraq, fighting a war--not a battle, a war on terrorism. \nThen we will say, well, we are going to start closing bases. What about \nsome bases in Europe? We have been talking about that for 20 years. \nBefore I came to the Senate, we were talking how we needed to take a \nlook at our basing requirements in Europe. The Soviet Union is gone. \nDidn't anybody notice? Yet we are still positioned in Europe as if we \nwere going to go with tanks and heavy equipment into the Soviet Union. \nWhen are we going to get around to this?\n  In defense of the Pentagon, they are busy, they have a lot going on, \nand they have done a great job. They have not had the time, perhaps, to \ndecide what we are going to do in Okinawa and South Korea and the rest \nof Asia and Europe and what the future will hold. That is my point. Why \nshould we do this?\n  Before we start closing bases in America, we need a full assessment \nof what our needs are around the world. Will we bring the troops back? \nWhat will our efforts be to protect forces and be mobile? What do we \nneed here?\n  I could have maybe gone along with a deal and said we will go forward \nwith this once we have done the assessment and have identified what we \nwill change in Europe.\n  I have learned around this place, never say never. I could conceive \nof a time and a circumstance where maybe this would need to be done. At \nthis particular time, we have not properly assessed our needs. We are \nat war. It sends a terrible signal, and it is bad for the economy. We \nare trying to get the economy going, and it has a negative impact on \nthe economy.\n\n  Colleagues, look at what has been identified here. The criteria for \nthis round include military value. Does it have value as a military \nasset? Should it be eliminated or outsourced? Read that language \ncarefully. Does it have value as a military asset? Is that a way of \nsaying, Do we need the Corps of Engineers? Should it be eliminated or \noutsourced? Outsourced, is that what is behind all of this?\n  Jointness: Does the base possess multiservice functionability? What \ndoes that mean, we are going to combine Air Force and Navy pilot \ntraining? Have we thought that through?\n  Preservation of training areas: Does the base have unique training \nareas hindered by encroachment or environmental issues? That is a good \nthing to consider.\n  Homeland defense: Does it play a vital role in homeland defense? That \nis interesting. We should consider that. And cost and its economic \nimpact.\n  One of the areas that worries me, my impression is a lot of attention \nwill be given to health-related installations. Look down the list. We \nare talking about Army health clinics, a clinic in Alaska, talking \nabout medical groups in Alabama. I am not sure that is the place we \nneed to focus either. It will have an effect on military personnel and \non our veterans at a time when we are making a commitment to them under \nTRICARE and telling our military personnel they will have good health \ncare service. Are we going to be looking at closing the facilities \naround the country? Beware.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment. This would knock it \nout of the 2005 round. Maybe 2006 would be considered. Maybe something \ncould be worked out in conference. I invite my colleagues to pay \nattention to this. This will wind up being a huge problem is my \nprediction.\n  Mr. WARNER. It is always a challenge, Mr. President, to go toe to toe \nwith my distinguished colleague from Mississippi. The citizens are \nblessed for having such a powerful and respected voice in the Senate. \nWe have had a long and strong relationship. I am still proud to call \nyou leader. And you exhibit that leadership and have done so \nmagnificently, particularly here recently.\n  Quickly, I digress from what I intended to say by way of opening with \na couple of points. That is, the BRAC process will not begin until \nCongress has received and reviewed an overseas basing master plan from \nboth the administration and an independent commission to Congress \nauthorized in the bill. Both of these reports should be available by \nAugust 2004. That is an important point raised. We have addressed it. \nThat information will be before the Congress.\n  Second, under the law as written, the Senator brings out a series of \npoints about what this law does to protect us. There is quite a litany \nof steps. Congress will have numerous opportunities during the process \nto affect BRAC actions.\n  First, Congress will review by joint resolution the proposed BRAC \ncriteria submitted by the Department of Defense to Congress in February \n2004.\n  Second, Congress will review the DOD proposed force structure in \nFebruary 2004 and can pass legislation at any point in the process to \nterminate the authority.\n\n[[Page S7289]]\n\n  Third, Congress can exercise ``advise and consent'' prerogatives on \nnominees to the BRAC commission.\n  Fourth, Congress has 45 days after receiving the commission's list of \nrecommended base closures and realignments to pass a motion of \ndisapproval.\n  The law has carefully been drawn to protect the interests of the \nseveral States and to give the tools to its elected representatives, \nSenate and House, to step into this situation at a series of junctures \nto protect the interests of their constituents as this process goes on.\n  I pick up on another phrase used by my distinguished leader. With \nrespect to the BRAC process, he enumerated his long association. \nIndeed, I have had quite an association with it myself. I suppose I go \nback to 1969 to 1974 when I was in the Navy Secretariat and had the \ndecision to close, for example, the Boston Naval Shipyard and the \nNewport, RI, destroyer base. I am reminded of that on the floor of the \nSenate with great frequency by the colleagues from those distinguished \nStates.\n  Nevertheless, in those days we did not have a BRAC process. The \nSecretary of Defense, in consultation with his Service Secretaries--\nNavy, Army, and Air Force--moved unilaterally.\n  Congress came in. I remember going through days of hearings in the \nSenate caucus room. There must have been a dozen cameras focused on us \nwhile the various Members of the Congress berated this humble public \nservant, and the Chief of Naval Operations sitting next to me, with \nregard to the faulty process. Nevertheless, we had to move on.\n  At that point in time, we were overburdened with an infrastructure \nthat simply no longer was needed to support the size of the forces we \nhad. That is the very thing we are confronted with today.\n  For example, since the late 1980s, the Department has reduced force \nstructure by 36 percent. That is the numbers of men and women in \nuniform, Guard and Reserve. But infrastructure--that is the barracks, \nthe bases, the airfields, the training grounds that support that \nforce--has been reduced only by 21 percent. That is showing the total \ndisjunction between force level personnel and infrastructure to support \nand train those personnel.\n  A 1998 DOD BRAC report to Congress, validated by the Congressional \nBudget Office, indicated the Department of Defense had 23 percent \nexcess capacity. That basically still remains. I ask my colleagues, \nwhat businessperson in your State does not evaluate their \ninfrastructure and determine what is needed and what must be disposed \nof in order to maintain the basic profit line and viability and the \nability to keep its employees? Of course, we accept that as a pattern \nof business.\n  I say most respectfully, the Department of Defense is a business, a \nvery large business involved in a mission that is vital to the \nsecurity, today, tomorrow, and in the indefinite future of this \ncountry. The management of that business--four Presidents in sequence \nand the Secretaries of Defense acting under those Presidents--has come \nbefore the Congress and asked for the authority to bring into alignment \nthe base structure as this country is rapidly moving, under the \nleadership of the current Secretary of Defense, to a transition of the \nArmed Forces so we can keep apace with modernization; whether it is the \nsmart bombs we saw that were used in the most recent conflicts, or the \nnew ships that are on the drawing board, or, frankly, the lifestyles of \nthe soldiers, sailors, and marines.\n  When I was privileged to serve--we mentioned that more than we should \nthis morning--I remember I slept in a barracks with 50 people all in \none room. I was only 17 or 18. We got quickly adjusted to the \nlifestyle. We shared all types of facilities in World War II.\n  Today, we try to give our men and women of the Armed Forces living \ncompartments, once recruit training is completed, where they have a \ncertain measure of privacy and personal dignity that I think is owing \nto these people who volunteer today.\n  We cannot retain much of this infrastructure which is outdated, which \nstill requires that it be heated, painted, maintained, drawing down O \nfunds vital to build new facilities for the men and women of the Armed \nForces.\n  I could go on about the needs of the services, but I bring to the \nattention of the Senate the letters that have been forwarded to this \nbody. As a matter of fact, the letter approved by the President of the \nUnited States has just been sent to me at this very moment.\n\n  I will ask unanimous consent, during the course of this debate, that \nI can have printed in the Record letters from the Administration. \nIndeed, one from the Secretary of Defense makes it very clear that:\n\n       The authority to realign and close bases we no longer need \n     is an essential element of ensuring the right mix of bases \n     and forces within our warfighting strategy as we transform \n     the Department to meet the security challenges of the 21st \n     century.\n\n  Then the concluding paragraph--this particular letter went to the \nHouse of Representatives, but basically an identical one is being \ntransmitted to the Senate:\n\n       If the President is presented a bill to repeal or delay \n     BRAC, then I [the Secretary of Defense] would join other \n     senior advisers to the President in recommending that he veto \n     any such legislation.\n\n  Also accompanying that letter is a letter to me of 3 June, by the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, supporting this current posture \nof BRAC; namely, that it is law today and joining me in urging Senators \nnot to vote for the present legislation. I will quote the Chairman, \nGeneral Richard Myers:\n\n       In an environment where resources are scarce, we must \n     eliminate excess physical capacity to allow for increased \n     defense capability focused on ``jointness.''\n\n  There we are. The two spokesmen who are entrusted by law--not the \nBRAC law but the overall framework of the law of the United States as \nit relates to our security structure--these two men state unequivocally \ntheir opposition to the amendment that is presently before this Senate.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 13, 2003.\n     Hon. Duncan Hunter,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,\n     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I write to reiterate the importance we \n     place on conducting a single round of base closures and \n     realignments in 2005. We have just seen our troops \n     demonstrate an unprecedented effort in fighting for freedom \n     and against terror. But as I have expressed before, in the \n     wake of September 11, the imperative to convert excess \n     capacity into warfighting ability for potential conflict is \n     enhanced, not diminished. The authority to realign and close \n     bases we no longer need is an essential element of ensuring \n     the right mix of bases and forces within our warfighting \n     strategy as we transform the Department to meet the security \n     challenges of the 21st century.\n       Through base realignment and closures (BRAC) we will \n     reconfigure our current infrastructure into one in which \n     operational capacity maximizes both warfighting capability \n     and efficiency. BRAC 2005 will also help the Department \n     eliminate excess physical capacity--the operation, \n     sustainment, and recapitalization of which diverts scarce \n     resources from defense capability. BRAC's ability to achieve \n     significant savings has been thoroughly reviewed and \n     validated by both the Congressional Budget Office and the \n     General Accounting Office.\n       With the continuing demands of the global war on terrorism \n     we must seek every efficiency to meet our national security \n     needs. Now more than ever we have an imperative to convert \n     excess capacity into warfighting ability.\n       If the President is presented a bill to repeal or delay \n     BRAC, then I would join other senior advisors to the \n     President in recommending that he veto any such legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Donald Rumsfeld.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   Chairman of the\n\n\n                                        Joint Chiefs of Staff,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 3, 2003.\n     Hon. John W. Warner,\n     Chairman, Armed Services Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: To ensure the security challenges of the \n     21st century are met, we must continue to transform the joint \n     force. Capitalizing on the recent successes in Iraq and \n     Afghanistan, BRAC 2005 provides us the opportunity to \n     configure our infrastructure to maximize capability and \n     efficiency.\n       In an environment where resources are scarce, we must \n     eliminate excess physical capacity to allow for increased \n     defense capability focused on ``jointness.''\n       I strongly support needed infrastructure reductions \n     facilitated by BRAC 2005.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Richard B. Myers,\n\n                                                   Chairman of the\n                                            Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n  Mr. WARNER. I want to return to Senator Lott's comment when he said \n``Never say never,'' which indicates maybe someday a BRAC procedure. \nSenator Lott very accurately portrayed the turmoil in the States, the\n\n[[Page S7290]]\n\ncities, the towns, and the villages where military installations are \nlocated. It is a very painful procedure by which the Department has to \nevaluate each of those installations and make the determinations which \nare no longer needed for the viability of a modern military. \nConsequently, the mayors, the city councils, the Governors are working \nvery hard--I know in my State--as they are in each of your States at \nthis time to prepare themselves for the unknowns of BRAC. Considerable \ndollars in the local budgets, and in the State budgets, are expended to \nhire those individuals they believe are expert in how best to go before \nthe BRAC Commission, should a base or a facility in that State be put \non the DOD list. The Governors can address that Commission, and indeed \nthe Members of Congress, to state the case for not closing a base.\n  All this is going on at great expense. As Senator Lott said, ``Never \nsay never.'' Congress has spoken. It has put a law on the books under \nwhich our President is currently operating. He has indicated he is not \ngoing to let that law be removed. So if we take action today and send a \nsignal that the Senate is repealing the previous law, there is a long \ncourse of uncertainty as to whether or not that decision by the Senate \nwill stand. This President, whom I have come to respect enormously, \nwhen he says he is going to do something, does it. These communities--\nas Senator Lott says, ``Never say never''--will be in a great state of \nuncertainty for an indefinite period of time.\n  I do not say this by way of any threat. It is my own opinion. I \nbelieve the law that has been adopted by the President, that is in \nforce, is going to stay in force. We better recognize that and get on \nwith the business of this Nation to properly enable those of \nresponsibility to realize the force and base structure of this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, an hour from now, we will have the \nopportunity to vote on an amendment pertaining to whether or not we go \nforward on the process called BRAC, the Base Realignment and Closure \nAct. For the last 20 years, we have debated in the House and the \nSenate, and around the country, whether or not we should take a look at \nour military bases--Army, Air Force, Navy, and Marine--to determine \nwhether or not we have the right bases with the right mix of personnel \nwith the appropriate aircraft, ships, and tanks, and decide whether the \nmen, women, equipment, and materiel are where the bases are. We might \nhave some bases that need to be closed, or perhaps we have some bases \nwhere we simply need to move men, women, equipment, and materiel to \nsome other base where it makes more sense to maintain them.\n  Over the last month or two, we have debated our budget at some \nlength. Today we find ourselves in a deplorable situation with respect \nto our budget deficit. Two or three years ago, we enjoyed the largest \nsurplus in our Nation's history. This year we are looking at what might \nbe the largest budget deficit that we will have ever had.\n  I, for one--and I know I have many colleagues who feel this way, \ntoo--do not worship at the altar of a balanced budget, but I sure care \nabout getting closer to a more balanced budget. When I was Governor of \nDelaware, we cut taxes 7 out of 8 years. We also balanced the budget in \n8 straight years.\n  One of the things I found troubling about the tax cuts Congress just \npassed is that we do not come close to balancing the budget this year, \nnext year, or for the next 10 years. That is a problem for our country. \nBut we have taken the action that we are going to take with respect to \ntaxes, and now, over the next several months, we will be turning to the \n13 appropriations bills.\n  About a year ago, when we were discussing military spending, we had \nthe opportunity to decide whether or not we wanted to take another \nclose look at our military base structure, largely in this country but \nalso outside this country, to see if we have it right: if we have the \nbases, the personnel, the weaponry, and the military equipment where we \nneed it in the 21st century. There is some reason to believe we do not. \nThe wars we have just fought in Iraq and Afghanistan were different \nfrom the one in which I served in southeast Asia. Subsequently, the \nwars of the 21st century--I hope there are none, but history would \nsuggest that there probably will be--those wars are going to be \ndifferent from the ones we had in the last century.\n  Our military leadership tells us in this administration, just as they \ndid in the last administration, and as they did during the Reagan and \nBush 1 administrations, that from time to time we need to look at our \nbase structure and determine whether or not it is appropriate for the \nthreats we face. I, for one, believe it is time to take another look at \nwhere we have our bases, how they are structured, and how they are \nmanned.\n  To the extent we find bases that ought to be closed, for they simply \ndo not have the personnel to support or the missions to demand that \nkind of infrastructure, then we ought to have the political courage, as \ndifficult as it is, to close them.\n  We have a whole lot at stake in my State. The largest employer in the \ncentral and southern part of my State is Dover Air Force Base. It is a \ngreat base, with a great reputation. We would like to think they are \nimmune from the threat BRAC might pose, but I suppose one never knows. \nWe have worked hard, and people on the base work hard, to make sure \nthey will never be on a short list for BRAC.\n  I spent about 5 years on active duty and another 18 years in the \nReserves as a naval flight officer. I have been stationed at any number \nof bases which, frankly, ought to be closed, if one looks at the people \nwho were assigned to a particular base. Large bases with plenty of \nhangar space, plenty of space in the exchange and the other parts of \nthe base, but not many people. I have been on other bases where they \nmay have had the people who were stationed there but they did not have \nthe support, whether it was the child development centers, schools, or \nother services for families.\n  This is not a bad time, as we face the threats of this century to our \ncountry, to look at the kind of military we are trying to shape.\n  Much is said of this administration's effort, led by Secretary \nRumsfeld, to reshape and reform our military. Actually, a lot of the \nchanges were undertaken in the last administration under the leadership \nof President Clinton and his Department of Defense Secretaries.\n  We want a military that is leaner in terms of personnel. We want a \nmilitary that is better trained, better equipped, and better uses \ntechnology. We want a military that is able to deploy more quickly to \ntrouble spots around the world. The threat we face, as we all know, is \ndifferent today than it was 10 or 20 years ago. A lot different.\n  That also suggests to me this is a good time to slow down, to take \nstock, to assess where we have our men and women and materiels \nstationed around this country and the world and ask ourselves, does \nthis allocation make sense? In many cases, it will; in some cases, it \nwill not.\n  When we talk about budget deficits and bemoan the fact we have this \nhuge budget deficit today, I don't want to hear from the \nadministration, well, there is one thing we could have done to help \nwhittle down that budget deficit a little bit without threatening our \nability to defend ourselves or express our strength and extend our \nmilitary strength around the world. I don't want it said that we undid \nwhat we agreed to do a year or two ago. I hope when we vote in less \nthan an hour that we will support the position we took last year, we \nwill let this commission be formed, we will let them do their work, and \nwe will provide plenty of input to the commission as they do their work \nin our respective States, and in the end have an opportunity for an up-\nor-down vote on whether or not the status quo is just fine--I think it \nis not--or whether some changes are needed. Fair, reasonable, pragmatic \nchanges are needed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, today, I offer my support of the Dorgan \namendment and oppose the base closing round scheduled for 2005. The \nworld has changed since this legislation was voted on in 2001. I \nopposed it then and I oppose it now because we must complete an \nevaluation of our basing needs for the 21st century. And this argument \ncarries more weight in this post-September 11 world.\n\n[[Page S7291]]\n\n  Since we passed the base closing legislation in 2001, we have had the \nSeptember 11 attacks, the war in Afghanistan, and the war in Iraq. Our \nmen and women in uniform are operating under a tremendously demanding \noperations tempo. Until we are able to evaluate the lessons of these \nconflicts and how they should impact our base structure, it seems \nfoolish to rush ahead to a base closing round that was conceived prior \nto September 11.\n  A number of New York installations have played a vital role in our \nhomeland security as well as military action in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nAs we know, troops from the 10th Mountain Division, Light Infantry, \nfrom Fort Drum fought in Operation Anaconda in Afghanistan and also \ncontributed troops to Operation Iraqi Freedom. New York's Air National \nGuard units in Niagara Falls, Syracuse, Newburgh, Scotia, and Long \nIsland have all contributed to homeland security or important missions \nabroad. And New York has numerous other installations that play an \nimportant role in our national defense and homeland security. Because \nour security needs have grown so much at home and abroad, we need to \nconduct a full evaluation of how our military bases fit into our \nhomeland security structure before we push ahead with another base \nclosing round.\n  Our troops need to know that we support them in their efforts. And \nstanding by a bill that was passed in the months before September 11 \ndoes a disservice to them. It places communities under tremendous \nstress to have to prepare for a base closing round. As Senator Dorgan \npoints out, it seems wasteful to ask communities in this economic \nclimate to devote scarce resources to prepare for this round of base \nclosures. And New York is no exception.\n  Until we can have a full debate on what form our post-9/11 military \nbase structure should take, I will support the Dorgan amendment and \noppose a 2005 base closing round.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor of the \namendment offered by Senators Dorgan and Lott to repeal the provisions \nin the fiscal year 2002 Defense authorization bill that authorize an \nadditional base closure round in 2005.\n  Even before the horrific attacks of September 11, 2001, I along with \nmany of my colleagues had serious questions about both the integrity of \nthe base closing process itself as well as the actual benefits \nrealized. Now, with acts of war committed against the United States, \nwith Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom ongoing, \nwith our reservists having been calledup and our troops being deployed \nand the unpredictability of future missions, this is not the time to be \nconsidering the closure of additional bases. Indeed, now, more than at \nany time in recent history, I believe it is absolutely critical that \nthis Nation not sacrifice valuable defense infrastructure.\n  In addition, as we proceed in the stand up of the Department of \nHomeland Defense, we are still trying to understand the domestic \nmilitary requirements of our nation. Until there is a complete \nassessment of these needs, we simply can't afford to lose more bases. \nAfter all, during previous base closure rounds over the last decade, \nthe Northeast alone lost 49 bases, roughly 50 percent of what we had \nprior to BRAC. Furthermore, 173, or just under 35 percent of the \ninstallations on the East Coast, were closed during the previous \nrounds. Although the Department of Homeland Security will not take the \nplace of the Department of Defense, all of our military installations \nwill no doubt play a critical and prominent role in homeland security.\n  Instead of chasing illusive savings, I believe the Department of \nDefense needs a comprehensive plan that identifies the operational and \nmaintenance infrastructure required to support the services' national \nsecurity requirements. Once property is relinquished and remediated, it \nis permanently lost as a military asset for all practical purposes.\n  The administration and proponents of additional base closure rounds \npoint out that reducing infrastructure has not kept pace with our post \nCold war military force reductions. They say that bases must be \ndownsized proportionate to the reduction in total force strength. \nHowever, the fact of the matter is, there is no straight line corollary \nbetween the size of our forces and the infrastructure required to \nsupport them.\n  Keep in mind, that force levels may have to be revisited once again \nin light of the new anti-terror mission our military faces, and may \nwell require an increase. So would we then go and buy back property \nthat we have given up in future base closure rounds to build new bases \n- I think not.\n  The Department of Defense hopes to eliminate 23 percent of its base \nstructure in the 2005 BRAC round. That would exceed the 21 percent \nclosed in all four of the previous rounds. Before we legislate defense-\nwide policy that will reduce the size and number of training areas \ncritical to our force readiness, the Department of Defense ought to be \nable to tell us, through a comprehensive plan, the level of operational \nand maintenance infrastructure required to support our shifting \nnational security requirements.\n  Proponents argue that the administration's approach will be based \nupon military value and removes parochial and political factors from \nthe process, but in reality, the administration's Efficient Facilities \nInitiative is more similar to past BRAC rounds than one might think. \nMuch has been made of the de-politicization of the process by including \n``military value,'' ``jointness,'' and the other criteria in the \nlegislation. However, review of the last process reveals that these \ncriteria are nearly identical to those used in the 1995 round. This is \nvery disturbing, because in my view, the past BRAC rounds were not fair \nor equitable, and were not based solely on military value.\n  I have been through BRAC before. And I have to say, I know how the \ncriteria can be twisted to the advantage or disadvantage of a given \nfacility. In fact we had not one but two Air Force generals defending \nthe former Loring Air Force Base before a past BRAC commission; yet the \nAir Force claimed its facilities were ``well below average''--and this \ndespite the fact that $300 million had been spent there over a ten year \nperiod to replace or upgrade nearly everything on the base and it ended \nup being closed on so-called ``quality of life'' issues even though \nthat was never supposed to be part of the criteria.\n  I strongly believe Congress must also consider the economic impact of \nbase closures on communities in light of the uncertainty regarding the \nnation's economy and in those communities whose economy is tied to \nmilitary installations, the threat of closure will provide a deterrent \nto any recovery.\n  In August 2001, GAO issued an overview on the status of economic \nrecovery, land transfers, and environmental cleanup in communities that \nlost bases during previous BRAC rounds. GAO found that the short term \nimpact of a base closure was traumatic for the surrounding community \nand that economic recovery was dependent on several factors including \nthe strength of the national economy, federal assistance programs \ntotaling more than $1.2 billion, and an area's natural resources and \neconomic diversity.\n  Keep in mind, this assessment was done during a time of unprecedented \neconomic growth and as GAO stated, the health of the national economy \nwas critical to the ability of communities to adjust: ``Local officials \nhave cited the strong national or regional economy as one explanation \nof why their communities have avoided economic harm and found new areas \nfor growth.'' GAO also noted: ``Local officials from BRAC communities \nhave stressed the importance of having a strong national economy and \nlocal industries that could soften the impact of job losses from a base \nclosure.''\n  With the slow-down of the economy, communities may not be able to \nrebound to the extent they have in previous years. Indeed, it is vital \nto note that not every community affected by base closures has fared so \nwell in the past--those in rural areas still experienced above average \nunemployment and below average per capita incomes.\n  Advocates of base closure allege that billions of dollars will be \nsaved, despite the fact that there is no consensus on the numbers among \ndifferent sources. These estimates vary because, as the Congressional \nBudget Office explains, BRAC savings are really ``avoided costs.'' \nBecause these avoided costs are not actual expenditures and cannot be\n\n[[Page S7292]]\n\nrecorded and tracked by the Defense Department accounting systems, they \ncannot be validated, which has led to inaccurate and overinflated \nestimates.\n  The General Accounting Office found that land sales from the first \nbase closure round in 1988 were estimated by Pentagon officials to \nproduce $2.4 billion in revenue; however, as of 1995, the actual \nrevenue generated was only $65.7 million. That's about 25 percent of \nthe expected value. This type of overly optimistic accounting \nestablishes a very poor foundation for initiating a policy that will \nhave a permanent impact on both the military and the civilian \ncommunities surrounding these bases.\n  I want to protect the military's critical readiness and operational \nassets. I want to protect the home port berthing for our ships and \nsubmarines, the airspace that our aircraft fly in and the training \nareas and ranges that our armed forces require to support and defend \nour nation and its interests. I want to protect the economic viability \nof communities in every state. And I want to make absolutely sure that \nthis nation maintains the military infrastructure it will need in the \nyears to come to support the war of terrorism. We must not degrade the \nreadiness of our armed forces by closing more bases, certainly not at \nthis time. Certainly not without information on our future defense \nneeds that we do not have.\n  In closing, I reaffirm my opposition to legislation authorizing \nadditional BRAC rounds and encourage my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting the Dorgan/Lott amendment.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the amendment in \nquestion. I don't think anyone in the U.S. Senate is looking forward to \nthe upcoming BRAC round in 2005, including myself. BRAC will have a \nnegative impact in Georgia should any of the bases or posts in my state \nbe closed.\n  However, I am convinced fiscal realities and some over capacity \nissues exist which we absolutely need to address, and if we don't do it \nnow we will have to do it later. Putting off the BRAC 2005 round now \nwill only prolong the anxiety in our communities surrounding our \nmilitary installations.\n  The Department of Defense has stated that they are as much as 25 \npercent over-capitalized in their installations across the country. I \ndo not agree with that assessment but I believe that if we are serious \nabout transforming the military for the 21st Century then we need to \nreduce capacity to more closely equal our force structure needs.\n  I personally have 13 major defense installations in my State of \nGeorgia, and we are preparing now for the 2005 BRAC round. We have a \ntremendous amount to be proud of at every one of our Georgia \ninstallations and I never pass up an opportunity to say how proud I am \nof the soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, Department of Defense (DoD) \ncivilians--and their families--who serve at our bases. They have served \nour country well. And I believe our bases in Georgia are essential to \nthe national security of the United States. All you have to do is look \nat the recent conflict in Iraq and see that Georgia's bases were all so \nstrategically important. Georgia will prove that to the BRAC Commission \nwhen they come to visit us in the coming months.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I oppose the Pentagon's plan for a new \nround of military base closures in 2005. California has already endured \nmore than its fair share of previous base closures. Of the 97 major \nmilitary installations closed nationwide since 1988, 29 were in \nCalifornia. That's 30 percent of all major facilities closed.\n  Californians are all too familiar with the serious impact of closed \nmilitary facilities on their communities. Jobs are lost, small \nbusinesses close down, and what is left is infrastructure that is \ndifficult to reuse. In many cases, environmental contamination makes \nlarge tracts of land off limits until decades of cleanup are complete. \nBy the Pentagon's own estimates, some closed California bases won't be \nfully cleaned up until 2069.\n  The former McClellan Air Force Base in Sacramento is a good example \nof the failure of the Department of Defense to clean-up bases that were \nclosed through the BRAC process.\n  Rob Leonard, the former head of Sacramento's Military Base Conversion \noffice, recently testified before the Senate Appropriations Committee \nabout the status of McClellan. According to Mr. Leonard's testimony, 6 \nyears ago the estimated cost to clean-up McClellan was $832 million and \nwas projected to take 30 years. Today, the cost is estimated to be $1.3 \nbillion and is anticipated to continue far beyond 2033.\n  At the same time, however, he goes on to say that ``over the past two \nyears the Air Force appropriation requests for the McClellan \nenvironmental program have not been fully supported by the Department \nof Defense and Congress; and as a result, the clean-up schedule has \nbeen adversely affected.''\n  Another example is the former El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. This \nbase, which was closed in the 1993 round of BRAC, will not be cleaned-\nup until 2034 at the earliest. The DOD's own estimates say that it will \nstill take at least $77 million to complete the work. Contamination on \nthe base, including a nine acre hazardous-waste dump, has led to delays \nin the reuse and redevelopment of the site.\n  These former California bases are not the exception--they are the \nnorm. Consider the estimated clean-up completion dates for the \nfollowing California bases: George Air Force Base--2031; Castle Air \nForce Base--2038; Tustin Marine Corps Air Station--2038; Moffett Field \nNaval Air Station--2032; and Fort Ord--2031.\n  It seems to me that the military should finish one job before it \nstarts another. The DOD should concentrate on cleaning up what has \nalready been closed so that these bases can be put to productive use by \nlocal communities.\n  Given that the Department of Defense continues to drag its feet on \ncleaning up BRAC sites while pushing for broad exemptions from \nenvironmental standards leads me to believe that it simply does not \nunderstand the importance of a safe and clean environment.\n  The Pentagon should focus its energy and resources on cleaning up the \nbases it has already closed rather than pursue another painful round of \nmilitary base closures. I hope my colleagues share this view and I \nthank the Senator from North Dakota for his amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute 45 seconds.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent the Senator from Michigan be \ngiven 5 minutes--add an extra 5 minutes to both sides. As I understand, \nthere is another Senator. Let's suggest we add another 10 minutes to \nboth sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I oppose the amendment. I believe the men and women in \nuniform and the taxpayers are served best by ensuring that this 2005 \nBRAC process go forward. Every day since September 11, they have been \non the front lines of our daily fight against terrorism. They have been \nsent directly into battle in Afghanistan and most recently in Iraq. \nEvery dollar wasted denies them the resources needed to ensure their \nsuccess and their safety, and the success and safety of future men and \nwomen whom we place in harm's way.\n  The Department of Defense estimates that as much as 25 percent of \ntheir current base structure is excess to their needs. We are spending \nbillions of dollars year after year maintaining infrastructure that we \nsimply do not need. It is a waste of public resources to hold onto this \ninfrastructure, and it is an impediment to our efforts to protect our \nnational security.\n  Estimates of previous savings in previous BRAC rounds stand at $17 \nbillion. Perhaps more significant for this debate are the annual \nsavings we could expect from future base closings which are estimated \nat $6 billion a year. These savings have been documented countless \ntimes by the Department of Defense, by the GAO, and by the \nCongressional Budget Office in letter after letter saying the savings \nare significant. Our forces need resources for training, for \ntechnology, for weapons, and to maintain facilities in better \ncondition.\n  How do we justify asking our forces to go into combat and into harm's \nway if we ourselves are unwilling to take the difficult steps to give \nthem the resources that they need and deserve and\n\n[[Page S7293]]\n\nthat we have the power to give to them?\n  One of the most important questions that has been raised is, Does \nSeptember 11 change all of this? We answered that question 2 years ago \nwhen we adopted the 2005 round. We authorized it at that time, after \nSeptember 11.\n  On November 16, 2001, GEN Richard Myers, Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs, wrote us the following:\n\n       We estimate that 23 percent of our facilities are \n     underutilized. The Services cannot afford the costs \n     associated with this excess infrastructure. The Department of \n     Defense must have the ability to restructure the \n     installations to better meet the current national security \n     needs. The sustained campaign against international terrorism \n     will require wise use of our resources and the aggressive \n     elimination of waste.\n\n  A letter written on October 15, 2001--a month after September 11--\nsigned by I think every former Secretary of Defense, says:\n\n       We are concerned that the reluctance to close unneeded \n     facilities is a drag on our military forces, particularly in \n     an era when homeland security is being discussed as never \n     before. The forces needed to defend bases that would perhaps \n     otherwise be closed are forces unavailable for the campaign \n     on terrorism. Further, money spent on a redundant facility is \n     money not spent on the latest technology we'll need to win \n     this campaign.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that those two letters I have identified be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   Chairman of the\n\n\n                                        Joint Chiefs of Staff,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 16, 2001.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,\n     U.S. Senate Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: As the Conferees deliberate the FY 2002 \n     Defense Authorization Bill, allow me to emphasize how \n     critical it is that Congress authorize another round of base \n     closures and realignments.\n       Installations contribute to overall force readiness; \n     however, excess infrastructure detracts from military \n     readiness by diverting limited resources from personnel, \n     training, equipment modernization, and transformation. We \n     estimate that 23% of our facilities are underutilized. The \n     Services cannot afford the costs associated with this excess \n     infrastructure. The Department of Defense must have the \n     ability to restructure its installations to better meet the \n     current national security needs. The sustained campaign \n     against international terrorism will require wise use of our \n     resources and the aggressive elimination of waste.\n       Therefore, I strongly endorse pending legislation to \n     provide the Department the required tools to reduce our \n     excess infrastructure. This authority is necessary for our \n     forces to become more efficient and thus serve as better \n     custodians of taxpayer money.\n       Finally, on behalf of our magnificent men and women in \n     uniform, thank you for your strong and dedicated support.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Richard B. Myers,\n     Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 October 15, 2001.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: This letter underscores the need for the \n     Congress to approve an additional round of base realignment \n     and closure. While we understand the sensitivity of this \n     effort, our support for another round is unequivocal in light \n     of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The Defense \n     Department must be allowed to review its existing \n     infrastructure to ensure it is positioned to support our \n     current and evolving force structure and our war fighting \n     plans.\n       We are concerned that the reluctance to close unneeded \n     facilities is a drag on our military forces, particularly in \n     an era when homeland security is being discussed as never \n     before. The forces needed to defend bases that would perhaps \n     otherwise be closed are forces unavailable for the campaign \n     on terrorism. Further, money spent on a redundant facility is \n     money not spent on the latest technology we'll need to win \n     this campaign.\n       We thank you for all you have done to provide for our \n     military forces, the finest in the world. We know closing or \n     realigning bases will be difficult, but we expect you will \n     face many difficult decisions in the coming weeks and months. \n     With the support of Secretary Rumsfeld, together we stand \n     ready to assist in any way we can.\n           Sincerely,\n     Former Secretaries of Defense.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   Chairman of the\n\n\n                                        Joint Chiefs of Staff,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 25, 2001.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Chairman, Senate Armed Services Committee,\n     U.S. Senate Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: As the full Senate deliberates the FY \n     2002 Defense Authorization Bill I would like to reiterate how \n     critically important it is the Congress authorize another \n     round of base closures and realignments.\n       Last Thursday the President outlined a sustained campaign \n     to combat international terrorism. The efficient and \n     effective use of the resources devoted to this effort will be \n     the responsibility of the Services and the Combatant \n     Commanders. The authority to eliminate excess infrastructure \n     will be an important tool our forces will need to become more \n     efficient and serve as better custodians of the taxpayers \n     money. As I mentioned before, there is an estimated 23 \n     percent under-utilization of our facilities. We can not \n     afford the cost associated with carrying this excess \n     infrastructure. The Department of Defense must have the \n     ability to restructure its installations to meet our current \n     national security needs.\n       I know you share my concerns that additional base closures \n     are necessary. The Department is committed to accomplishing \n     the required reshaping and restructuring in a single round of \n     base closures and realignments. I hope the Congress will \n     support this effort.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Henry H. Shelton,\n                            Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, there is another issue which has been \nraised, and that is the future of our overseas bases. The question was \nasked, How do we consider the base structure in the United States \nbefore we determine the overseas base structure and what the \nrequirements will be? There are three ongoing efforts in determining \nwhat our overseas presence will be for the future.\n  First, the BRAC law itself requires an infrastructure facility review \non a worldwide basis before the 2005 round can proceed.\n  Second, in March, Secretary Rumsfeld requested input from the various \ncombatant commanders in developing a comprehensive overseas presence in \nbasing strategy looking out for the next 10 years. The results of that \nreview are expected this July.\n  Finally, there is a provision in the bill before us that establishes \nan independent overseas basing commission that will provide \nrecommendations on our overseas presence and a basic strategy to \nCongress that is due in August of 2004.\n  Senator Dorgan asked, How are we going to know what our needs are in \n2005? That is when the recommendations are made to the Base Closing \nCommission--in May of 2005.\n  This isn't something being done now or this year; these \nrecommendations are due in May of 2005.\n  I thank our colleagues who have maintained the difficult course here, \nand I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, you know there are issues that never go \naway. I have only been here since 1987. But we have revisited this \nissue--I think my colleagues from Michigan and Virginia would agree--\nprobably more often than any other issue affecting our Nation's \nsecurity. Issues come and go. This one keeps coming back.\n  Every expert on military national security who doesn't have any \nparticular bias will tell you we have too many bases. We have too many \nmilitary bases. I am happy to say we are already in the process in \nEurope of making some significant changes which will result in \nsignificant savings.\n  Why do we have the BRAC process? We have the BRAC process because we \nproved to anyone's satisfaction that we cannot close an individual \nbase. Yes, we abrogated our responsibilities, but we didn't completely \nabrogate our responsibilities because it will still come back to the \nfindings of the commission, and we will vote yes or no.\n  The issue that continues to intrigue me is this argument that it will \ncost more to close bases. If that logic were true, we never should have \nclosed the bases following World War II when we had thousands of bases \nall over America. But we closed bases following World War II because we \nhad a decrease in the requirements to meet our national security needs.\n  In 1991, we had approximately 3 million men and women in the \nmilitary. We now have 1.4 million men and women in the military. And \nthose reductions in the size of our military were made with the full \nknowledge, support, and legislative action of the Congress of the \nUnited States. The President didn't reduce the size of the military by \nExecutive order. Every year, a part of our bill is the authorization of \nthe numbers of people and appropriations to pay them. We are now\n\n[[Page S7294]]\n\ndown to 1.4 million Americans. Maybe we need some more. But there \nclearly is not the need for the number of bases we had in 1991.\n  The Secretary of Defense--obviously a strong leader, obviously a \nhighly respected individual, as his predecessors have said--will \nrecommend a veto of the entire legislation if this BRAC process is \ntaken out of it and not allowed to proceed. Here we are placing at risk \nall of the hard work that has been done by the committee in hearings \nand coming up with our authorization. The bill is now at risk if we \ndestroy the BRAC process.\n  I remind my colleagues that the BRAC process has worked. Yes, it has \ncaused some pain. Yes, it has caused some dislocation. But over time in \nthe vast majority of bases that are closed, revenue increases to the \ncommunity rather than decreases.\n  That is not to say there isn't severe dislocation in the short term \nand severe economic difficulties because communities are dependent upon \nthe military presence. But I urge my colleagues to do what is best for \nour Nation's security, as articulated by the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, by our Secretary of Defense, and literally every other \nexpert on national security: that we need to reduce the number of bases \nso we can spend the money on the men and women in the military, for \ntheir pay, their benefits, their health care, and their housing.\n  One of the reasons why we have dilapidated barracks in some bases in \nAmerica is because we have too many of them. We cannot afford to \nmaintain all of them at the level we would like for this magnificent \nAll-Volunteer Force.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment. Let's move forward and \nhave this bill enacted and signed into law by the President of the \nUnited States.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield time to myself.\n  I thank my colleague from Arizona. He, with a great sense of \nhumility, can refer to his own long association with the Active and, \nindeed, Reserve and Guard Forces throughout this country. He knows full \nwell that the purpose of the BRAC is to enable the men and women of the \nArmed Forces to have a better lifestyle together with their families--\nthat coupled with the desperate need to continue with the modernization \nand transformation of these Armed Forces. I thank my colleague for his \nparticipation and strong support to maintain what is law today, and \nwhich law gives Congress adequate opportunity, as I have said, to \nprotect the interests of our States.\n  I enumerated there are several parts of the bill which provide that. \nI enumerated very clearly they were going through quite a process with \nregard to the evaluation of overseas bases prior to final decisions on \nthe BRAC. I believe Members have a role of participation to come in the \ndays, months, and whatever period it takes.\n  Mr. President, I now have in hand the letter from the Secretary of \nDefense as authorized by the President. I have referred in part to an \nearlier communication from the Secretary of Defense to the House. It is \nparallel to the one received by the Senate, strongly stating the \nessential nature of this and concluding:\n\n       If the President is presented a bill that amends the BRAC \n     authority passed by Congress two years ago . . . then I would \n     join other senior advisors to the President recommending that \n     he veto any such legislation.\n\n  That is a perilous route to put the Senate in with regard to this \nimportant piece of legislation. In my years here, I have witnessed our \nlegislation contested to the very last minute and how the \nAppropriations Committee then had the distasteful task of trying to \npick out those portions of our bill which had to become law. So much of \nthe work--of all the Members, not just the committee members--in that \nbill is lost in that process of dissembling our bill and putting \nportions on the Appropriations bill as it goes forward.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time on the amendment has \nexpired.\n  Mr. WARNER. I strongly urge that this amendment be rejected by the \nSenate. As I understand, Mr. President, the vote takes place at 2:50 \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. Now, Mr. President, all time has expired but I see the \npresence of a very valued member of our committee, the Senator from \nOklahoma, so I ask unanimous consent that he be given 5 minutes to \nspeak to this matter. Regrettably, he is not aligned with the chairman, \nbut occasionally that occurs. I ask that his remarks be included as if \nstated within the time limitation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes remain for the proponents of the \namendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Then he is within the bounds of his right to exercise \nsuch time as he wishes under the 10 minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the distinguished chairman.\n  Mr. President, first, I thank the distinguished chairman of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee for his remarks, and also the \ndistinguished Senator from Arizona.\n  I would like to start off by saying, I was elected to the other body \nin 1986. In 1987, a very distinguished Congressman, Dick Armey, came up \nwith the whole idea of how to get rid of excess infrastructure, using \nthis system that should be free of political influence, or as free as \npossible. I supported it and voted for it. I went through four BRAC \nrounds. The first one was in 1988, the second one was in 1991, the \nthird in 1993, and the fourth was in 1995.\n  During that period of time, it worked very well. We closed or \nrealigned some 300 installations but 97 specific major installations \nwere closed. There was a lot of pain that went with that. There were \nprobably a few people who were defeated on the basis of that. But, \nnonetheless, the idea he had worked.\n  I made the statement during that time that with regard to the \ninstallations we have in my State of Oklahoma, if they came out through \nthis process and said they, in fact, wanted to do something, and it was \nnecessary to close a classified, excess infrastructure in one of my \ninstallations, I would support that statement. As it turned out, it did \nnot happen.\n  There are three major reasons, that even though what my colleagues \nhave said sounds very good--and I believe most of it is true and \nfactual; and I know they believe it--but three things are different \ntoday than were in those four BRAC rounds.\n  No. 1, I look across the Chamber and I can see a chart that makes \nreference to the fact that the threat is different since September 11. \nWell, I will not belabor that point because I was not on the floor and \nI assume that point has been made.\n  When you talk about the threat that is out there, you are talking \nabout a threat that could not have been foreseen 10 years ago or even 5 \nyears ago or even 3 years ago. It is a totally different threat.\n  I can remember sitting in a hearing when we had expert testimony by \nindividuals who were saying at that time that we will no longer need \nground forces in 10 years. That was 10 years ago, and we have had two \nmajor victories--primarily on the ground--in the last year. So these \nthings were not foreseen at that time. The change in the threat is \ngoing to cause us to make other adjustments.\n  The second thing that I have strong feelings about is this: I was \nlistening to the distinguished Senator from Michigan talk about the \namount of money that has been saved. I would question that. There are a \nlot of cleanups that have not been concluded yet. We hear glowing \nfigures about how much is going to be saved by each installation that \nis closed. Some installation closings have resulted in no savings \nwhatsoever. But there is one thing that is a certainty; and that is, \nwhen you close an installation, for the first 2 or 3 or 4 years, it is \ngoing to cost a lot of money. For that reason, and that reason alone, I \nwould want to adopt this amendment so we do not have a 2005 BRAC round \nbecause we do not have any idea how many installations will be closed \nand how much money that will cost us.\n  Right now we are in a crisis in our defense system. I know a lot of \npeople do not like to say this. A lot of people do not believe it. But \nwe went through the last administration, when the proper attention was \nnot given to defending America, and a lot of people had this great \neuphoria that the cold war was over and thinking there was no longer\n\n[[Page S7295]]\n\na threat out there and that we could cut down the size of our military; \nand, as the Senator from Arizona said, we did cut it down from some 3 \nmillion troops to 1.4 million. I am certain a mistake was made.\n\n  Now we look at the problems we have in our military and they go all \nthe way across the board. No. 1, we have inadequate troop strength. We \nknow that. That is a fact. We can't do what has to be done in Iraq and \nother places and have enough reserve for a contingency that might \nhappen in North Korea, Syria, or any other place. This is something \nthat has concerned us.\n  No. 2, force strength deficiency is resulting in a crisis in our \nreserve component. Our Guard and Reserves are all overworked. They are \nunable to carry on the responsibilities they have. We can't expect the \nemployers to continue with all these deployments and pay these people, \nhold these jobs, particularly in an economy that is not robust. This \nproblem is serious.\n  A third problem that took place over the last administration was a \nslowing down of our modernization program. I have said in the Senate \nthat we are sending our troops out to fight on the ground with \nartillery that is World War II technology. The best thing we have in \nartillery right now operating is called Paladin. Paladin technology \ncame about in the 1950s. When you tell people you have to get out and \nswab the breach after every shot, they don't believe you until they see \nthat is the case. There are four countries, including South Africa, \nmaking artillery pieces better than that which we have.\n  Then with all of these problems out there, we find out that the \nthreats are greater today than they were during the cold war. People \ndon't like to hear that, but back in the cold war, we had one great \nthreat. That was the Soviet Union. We were the two superpowers. They \nwere predictable. We knew what each other had. We developed a program \nunder a Republican administration that I did not agree with. That was a \nprogram of mutual assured destruction. That is, I will make you a deal: \nYou don't defend yourself against us and an incoming missile; We will \nnot defend ourselves. So if you fire on us, we will fire on you. \nEverybody dies and everybody is happy.\n  That seemed fairly reasonable at that time. Now we have a little \nsense of the changing threat out there and recognize it is not coming \nfrom one place. We have some 20 countries that have weapons of mass \ndestruction or that are developing them. It is not something we can \nquantify now as to what kind of force structure we need.\n  That brings me to my second point one more time. While we don't know \nhow much savings will be effected, we do know it is going to cost \nmillions and millions of dollars for every installation that is closed. \nWe cannot afford it now. We cannot afford to leave our force structure \nwhere it is, our modernization program where it is. We cannot allow the \nRussians, who are selling on the open market their S.U. series that are \nbetter than our F-15s and F-16s--we want to give our troops, the most \ncapable troops in the world, the resources and modern resources to make \nsure they have something that is better than the enemy has.\n  The third reason it is very significant is, we are going to rebuild. \nWe have been asking the administration to give us as much detail as to \nwhat our future force structure should look like. I am not criticizing \nthem for not being able to come back with it because this is a moving \ntarget. We have threats that are out there we didn't have before. \nWe have to learn how to accommodate these threats and how to combat \nthem. Until such time as we know what the force structure is going to \nlook like, I don't believe we should be closing any infrastructure. If \nwe have an inadequate force structure right now that is down to here \nand we have perhaps more infrastructure, it does not make sense to \nbring the infrastructure down to an inadequate force structure and then \nbuild that up and wonder, wait a minute, why do we have something that \ncan't be used.\n\n  So for that reason, until we find out what our force structure is \ngoing to look like, we don't know what remaining installations will be \nneeded. Let's stop and remember, we had 97 major installations that \nhave been closed. That is behind us. We supported that. Those were the \nfour BRAC rounds. We are now to a point where we do not know what the \nthreat is going to be. We don't know how we will have to rebuild our \nforce structure and our system. So we don't know what kind of \ninfrastructure it is going to take to accommodate that.\n  These three reasons were not present in 1989. They were not present \nin 1991, 1993, and 1995. But they are present today. So we have to face \nthis crisis, which we will, and rebuild our military. And when we get \nto the point where we know what it is going to look like and how to \nadequately defend against this new threat, we had no idea it would be \nout there as recently as 3 or 4 years ago, then it is time to maybe \nlook and reevaluate where we might be. It would be premature to do it \nat this time.\n  I support the amendment. These are three very good reasons that were \nnot present in the future rounds.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE.

Mr. President, I am a Midwesterner by birth. I come from \nthe flatlands of Illinois, cornfields and prairies. Frankly, it has \nmeant I see things differently than others. I can still recall as a \nyoung boy the first time I saw an ocean. I was off to my brother's \nwedding in California, all of about 9 or 10 years old, and I got to see \nthe Pacific Ocean. It was an amazing spectacle to me. I had never seen \nanything like it. The closest I had come to that was the Mississippi \nRiver. I developed a special attachment and passion of taking my \nfamily, as they grew up, to oceans on a regular basis, to beaches, and \nthe great time you have together.\n  I never reflected on the fact that the great, vast, mighty body of \nwater, that ocean, might some day be vulnerable; it seemed so \nimpenetrable, so vast, so diverse, so huge.\n  This week in Washington, the Pew Oceans Commission will release its \nreport. The chairman of that commission is an old friend of mine, a \ngreat public servant, Leon Panetta of California. I commend this report \nto everyone in the country, whether you live near an ocean, as most \nAmericans do, or you are from the Midwest and a flatlander, as I am. It \ntalks about a great resource of America and a great resource of the\n\n[[Page S7296]]\n\nworld which is in crisis, the great resource of the world which is in \nperil.\n  The area of the ocean under United States jurisdiction spans 4.5 \nmillion square miles, more than any other single country. According to \nJane Lubchenco, professor of Oregon State University, our ocean \nproperty as a nation is 23 percent larger than our Nation's land area, \nmaking our ocean the country's largest public domain.\n  I met Professor Lubchenco last week in Italy at a seminar that \nfocused on international global environmental issues. She spoke at \nlength and in stark terms about what is happening to the oceans. Our \nocean ecosystems are unique treasures, places where we can discover the \nmystery of life, work and vacation, and pursue scientific study. Losing \nthe quality of our oceans and marine life that thrives in them would be \na tremendous loss.\n  In addition, damage to ocean ecosystems can cause significant damage \nto our economy, public health, and even our national security.\n  As the Pew Commission reports, our oceans face a crisis due to \ncontamination and failure to address problems over the years. Take, for \nexample, this statistic. The National Academy of Sciences estimates \nthat oil running off of our streets and driveways in America ultimately \nflows into the ocean, creating an Exxon-Valdez-size spill every 8 \nmonths. I was at Prince William Sound in Alaska after the Exxon Valdez \nspill, something I will never forget, going to tiny remote islands, \nseeing them literally covered with crude oil, seeing the wildlife that \nhad been rescued, some of it perished almost immediately, and with \nothers, valiant attempts were made to save them; 10.9 million gallons \nof crude oil dumped in Prince William Sound. That is how much oil we \ndump as a nation into the ocean every 8 months with the runoff from \ndriveways and parking lots finding its way to streams and rivers and \nour oceans.\n\n  These problems have tragic consequences. Many of our public beaches \nhave been closed over the years due to high levels of harmful \ncontamination. The United States Environmental Protection Agency about \n8 or 9 years ago created a Web site which reported on ozone and the \nimpact it would have on public health. It became increasingly popular \nas more and more parents with children facing asthma attacks went to \nthis Web site to see if it was safe to send their kids to school. What \nwas the ozone reading? Then, almost coincidentally, the EPA released \ninformation about beaches around America that had been closed because \nof contamination. That, too, became an extremely popular Web site. \nFamilies planning vacations and weekends would go to this Web site and \nfind out whether the beach they wanted to visit would be open to the \npublic or safe for bathing in.\n  It is an interesting comment, is it not, in the world we live in, the \nNation we live in, with all of our progress, that one of the sources of \ninformation we turn to most frequently is whether we can breathe the \nair or can expose our children to a beach or lake shore that might be \ncontaminated.\n  There is also a problem related to the fishing industry and its \nimpact, the impact of the ocean contamination. There was a paper \npublished in the May 15 issue of Scientific Journal, Nature, that \nreported 90 percent of all large fish--tuna, marlin, swordfish, shark, \ncod, and halibut--90 percent of those species are gone. Do you remember \nthe fish orange roughy? I bet you do. In the last few years it was a \npretty popular fish. Almost everywhere in America you would go to a \nrestaurant and orange roughy was on the menu. Try to find it today. It \nhas been fished to near extinction. They discovered where to fish for \norange roughy on the coast of New Zealand and went to depths they had \nnever been able to fish at before and successfully found the species. \nIt was fished out. It turned out to be popular and no efforts were made \nto conserve it. As a consequence, you will be able to tell your \nchildren you once had a fish called orange roughy. It is not likely \nthey will ever taste one.\n  An article in the Washington Post also reports the significant fish \nshortages and how the fishing industry is close to collapsing in many \nparts of the United States and around the world. This week's U.S. News \n& World Report devotes its cover story to the problem of empty oceans.\n  I will address one part of this problem, something we can do about it \nin a hurry. It relates to cruise ships.\n\n  One of the major contributors to ocean pollution is the cruise ship \nindustry, which in 2001 carried 8.4 million passengers in North \nAmerica. I do not have anything against cruise ships--they provide many \nAmericans ample opportunities to relax and learn about oceans and \nmarine wildlife. However, they are exempt from critical regulations \nthat would help protect the beautiful and inspiring oceans and marine \nwildlife that many cruise ships aim to present to travelers.\n  I am going to give some data here that I think is incredibly \nshocking.\n  According to EPA and industry data, a typical 3,000 passenger cruise \nship each week generates 210,000 gallons of black water, which is raw \nsewage; 1 million gallons of gray water, included runoff from showers, \nsinks and dishwashers; 37,000 gallons of oily bilge water, which \ncollects in the bottom of ships and contains oil and chemicals from \nengine maintenance that are toxic to marine life; more than eight tons \nof solid waste; millions of gallons of ballast water, which is brought \ninto ships to facilitate balance and then released back into the ocean, \ncontaining potential invasive species; and toxic wastes including dry \ncleaning chemicals such as PERC and photoprocessing chemicals.\n  These wastes are damaging to our oceans. Interestingly enough, any \ncity in America which generated that kind of waste would never be \nallowed to dump it on the land or in an adjoining river. But if you \nhappen to be a cruise ship that is traveling in the waters of America, \nyou are virtually exempt from the Clean Water Act and you can dump, in \ncertain locations within the oceans off the coasts of America, with \nvirtual impunity, with one notable exception. The State of Alaska--\nthank goodness for them--has established much stricter standards than \nthe Clean Water Act imposes on the cruise ship industry that does its \nbusiness outside States around America.\n\n  According to the organization Oceana, raw sewage can sicken and kill \nmarine life, including corals, and contributes to algae blooms that \ncloud the water, reduce oxygen levels and kill fish. Furthermore, \ninvasive species, those that are not native to the area where they are \nreleased in ballast water, can colonize new areas, and, in so doing, \nreplace and harm local species. We have become painfully familiar with \ninvasive species in the Great Lakes, and the government and industry \nare making efforts to address it. I am proud to be representing a state \nthat adjoins that great Lake Michigan, but we know about Zebra Mussels \nand forms of eels that have been dumped in ballast water and invaded \nwhat was a sound marine life in the Great Lakes.\n  Wastes from cruise ships can also affect human health. According to \nOceana, the recent outbreaks of the Norwalk virus on cruise ships have \nsickened more than 3,000 passengers and crew, forcing many people to \nabandon their vacations early. The Norwalk virus is found in human \nwaste and on hands and surfaces that may have had contact with it. It \ncan be spread by shellfish contaminated by sewage from boats. In \naddition, wastes can wash up on our beaches and near our shoes, \nthreatening people who work or vacation there.\n  Despite the fact that cruise ships generate all of this waste, and \nare an identifiable source of pollution, they are exempted from the \nregulations that implement the Clean Water Act's point source \npermitting system. Indeed, cruise ships can dump raw, untreated sewage \ninto the water once the ship is more than three miles off U.S. shores. \nThey can also dump gray water and ballast water without a permit, even \nwhen they are docked at ports that are in U.S. waters. Finally, they \nare permitted to dump solid garbage into the ocean when they are at \nleast 12 miles from the shore.\n  This problem is not confined to our domestic cruise ship industry. \nAccording to a February 2000 GAO report, foreign-flagged cruise ships \nwere involved in 87 confirmed illegal discharge cases in U.S. waters \nfrom 1993 to 1998.\n  In August 2000, EPA issued a ``Cruise ship White Paper,'' providing a \nblueprint for strengthening the laws regulating cruise ships. However, \nCongress has failed to act on this issue.\n\n[[Page S7297]]\n\n  We cannot delay any longer. that is why I will introduce legislation \nto strengthen the Clean Water Act and other relevant laws regarding the \ncruise ship industry.\n  Specifically,the legislation I am preparing is based on ideas and \nrecommendations generated by the EPA, GAO, and interest groups. Here is \nwhat it would do:\n  Remove the exemption of cruise ships from existing Clean Water Act \nrequirements;\n  Ban the release of raw sewage anywhere in the ocean, and require \ntreatment standards similar to Alaska's strict standards;\n  Ban release of so-called ``treated'' wastes within a certain distance \nof our shores;\n  Provide for adequate measures to prevent ballast waters from \nspreading invasive species;\n  Provide for monitoring of compliance with these requirements and the \navailability of data for public review;\n  Enable citizens to bring lawsuits against cruise ships, as provided \nunder the Clean Water Act; and\n  Increase resources for inspections and strengthen the inspection \nrequirements.\n  This is truly an international issue, but the United States must not \nonly do its part, it must lead the way. I urge my colleagues to join \nme. First, read this Pew Oceans Commission report. It is an eye opener. \nIt is a revelation. Wherever you live in the United States, you will \nvalue our oceans and you will come to understand the dangers they face.\n  I also encourage my colleagues to join me by cosponsoring the \nlegislation I am crafting. The oceans, that cover nearly 70 percent of \nour planet, cannot wait any longer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

In carrying out the \n     study, the Secretary shall--\n       (A) compare the Federal Government death benefits for \n     survivors of deceased members of the Armed Forces with \n     commercial and other private sector death benefits plans for \n     segments of United States society outside the Armed Forces, \n     and also with the benefits available under Public Law 107-37 \n     (115 Stat. 219) (commonly known as the ``Public Safety \n     Officer Benefits Bill'');\n       (B) assess the personnel policy effects that would result \n     from a revision of the death gratuity benefit to provide a \n     stratified schedule of entitlement amounts that places a \n     premium on deaths resulting from participation in combat or \n     from acts of terrorism;\n       (C) assess the adequacy of the current system of Survivor \n     Benefit Plan annuities and Dependency and Indemnity \n     Compensation and the anticipated effects of an elimination of \n     the offset of Survivor Benefit Plan annuities by Dependency \n     and Indemnity Compensation;\n       (D) examine the commercial insurability of members of the \n     Armed Forces in high risk military occupational specialties; \n     and\n       (E) examine the extent to which private trusts and \n     foundations engage in fundraising or otherwise provide \n     financial benefits for survivors of deceased members of the \n     Armed Forces.\n       (3) Not later than March 1, 2004, the Secretary shall \n     submit a report on the results of the study under paragraph \n     (2) to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the \n     House of Representatives.

INTEGRATION OF DEFENSE INTELLIGENCE, SURVEILLANCE, \n                   AND RECONNAISSANCE CAPABILITIES\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n\n[[Page S7333]]\n\n       (1) As part of transformation efforts within the Department \n     of Defense, each of the Armed Forces is developing \n     intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities \n     that best support future war fighting as envisioned by the \n     leadership of the military department concerned.\n       (2) Concurrently, intelligence agencies of the Department \n     of Defense outside the military departments are developing \n     transformation roadmaps to best support the future \n     decisionmaking and war fighting needs of their principal \n     customers, but are not always closely coordinating those \n     efforts with the intelligence, surveillance, and \n     reconnaissance development efforts of the military \n     departments.\n       (3) A senior official of each military department has been \n     designated as the integrator of intelligence, surveillance, \n     and reconnaissance for each of the Armed Forces in such \n     military department, but there is not currently a well-\n     defined forum where the integrators of intelligence, \n     surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities for each of the \n     Armed Forces can routinely interact with each other and with \n     senior representatives of Department of Defense intelligence \n     agencies, as well as with other members of the intelligence \n     community, to ensure unity of effort and to preclude \n     unnecessary duplication of effort.\n       (4) The current funding structure of a National Foreign \n     Intelligence Program (NFIP), Joint Military Intelligence \n     Program (JMIP), and Tactical Intelligence and Related \n     Activities Program (TIARA) might not be the best approach for \n     supporting the development of an intelligence, surveillance, \n     and reconnaissance structure that is integrated to meet the \n     national security requirements of the United States in the \n     21st century.\n       (5) The position of Under Secretary of Defense for \n     Intelligence was established in 2002 by Public Law 107-314 in \n     order to facilitate resolution of the challenges to achieving \n     an integrated intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance \n     structure in the Department of Defense to meet such 21st \n     century requirements.\n       (b) Goal.--It shall be a goal of the Department of Defense \n     to fully coordinate and integrate the intelligence, \n     surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities and \n     developmental activities of the military departments, \n     intelligence agencies of the Department of Defense, and \n     relevant combatant commands as those departments, agencies, \n     and commands transform their intelligence, surveillance, and \n     reconnaissance systems to meet current and future needs.\n       (c) Requirement.--(1) The Under Secretary of Defense for \n     Intelligence shall establish an Intelligence, Surveillance, \n     and Reconnaissance Integration Council to provide a permanent \n     forum for the discussion and arbitration of issues relating \n     to the integration of intelligence, surveillance, and \n     reconnaissance capabilities.\n       (2) The Council shall be composed of the senior \n     intelligence officers of the Armed Forces and the United \n     States Special Operations Command, the Director of Operations \n     of the Joint Staff, and the directors of the intelligence \n     agencies of the Department of Defense.\n       (3) The Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence shall \n     invite the participation of the Director of Central \n     Intelligence or his representative in the proceedings of the \n     Council.\n       (d) ISR Integration Roadmap.--The Under Secretary of \n     Defense for Intelligence, in consultation with the \n     Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Integration \n     Council and the Director of Central Intelligence, shall \n     develop a comprehensive Defense Intelligence, Surveillance, \n     and Reconnaissance Integration Roadmap to guide the \n     development and integration of the Department of Defense \n     intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities \n     for 15 years.\n       (e) Report.--(1) Not later than September 30, 2004, the \n     Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence shall submit to \n     the committees of Congress specified in paragraph (2) a \n     report on the Defense Intelligence, Surveillance, and \n     Reconnaissance Integration Roadmap developed under subsection \n     (d). The report shall include the following matters:\n       (A) The fundamental goals established in the roadmap.\n       (B) An overview of the intelligence, surveillance, and \n     reconnaissance integration activities of the military \n     departments and the intelligence agencies of the Department \n     of Defense.\n       (C) An investment strategy for achieving--\n       (i) an integration of Department of Defense intelligence, \n     surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities that ensures \n     sustainment of needed tactical and operational efforts; and\n       (ii) efficient investment in new intelligence, \n     surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities.\n       (D) A discussion of how intelligence gathered and analyzed \n     by the Department of Defense can enhance the role of the \n     Department of Defense in fulfilling its homeland security \n     responsibilities.\n       (E) A discussion of how counterintelligence activities of \n     the Armed Forces and the Department of Defense intelligence \n     agencies can be better integrated.\n       (F) Recommendations on how annual funding authorizations \n     and appropriations can be optimally structured to best \n     support the development of a fully integrated Department of \n     Defense intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance \n     architecture.\n       (2) The committees of Congress referred to in paragraph (1) \n     are as follows:\n       (A) The Committee on Armed Services, the Committee on \n     Appropriations, and the Select Committee on Intelligence of \n     the Senate.\n       (B) The Committee on Armed Services, the Committee on \n     Appropriations, and the Permanent Select Committee on \n     Intelligence of the House of Representatives.\n\n     SEC. 925.

I am hopeful we \nwill not have to redo them, however there is going to be another \namendment, at least one, perhaps two, on the ethanol amendment. But in \nthe meantime, the distinguished Republican whip has requested that he \nbe permitted to speak for 5 minutes as in morning business.\n  I make that request in his behalf.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask the Chair get order in the Senate so he can be \nheard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  (The remarks of Mr. McConnell, Mr. McCain, and Mrs. Feinstein, \npertaining to the introduction of S. 1182 are located in today's Record \nunder ``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the ethanol \namendment No. 850 that has been offered by our distinguished majority \nleader, Senator Frist. This is a bipartisan amendment which has been \ncrafted thoughtfully by leadership on both sides of the aisle and \nproves to be a compromise bill that will triple the amount of \ndomestically produced ethanol used in America. President Bush was right \nwhen he said 2 years ago that we are long overdue in implementing a \ncomprehensive energy policy for our Nation. If he were to say the same \nthing today, he would still be right. We need a policy that broadens \nour base of energy resources to create stability, guarantee reasonable \nprices, and protect America's security.\n  I believe that increasing our use of alternative and renewable fuels \nsuch as ethanol and biodiesel is a key element in our effort to \nconstructing that much needed stability. It is a clean burning, \nhomegrown renewable fuel that we can rely on for generations to come. \nEthanol is a step towards good stewardship of our environment. \nExpanding the use of ethanol will also protect our environment by \nreducing auto emissions, which will mean cleaner air and improved \npublic health. It just so happens that as we are looking out for our \nenvironment we are not only going to benefit in the arena of \nenvironmental friendliness but as the same time boost our economy.\n  Consumers will benefit from more efficient use of their vehicles at a \nlower cost. Adding 10 percent ethanol to a gallon of regular gas would \nreduce the retail price to consumers by almost seven cents per gallon \naccording to the Energy Information Administration.\n  By continuing each year to increase the volume of ethanol in a gallon \nof gasoline, we can concurrently decrease the volume of crude oil \nneeded for it. Crude oil prices have risen in 2003 as a result of the \nwar with Iraq and international tensions. We must protect ourselves and \nbe secure with our independence during these trying times and possible \nterrorism. It is no secret that we currently import over 58 percent of \nthe oil we use. This dependence is not getting better. The Energy \nInformation Administration estimates that our dependency on imported \noil could grow to nearly 70 percent by 2020. We are so dependent on \nforeign oil, that the demand for renewable fuels such as ethanol and \nbiodiesel is on the rise. Although our troops were successful in the \nliberation of Iraq, our greatest energy challenge remains the need to \nreduce our reliance on foreign sources to meet our energy needs.\n\n  The production and marketing of ethanol is very important to the \neconomy of my state and the nation. The Energy Information \nAdministration has proven that tripling the use nationally of renewable \nfuels over the next decade will increase U.S. GDP by $156 billion by \n2012, reduce our National Trade Deficit by more than $34 billion, save \ntaxpayers $2 billion annually in reduced government subsidies due to \nthe creation of new markets for corn, and create more than 214,000 new \njobs.\n  The benefits for the farm economy are even more pronounced. An \nincrease in the use of ethanol across the Nation means an economic \nboost to thousands of farm families across my State. Currently, ethanol \nproduction provides 192,000 jobs and $4.5 billion to net farm income \nnationwide. Passage of this amendment will increase net farm income by \nnearly $6 billion annually. Passage of this amendment will create $5.3 \nbillion of new investment in renewable fuel production capacity. Kansas \nare loudly voicing their support of this legislation. Phasing out MTBE \non a National basis will be good for our fuel suppliers. Refiners are \nunder tremendous strain from having to make several different gasoline \nblends to meet various state clean air requirements. The MTBE phaseout \nprovisions in this package will ensure that refiners will have less \nstress on their system.\n  This entire Nation's is in need of this environmentally friendly, \nsustainable fuel as we carry on in our efforts to be good stewards of \nour environment. Ethanol will boost our energy independence and become \nan aid to national security while we as a country find ourselves \ncontinuing the battle against terrorism. I cannot proclaim enough, the \ngreatness of the positive impacts this fuel contains. Leaders here in \nour body have discovered it. The language in this bill has strong \nbipartisan support and is the result of long negotiations between the \nRenewable Fuels Association, National Corn Growers Association, Farm \nBureau Federation, American Petroleum Institute, Northeast States for \nCoordinated Air Use Management, NESCAUM, and the American Lung \nAssociation.\n  Americans can rest more sound and secure as we further develop the \nuse of our homegrown fuel, ethanol.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I know there are many Senators who have \nplenty to do besides being concerned about this Energy bill on the\n\n[[Page S7366]]\n\nfloor of the Senate. But I want to say for some of us that the Energy \nPolicy Act is a very important subject. The committee has worked very \nhard. We don't claim to have a perfect bill, but we claim to have a \nbill that deserves the consideration of the Senate.\n  For all those Senators who want to review the bill and haven't, I \nhope they will start. For those who have amendments and haven't reduced \nthem to writing, I hope they get going. For those who have questions \nabout the bill, we are going to be here working on it--both the \nminority whip and Senator Bingaman. His staff is adequate in numbers \nand capacity and will be available, as will mine.\n  With that in mind, we are back to the point where we have set aside \nthe LIHEAP issue that came about yesterday--the issue with reference to \nthe jurisdiction of the different LIHEAP provisions that we wanted to \nhave in this bill where the chairman of the Committee on Health and \nHuman Resources desires that it not be on the bill but rather be \nreturned to his committee for jurisdictional consideration. That will \nbe taken up later.\n  We are now back to ethanol. Yesterday we had two votes. They were \nvery heavily debated for a long period of time. In each instance both \nfailed. In each instance 60 votes or more were obtained on the side of \nsupporting the bill, which is not just a Republican or Democrat bill. \nIt is a bill put together by Democrats and Republicans, and all kinds \nof different leadership groups in this country that are concerned about \nour future in terms of dependence upon oil and its derivatives; those \nwho are concerned about agricultural products and the fact that we \nproduce so much more than we need and that the price is constantly a \nproblem both to the Government because of its support programs and to \nthe farmer because it is difficult to make a living.\n  Those who are concerned about rural America see this bill as a \npotential for the injection of tremendous amounts of real investments \nand real jobs and capital into all parts of rural America because \nfacilities will have to be built that will cost billions of dollars in \norder to comply with the requirements of this national mandate for \nethanol use.\n  The mandate is a good mandate. It is a national mandate. It is a \nmandate that says by a year certain we will be using certain quantities \nof ethanol in our petroleum products that feed the gasoline tanks, and \nthus the automobiles and trucks of America that use gasoline and diesel \nfuel.\n  I am sure there are additional amendments on this issue. I merely \nwanted to recap for the Senate where we are.\n  I also wish to say that while we have been on this bill for a number \nof days, it appears that the only amendments are those that pertain to \nethanol. I know there are more. I implore Senators, I beg them, if they \nhave amendments, let us get them ready and bring them down here. Who \nknows, they may have winners. They may have a much better approach to \nenergy independence in this bill. We stand ready to accommodate and get \nthem before the Senate and get the votes on them as soon as possible.\n  What I understand the situation to be now, so the Senators will \nunderstand, is that the distinguished minority manager, the junior \nSenator from New Mexico, has an amendment on ethanol. I understand that \nwhen he is finished, the distinguished Senator from New York has an \namendment. He told the Senator from New Mexico that he would follow the \namendment of the Senator from New Mexico. I hope that will be the case. \nIf he comes forth, we will not have one vote at a time but rather back-\nto-back votes. There appears to be a couple of other amendments that \nmay be offered before the day is out.\n\n  Then I suggest that as many Senators as possible begin to try to \nfigure out what they want to do with this bill. I know there are \nSenators who have not had a chance to make up their mind about \namendments but I ask that they do that. Actually, there are many of us \nwho want to get an Energy bill. We think the remainder of this week, \nclear through Friday, and all of next week ought to be sufficient time \nto get this done. Some do not think so but I surmise that if we tried, \nand we had amendments going most of the day, with votes taking place \neach day, we would be surprised how soon we would get this bill \ncompleted.\n  Having said that, I yield the floor to my distinguished fellow \nSenator from New Mexico, Mr. Bingaman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, first, I thank the chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Domenici, for his comments. I agree with his request \nthat we move ahead with amendments. I know there are many Senators with \namendments they want to offer. I think the logical thing to do is to \ntry to deal with all of the ethanol-related amendments at this stage in \nthe consideration of the bill. I hope that by offering an ethanol-\nrelated amendment now, on behalf of myself and Senator Sununu, we can \nbegin the process of considering these amendments in a thoughtful way \nand, hopefully, work through them over the next day or two.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 851 To Amendment No. 850\n\n  Mr. President, with that, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration. It is an amendment to amendment No. 850 \nthat Senator Domenici offered on behalf of Senator Frist and others.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. BINGAMAN], for himself and \n     Mr. Sununu, proposes an amendment numbered 851 to amendment \n     No. 850.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To authorize the Secretary of Energy to waive the ethanol \nmandate on the East and West Coast in the event of a significant price \n                    increase or supply interruption)\n\n       On page 18, after line 15, insert the following:\n       ``(11) Significant price increase or supply interruption.--\n       ``(A) Suspension of requirements.--In addition to the \n     authority of the Administrator to waive the requirements of \n     paragraph (2) under paragraphs (7) and (8), and to extend the \n     exemption from paragraph (2) under paragraph (9), the \n     President, acting through the Secretary of Energy, may \n     suspend the requirements of paragraph (2) in any Petroleum \n     Administration for Defense District, in whole or in part, in \n     the event the Secretary of Energy determines that--\n       ``(i) application of the requirements of paragraph (2) in \n     the District will result, or has resulted, in an increase in \n     the average cost of gasoline to end users in the District of \n     ten cents per gallon or more; or\n       ``(ii) a significant interruption in the supply of \n     renewable fuel in the District will result, or has resulted, \n     in an increase in the average cost of gasoline to end users \n     in the District of ten cents per gallon or more.\n       ``(B) Duration of suspension.--A suspension granted under \n     subparagraph (A) shall terminate after 30 days, but may be \n     renewed by the Secretary of Energy for additional 30-day \n     periods if he determines that the significant price increase \n     or significant supply interruption persists.''.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, as I indicated, this is an amendment I \nam offering on behalf of Senator Sununu and myself. It is to improve \nthe waiver provisions in the renewable fuels standard in the Daschle-\nFrist amendment.\n  The amendment we are offering seeks to give the President the \nauthority to suspend the ethanal mandate--he could suspend it with \nregard to a particular geographic area in the country--in the event \nthere is a severe supply or price disruption to U.S. gasoline markets. \nWe have a way of determining when that threshold is reached. It \nprovides a path for immediate action to be taken to deal with that \nprice circumstance.\n  This is not a requirement that the President act. This is merely \nauthority for him to act if he chooses to do so. I think we need to \nmake that point so all Members understand we are not requiring any \naction by this amendment; we are expanding the waiver authority so that \nadditional authority exists if the President chooses to use it. \nUltimately, someone needs to have the authority to take immediate \naction if there happens to be a crisis, if a crisis comes upon us.\n  The Daschle-Frist amendment waiver provisions--and this is on page 12 \nof the underlying Daschle-Frist amendment--those waiver provisions give \neach State the right to petition the Administrator for a waiver in the \nevent of severe harm to the economy or the environment. The process \nthat is outlined can take up to 90 days. It is not necessarily going to \ntake 90 days. It could\n\n[[Page S7367]]\n\ntake longer, as there is no enforcement really built in, but it is \nsupposed to take no more than 90 days.\n  The State files the petition. The Administrator has the 90 days, \nmaximum, to make a determination of whether the petition should be \ngranted. In making that determination, the Secretary is required to \ngive public notice and an opportunity for comment. That is a 3-month \nperiod--or up to a 3-month period--for a determination to be made and \nfor the mandate to be suspended.\n  In a crisis situation, a significant amount of economic or \nenvironmental damage could be done during that period while all of this \nnotice and opportunity for comment is occurring. In my view, we cannot \nafford that. Ninety days is too long a period.\n  The amendment we are offering does not seek to disturb or to weaken \nthe underlying Daschle-Frist amendment. It simply gives the President \nthe authority to take immediate action to deal with urgent issues that \nmay arise in particular regions. If a State or region experiences a \nsupply disruption which they might experience with regard to ethanol or \na price spike resulting from the mandate, and a suspension of the \nmandate is necessary, then we are giving the President authority to \nsuspend the mandate for a 30-day period. He could renew that for an \nadditional 30 days if he chose to. But that is the essence of our \namendment. If the gasoline prices rise more than 10 cents as a result \nof the mandate, that is when this authority would come into place.\n  Now, this is not the price of ethanol rising 10 cents; this is the \nprice of gasoline at the pump rising 10 cents because of the mandate to \nuse ethanol as required in the Daschle-Frist amendment. If the price of \ngas at the pump rises over 10 cents, and the Secretary makes the \ndetermination that immediate action is necessary, then the mandate \ncould be suspended for the 30 days in this affected PADD, this \nPetroleum Administration for Defense District, or in the effected State \nor region.\n\n  What does that 10-cent rise in the price of gasoline per gallon mean? \nLet me refer to this chart I have in the Chamber.\n  You can see that ethanol is going to be blended with other petroleum \nfuel in gasoline, and 10 percent of it is going to be ethanol. So, in \nfact, if you saw a 50-cent increase in the price of ethanol per gallon, \nthat would mean a 5-cent-per-gallon rise in the price of gasoline. If \nyou saw a $1 increase in the price of ethanol per gallon, that would \nmean a 10-cent-per-gallon increase in the price of gasoline.\n  I think this chart makes clear that what we are proposing gives the \nPresident the ability to act expeditiously. If there is this kind of $1 \nincrease in the price of ethanol itself, that could translate \napproximately to a 10-cent increase in gasoline. This is a high \nthreshold. Frankly, I know there are Members of this Senate who would \nsay that should not be 10 cents; we ought to have the President have \nthe authority to act if you have a 3-cent increase or a 2-cent increase \nor a 5-cent increase, and I might agree with some of that logic.\n  But the truth is, we have tried to write this in a way that makes it \nclear that this is not authority we would expect to be invoked or to be \navailable to the President under most circumstances. This is authority \nwhich would only be available under extraordinary circumstances.\n  Today prices are at about $1.15 per gallon. Adjusted for inflation, \nthis is roughly where they were back in 1998. There has been some \nfluctuation.\n  This second chart that I have in the Chamber shows what has happened \nto the price of gasoline from 1998 through the current period. You can \nsee that there has been fluctuation in the price of ethanol, but we \nhave not seen enough fluctuation in the price of ethanol from the \naverage price to trigger this authority to ever take place, so that \nduring this entire period this authority would not have come into \nplace. It is clear we are not setting up some kind of a hair-trigger \nprocedure here which will give the President or the Secretary of Energy \nthe ability to step in at will and act.\n  The amendment we are proposing is simply a safety valve. As I have \nsaid several times, it is not automatic. If there is no disruption in \nsupply, if prices do not spike substantially outside the range shown on \nthis chart, then nothing would happen. However, in the event we do have \na problem, we would have in place, with this amendment, a procedure for \ndealing with it.\n  The reason I think this amendment is important is because fuel \ntransitions are inherently problematic.\n  We have a lot of history on which to base that judgment. All previous \nchanges to the reformulated gasoline formula have resulted in severe \nprice volatility in gasoline markets. We don't have to go back very far \nto see that this is the case. In 1996 and in the year 2000, we saw \ngasoline prices rise substantially, and both times this resulted in \ngasoline price spikes of more than 30 cents a gallon in California.\n  There are previous EIA studies that have been done, but they have not \naddressed short-term issues. That is what we are talking about, short-\nterm supply disruptions. They either look at the long-term outcomes or \nact to analyze supply disruptions only after they have occurred.\n  The mandate we are proposing to put into law with the Frist-Daschle \namendment does create substantial uncertainty. That has been discussed \nin some of the debate that has already occurred. The mandate says we \nwill use 5 billion gallons of ethanol in the Nation's fuel supply by \n2012. It bans the use of MTBE beginning in the year 2007. While some \nwould prefer to call it a renewable fuels standard, it is in fact a \nmandate. All of us understand that. By the nature of a mandate, it \ncreates a substantial amount of uncertainty.\n  While my colleagues may argue that they have crafted a plan that \nallows plenty of time for the transition from MTBE to ethanol, I have \ndoubts about whether that is the case. Under the mandate in the Frist-\nDaschle amendment, it is possible that our motor fuels market will see \ndisruptions in supply and price spikes that, if left unattended, could \nharm consumers and the economy. Our amendment tries to deal directly \nwith that.\n  We have to keep in mind the MTBE ban affects supply immediately. Once \nthe bill passes, MTBE will be quickly phased out and banned in 16 \nStates; most importantly, in California and Washington and Arizona on \nthe West Coast and in New York and Connecticut on the East Coast. These \nStates in the Northeast in particular are heavily dependent on gasoline \nproduct imports from Europe and South America. Venezuela supplies 8 \npercent of the gasoline volume on the East Coast. The Venezuelan \nNational Oil Company says a renewable fuels mandate could make it \ndifficult if not impossible to import finished gasoline into the United \nStates as they have been doing.\n  Most of the East Coast imports come into the New York area and need \nto be suitable for the reformulated gas markets.\n  As I have said in several ways, there is a lot of uncertainty that we \njust do not know the answers to. Let me list some of that again. Then I \nwill defer to my colleague from New Hampshire who is here and wishes to \nspeak on behalf of the amendment as well.\n  Some of the questions that still exist in my mind as regards this \nmandate are, No. 1, what if we have a supply shortage when refineries \nare already producing at capacity? What does that do to the price to \nthe consumer? Second, what if our import capacity declines and prices \nspike even further? Third, what if there is a drought in the Midwest \nthat affects corn production and therefore affects ethanol production? \nThat could significantly affect the price. And it could get the price \noutside of this area that is reflected on the chart behind me.\n  Perhaps we could experience problems in transporting the ethanol or \nan important element in the refinery infrastructure could be damaged at \na key hub. There is any number of scenarios that could lead us to \nsupply disruptions, to price spikes. Under those circumstances, we need \nto have authority vested with the President to take action. We should \nnot be requiring that he take that action, but we should be giving him \nthe authority. We need to be proactive. We need to look forward and \nanalyze potential problems the U.S. motor fuels market could face in \nthe short term, and we need to do this before the disruption occurs.\n\n[[Page S7368]]\n\n  I urge our colleagues to carefully consider the amendment. It is good \npolicy to build in such a provision to protect consumers in the event \nof a crisis. It is a good safety valve to add to the bill. It \nsubstantially strengthens the bill. I hope my colleagues will agree and \nthat we can add this as an amendment.\n  I yield the floor. I see my colleague, my cosponsor from New \nHampshire, is in the Chamber waiting to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Bingaman \namendment and I thank my colleague for allowing me to work with him on \nthis initiative. I have expressed concerns about the ethanol mandate in \nthis energy bill before, and the concerns this amendment tries to \naddress are obviously an extension of those concerns.\n  As we have debated this Energy Bill prior to today, in the work I \nhave done in the House, and the visits I've had back home with the \npeople of New Hampshire, I have always emphasized that to the extent we \nare debating an energy bill, it ought to be about price and access. It \nshould be about making sure we have available, stable, reliable sources \nof energy and a diversified supply for consumers, because those stable, \nreliable sources of energy are so central to economic growth.\n  At the end of the day, this debate ought to be about access and \nprice. What this amendment attempts to do is to ensure that where the \ngasoline markets are concerned, consumers are protected on access and \non price. We need to make sure that we have, as the Senator from New \nMexico described, a safety valve--a way to ensure that if and when the \nvery significant fuels mandate proposed for this bill is imposed on \ncities, towns, and States across America, there will not be major \ndisruptions in supply that would lead to price spikes, and that \nconsumers not be subjected to higher fuel costs unnecessarily.\n  There is a waiver provision in the underlying amendment. But we ought \nto be concerned about that waiver provision because of the 90-day \nwindow described by the Senator from New Mexico. This would allow the \nPresident and Secretary to act if there is economic harm, but it would \nallow up to 90 days to do so. Ninety days can be a very long time, as \nanyone who sat through the price spikes two summers ago will tell you. \nGasoline prices spiked up, 25, 50 cents, spiking well over $2 in some \nplaces. To the extent that those price spikes could have been avoided, \nmany people would argue the President or the Secretary of Energy should \nhave taken steps to avoid them. That is exactly what this kind of an \namendment will allow.\n  If the cost of ethanol drives those prices up more than 10 cents a \ngallon, then the President can act with the Secretary and suspend the \nmandate for 30 days. It is a safety valve. It doesn't take away from \nthe mandate, although I am one who would like to see more done in terms \nof eliminating the mandate. But, our amendment is a safety valve that \nallows the President to act. It does not force the President to act, \nand it does not require him to act. Instead, it gives the President and \nthe Secretary the opportunity to take steps to protect consumers from \nunreasonable price spikes.\n  Supporters of the ethanol program, those who would like to see the \nmandate imposed no matter what the constraints, might say: Well, it is \nhighly unlikely such spikes will occur. We can look at the graph \npresented by the Senator from New Mexico. It is highly unlikely we \nwould see significant price spikes. Maybe this amendment is \nunnecessary.\n  But, Mr. President, we can't predict the future. We don't know with \ncertainty what will or will not happen to the cost of fuel with the 5-\nbillion gallon mandate on ethanol that has been proposed, but we should \nbe prepared.\n  That is what we are trying to accomplish with this amendment. We \ncould certainly see problems with ethanol production. We don't have the \ncapacity to produce 5 billion gallons today. If the mandate were \nimposed, we would like to believe we could double the production \ncapacity in a brief amount of time, but we don't know that for sure. We \ncould have problems with ethanol production. Frankly, we are likely to \nhave problems with ethanol distribution. They may not be huge problems, \nbut ethanol has to be trucked or shipped around the country. It cannot \nbe distributed through the existing pipeline system we use for gasoline \nin parts of the country.\n  So there are going to be new demands on the logistics governing our \ndistribution system for gasoline. That could certainly have a big \nimpact on prices. The Senator from New Mexico talked about the issue of \nimporting gasoline from places such as Venezuela--there is no certainty \nthat we would be able to continue to import finished gasoline; we might \nhave to import the raw blend stock to be mixed with ethanol in the \nUnited States.\n  There is no guarantee of the reliability of those imports. And, of \ncourse, we may have unusual spikes in demand because of the MTBE bans \nthat are likely to go into effect if and when this legislation becomes \nlaw. I come from a State where there has been strong support for \nbanning the use of MTBE. Even more important, I would certainly like to \nsee a provision in the bill--one that was proposed the other day by the \nSenator from California, Mrs. Feinstein--to allow States to waive the \nrequirement for this mandate, so that States could be free to meet the \nClean Air Act without having to use MTBE or without having to use \nethanol.\n  But the point is, there are uncertainties about the future price of \ngasoline. Those uncertainties are made greater by the potential 5-\nbillion-gallon ethanol mandate in the bill. Our amendment would provide \na safety valve so that if there were price spikes, the President and \nthe Secretary could act in consumers' interests.\n  Despite my concerns about the mandate and all the other concerns I \nmight have about this Energy bill, I think at the end of the day we \nshould be looking to ensure that the bill protects consumers. This \namendment does that. I think it is common sense.\n  I say to my colleagues, you can support the ethanol program and still \nsupport this amendment that protects consumers. Also, you can certainly \noppose the ethanol program and support this amendment that protects \nconsumers.\n  I hope my colleagues will join Senator Bingaman and me in doing the \nright thing for taxpayers and for consumers by supporting this \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak in \nopposition to the Bingaman amendment. I must say as I begin, however, \nthat there is no one in the caucus--and, I argue, in the Senate today--\nwho knows more about the issues relating to energy than does my \ncolleague from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman. He has been an outstanding \nleader, and I have enjoyed working with him on these issues now for \nmany years. I recall so vividly his masterful work in getting us a bill \nthat generated some 88 votes, if I recall, last year. That was after \nabout 8 weeks of work. So it is not easy to take these issues or to \nmove this legislation. He deserves great credit for the work he has \ndone.\n  I take issue with this amendment for several reasons. I have had a \nchance to look at the amendment itself. There are phrases on line 9 and \non line 2 of page 2 that are of particular concern to me. I will read \nthe pertinent passages of the amendment, and I will explain my concern.\n\n  First, I have a little explanatory comment. Obviously, the \ndistinguished Senator from New Mexico is interested in providing \ngreater authority to the Secretary to suspend the requirements of the \nbill. Then he lists those instances in his amendment where the \nrequirements of the bill would be lifted. It is in these areas that I \nfind my initial concern, and then I will address some other concerns I \nhave.\n  On line 9, page 1, it says:\n\n       Application of the requirements of paragraph (2) in the \n     District will result, or has\n\n[[Page S7369]]\n\n     resulted, in an increase in the average cost of gasoline to \n     the end users in the District of ten cents per gallon or \n     more.\n\n  Line 2, page 2, that he can suspend the requirements of the bill if, \nin the estimation of the Secretary of Energy:\n\n       a significant interruption in the supply of renewable fuel \n     in the District will result, or has resulted, in an increase \n     in the average cost of gasoline to end users in the District \n     of ten cents per gallon or more.\n  The phrase that troubles me is ``will result.'' We all would like to \nbe able to anticipate the future. But I could easily see a Secretary \nwho has opposition to renewable fuels, opposition to any real \nrequirement that we move to find replacements for gasoline; or, for \nthat matter, you could put this in a larger context, if we were talking \nabout the renewable portfolio standard, to wind, solar, biomass, or any \nother renewable fuel, where you could see a Secretary announce: You \nknow what. I have made a decision. I have made a decision that this \nwill result at some point in the future in a cost increase, and the \nSenator here would set as the threshold 10 cents a gallon. But it will \nhappen, and on that basis I am going to suspend the law.\n  First, the declarative authority on the part of the Secretary as a \nresult of his ability to predict--weather men are wrong, politicians \nare wrong, and Secretaries could be wrong. Yet we would give him the \nauthority, based on his judgment and his prediction that somehow he \nwill know we are going to exceed 10 cents a gallon and, on that basis, \nsuspend the law, take an action to suspend the law.\n  The second concern I have is the good government concern. If we are \ngoing to suspend the law, it seems to me we ought to have an \nopportunity to have comment, to have others express themselves on \nwhether this will result in a price increase. As an advocate of good \ngovernment, generally when we pass legislation, anytime we designate \nauthority to somebody else, we say, look, you cannot do this without \nsome ability to be heard. You have to be heard. There has to be a \nprocess before we give dictatorial powers to somebody to change the \nlaw.\n  That is exactly what our bill does. Our bill says that in those \ninstances when some economic disruption might occur, No. 1, there has \nto be a demonstration that it has occurred. No prediction that it might \nhappen. It has to happen so we know with what we are dealing.\n\n  Secondly we say: If we are going to suspend a law passed by the U.S. \nCongress and signed into law by the President of the United States, \nthere has to be a good government procedure, and that procedure simply \nsays there has to be notice, there has to be an opportunity to be \nheard, and then a decision has to be made.\n  Then we even go beyond that. We say a decision has to be made within \n90 days. At one point, in a previous version of this bill, we said it \nhad to be done in 180 days. Some said that was too long a period. So we \nhave already cut that in half. Then it said no later than 90 days. That \nis not the threshold to start the decisionmaking process. That is the \nthreshold to end it.\n  Advocates of good government, I would think, would say that is a \npretty good way to do it. If we are going to have price spikes--and I \nwill get to that in just a minute--then it seems to us you ought to \ngive somebody an opportunity to waive the requirements of law. That is \nunderstandable. We can do that. But to say, first, we are going to \nallow that person to make this decision based on what he thinks is \ngoing to happen, and then, secondly, allow him to make a decision based \non what he thinks is going to happen without any good government \napplication of the law, an opportunity to be heard, an opportunity to \nmake some judgment based on facts, is an awfully troubling assertion or \nproposition to me.\n  Having said that, the Department of Energy, in January of last year, \njust a little over a year ago, completed a report on this very issue. I \nhave not known the Department of Energy necessarily to be a cheerleader \nfor ethanol. They have not been out there leading the pack. But they \nwere asked: What analysis can you provide us with regard to this very \nconcern? Here is their conclusion:\n\n       No major infrastructure barriers exist to expand ethanol to \n     5 billion gallons per year comparable to the legislation \n     before us today.\n\n  The Energy Information Agency said after their careful analysis in \nconcert with this report:\n\n       The cost of establishing a renewable fuels standard is less \n     than half a penny per gallon for all gasoline.\n\n  That is not an assertion by the Senator from South Dakota. That is \nnot the ethanol industry. That is the Federal Government in its \nanalysis of the implications of what it is we are doing with this \nlegislation--a half a penny per gallon for all gasoline.\n  In March of this year, the California Energy Commission analysis said \nit cannot establish any attributable increase in the price of gasoline \nbased on the cost or availability of ethanol and the requirements under \nwhich they currently are living.\n  Mr. President, first, if you listen to our own analysis, the \nGovernment agencies that have provided their most objective review of \nthe circumstances, we are talking about half a penny per gallon for all \ngasoline. We are talking about the California Energy Commission--and I \nmight note, as I said yesterday, 65 percent of all the gasoline sold in \nCalifornia today has ethanol. It is going to go to 80 percent by \nsummer. And we have the California Energy Commission saying they cannot \nfind any tangible connection between the price of ethanol and the price \nof gasoline. But if, for whatever reason, it might happen, we say: \nLet's give the Secretary the authority. Let's make sure we are not \ngoing to hold consumers hostage to some sort of unexpected price hike, \nbut let's, No. 1, make sure it happens, rather than give the Secretary \nthis ability to predict and make some assertion it might happen. And, \nsecondly, let's use the good government practices we have always used \nto ensure if we are going to change the law for whatever period of \ntime, that we do so with the opportunity for Americans to be heard. So \nI hope we oppose this amendment.\n\n  I end where I started. The Senator from New Mexico deserves great \ncredit for all he has done to bring us to this point. I respect him \nimmensely and differ with him on this amendment. We could not be in \nbetter hands. I appreciate his cooperation on so many of these issues \nas we move forward. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 851, As Modified\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I very much appreciate the comments of \nthe leader. I know of his strong commitment to this underlying \namendment. I will say what everyone in the Senate knows, which is his \nreputation, a well-earned reputation, for straight dealing. He \nindicated to me before I offered the amendment that he would be \ncompelled to oppose it, and I certainly understand. I am anxious to \naccommodate some of the concerns he has raised.\n  With that in mind, I send a modification of the amendment to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. The amendment is \nso modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n       On page 18, after line 15, insert the following:\n       ``(11) Significant price increase or supply interruption.--\n       ``(A) Suspension of requirements.--In addition to the \n     authority of the Administrator to waive the requirements of \n     paragraph (2) under paragraphs (7) and (8), and to extend the \n     exemption from paragraph (2) under paragraph (9), the \n     President, acting through the Secretary of Energy, may \n     suspend the requirements of paragraph (2) in any Petroleum \n     Administration for Defense District, in whole or in part, in \n     the event the Secretary of Energy determines that--\n       ``(i) application of the requirements of paragraph (2) in \n     the District has resulted in an increase in the average cost \n     of gasoline to end users in the District of ten cents per \n     gallon or more; or\n       ``(ii) a significant interruption in the supply of \n     renewable fuel in the District has resulted in an increase in \n     the average cost of gasoline to end users in the District of \n     ten cents per gallon or more.\n       ``(B) Duration of suspension.--A suspension granted under \n     subparagraph (A) shall terminate after 30 days, but may be \n     renewed by the Secretary of Energy for additional 30-day \n     periods if he determines that the significant price increase \n     or significant supply interruption persists.''.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me explain what I did with the \nmodification. I dealt with the issue Senator Daschle raised about his \nconcern that\n\n[[Page S7370]]\n\nthe language in the previous amendment, as I offered it with Senator \nSununu, allowed the Secretary to act on the basis of a prediction about \nwhat was going to happen. That language was in the bill, and I just \nmodified the bill to provide that the President--let me clarify that \nnothing in this amendment gives the Secretary authority to act. This \namendment only gives the President authority to act. The President can \nonly act on the basis of a determination made by his or her Secretary \nof Energy.\n  Now, with the modification, it would be a determination made by his \nor her Secretary of Energy that this ethanol mandate, in fact, has \nresulted in an increase in the average cost of gasoline to end users or \nit has resulted in a significant interruption or has resulted in an \nincrease in the average cost by at least 10 cents per gallon as a \nresult of the mandate.\n  In response to that concern Senator Daschle raised, I want to be \nclear that we have dealt with that in the modification I have just sent \nto the desk.\n  Let me also address briefly the other issues Senator Daschle raised.\n  He indicated the need for this is not there because, in fact, the \nEnergy Information Agency in the Department of Energy has said this \nmandate will result in an increase in the price of gas per gallon of \nless than one-half of 1 cent per gallon, and the California Energy \nCommission has also concluded that there is no appreciable increase \nthat will result from this mandate.\n  First of all, if you look into the analyses that were done both by \nthe Department of Energy and the California Energy Commission, they \nwere looking over the long term and saying over the long term there \nwill not be, in their view, a substantial increase in the price of \ngasoline as a result of this mandate. That may well be true. Our \namendment does not deal with the long term. Our amendment tries to deal \nwith the short term, and that is where there is a price spike, where \nthere is a supply disruption that causes the price to go up an \nadditional 10 cents per gallon because of the ethanol mandate, if that \noccurs, and it may well not occur. So there is a difference between the \nstudies that they did, which are long term, and the issue we are trying \nto deal with, which is short term.\n\n  I also point out that another sort of flaw in the argument, at least \nin my view, is that we are now saying we do not need to put this extra \nsafety valve in the legislation because we have a prediction by the \nEnergy Information Agency and we have a prediction by the California \nEnergy Commission that this will not be needed down the road. It may \nwell not be needed, and certainly I am not here to predict that it will \nbe needed. I am just saying this is a good insurance policy. This is a \ngood safety valve.\n  The Energy Information Agency has been known to make mistakes in \ntheir predictions. As to the California Energy Commission, although I \nam not totally familiar with all of their work, I would venture to say \nthey have probably made a few mistakes in their predictions. I do not \nknow exactly where they were on their predictions with regard to the \nprice of electricity in California a few years ago, but they may well \nhave missed the mark in predicting what that price was going to be, and \nthey might well have wished there was some similar authority to this in \nplace that could have been exercised or had been exercised when that \ncrisis hit.\n  So I think this is good government practice, and clearly under most \ncircumstances the appropriate course is to give public notice, to have \nopportunity for comment and hearings, have all the sides, all the \ninterest groups come in and give their point of view. That is a good \ncourse. But if the price of ethanol has gone up substantially or there \nhas been a supply disruption or there has been something that has \noccurred that has caused the price of gasoline to jump more than 10 \ncents that is directly traceable to this mandate, I believe the wise \ncourse is for us to give authority to the President to take action if \nhe or she decides to take action.\n  As I say, there is nothing in this amendment that requires anyone to \ndo anything. This amendment merely gives people authority to take \naction if a crisis occurs, if a price spike occurs, if they determine \nthat action is appropriate.\n  It is possible, in some future administration, that there will be a \nSecretary of Energy who is opposed to ethanol perhaps, but I assume \nthat the American people are going to elect Presidents in the future \nwho reflect their views on most issues. If they do not reflect their \nviews, then of course the voters have the opportunity to hold them \naccountable when there is a follow-on election.\n  Clearly, I think we are mandating a substantial increase in the use \nof ethanol. I am not opposing that in this amendment, but I am saying \nlet us at least be a little bit humble about our own ability to predict \nwhat might occur in the future. If, in fact, there is a significant \nprice spike because of some problem in transitioning to this new fuel \nmixture, if there is some price spike as a result of interruptions in \nsupply, then let's have the President, with the authority, deal with \nthe situation, and let's not just say, okay, we are going to require \nthat they go through the normal hoops, give public notice and comments, \nhave hearings, and all of that. I think there is certainly a time for \nall of that, but there is also a time to take action. When the American \npeople elect a President, they expect the President to have authority \nto act when the circumstance requires. That is what our amendment would \ndo, and we hope very much it will be agreed to.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator join me in asking for the yeas and \nnays on his amendment?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I am glad to ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me ask, does Senator Reid know if there is another \nSenator who has an amendment?\n  Mr. REID. Senator Schumer is due any minute to offer an amendment on \nthis subject.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have spoken to the two managers of the \nbill. We have been dealing now for the second day on the ethanol \nsection. What we would like all Members to hear, if anyone has any \ndesire to offer an amendment on the ethanol section, is they should let \ntheir respective Cloakrooms know immediately. The knowledge we have at \nthis time is Senator Boxer has two amendments, Senator Schumer has one \namendment, Senator Clinton has one amendment, and Senator Feinstein has \ntwo amendments.\n  If there are amendments other than these that I have just \nenumerated--Boxer, two; Schumer, one; Clinton, one; Feinstein, two--\nthey should let the cloakrooms know. It is my understanding Senator \nNickles may or may not offer an amendment but he is on the list.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Should we put Nickles on the list?\n  We think he will come off.\n  Mr. REID. He is on the list. If anyone else wants to offer an \namendment, let us know immediately. Otherwise we are going to enter \ninto an agreement that the amendments I have just listed will be the \nonly ones in order on the ethanol section.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Might we do it this way, so there will be a bit of \nfinality. It is 10 minutes to 5. Could we enter into an agreement that \nthat is it, unless some Senator contacts you or Senator Bingaman or \nmyself by 5 o'clock?\n  Mr. REID. We should give people a little bit of time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is plenty, 10 minutes. At 5:30?\n  Mr. REID. I personally would like to get off this section. We hope to \nhave a vote, it is my understanding, by 5:15. We would know as soon as \nthat vote is completed.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. For now we are going with the fact this is all we are\n\n[[Page S7371]]\n\naware of. We hope Senators understand we are perilously close to making \nthat a consent agreement but we have not yet, just in deference to \nsomebody who might still come up with a new idea regarding this \nsubject.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield, I have spoken to Senator \nFeinstein. She is willing to offer one of her amendments tonight, as \nsoon as the vote is completed. What we will try to do is have slots \navailable, either tonight or first thing in the morning, to finish \nthese amendments.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I understand. To give her a little more time, I \nunderstand we could have two votes. What we will tell the Senate \nshortly, about LIHEAP, which may meet with your approval, Senator \nBingaman--the idea would be to bring it back immediately following a \nvote on your amendment. It would make the pending business the LIHEAP \namendments, both of them, at which time we would have a vote on the \nDomenici amendment that was offered in behalf of the chairman of the \ncommittee, and there would be a vote. Immediately following that vote \nthere would be a vote, if required, on the LIHEAP amendment.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, in response to the question, my \nunderstanding is Senator Cantwell, from Washington, did want to speak \non this LIHEAP issue. I don't feel comfortable just agreeing we are \ngoing to lock her out of that opportunity. I think we have been \nadvising people that the LIHEAP issue had been put aside for some \nperiod of time.\n  Until we can consult with her, at least, and find out--as I \nunderstand it, the Senator is suggesting we go ahead and go to a vote \non the Gregg amendment?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Gregg amendment, yes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. That would essentially replace the LIHEAP provisions \nwith a sense of the Senate.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Right.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I am saying before I agree to that specific time I \nwould like to be sure to protect Senator Cantwell.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wonder if we could agree to vote on the Bingaman \namendment and then say, when that vote has been completed and we finish \nit, there would be 10 minutes for debate, at which time I will give 5 \nof that to the Senator you just described, for her discussion, or 10, \nwhatever you would like, after which we would have a vote? That gives \nyou what you need and it sets up at least two votes and a disposition \nof your LIHEAP.\n\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield, that may be appropriate, but we \nneed to check with her first.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. All right. Could we just make sure everybody \nunderstands we are prepared to move, soon, to bring the LIHEAP issue \nback on the calendar where it belongs, and to dispose of it this \nevening?\n  With that, I assume we will proceed, Senator, to vote on your \namendment, if that is all right with you.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, in response, I have no problem with \nproceeding to a vote on my amendment on ethanol at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 851\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, there has been ample argument in \nopposition to the Bingaman amendment. The Senator from New Mexico, the \nmanager of the bill, would merely like to say, while I accept the \nargument of the distinguished junior Senator from New Mexico, it seems \nto this Senator from New Mexico that to adopt the amendment truly \ncreates an unworkable situation with reference to the source, supply, \nand the management of petroleum needs in the United States. That is all \nI have to say. I believe there is ample flexibility in the underlying \nbill. I do not believe we ought to make it more difficult to turn the \nspigot on and off with reference to the impact of ethanol on the \ngasoline supply in the country.\n  I believe it is almost unworkable, for any President to decide, for \ninstance, what caused the increase and to turn that on and off with \nreference to the supply and refining capacity and the like.\n  With that, I yield the floor. I am prepared to vote up or down on the \nBingaman amendment to the ethanol amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am going to suggest the absence a quorum for about 10 \nminutes. Senators are being put on notice during that period of time \nthat we are going to vote shortly. That is why we are having a 10-\nminute quorum call at this time. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Idaho (Mr. Crapo) and \nthe Senator from Ohio (Mr. Voinovich) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Florida (Mr. Graham), the \nSenator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry), and the Senator from \nConnecticut (Mr. Lieberman) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``nay.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 37, nays 58, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 206 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--37\n\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Cantwell\n     Clinton\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Ensign\n     Feinstein\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Kennedy\n     Kyl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     McCain\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Rockefeller\n     Santorum\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Sununu\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--58\n\n     Alexander\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Craig\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Johnson\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Levin\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Sarbanes\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n\n                             NOT VOTING--5\n\n     Crapo\n     Graham (FL)\n     Kerry\n     Lieberman\n     Voinovich\n  The amendment (No. 851) was rejected.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I say to fellow Senators, we are going \nto have a unanimous-consent request that will pertain to ethanol. There \nwill be no further votes this evening. We will have a unanimous-consent \nrequest regarding three amendments on ethanol that will be entered into \nshortly. All three will be voted on tomorrow, and that will dispose of \nthe ethanol second-degree amendments.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. After visiting with the two managers of the bill, the next \namendment that will be offered on this Frist-\n\n[[Page S7372]]\n\nDaschle amendment is one by the Senator from New York on behalf of \nhimself and Senator Clinton. The agreement on that is that there will \nbe 20 minutes equally divided. That basically is what would happen on \nthis amendment. This is a second-degree amendment. So that is all the \nprotection they need.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Schumer be recognized to offer \nhis amendment, that there be 20 minutes equally divided on this \namendment, and that the vote would occur sometime tomorrow, which will \nbe subject to the two leaders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Do we have the rest of the consent ready?\n  Mr. REID. He is not quite ready yet.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Does the Senator think we should wait now and do it or \nlet Senator Schumer begin?\n  Just so everybody understands, we do intend to have a consent that \ndisposes of all three amendments, with votes on all three, Schumer and \ntwo others. But that consent agreement will come along shortly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York is recognized.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 853 to Amendment No. 850\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I have an amendment at the desk. I ask unanimous consent \nthat Senator Clinton be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. Schumer], for himself and \n     Mrs. Clinton, proposes an amendment numbered 853 to amendment \n     No. 850.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To exclude Petroleum Administration for Defense Districts I, \n               IV, and V from the renewable fuel program)\n\n       On page 4, strike lines 6 through 15 and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(i) Promulgation.--Not later than 1 year after the date \n     of enactment of this paragraph, the Administrator shall \n     promulgate regulations to ensure that gasoline sold or \n     introduced into commerce in the United States (except in \n     Petroleum Administration for Defense Districts I, IV, and V), \n     on an annual average basis, contains the applicable volume of \n     renewable fuel determined in accordance with subparagraph \n     (B).\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I rise today to offer an amendment that \nwould modify the renewable fuels provision of this amendment and limit \nit to Petroleum Administration Defense Districts II and III where corn \nand ethanol are most naturally available.\n  The objection that those of us from the coasts and the Rocky Mountain \nareas have with this amendment is very simple. While corn is plentiful \nin the Middle West, as this chart shows, and ethanol will be a good \nadditive for gasoline in terms of cleaner air, in terms of oxidation, \nit will not work on the coasts. First, we do not have the corn \navailable. It has to be shipped. It has to be made into ethanol and \nthen shipped. Since ethanol is combustible, shipping is expensive. It \nwill raise prices for us. We do not know how much. There is a dispute. \nBut when there is a better way to do it that will not raise any \ngasoline prices, there is no reason we should not be for this.\n  So this amendment would basically be very simple. It would say that \nPADDs II and III, the corn-growing areas of the country which produce \nmost of the ethanol, would, indeed, still have the mandate before them, \nbut it would allow PADDs I and IV and V to be exempt.\n  This body has no reason not to exempt. We have already exempted \nAlaska and Hawaii because they are far away. The issue is not the \namount of water or land that must be traversed; it is how far the \nethanol has to be transported, and it has to be transported quite a \nlong distance to get to these other areas.\n  So I join with my colleague, Senator Clinton, to offer this amendment \nand to say the main reason we are against this is very simple: There \nare cheaper ways to do this. This will raise the price of gasoline, and \nit will be an unfair burden, an unfair tax, on many of the people who \nlive in the two coastal areas of this country and in the Rocky Mountain \nStates.\n  Every one of my colleagues from the PADD IV, PADD V, and PADD I areas \nare not representing their constituents unless they vote for this \namendment because the benefit for the few corn growers in our area will \nbe far exceeded by the detriment to every driver in the area in terms \nof increased gasoline prices.\n  Some say it will not raise prices much. Most of the studies are \nadmittedly divided on that, but there is too much evidence that says \nthey will. If there is a better way to do it that does not require a \nmandate, why not? I say to my free market colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle, it is very hypocritical to be for the free market except \nwhen it benefits a product in their State. To force ethanol on areas \nthat could do it better in other ways is not free market.\n  Ethanol is already subsidized dramatically. I have supported money \nfor our corn growers, even though we have very few in New York. But if \nwe are going to do it, it ought to come out of the Treasury, not out of \nthe pockets of drivers throughout the Nation. We are going to be making \na major mistake. We will come back 3, 4, 5 years from now, if we pass \nthe Frist-Daschle amendment, and we will regret it.\n  Remember the catastrophic tax? This is the same type of thing. I do \nnot want any of my colleagues to say they did not know, because we are \ngiving them warning loudly and clearly that the chances that this will \nraise gasoline prices significantly are too high to risk it, \nparticularly when there are other ways to require the clean burning of \nfuels other than ethanol.\n\n  So for my colleague from Tennessee and for my colleague from South \nDakota, who are both fine people, we are not exempting their areas. If \nthey want to do it there, that is fine. It is not going to cost them \nmuch. It will help their corn growers and not cost their drivers much. \nBut for all the people on the east coast, the west coast, and the Rocky \nMountain States, this makes a huge difference.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I reserve the \nremainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing be the only remaining second-degree amendments to No. 850 and \nthat they be related to ethanol: No. 1, Schumer, which we are hearing \nnow, 20 minutes equally divided; Senator Boxer, 1 hour equally divided \non two amendments. I further ask unanimous consent that following \ndebate on the Schumer amendment this evening, the amendment be \ntemporarily set aside. I further ask consent that when the Senate \nresumes consideration of the Energy bill on Thursday, Senator Boxer be \nrecognized--at that time, she be recognized in order to offer her first \namendment.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that following debate on the above \nlisted amendments, they be temporarily set aside and the votes occur in \nrelation to the amendments in the order offered at a time determined by \nthe majority leader after consultation with the Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic assistant leader.\n  Mr. REID. I ask that there be 2 minutes equally divided between the \nvotes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to modifying the unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I do not want to object, but I want to ask a question \nbecause I am rereading what I just read. It does not seem to me that it \nsays there is a second Boxer amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Yes, she has two. It does say that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It says Senator Boxer be recognized to offer her first \namendment.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that following the debate on the \nabove listed amendments--it does not say her second amendment.\n  Mr. REID. We want to make sure she gets to offer her second \namendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. All right.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, Senator Boxer has indicated she would be \nwilling to come anytime in the morning. It\n\n[[Page S7373]]\n\nis my understanding, after having spoken to the managers of the bill, \nthat she would need to be here at approximately 10 a.m. tomorrow.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is about right.\n  Mr. REID. We will go into session at 9:30. Staff should advise \nSenator Boxer to be here at 10.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, maybe I did not make it clear, because it \nwas not clear, that we are going to have three votes. I assumed we \nwould go right into the first vote and not need the 2 minutes, but we \nare going to do this later, so Senator Schumer would also need the 2 \nminutes as with the two Boxer amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from New York has \n5 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I don't see anyone here who wants to argue in \nopposition to you. We have already voted. I know the Senator from New \nYork has great, innovative capacity and that he has proudly come up \nwith an amendment the likes of which the Senate has never seen or \nheard, but I have an inclination that it is similar to what we have \nvoted heretofore; I don't believe it has been offered to do anything \nother than cause significant mischief to the ethanol bill which is \nbefore the Senate, which I understand has very broad support.\n  So my argument would merely be, in all deference, to suggest that \nenough is enough, and just as we voted heretofore in opposition to the \nother amendments, we follow suit and vote against the amendment of the \ndistinguished Senator from New York.\n  I only used 3 minutes and I yield back any other time in opposition. \nI thank the Senator for being generous in only using a small amount of \nthe Senate's time this evening. I do mean the latter seriously.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I conclude, first, one difference with \nthis amendment--it has the support of the ranking Democrat on the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee, which the others did not. \nSecond, it affects all of the coastal States, not just one or two.\n  On the other amendments there was a general opt-out. Those who \nadvocate ethanol would say every State could opt out and we would not \nhave an ethanol program. Here, the main States that care about it in \nPADDs II and III, half of the States in the country or less, would not \nbe allowed to opt out. It would be cheaper for them.\n  I say to my good friend, ``mischief''? We are creating mischief with \nthis amendment? My goodness, the amendment my good friend the chairman \nof the Energy and Natural Resources Committee is creating affecting the \ndrivers in more than half the country is enormous, all to help the corn \ngrowers and to help the ethanol industry. That is the kind of mischief \nthat people do not like about Washington.\n  They are saying, you are telling me, Mr. John Q. Smith of New York, \nMiss Mary E. Jones of Oregon, Miss Young Teenager who just learned to \ndrive from Denver, CO, they must use ethanol even if it costs more.\n  I see my good friend from Pennsylvania, one of the great upholders of \nfree market principles--except when it comes to steel and corn.\n  Let's be realistic here.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If the Senator from New York would yield, if he checks \nmy vote on the last 2 amendments he would find I am a great defender of \nthe free market principle and have joined the Senator from New York in \nsupport of those.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I retract my remarks. I should not have assumed the \nworst.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I say to my friend from New Mexico who also upholds free \nmarket principles that this is not a free market bill. This is the \nopposite. Even the Wall Street Journal editorial page has come out \nagainst this proposal.\n  Can't we form a nice little coalition of the States poorly affected, \nthe States that are hurt by this, plus all those who believe in the \ngreat free market, like my good friend from Pennsylvania on the issue \nof corn?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I remind the Senator, in response to the Senator from \nNew Mexico and his remarks about this being more of the same and enough \nis enough and his comment, one thing is different, and that is that the \nranking minority member of the Energy Committee was on his amendment, I \nremind the Senator that same Senator has offered his own amendment and \nit did not get enough votes. If you get as many votes as he got, you \nare doing quite well. I don't know that you can expect more by saying \nhe is on it since he has tried his best and failed already.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Reclaiming my time, I simply say to my friend from New \nMexico, the underlying is so bad and so egregious it is worth trying \nand trying again.\n  You know the old song: what made you think that ram could punch a \nhole in the dam? Everyone knows a ram can't punch a hole in the dam, \nbut he had high hopes. He had high hopes, high, apple pie-in-the-sky \nhopes.\n  That is what we have here. We know if we persist, because we are \nright, we can do it, just like the ad, that could not move a banana \ntree plant in the same aforementioned song.\n  We are going to keep trying. We know it is an uphill fight. We do not \nthink that is because we are wrong. We think that is because there is a \nlot of power on the other side. I guess our lack of strength and votes \nthus far is somewhat made up for in the passion we felt about this \nissue in these amendments.\n  If my colleague would like to conclude, I yield him whatever time \nremains.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am anxiously awaiting for you to decide you have used \nyour time up. Have you?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask the President if I have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 54 seconds.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. In deference to my good friend from New Mexico, and in \nhopes that he will see the error of his ways, I yield back those 54 \nseconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am so thrilled. That is the first act of generosity \nthat has occurred with reference to the chairman, who has been trying \nto get this bill completed. I am very thrilled.\n  Tomorrow we will have three votes, as I indicated, starting sometime \nafter 10 o'clock. They will all be on ethanol. We have a bill with all \nkinds of things in it and we will just be finishing the subject matter \nof both votes on ethanol.\n  I do thank the minority managers for their efforts, in particular \nSenator Reid, in trying to narrow down the number of amendments on the \nDemocratic side, which they have done.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/04/senate-section/article/S7373-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, there is no question that the goals of the \nEndangered Species Act are noble. Wyoming residents understand the \ndesire to maintain a healthy environment and to manage and protect \nwildlife. In fact, it is a business we have been in for generations. \nThe fact that today's private lands are the primary habitat for a more \nabundant range of wildlife than can be found on Federal public lands is \na strong testament to my Wyoming's residents' belief in protecting \nwildlife and their willingness to put those beliefs in action.\n  It was the State of Wyoming, not the Federal Government, that took \naction to find the believed extinct black-footed ferret. The State then \nused its own\n\n[[Page S7374]]\n\nmoney to build a facility that was able to nurse the ferret back into \nexistence. As a result of the State's unilateral efforts we now have \nseveral populations of black-footed ferrets spread across several \nStates.\n  Unfortunately, the ESA has moved beyond its goals of recovery species \nand had become a tool to control development, to shut down small \nbusinesses, and to impose costs--in the form of unfunded mandates--on \nStates, local governments and private individuals.\n  Then there are those other costs, the ones that can't be put into \nexact dollar figures but which seem to drain the already limited \nresources of private land owners. Whether it is the grizzly bear, \nblack-footed ferret, Canada lynx, Preble's meadow jumping mouse, gray \nwolf, whooping crane, bald eagle, western snowy plover, sage grouse, \nWyoming toad, Colorado pikeminnow, razorback sucker, Colorado butterfly \nplant, or a flower called the Ute Ladies' tresses, Wyoming residents \nhave been forced to invest valuable man hours and personal property to \nensure these plants, fish and animals are managed according to national \npriorities as set by non-resident Federal agencies.\n  It is only fair that Federal dollars be provided to pay for Federal \npriorities.\n  Imagine, as a home owner, that an endangered species is discovered in \nyour yard. What if you were then denied the use of your garden, back \nyard and driveway, couldn't mow or pull any weeds and were told, oh, \nyes, you have to change jobs too. You'd be on the phone to your lawyer, \nyour governor, your Senator and the President. And all of them would \nsay, ``It's the law and you are not entitled to a dime of \ncompensation.'' Now how would you feel about the Endangered Species \nAct?\n  Granted, a farm or ranch is larger than your garden or back yard, but \nit is often the sole source of support for some of our Nation's \nhardworking families--and to have acres taken away and out of use \nwithout compensation would appear to violate the Constitution! My bill \nmerely provides for just compensation for this, a Federal priority and \nmandate.\n  My bill would guarantee funding for implementing the ESA while \nrequiring the Federal Government to pay for all the costs relating to \nthe establishment of State management plans, monitoring, consultation \nand administration, surveys, conservation agreements, land \nacquisitions, losses from predation, losses in value to real or \npersonal property or any other cost imposed for mitigating management \nof a species covered by the ESA.\n  When they see the real costs of these regulations and their impact on \ncommunities, the American public will, for the first time, realize what \nit costs to declare a species as endangered. It's one thing to dictate \nhow someone else or another community spends its resources, and it's \nquite another to face those costs and lost opportunities yourself.\n  There should be no question in anyone's mind that the Endangered \nSpecies Act is an unfunded mandate. For far too many years states, \nlocal governments and individual property owners have borne the brunt \nof implementing the Federal Endangered Species Act. They stagger \nbeneath the momentous weight of having to pay for the mismanagement and \npolicy decisions of federal bureaucracies.\n  One of the biggest problems with this statute is that the people \nforcing implementation have no real perspective on what it does or how \nit impacts states and local communities. It is very easy for them to \nsit back in their protected communities, surrounded by granite walls \nand pavement, and dictate to the West that our herds of cows and flocks \nof sheep are needed to feed the wolves they transplanted here, or that \nspecies preservation is more important than providing jobs for the \ncommunity and putting food on the table. It's easy for them because \nthey don't have to live with the results of their decisions. It doesn't \ncost them anything and they have nothing to lose. The only investment \nmost Americans make in the Endangered Species Act is rhetoric.\n  I love Wyoming and the plants and animals that populate it. I would \nhate to see anything happen that would change the ability of Wyoming \nand individuals to continue managing its land with the kind of \nproductivity that we now have.\n  The reality is, however, that the Endangered Species Act has become \nmore of a hindrance than a help. Not one species has been recovered \nbecause of the rules and regulations imposed by this statute. What has \nhad the biggest impact has been the people on the ground who are not \nallowed to make personal choices on how they manage their own property. \nIf we continue to impose the costs and expenses on local landowners and \ncommunities, there will come a day when they are no longer there to \nmake the wise and well informed management decisions that will make a \nreal difference in the future existence of our Nation's endangered \nspecies.\n  I hope my colleagues will consider this bill and the costs it puts on \nindividuals and recognize that the Endangered Species Act is a Federal \npriority and, as such, it should be a Federal cost, not a personal \ncost.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/04/senate-section/article/S7374-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   COMMEMORATING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE HISTORIC FRANKLIN HOTEL\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate my dear \nfriend Bill Walsh on the 100th anniversary of the Historic Franklin \nHotel in Deadwood, SD.\n  The Franklin Hotel is truly a piece of living history and a jewel of \nthe Black Hills. Throughout the decades, the Franklin has accommodated \nPresidents and celebrities, including Teddy Roosevelt, William Taft, \nJohn Wayne, and the great Babe Ruth. In addition to being a much-\ncelebrated destination for visitors to the Black Hills, the Franklin \nhas also served as a cornerstone for the community of Deadwood. The \nFranklin was a source of comfort for city dwellers during the Great \nDepression, and hosted the first radio broadcast in the State of South \nDakota.\n  Today, the Franklin continues to be a place of celebration, as it \naccommodates thousands of tourists in the Black Hills each year. From \nviewing the Days of '76 Parade on the veranda, to celebrating St. \nPatrick's Day in Durty Nelly's, to a grand New Year's Eve celebration, \nthe Franklin continues to be a source of great entertainment and a \nplace where special memories are made daily.\n  The Historic Franklin Hotel is a true reminder of our rich Western \nheritage. Today, on its 100th anniversary, the task of maintaining and \npreserving this rich cultural treasure rests on the shoulders of Bill \nWalsh. If founder Harris Franklin were alive today, he would be proud \nof Bill's dedication to the preservation of this historic landmark. I \nextend my best wishes to Bill and the Franklin Hotel's Board of \nDirectors, Jo Roebuck Pearson, Mike Trucano, Taffy Tucker, and Orville \nBryan.\n  Congratulations to all of you as you celebrate this extraordinary \nmilestone. We look forward to the next 100 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/04/senate-section/article/S7374-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RELEASE OF AUNG SAN SUU KYI\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today I rise to affirm the call from \nSecretary of State Powell that military leaders in Burma release Aung \nSan Suu Kyi from continued ``protective custody.''\n  The reimposition of custody of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and the denial of \nrequests by United States and other officials to meet with her and \nassure her good health and well-being are unconscionable. She should be \nreleased immediately and unconditionally. In addition to the release of \nother National League for Democracy leaders who have been arrested, I \nalso call upon the government of Burma to allow the NLD to reopen its \noffices throughout the country.\n  The only hope for democracy in Burma will be found in dialogue among \nthe National League for Democracy, the State Peace and Development \nCouncil and the ethnic nationalities. The arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi is \na major setback to meaningful reform, and raises serious questions \nabout whether the current ruling junta can be trusted to live up to any \nof its promises. The United States must continue to support Daw Aung \nSan Suu Kyi and the NLD.\n  I am pleased that the Bush administration, in coordination with the \nUnited Nations Security Council and other members of the international \ncommunity, is ``considering all measures available in our efforts to \nfoster this transition to democracy.''\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/04/senate-section/article/S7375-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S7375]]\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred on April 10, \n2003. A day after taking part in the national Day of Silence to promote \nschool safety for gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgendered students, \n16-year-old Caitlin Meuse was savagely attacked in Concord, MA. \nAccording to police, the attack may have been related to her \nparticipation in the event at her high school. Meuse had been struck by \na blunt object such as a baseball bat or a tire iron. Knocked \nunconscious and bleeding from the head, Caitlin was found lying in the \nstreet by a neighbor near her home. She was held in intensive care at \nthe hospital for 2 days and was treated for a head injury, missing \nfront teeth, a fractured nose, deep cuts and severe facial swelling.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/04/senate-section/article/S7375-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             PREVENT ALL CIGARETTE TRAFFICKING ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Prevent All \nCigarette Trafficking Act, ``PACT Act'' of 2003. This legislation \naddressed the growing problem of cigarette smuggling, and the \nconnection between these activities and terrorist funding. According to \nthe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, 10 cigarette \nsmuggling cases were initiated in 1998. That has grown to approximately \n160 in 2002.\n  Cigarette smuggling can be defined as the movement of cigarettes from \nlow-tax areas to high-tax areas in order to avoid the payment of taxes \nwhen the cigarettes are resold. Smugglers buy cigarettes in low-tax \nStates such as North Carolina and Kentucky, and drive or ship the \nproduct to high-tax States and sell them on the street, to convenience \nstores, or to conspirators without paying the required State taxes. \nSome smugglers affix fraudulent State tax stamps to make it appear they \nhave paid the State taxes that are due. The profits for cigarettes \nsmuggling can be enormous. In North Carolina, a pack of cigarettes is \ntaxed 5 cents. In New York, the State tax is $1.50 and in New York \nCity, an additional $1.50 a pack city tax is levied.\n  It is clear that cigarette trafficking is becoming a method of \nterrorist financing. In an investigation last month, the AFT arrested \n17 individuals who are alleged to have smuggled more than $20 million \nworth of cigarettes. The ring allegedly purchased cigarettes in \nVirginia, where the state tax is 3 cents and resold them in California \nwithout paying the California tax, which is 87 cents. In another recent \ninvestigation, the AFT disrupted a cigarette smuggling scheme between \nNorth Carolina and Michigan participants allegedly smuggled at least $8 \nmillion worth of cigarettes and sent the proceeds to Hezbollah to \nsupport terrorist activities.\n  The Internet is contributing to the smuggling problem because many \nInternet cigarette retailers are not paying the required taxes when \nshipments are sent to buyers in various States. It is impossible to \nknow what happens to these ill-gotten gains. Currently, there are \nhundreds of tobacco retailers on the Internet claiming to sell tax-free \ncigarettes. Several openly proclaim on their websites that they do not \nreport internet tobacco sales to any State's tax administrator. This is \na flagrant violation of the law in every State. A recent Government \nAccounting Office report advised that States will lose approximately \n$1.5 billion in tax revenues by the year 2005 if the current state of \nInternet tobacco sales continues. More than ever, state governments \nneed these tax dollars.\n  Compounding the problem, counterfeit cigarettes, on which smugglers \nhave paid no taxes, are becoming more and more common. In 2001, the \nU.S. Customs Service made 24 seizures of counterfeit cigarettes. In \n2002, they made 255 seizures. Phillip Morris estimates that 100 billion \ncounterfeit cigarettes are produced in China alone.\n  The PACT Act will combat tobacco smuggling in a number of ways. \nFirst, in order to assist law enforcement and fight terrorism funding, \nthis legislation will make violations of the Jenkins Act a felony \nthereby encouraging more investigations and prosecutions. The Jenkins \nAct, 18 U.S.C. 375, requires any person who sells and ships cigarettes \nacross State lines to anyone other than a licensed distributor, to \nreport the sale to the buyer's State tobacco tax administrator, thus \nallowing State and local governments to collect the taxes that are \nlawfully due. The current penalty for violating the Jenkins Act is a \nmisdemeanor.\n  In my State of Wisconsin, in 2001, State authorities referred a \nJenkins Act violation to the U.S. Attorney who said that this was a \nmatter that should be handled administratively. However, Wisconsin and \nmost States do not have remedies for these violations and they have \nlittle recourse against vendors.\n  This legislation also amends the Jenkins Act by explicitly expanding \nthe definition of ``sales'' to include sales to a consumer via the \nmails, telephone, or the Internet. It will also require both sellers \nand shippers to submit the required reports, even when sales are to a \nlicensed distributor. Finally, the ``PACT Act'' will empower State \nAttorneys General, and persons holding a Federal permit to manufacture \nor import cigarettes, to bring civil actions in Federal court to \nrestrain violations of the Jenkins Act and to seek civil damages for \nthe losses they have incurred. This will allow State Attorneys General \nto stop violators of this Federal law from operating as well as recoup \ntheir tax losses.\n  The PACT Act also strengthens the Contraband Cigarette Trafficking \nAct (``CCTA''), 18 U.S.C. 2342, which makes it unlawful for any person \nto ship, transport, receive, possess, sell, distribute, or purchase \ncontraband cigarettes. Under the CCTA, contraband cigarettes is defined \nas 60,000 cigarettes or more which bear no tax stamp. This legislation \nwill lower the threshold from 60,000 to 10,000 in order for smuggled \ncigarettes to be considered ``contraband,'' thereby allowing ATF to \nopen more investigations and seek more Federal prosecutions of \ncigarette smugglers.\n  Finally, the PACT Act will grant ATF the ability to utilize funds \nearned during undercover operations to offset expenses that are \nincurred during those investigations. This will make the ATF's powers \nmore comparable to those of other investigative agencies such as that \nthe FBI and DEA, may use non-appropriated funds to make undercover \npurchases and pay other investigative expenses. ATF needs this \nauthority in part because of the huge costs associated with purchasing \ntens of thousands of cigarettes in undercover investigations.\n  Cigarette smuggling is increasing and must be addressed. Enhancing \nthe criminal laws to reduce cigarette smuggling will help deny \nterrorists a needed source of funding and help our States collect their \nrevenue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/04/senate-section/article/S7375-3", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7375-S7376]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n HONORING THE GIRL SCOUTS WHO HAVE RECEIVED THE SILVER AND GOLD AWARDS\n\n Mr. CHAFEE.

Mr. President, 2003 is the officially designated \nYear of the Blues. As we now look to music and the arts to guide us \nthrough trying times, it is an honor to pay tribute to an international \nmonument to music: Quincy Delight Jones, Jr. and his passion for music \neducation.\n  He is a veritable Renaissance Man, an orchestrator, arranger, \nconductor, composer, magazine publisher, executive, writer--and music, \nfilm and television producer. In his far-flung enterprises, he is the \nvery modern model of a major music mogul. It will take another artist \ndecades to approach his record 27 Grammy Awards and Kennedy Center \nHonors. And it can be said without exaggeration that the music of \nQuincy Jones is otherworldly: Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin chose the \nQuincy Jones-Frank Sinatra rendition of ``Fly Me to the Moon'' as the \nfirst song to be played on lunar soil.\n  Quincy Jones's own musical odyssey began earnest in Seattle, where \nhis family had moved to seek better job opportunities in the industrial \nboom of World War II America. Still trapped in poverty, Quincy and his \nbrother broke into a Seattle recreation hall in search of free meal, \nbut stumbled upon an upright piano. Merely riffing on the ivory keys \nsummoned pleasure in an instant. Playing the piano, he wrote later, \nenabled him to ``hope and cope.''\n  Early on Quincy Jones could straddle styles of music--and the egos of \nmusicians. In Seattle, as a student in integrated schools and a band \nmember with Ray Charles playing gigs at black and white venues, he \nlearned to gracefully balance the cusp between commerce and art. He is, \nas Duke Ellington would say, ``beyond category.''\n  Quincy, says arranger Bill Mathieu, is ``a culminator . . . his music \ncontains nearly everything of value that has been done before.'' He \nwas--and is--an innovator, able as Washington University Professor \nGerald Early wrote, to shape the world artistically, breaking down \nbarriers and moving across boundaries. ``Jones has become a virtual \nepoch in American popular cultural history, a person of such importance \nand achievement that is difficult to imagine the era without him.''\n  His greatest contribution to our times may be as a passionate \nproselytizer for music education in the classroom. Half a century ago, \nin his first forays abroad, Quincy made the startling discovery that \npeople around the globe knew and cherished American music--sometimes \nmore than American themselves did. So in his early twenties, even as he \nwas inventing new music, he made it his mission to teach and preserve \nthe legacy of our musical heritage.\n  Music consists of only 12 notes, yet in its infinite varieties it \nbeguiles, bewitches and beckons us. It can, as Leonard Bernstein \nobserved, name the unnamble and communicate the unknowable. Music not \nonly entertains and uplifts--it edifies and empowers. To know the \nhistory of American music is to grasp the history of America.\n  Duke Ellington divided the entire musical opus into two categories: \nGood and Bad. Thomas Jefferson, perhaps the most lyrical of the \nfounding fathers and himself a composer, believed not only in public \neducation, but that music and musical training was an essential \ncomponent of good citizenship.\n  President John F. Kennedy knew that arts were good for the nation, \ngood for the soul. ``The life of the arts far from being an \ninterruption, a distraction, in the life of a nation, is close to the \ncenter of a nation's purpose--and is a test of the quality of a \nnation's civilization.''\n  Widely lauded children's television programming such as Sesame Street \nand Mr. Roger's Neighborhood have long discovered that the lessons of \nlearning and of life are best realized when music is attached to them. \nAs the late, beloved Fred Rogers often claimed about his early piano \nplaying, ``By the time I was five-years-old, I could laugh or be very \nangry through the ends of my fingers.''\n  ``If you don't get kids in kindergarten'' cautions Fred Anton, the \nCEO of Warner Bros. Publications, ``you won't get them later in high \nschool. If you can reach children when they are young, music will stay \nwith them forever.'' To that end, Warner Bros. has spent four years \nbringing together pioneers in music, linguistics, the sciences and fine \narts and asked them to reinvigorate music education. Music education, \nfrom pre-K through high school, benefits everyone, says Anton, not just \nfuture virtuosos: ``You are going to develop critical thinking skills \nand better team players. And this won't be the dreary music programs of \n20 or 40 years ago. This is for today's kids.''\n  A classic musical piece such as ``Follow the Drinking Gourd'' \nincorporates the new thinking. Children learn that in the Civil War era \nslaves sang code songs to each other, passing along messages of where \nto escape and find safe houses. The Drinking Gourd was the North Star. \nBy teaching the kids the story--the ``Behind the Music'' vignette--it \nbrings them into the song, while at the same time teaches impart \nlessons in history, social studies, and even astronomy.\n  Whether a genius such as Quincy Jones or an enthusiastic student \nembracing early violin lessons, artists at all levels savor the \nundiluted joy of the musical mind. It is the flow experience, where \npassion and precision unite, and one loses track of time and space. In \na musical mode, dreamers dream and the impossible seems possible.\n  Music stirs our creative impulses--and it invariably contributes to \nour math, linguistic and science learning. The most ardent champion of \nmusic education today would indubitably be Albert Einstein. When asked \nabout the theory of relativity, he explained, ``It occurred to me by \nintuition, and music was the driving force behind that intuition. My \ndiscovery was the result of musical perception.''\n  Harvard University's Dr. Howard Gardner, whose landmark research in \nMind Intelligences was first published 20 years ago, asserts that all \nof us are gifted with music in the brain, an intelligence that when \ntapped--especially when we are young--generates bountiful lifetime \nrewards in all of our other academic and social endeavors.\n  We have empirical data linking music education to higher test scores, \nlower school dropout rates, higher cognitive skills and an increased \nability for students to analyze and evaluate information. A University \nof California School for Medicine San Francisco paper concluded that \nlearning to play an instrument ``refines the development of the brain \nand entire neuromuscular system.''\n  Other brain research contends that music and arts activities develop \nthe intellect, lead to higher test results in mathematics, science and \nhistory and strengthens synapses and spatial reasoning in all brain \nsystems.\n  Students exposed to music education are more disciplined, dexterous, \ncoordinated, creative and self-assured. They\n\n[[Page S7377]]\n\nlisten better, learn better, write better and speak better. Or as \nCharlie Parker would have succinctly put it, ``They get in the \ngroove.''\n  Yet despite the overwhelming scientific and anecdotal evidence \nshowcasting the benefits of music, music education programs throughout \nthe country are in peril. Some fine arts education budgets have been \ndrastically cut; others have been eliminated entirely. The consequences \nwill harm both our music industry and concert halls, but even more \nseriously our nation's youth.\n  As Dr. Jean Houston implored 15 years ago, long before the latest \nrounds in budget cuts, ``Children without access to an arts program are \nactually damaging their brain. They are not being exposed to non-verbal \nmodalities which help them learn skills like reading, writing and math \nmuch more easily.''\n  Which is why Quincy Jones, Warner Bros. Publications, and other \ntitans of the music world are joining the battle. The fight to initiate \nand restore arts and music education to our schools needs a volunteer \narmy of teachers, researchers, parents, elected officials, school \nboards and legislators in formation with the arts industries and \nartists themselves.\n  For the Year of the Blues, Seattle's Experience Music Project is \npartnering with the Blues Foundation in Memphis and PBS for a multi-\nmedia project that will include a television series, The Blues, \nexecutive produced by Martin Scorsese, a public radio series, a \ncomprehensive Web site and education program, a companion book, DVDS \nand boxed CD set, and a traveling interactive exhibit.\n  Today's advanced multimedia technology will seek to capture the \nspirit and times of the blues, an era when at myriad clubs jazz greats \nwould come in after working hours and fold into jam sessions. Guests, \nand the musicians themselves, were treated to wild flights of fantasy \nand improvisation. On any given night the likes of Sydney Bechet, Jack \nTeagarden, Louis and Lil Armstrong, and Bud Freeman would sit together \nand play the music they felt. It was the dawn of great female artists: \nDinah Washington, Billie Holliday and Bessie Smith.\n  Music in all its incarnations is one of the most eloquent and \nmemorable reflections of our loud and boisterous democracy. Jazz and \nthe blues represented the vibrant merger of African music, plantation \nsongs, ragtime and the plaintive yearnings of what was then known as \nhillbilly music. It follows that from jazz, the rivers of rock and \nroll, hip-hop and rap flowed.\n  The genuis of Quincy Jones is his ability to siphon off music from \nall eras and seemingly reinvent it. It is as if he were a scientist, \nextrapolating findings from all disciplines and effortlessly merging \nthem into brand new medical breakthroughs. The challenge for educators \nis to build upon existing layers of history, knowledge and research to \nstructure a new paradigm, deftly blending the elements to produce the \nfinest school system in the world.\n  Artists such as Quincy Jones have a gift for revering music's past, \nwhile keenly anticipating its future. For as Nadia Boulanger, possibly \nthe greatest music teacher of the 20th century said, ``A person's music \ncan be no more or less than they are as a human being.''\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Ann \nReiner from Portland, OR, a former member of the Oncology Nursing \nSociety's Board of Directors. Ann has been helping individuals with \ncancer and their families for 20 years. Currently, Ann is the Program \nDirector for Cancer Services and the Director of Outreach and Education \nfor the Cancer Institute at the Oregon Health and Science University, \nOHSU. Ann is also an Instructor at the School of Nursing at OHSU.\n  Since 1983, Ann has been a member of the Oncology Nursing Society and \nmost recently stepped down from serving on its Board of Directors. The \nOncology Nursing Society, the largest professional oncology group in \nthe United States composed of more than 30,000 nurses and other health \nprofessionals, exists to promote excellence in oncology nursing and the \nprovision of quality care to those individuals affected by cancer. As \npart of its mission, the Society honors and maintains nursing's \nhistorical and essential commitment to advocacy for the public good.\n  Ann Reiner has received numerous awards for her work on behalf of \nindividuals with cancer, including a Doctoral Degree in Cancer Nursing \nScholarship from the American Cancer Society and a Fellow at the \nOncology Nursing Society's Inaugural Leadership Development Institute. \nIn addition, Ann is a member of the Institutional Review Board at OSHU, \na member of the Breast and Cervical Cancer Program Medical Advisory \nCommittee with the Oregon Department of Health, and a member and \ncoordinator for the Portland area Citywide Annual Skin Cancer \nScreening.\n  A number of studies and articles that Ann has written on quality \ncancer care and the nursing shortage have been published in \ndistinguished publications such as the Cancer Prevention, Detection and \nControl: A Nursing Perspective, Puget Sound Chapter Oncology Nursing \nSociety Quarterly, Manual of Patient Care Standards, Blood, The Cancer \nExperience: Nursing Diagnosis and Management, Journal of Nursing \nQuality Assurance, and the Regional Oncology Nurses' Quarterly. Since \nthe 1980s, Ann has given over seventy presentations and has presented \nthirty papers to national audiences on a host of cancer care, health, \nand nursing shortage issues.\n  Over the last 10 years, the setting where treatment for cancer is \nprovided has changed dramatically. An estimated 80 percent of all \nAmericans receive cancer care in community settings, including cancer \ncenters, physicians' offices, and hospital outpatient departments. \nTreatment regimens are as complex, if not more so, than regimens given \nin the inpatient setting a few short years ago. Oncology nurses, like \nAnn, are on the front lines of the provision of quality cancer care for \nindividuals with cancer each and everyday. Nurses are involved in the \ncare of a cancer patient from the beginning through the end of \ntreatment. Oncology nurses are the front-line providers of care by \nadministering chemotherapy, managing patient therapies and side \neffects, working with insurance companies to ensure that patients \nreceive the appropriate treatment, and provide counseling to patients \nand family members, in addition to many other daily acts on behalf of \ncancer patients.\n  With an increasing number of people with cancer needing high quality \nhealth care coupled with an inadequate nursing workforce, our Nation \ncould quickly face a cancer care crises of serious proportion, limiting \naccess to quality cancer care, particularly in traditionally \nunderserved areas. Without an adequate supply of nurses there will not \nbe enough qualified oncology nurses to provide quality cancer care to a \ngrowing population of people in need. I was proud to support the \npassage of the Nurse Reinvestment Act in the 107th Congress. This \nimportant legislation expanded and implemented programs to address the \nmultiple problems contributing to the nationwide nursing shortage, \nincluding the decline in nursing student enrollments, shortage of \nfaculty, and dissatisfaction with nurse workplace environments.\n  I commend Ann Reiner and the Oncology Nursing Society for all of \ntheir hard work to prevent and reduce suffering from cancer and to \nimprove the lives of those 1.3 million Americans who will be diagnosed \nwith cancer in 2003. I wish Ann and the Oncology Nursing Society the \nbest of luck in all of their endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/04/senate-section/article/S7377-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7377-S7378]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n HONORING A MOMENT IN HISTORY: FIFTY YEARS SINCE MAN FIRST REACHED THE \n                           ROOF OF THE WORLD\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, May 29, 2003 marks a true milestone, a \ntriumph of the human spirit. On that day, 50 years earlier, two young \nmen--Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay--became the first to reach the \nhighest point on earth, the fabled summit of Mt. Everest.\n  At 29,028 feet above sea level, Everest had defied 15 earlier \nattempts, including the doomed expedition of George Mallory, in 1924.\n  Some have called Everest the Third Pole, after the North Pole, first \nreached in 1909, and the South Pole, reached in 1911.\n  Small wonder, then, that these two intrepid climbers--the lanky \nbeekeeper\n\n[[Page S7378]]\n\nfrom New Zealand and the sprightly Sherpa born in Tibet--became instant \ncelebrities back in 1953, and have since evolved into legendary \nfigures.\n  The son of a yak herder, Tenzing Norgay, who died in 1986, became the \nfirst humbly born Asian to rise to global fame entirely through his own \nefforts and sheer willpower. In many ways his story has a strong \nAmerican flavor to it--with enough determination and hard work, anyone \ncan achieve anything.\n  Norgay spoke 13 languages but could neither read nor write. He always \ntold his children: ``I climbed Everest so you wouldn't have to.'' His \nson, Norbu, now a resident of San Francisco, took these words to heart. \nCollege became his Everest.\n  Equally extraordinary is how Hillary and Norgay used their fame not \nfor personal gain, but as champions of their people and, later, to help \nand protect the unique culture of the Sherpas.\n  For nearly 25 years now, I have been honored to consider Sir Edmund \nHillary my friend. In September of 1981, he was with my husband when he \nfulfilled a dream: entering the beautiful Kanshung valley, in an \nattempt to climb the east face of Everest from Tibet.\n  In concert with the American Himalayan Foundation, Sir Edmund's \nHimalayan Trust, which was established in 1962, has been leading the \neffort to build schools, bridges, hospitals, and micro hydro plants, \nout of his deep and lasting affection for the Sherpa people.\n  To date, they have built 27 schools where once there were none. I am \nnot talking about just funding alone--Sir Edmund actually took part in \nthe actual construction of these and other buildings. Here is a man who \nputs the divots back. Just ask the Sherpa children who grew up tending \nyaks who are now doctors, pilots and investment bankers.\n  The Himalayan Trust has also built two hospitals, one in Khunde and \none in Paphlu, and 11 village clinics that provide health care for the \nSherpa communities and trekkers alike.\n  The Trust has worked to combat the deforestation of the Khumbu, \ncaused largely by tourism, by planting more than 1 million trees, to \nrestore the sacred monasteries at Tengbouche and Thame--central sites \nfor the spirituality of the Sherpas, and in the establishment, in 1976, \nof the Sagarmatha National Park. Sagarmatha is the Nepali name for \nMount Everest.\n  At 83 years old, New Zealand's former High Commissioner to India is \nstill going strong. For half a century now he has been one of the \nenduring figures of our time.\n  He has taught me and so many others about the simple yet majestic \npower of the Himalayas and the marvelous but far too often forgotten \npeople whose ancient culture is tied so closely to those amazing \nmountains.\n  Being the first to reach the top of the world would ensure anyone's \nname in the history books--and Hillary and Norgay achieved that the \nmoment news spread of their heroic accomplishment.\n  But I believe had they not been the men they were--soft spoken and \ndown to earth, devoted to actions and example, to helping others rather \nthan themselves--then they would have ended up as mere footnotes.\n  Instead, the names of Hillary and Norgay remain an inspiration to \npeople around the world. And I am absolutely certain that the same will \nbe true 50 years from now, when it comes time to celebrate the 100th \nanniversary, and for many other anniversaries to follow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/04/senate-section/article/S7378-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7378]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:20 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following joint resolution, in which it requests the \nconcurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.J.

     STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n  S. 1179. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nexpand Medicare benefits to prevent, delay, and minimize the \nprogression of chronic conditions, and develop national policies on \neffective chronic condition care, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to \nintroduce the Medicare Chronic Care Improvement Act of 2003. For the \nlast three decades, the Medicare program has fulfilled our promise to \ncare for older Americans who have spent a lifetime working and \ncontributing to our Nation's economy. Currently, 41 million seniors \ndepend on Medicare for critical health care assistance. Those seniors \nhave been asking Congress for many years to strengthen Medicare. This \nCongress, we must respond by taking action. We must enact legislation \nthis year that fills the gaps in Medicare.\n  When Congress and President Johnson designed the Medicare program in \n1965, they could not have foreseen the health care system that exists \ntoday. New technology, advances in research and an aging population \nhave changed both what beneficiaries need and the system that is \nresponding to those needs. One of the unforseen implications of these \nchanges is a growing number of Americans living with chronic \nconditions.\n  In 2000, over 45 percent of Americans had a chronic condition. That \nnumber continues to grow and, by 2020, more than 48 percent or 157 \nmillion Americans, will have at least one chronic condition. Chronic \nconditions encompass an array of health conditions that are persistent, \nrecurring, and cannot be cured. They include severely impairing \nconditions like Alzheimer's disease, congestive heart failure, chronic \nobstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, depression, hypertension, and \narthritis.\n  Treating serious and disabling chronic conditions is the highest cost \nand fastest growing segment of health care. People with chronic \nconditions represent 78 percent of all health care spending. These \npeople are the heaviest users of home health care visits, \nprescriptions, physician visits, and inpatient stays.\n  As we grow older, the chances of developing a chronic condition \nincrease. Thus, it should be no surprise that nearly 80 percent of \nMedicare beneficiaries have at least one chronic condition and two-\nthirds have two or more chronic conditions. However, the Medicare fee-\nfor-service program does not currently cover many of the services \nneeded to provide quality care to beneficiaries who are managing \ncomplex chronic conditions.\n  To meet the needs of these individuals, our Medicare fee-for-service \nsystem must reflect a person-centered, system-oriented approach to \ncare. Payers and providers who serve the same person must be empowered \nto work together to help people with chronic conditions prevent, delay, \nor minimize disease and disability progression and maximize their \nhealth and well being.\n  That is why I am here to reintroduce a much needed solution--the \nMedicare Chronic Care Improvement Act of 2003. This bill establishes a \ncomprehensive plan to improve and strengthen the Medicare fee-for-\nservice and Medicare+Choice systems by generating better health \noutcomes for beneficiaries with chronic conditions and increasing \nefficiency.\n\n  This bill would achieve these results by, first, helping to prevent, \ndelay, and minimize the progression of chronic conditions by \nauthorizing the Secretary of Health and Human Services to expand \ncoverage of preventive health benefits. The bill permits providers to \nwaive deductibles and co-payments for preventive and wellness services \ncurrently covered by Medicare and streamlines the process of approving \nnew preventive benefits.\n  Second, this bill provides a person-centered, system-oriented \napproach to care for this extremely vulnerable segment of our \npopulation by expanding Medicare coverage to include assessment, care-\ncoordination, self-management services, and patient and family \ncaregiver education and counseling.\n  For more detail, I am also entering a section-by-section bill summary \ninto the Congressional Record following this statement.\n  The Medicare Chronic Care Improvement Act provides a comprehensive \nsolution to improving the quality of life and health for millions of \nAmericans who are struggling with serious and disabling chronic \nconditions. Not only that, it has the potential to save the Medicare \nprogram money, by better managing and treating chronic conditions \nbefore costly complications result. That is good for seniors and good \nfor Medicare--a win-win situation.\n  It is time to step up to the plate and fulfill our obligation to our \nNation's most vulnerable citizens. Improving Medicare is the right \nthing to do, but only if we do it the right way. I believe that this \nbill is a critical component of the right recipe for strengthening the \nMedicare program for today and tomorrow's beneficiaries. Unlike the \nadministration's Medicare reform plan, the Medicare Chronic Care \nImprovement Act gives beneficiaries better care while maintaining \nconsumer choice and improving the program's efficiency. Because these \nare the results that West Virginians want, I will fight to include the \nprovisions of this bill in any Medicare reform package that moves \nthrough the Finance Committee or the Senate floor.\n  I would like the record to reflect that the following groups \npublically support this legislation: Alzheimer's Association; American \nGeriatrics Society; Center for Medicare Advocacy; Families USA; and \nMedicare Rights Center.\n  National Chronic Care Consortium, representing such organizations as: \nAging and Disability Services Administration, State of Washington \n(Olympia, WA); Aging in America, Inc (Bronx, NY); Albert Einstein \nHealthcare Network (Philadelphia, PA); Area Agency on Aging 10B Inc. \n(Akron, OH); Baylor Health Care System (Dallas, TX); Benjamin Rose \n(Cleveland, OH); Beth Abraham Family of Health Services (Bronx, NY); \nBlue Cross & Blue Shield of Minnesota (Eagan, MN); Carle Foundation \nHospital-Health Systems Research Center (Mahomet, IL); Catholic Health \nInitiatives (Parker, CO); Centura Health (Denver, CO); Community Health \nPartnership, Inc.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify \nto work opportunity credit and the welfare-to-work credit; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Baucus in \nthe introduction of the Encouraging Work Act of 2003. The Work \nOpportunity Tax Credit, WOTC, and Welfare-to-Work Tax Credit, W-t-W, \nare tax incentives that encouraging employers to hire public assistance \nrecipients and other individuals with barriers to employment. The \ncombination of Welfare Reform passed by Congress in 1996 and the \nassistance to employers found in the WOTC and W-t-W has enabled \nexpanded opportunity for many Americans. Yet more can be done.\n  Under present law, WOTC provides a 40 percent tax credit on the first \n$6,000 of wages for those working at least 400 hours, or a partial \ncredit of 25 percent for those working 120-399 hours. W-t-W provides a \n35 percent tax credit on the first $10,000 of wages for those working \n400 hours in the first year. In the second year, the W-t-W credit is 50 \npercent of the first $10,000 of wages earned. WOTC and W-t-W are key \nelements of welfare reform. A growing number of employers use these \nprograms in the retail, health care, hotel, financial services, food, \nand other industries. These programs have helped over 2,200,000 \npreviously dependent persons to find jobs.\n  Eligibility is limited to: 1. recipients of Temporary, Assistance to \nNeedy Families, TANF, in 9 of the 18 months ending on the hiring date; \n2. individuals receiving Supplemental Security Income, SSI, benefits; \n3. disabled individuals with vocational rehabilitation referrals; 4. \nveterans on food stamps; 5. individuals aged 18-24 in households \nreceiving food stamp benefits; 6. qualified summer youth employees: 7. \nlow-income ex-felons; and 8. individuals ages 18-24 living in \nempowerment zones or renewal communities. Eligibility for W-t-W is \nlimited to individuals receiving welfare benefits for 18 consecutive \nmonths ending on the hiring date. More than 80 percent of WOTC and W-t-\nW hires were previously dependent on public assistance programs. These \ncredits are both a hiring incentive, offsetting some of the higher \ncosts of recruiting, hiring, and retaining public assistance recipients \nand other low-skilled individuals, and a retention incentive, providing \na higher reward for those who stay longer on the job.\n  Without action by Congress WOTC and W-t-W will expire on December 31, \n2003. After seven years of experience with these programs, their value \nhas been well demonstrated. In 2001, the GAO issued a report that \nindicated that employers have significantly changed their hiring \npractices because of WOTC. With the resources provided by WOTC, \nemployers have provided job mentors, lengthened training periods, \nengaged in recruiting outreach, and listed jobs or requested referrals \nfrom public agencies or partnerships. WOTC and W-t-W have become a true \npublic-private partnership in which the Department of Labor, the \nInternal Revenue Service, the states, and employers have forged \nexcellent working relationships.\n  But the challenges for employers and those looking for better \nopportunities are real. The job skills of eligible persons leaving \nwelfare are sometimes limited, and the costs of recruiting, training, \nand supervising low-skilled individuals cause many employers to look \nelsewhere for employees. The weak economy and rising unemployment give \nemployers more hiring options. WOTC and W-t-W are proven incentives for \nencouraging employers to seek employees from the targeted groups.\n  Despite the considerable success of WOTC and W-t-W, many vulnerable \nindividuals still need a boost in finding employment. This is \nparticularly true during periods of high unemployment. There are \nseveral legislative changes that would strengthen these programs, \nexpand employment opportunities for needy individuals, and make the \nprograms more attractive to employers.\n  The Administration's FY 2004 budget proposes to simplify these \nimportant employment incentives by combining them into one credit and \nmaking the rules for computing the combined credits simpler. The \ncredits would be combined by creating a new welfare-to-work target \ngroup under WOTC. The minimum employment periods and\n\n[[Page S7388]]\n\ncredit rates for the first year of employment under the present work \nopportunity tax credit would apply to W-t-W employees. The maximum \namount of eligible wages would continue to be $10,000 for W-t-W \nemployees and $6,000 for other target groups ($3,000 for summer youth). \nIn addition, the second year 50-percent credit under W-t-W would \ncontinue to be available for W-t-W employees under the modified WOTC.\n  Under current law, only those ex-felons whose annual family income is \n70 percent or less than the Bureau of Labor Statistics lower living \nstandard during the six months preceding the hiring date are eligible \nfor WOTC. The Administration's FY 2004 budget proposes to eliminate the \nfamily income attribution rule.\n  Permanent extension would provide these programs with greater \nstability, thereby encouraging more employers to participate, make \ninvestments in expanding outreach to identify potential workers from \nthe targeted groups, and avoid the wasteful disruption of termination \nand renewal. A permanent extension would also encourage the state job \nservices to invest the resources needed to make the certification \nprocess more efficient and employer-friendly.\n  Current WOTC eligibility rules heavily favor the hiring of women \nbecause single mothers are much more likely to be on welfare or food \nstamps. Women constitute about 80 percent of those hired under the WOTC \nprogram, but men from welfare households face the same or even greater \nbarriers to finding work. Increasing the age ceiling in the ``food \nstamp category'' would greatly improve the job prospects for many \nabsentee fathers and other ``at risk'' males. This change would be \ncompletely consistent with program objectives because many food stamp \nhouseholds include adults who are not working, and more than 90 percent \nof those on food stamps live below the poverty line.\n  The Work Opportunity Credit and Welfare-to-Work Credit have been \nsuccessful in moving traditionally hard-to-employ persons off welfare \nand into the workforce, where they contribute to our economy. However, \nemployer participation in these important programs can be increased, \nparticularly among small and medium-sized employers. This is due to the \ncomplexity of the credits and the fact that they are both only \ntemporary provisions of the tax code subject to renewal every year or \ntwo. Small, medium, and even some large employers find it difficult to \njustify developing the necessary infrastructure to administer and \nparticipate in these programs when their continued existence beyond one \nor two years is constantly in question.\n  This legislation will remedy this problem by combining WOTC and W-t-W \ninto one, more easily administered tax credit, and by making it a \npermanent part of the tax code. Many organizations including the \nNational Council of Chain Restaurants, National Retail Federation, Food \nMarketing Institute, National Association of Convenience Stores, \nNational Restaurant Association, American Hotel & Lodging Association, \nNational Roofing Contractors Association, National Association of Chain \nDrug Stores, American Nursery and Landscape Association, and the \nAmerican Health Care Association support this legislation. \nRepresentatives Amo Houghton, R-NY, and Charles Rangel, D-NY, have \nintroduced identical legislation in the House of Representatives. I \nurge my colleagues to join us in supporting this legislation.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, Senator \nSantorum, and my other Senate colleagues in introducing legislation to \npermanently extend and improve upon the Work Opportunity and the \nWelfare-to-Work tax credits. During this year's debate on the Jobs and \nGrowth Tax Reconciliation Act, I voted to extend these tax credits were \nnot included in the final conference agreement, but I continue to \nstrongly support the passage of legislation this year to make these \ncredits permanent and make several reforms in the programs to improve \ntheir effectiveness.\n  Over the past seven years, the Work Opportunity Tax Credit, WOTC, and \nthe Welfare-to-Work, W-t-W, tax credit have helped over 2.2 million \npublic assistance dependent individuals enter the workforce. Both of \nthese important programs are scheduled to expire on December 31, 2003. \nThese hiring tax incentives have clearly demonstrated their \neffectiveness in helping to level the job selection playing field for \nlow-skilled individuals by providing employers with additional \nresources to help recruit, select, train and retain individuals with \nsignificant barriers to work. Many vulnerable individuals still need a \nboost in finding employment, and this is particularly critical during \nperiods of high unemployment. The weak economy and rising unemployment \ngive employers many more hiring options because of the larger pool of \nexperienced laid-off workers. Without an extension of these programs, \nthe task of transitioning from welfare-to-work will become even harder \nfor individuals reaching their welfare eligibility ceiling this year.\n  Because of the costs involved in setting up and administering a WOTC/\nW-t-W program, employers have established massive outreach programs to \nmaximize the number of eligible persons in their hiring pool. The \nStates, in turn, have steadily improved the programs through improved \nadministration. WOTC has become an example of a true public-private \npartnership design to assist the most needy. Without the additional \nresources provided by these hiring tax incentives, few employers would \nactively seek out this hard-to-employ population.\n  WOTC provides employers with a graduated tax credit equal to 25-\npercent of the first $6,000 in wages for eligible individuals working \nbetween 120 hours and 399 hours and a 40-percent tax credit on the \nfirst $6,000 in wages for those working over 400 hours. The W-t-W tax \ncredit is geared toward long term welfare recipients and provides a 35-\npercent tax credit on the first $10,000 in wages during the first year \nof employment and a 50-percent credit on the first $10,000 for those \nwho stay on the job a second year.\n  In my own State of Montana many businesses take advantage of this \nprogram, including large multinational firms and smaller family-owned \nbusinesses. Those who truly benefit from the WOTC/W-t-W program, \nhowever, are low-income families, under the Food Stamp Program and the \nAid to Families with Dependent Children, AFDC, and Temporary Assistance \nfor Needy Families, TANF, program, and also low income U.S. Veterans. \nIn Montana, more than 1,000 people were certified as eligible under the \nWOTC program during the past 18 months, October 2001 through March \n2003, including 476 Food Stamp recipients, 475 AFDC/TANF recipients, \nand 52 U.S. veterans.\n  The bill we are introducing provides for a permanent program \nextension of the two credits. After seven years of experience with WOTC \nand W-t-W, we know that employers do respond to these important hiring \ntax incentives. Permanent extension would provide these programs with \ngreater stability, thereby encouraging more employers to participate, \nmake investments in expanding outreach to identify potential workers \nfrom the targeted groups, and avoid the wasteful disruption of \ntermination and renewal. A permanent extension would also encourage the \nstate job services to invest the resources needed to make the \ncertification process more efficient and employer-friendly.\n  The bill also includes a proposal to simplify the programs by \ncombining them into one credit and making the rules for computing the \ncombined credits simpler. This would be accomplished by creating a new \nwelfare-to-work target group under WOTC. The minimum employment periods \nand credit rates for the first year of employment under present work \nopportunity tax credit would apply to W-t-W employees. THe maximum \namount of eligible wages would continue to be $10,000 for W-t-W \nemployees. In addition, the second year 50-percent credit under W-t-W \nwould continue to be available for W-t-W employees under the modified \nWOTC.\n  Finally, there are other changes in the bill that would extend these \nbenefits to more people and help them find work. Because of the \nprogram's eligibility criteria, over 80 percent of those hired are \nwomen leaving welfare. Since men generally are not eligible for TANF \nbenefits, the fathers of children on welfare receive little help in \nfinding work, even though they often face even greater barriers to work \nthan women\n\n[[Page S7389]]\n\non welfare. We propose to help absentee fathers find work and provide \nthe resources to assume their family responsibilities by opening up \nWOTC eligibility to anyone 39 years old or younger in families \nreceiving food stamps or residing in enterprise zones or empowerment \ncommunities. Raising the eligibility limits in these two categories \nwill extend eligibility to hundreds of thousands of at-risk men.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORZINE (for himself, Mr. Lautenberg, and Mr. Akaka):\n  S. 1181. A bill to promote youth financial education; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce along with \nSenators Lautenberg and Akaka the Youth Financial Literacy Act to call \nattention to an important issue in education: teaching students the \nbasic principles of financial literacy to prepare them to be \nresponsible consumers. This legislation will give young Americans the \ntools they need to succeed in this ever-changing economy.\n  Today, it is as important for young people to learn about staying out \nof debt, maintaining good credit and building up their savings as it is \nfor them to learn about geography, science and history.\n  Far too many of our youth enter adulthood lacking basic financial \nliteracy skills, not knowing how to budget their wages or salaries or \nbuild personal savings. A recent survey by the non-profit JumpStart \nCoalition reveals that the only 21 percent of students between the ages \nof 16 and 22 say they have taken a personal finance course at school. \nThe study also found that when high school seniors were tested on basic \nfinancial literacy, they answered a mere 50.2 percent of the questions \ncorrectly. That, is simply not acceptable.\n  Providing financial education to our nation's young people must be a \npriority. Indeed it is time for our schools to make a more concerted \neffort to prepare our children for success in new ways including their \nfuture financial decision-making.\n  I am not alone in advocating the importance of financial literacy. \nFederal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has said, ``Improving basic \nfinancial education at the elementary and secondary school levels is \nessential to providing a foundation for financial literacy that can \nhelp prevent younger people from making poor financial decisions.''\n  Today, I hope to elevate the discussion of this issue by introducing \nthe Youth Financial Education Act, which would provide $100 million in \ngrants to states to help them develop and implement financial education \nprograms in elementary and secondary schools, including helping to \nprepare teachers to provide financial education. It would also \nestablish a national clearinghouse for instructional materials and \ninformation regarding model financial education programs.\n  I am happy to report that in my state of New Jersey many have already \nstarted the ball rolling on financial literacy education. My State \nallows local schools the option of offering financial education in high \nschool, and the New Jersey Coalition for Financial Education is working \nwith the New Jersey Department of Education to develop and implement \ncore curriculum standards. I believe it is time for our Nation to \nfollow suit and begin to focus on the financial literacy education of \nall young Americans.\n  We must not sit idly by while so many of our children lack financial \nliteracy. So I ask for my colleagues to join me in support of the Youth \nFinancial Literacy Act, which will ensure that our next generation is \nprepared to meet the challenges of the new economy.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1181\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to sanction the ruling Burmese military junta, to \nstrengthen Burma's democratic forces and support and recognize the \nNational League of Democracy as the legitimate representative of the \nBurmese people, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, while democracy activists in Burma have \nbeen murdered, intimidated and harassed for well over a decade, the \nblitzkrieg on freedom launched last weekend by the illegitimate State \nPeace and Development Council--SPDC--killed and injured scores of \nsupporters from the National League for Democracy--NLD.\n  Democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi and numerous other activists were \nbrutalized, arrested and today remain held incommunicado. Reports \nindicate that Suu Kyi is being held in the Yemon military camp, 40 \nkilometers outside of Rangoon. It is believed she suffers from \nlacerations to her face and a broken shoulder. The administration \nshould waste no time in gaining access to Suu Kyi to ensure her safety \nand security.\n  I have come to the floor every day this week to draw attention to the \nuntenable situation in that country. On Monday, I urged the \nadministration to act promptly and decisively in support of democracy \nin Burma. The State Department can take specific action without the \nneed for legislation--such as broadening visa restrictions, freezing \nassets, and downgrading Burma's diplomatic status in Washington.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Kentucky for his advocacy for, \nnot only one of the world's great, courageous figures, but also on \nbehalf of democracy and freedom in a small country far away.\n  Is the Senator from Kentucky aware of any action, or even any \nstatements being made by our friends in Asia, including ASEAN, and how \ndoes he feel about that?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I would say to my friend from Arizona, there will be a \nregional ASEAN meeting in Phnom Penh on June 18 and 19. Secretary \nPowell is scheduled to be there. I hope that will be an opportunity to \nhear from the\n\n[[Page S7391]]\n\nother Asian, ASEAN countries, that maybe, for once, they will \nunderstand what a pariah regime that is and work with us in a \ncoordinated fashion to impose sanctions that will actually mean \nsomething in bringing down the regime.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator will yield for one further question, has \nthe Senator heard about a statement of the Japanese Foreign Minister \nthat basically is saying that everything was pretty well--the status \nquo was pretty well satisfactory in Burma? And before I ask the Senator \nto answer the question, I want to say again, I thank him for his \nadvocacy of many years, for the democratic movement in Burma, sometimes \nknown as Myanmar. I thank him and look forward to working with him.\n  I think the Congress can act, and I hope we can work in concert with \nthe administration.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my friend from Arizona. I understand the \nJapanese may be reconsidering their statement of yesterday. There could \nwell be a subsequent statement today that might be more pleasing to the \nSenator from Arizona and myself.\n  I thank him for being an extraordinary leader on this issue, as well, \nand for agreeing to cosponsor the bill I am about to introduce.\n  I also might mention, I had an opportunity to talk with the Deputy \nSecretary of State and Deputy Secretary of Defense today to encourage \nthem to take a very great interest and recommend the President take a \nvery great interest in this issue. The only way, obviously, we are \ngoing to have an impact in Burma is for the United States to use the \nkind of leadership only it can provide to rally the world around a \nsanctions regime and tighten the noose around this regime and hopefully \nthis will be the beginning of that effort.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The White House should utilize all authority at its \ndisposal to immediately sanction the junta, including banning imports \nfrom Burma and raising the brutal crackdown on democracy before the \nU.N. Security Council.\n  On Tuesday, I appealed to the international community to stand by the \npeople of Burma during their dark hour of need, and called upon the \nworld's democracies to act in support of Suu Kyi and her courageous \nsupporters. Elected representatives cannot stand by idly while \ndemocracy in Burma is strangled by the SPDC.\n  Today, along with my colleagues Senators Feinstein, McCain, Leahy, \nSpecter, Kennedy, Mikulski, Kyl, Daschle, and Santorum, I am \nintroducing the ``Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003''. This act \nrecognizes that what is needed in Burma is fewer carrots and more \nsticks.\n  Among other restrictions that I will describe shortly, the act \nimposes an import ban on articles produced, mined, manufactured, grown, \nor assembled in Burma. It prohibits the import of goods to the United \nStates produced by the SPDC, companies in which the junta has a \nfinancial interest, and the SPDC's political arm, the Union Solidarity \nDevelopment Association--USDA.\n  Lest my colleagues forget, the USDA, under the direction of the \njunta, orchestrated the recent terror in the townships that left scores \ndead and Suu Kyi injured. They are Burma's fedayeen.\n  There are some who discount economic sanctions as a tool to coerce \nand modify the behavior of repressive nations. According to their \nargument, sanctions hurt the very people they are intended to help.\n  Sanctions in Burma will not rape ethnic girls and women, burn down \ntheir villages and murder their brothers, husbands, and sons.\n  Sanctions in Burma will not impress children into the military, drug \nthem, and send them off to dangerous battlefields.\n  Sanctions in Burma will not use slave labor, nor will they profit \nfrom an illicit narcotics trade that wreaks havoc among the region's \nyouth and contributes to an exploding HIV/AIDS rate along Burma's \nborders.\n  Finally, sanctions in Burma will not attack peaceful supporters of \nthe NLD or democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi, nor will they ever take a \nsingle life by an act of violence.\n\n  The SPDC is guilty of committing the laundry list of heinous crimes \nthat I just described. Every single one of them is an assault on the \nhuman rights and dignity of the Burmese people. Burma's junta is as \nchronic an abuser of human rights as Kim Jong-Il in North Korea--and as \nwas the Taliban in Afghanistan and Saddam Hussein in Iraq.\n  The fact of the matter is that the import ban will impact a \nnegligible percentage of Burma's population. It will deny Burma the \nability to import some $350 million to $470 million worth of goods to \nthe United States--most of which are garments and textiles--thus \ndenying the SPDC legitimate revenue.\n  Unfortunately, the people of Burma reap almost no benefits from this \nincome. The SPDC is more interested in spending revenue on itself than \nin investing in the welfare of the people of Burma.\n  With over one-quarter of Burma's imports currently destined for the \nUnited States, the ban will hit the SPDC where it hurts most--in the \npocketbook and its public image.\n  South African Bishop Desmond Tutu, who knows a thing or two about \nsanctions and repression, said of Burma earlier this week:\n\n       We urge freedom loving governments everywhere to impose \n     sanctions on this illegitimate regime. They worked for us in \n     South Africa. If applied conscientiously, they will work in \n     Burma too. Freeze the assets of the regime and impose \n     stringent travel restrictions on them and their supporters. \n     We need a regime change [in Burma].\n\n  I supported sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa \nthen, and I support sanctions against the military junta in Burma now.\n  Sanctions will empower Burma's democrats who have already \ndemonstrated their support for freedom by overwhelmingly electing the \nNLD in the 1990 elections. These polls were never recognized by the \nSPDC. Instead, the junta has spent the past decade trying to suffocate \nthe aspirations for democracy by all of Burma's people and imprisoning \ntheir leader, Suu Kyi.\n  In addition to the import ban, the act also freezes the assets of the \nSPDC in the United States and requires the U.S. to oppose and vote \nagainst loans or other assistance proposed for Burma by international \nfinancial institutions.\n  It expands the visa ban to former and present SPDC leadership and the \nUnion Solidarity Development Association and requires coordination with \nthe European Union's visa ban list. Let me be clear that the SPDC \nleadership includes all officer-level individuals associated with the \nregime.\n  Finally, the act requires the Secretary of State to promote greater \nawareness of the abuses of the SPDC, requires the State Department to \nmore proactively promote awareness of U.S. policy toward Burma, and \nencourages greater support for Burmese democracy activists.\n  Let me close with a few words and observations about Daw Aung San Suu \nKyi. Over the years, the daughter of the father of Burma's independence \nhas stood squarely between the people of Burma and the thuggish regime. \nAgainst great odds and often in great danger, Suu Kyi has consistently \nand successfully stared down SPDC generals and their military might. \nShe has never wavered--not once--in her support for democracy and the \nrule of law for Burma.\n  Our thoughts and prayers continue to be with Suu Kyi and the people \nshe so ably represents. She is obviously the greatest hope for that \ncountry.\n  I ask my colleagues: If America does not stand with Suu Kyi and the \nNLD now, whither freedom and justice in Burma? Without us, it has no \nchance.\n  Pressure, patience and persistence will bring political change to \nBurma. Suu Kyi knows this in her heart and mind, as we all do. America \nmust lead. And if we do, others will rally.\n  I thank my friend from New Mexico. I yield the floor and ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished majority \nwhip for his eloquent statement today and compliment him on his \npersistence with reference to the cause of freedom and democracy in \nBurma.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, for 6 days, Aung San Suu Kyi--the \ncourageous voice of democracy and freedom in Burma--has been in jail. \nHer crime?\n\n[[Page S7392]]\n\nSupport for reform and democracy in one of the world's most isolated \nand repressive countries.\n  One of the world's great democrats is currently being held by a \nmilitary junta disingenuously named State Peace and Development \nCouncil. Late last week, the Junta announced that it had Suu Kyi in \n``protective custody.'' The truth, of course, is that she was beaten \nwith a bamboo pole and detained in an ambush that killed four of her \nsupporters. Several observers noted that her arrest is the latest in a \nvicious and coordinated attack which has claimed 70 of her supporters.\n  This is evidence of the junta's deplorable disregard for \ninternational standards of decency and for the people it rules. It also \ntells us what we can expect from the junta. A year ago, after Suu Kyi \nwas released from her 15 year long detention, there was a glimmer of \nhope for reform and democracy in Burma. Rather than re-engaging the \nworld, however, the junta holds fast to its failed policies of the \npast.\n  The Special Envoy from the United Nations is scheduled to travel to \nBurma this weekend as part of a larger effort to promote democracy. Yet \nwith its actions this past week, the SPDC confirms what we had all \nfeared--and what Suu Kyi warned: the military junta in power in Burma \ncannot and will not take the necessary steps to bring about democracy \nand freedom. I hope the UN Envoy will make clear his disappointment, \nindeed the world's disappointment, with these latest developments.\n  Given the gravity of this situation in Burma, I am pleased to join \nwith Senators Feinstein and McConnell, among others, in introducing \nlegislation that underscores the depth of our concern and the strength \nof our resolve in ensuring democracy in Burma. The bill would ban \nimports from Burma, freeze SPDC assets in this country, tighten the \nvisa ban on Burmese officials, and urge specific diplomatic steps to \nraise the importance of this issue with our friends in the \ninternational community.\n  In the National Security Strategy, President Bush proclaimed that \n``our first imperative is to clarify what we stand for: the United \nStates must defend liberty and justice because these principles are \nright and true for all people everywhere. No nation owns these \naspirations, and no nation is exempt from them . . . We will champion \nthe cause of human dignity and oppose those who resist it.'' The SPDC \nis doing everything it can to rob the Burmese people of liberty, of \njustice, and of human dignity. It is time for the Senate to make clear \njust where the United States stands in the face of this injustice.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise along with my distinguished \ncolleague from Kentucky, Senator McConnell, to introduce the Burmese \nFreedom and Democracy Act of 2003, which would establish a complete \nimport ban on all products from Burma.\n  On May 30, Aung San Suu Kyi and at least 17 officials of the National \nLeague for Democracy, NLD, were detained after a clash in the town of \nYe-u, after reportedly being attacked by members of the Union \nSolidarity Development Association, a paramilitary organization created \nby the ruling military junta, the State Peace and Development Council, \nSPDC.\n  Four people were killed and 50 injured in the attacks. Aung San Suu \nKyi has been officially placed in ``protective custody'', but her \nwhereabouts remain unconfirmed.\n  Still more disturbing are reports in today's Washington Post that Suu \nKyi may have suffered a head wound and a broken arm in the attacks and \nis possibly being held at a military hospital near Rangoon. The \nmilitary junta continues to insist that she is in good health and in a \n``safe place'', yet they are unwilling to allow independent \nverification of Suu Kyi's condition.\n  One year ago the military junta freed Suu Kyi following 19 months of \nhouse arrest, while promising cooperation and dialogue toward political \naccommodation. Had I discussed Burma on the floor of the Senate back \nthen, I would have sounded a note of cautious optimism, echoing Aung \nSan Suu Kyi's own statement that ``it's a new dawn for the country''.\n  But as the events of May 30 have so tragically illustrated, the SPDC \nhave broken every promise to work towards political dialogue and, in \nfact, have launched a new campaign of repression.\n  Given the military regime's utter contempt for the welfare and safety \nof its people and the repeated and ongoing human rights abuses against \nAung San Suu Kyi and the members of the NLD, I now feel we have no \nchoice but to strengthen the sanctions imposed in 1997.\n  The actions of the SPDC are simply outrageous and I join the State \nDepartment, the United Nations and the many voices from around the \nworld in demanding that Suu Kyi and the others be released immediately, \nand to allow the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in Burma to \nconduct an independent investigation into the attack on Aung San Suu \nKyi and her party.\n  Not content to stop with arresting the leadership of the NLD, the \nregime has tightened its crackdown on the pro-democracy movement, \nclosing universities and shutting down at least six NLD offices. In \naddition, two NLD leaders have been arrested on charges of \n``subversion''.\n\n  Let us recall, the NLD overwhelmingly won Burma's national elections \nin 1990. The NLD are Burma's rightful leaders, not the military junta \nwhich seized power in 1988, crushing a widespread popular uprising.\n  Such actions are only the tip of the iceberg of the regime's \nbrutality. According to the Council on Foreign Relations Task Force \nreport on Burma, which both the Senator from Kentucky, and I had the \nhonor of serving on, gross human rights violations continue under the \nSPDC: over 1,300 political prisoners are still in jail; the practice of \nrape as a form of repression has been sanctioned by the Burmese \nmilitary; the use of forced labor is widespread; trafficking in young \nboys and girls as sex slaves is rampant; the government engages in the \nproduction and distribution of opium and methamphetamine.\n  In addition, the report notes that because of SPDC mismanagement, the \nBurmese economy is in shambles, with poor rice harvests and, most \nrecently, a February 2003 financial crisis sparked by government \nclosure of private deposit companies.\n  In the face of such brutality it is imperative that the United States \ntake strong and decisive action to express our disapproval of the SPDC \nand its tactics, and our support of those forces working for peace in \nBurma.\n  The United States must act. Although in general I do not support the \nuse of trade embargoes as an effective instrument of foreign policy, in \ncertain circumstances and when faced with certain conditions I believe \nthey are necessary and proper and can, in fact, provide effective \nleverage.\n  Burma, I believe, is such a case and an import ban is a proper and \nmuch needed step to take.\n  Our legislation: imposes a complete ban on all imports from Burma \nuntil the President determines and certifies to Congress that Burma has \nmade substantial and measurable progress on a number of democracy and \nhuman rights issues; allows the President to waive the import ban \nshould he determine and notify Congress that it is in the national \nsecurity interests of the United States to do so; allows the President \nto waive any provision of the bill found to be in violation of any \ninternational obligations of the U.S. pursuant to World Trade \nOrganization dispute settlement procedures; freezes the assets of the \nBurmese regime in the United States; directs United States executive \ndirectors at international financial institutions to vote against loans \nto the Burma; expands the visa ban against the past and present \nleadership of the military junta; encourages the Secretary of State to \nhighlight the abysmal record of the SPDC in the international \ncommunity, and; authorizes the President to use all available resources \nto assist democracy activists in Burma.\n\n  Both business and labor are united in support of a ban. The American \nApparel and Footwear Association, which represents apparel, footwear, \nand sewn products companies and their suppliers, has called for a ban.\n  President and CEO Kevin M. Burke stated, ``The government of Burma \ncontinues to abuse its citizens through force and intimidation, and \nrefuses to respect the basic human rights of its\n\n[[Page S7393]]\n\npeople. AAFA believes this unacceptable behavior should be met with \ncondemnation from not only the international public community, but from \nprivate industry as well.''\n  A number of stores, including Saks, Macy's, Bloomingdales, Ames, and \nThe Gap have already voluntarily stopped importing or selling goods \nfrom Burma. The AFL-CIO and other labor groups also support a ban.\n  In addition, the international Labor Organization, for the first time \nin its history, called on all ILO members to impose sanctions on Burma.\n  Such diversity in support of this legislation speaks volumes about \nthe brutality of the SPDC regime and its single-minded unwillingness to \ntake even a modest step towards democracy and national reconciliation.\n  Currently, Burma exports approximately $400 million in goods per year \nto the United States. These exports are the regime's major source of \nforeign currency. Rest assured, the regime will take notice if this \nbill becomes law.\n  As events of the past few days have shown, all other avenues have \nbeen tried and failed. There is no other resource but to introduce this \nlegislation, that would put pressure on the military junta to cease its \nviolations of human rights and respect the free will of the Burmese \npeople as expressed in the 1990 elections.\n  We must make a stand on the side of the people of Burma. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1182\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Burmese Freedom and \n     Democracy Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) has \n     failed to transfer power to the National League for Democracy \n     (NLD) whose parliamentarians won an overwhelming victory in \n     the 1990 elections in Burma.\n       (2) The SPDC has failed to enter into meaningful, political \n     dialogue with the NLD and ethnic minorities and has dismissed \n     the efforts of United Nations Special Envoy Razali bin Ismail \n     to further such dialogue.\n       (3) According to the State Department's ``Report to the \n     Congress Regarding Conditions in Burma and U.S. Policy Toward \n     Burma'' dated March 28, 2003, the SPDC has become ``more \n     confrontational'' in its exchanges with the NLD.\n       (4) On May 30, 2003, the SPDC, threatened by continued \n     support for the NLD throughout Burma, brutally attacked NLD \n     supporters, killed and injured scores of civilians, and \n     arrested democracy advocate Aung San Suu Kyi and other \n     activists.\n       (5) The SPDC continues egregious human rights violations \n     against Burmese citizens, uses rape as a weapon of \n     intimidation and torture against women, and forcibly \n     conscripts child-soldiers for the use in fighting indigenous \n     ethnic groups.\n       (6) The SPDC has demonstrably failed to cooperate with the \n     United States in stopping the flood of heroin and \n     methamphetamines being grown, refined, manufactured, and \n     transported in areas under the control of the SPDC serving to \n     flood the region and much of the world with these illicit \n     drugs.\n       (7) The SPDC provides safety, security, and engages in \n     business dealings with narcotics traffickers under indictment \n     by United States authorities, and other producers and \n     traffickers of narcotics.\n       (8) The International Labor Organization (ILO), for the \n     first time in its 82-year history, adopted in 2000, a \n     resolution recommending that governments, employers, and \n     workers organizations take appropriate measures to ensure \n     that their relations with the SPDC do not abet the \n     government-sponsored system of forced, compulsory, or slave \n     labor in Burma, and that other international bodies \n     reconsider any cooperation they may be engaged in with Burma \n     and, if appropriate, cease as soon as possible any activity \n     that could abet the practice of forced, compulsory, or slave \n     labor.\n       (9) The SPDC has integrated the Burmese military and its \n     surrogates into all facets of the economy effectively \n     destroying any free enterprise system.\n       (10) Investment in Burmese companies and purchases from \n     them serve to provide the SPDC with currency that is used to \n     finance its instruments of terror and repression against the \n     Burmese people.\n       (11) On April 15, 2003, the American Apparel and Footwear \n     Association expressed its ``strong support for a full and \n     immediate ban on U.S. textiles, apparel and footwear imports \n     from Burma'' and called upon the United States Government to \n     ``impose an outright ban on U.S. imports'' of these items \n     until Burma demonstrates respect for basic human and labor \n     rights of its citizens.\n       (12) The policy of the United States, as articulated by the \n     President on April 24, 2003, is to officially recognize the \n     NLD as the legitimate representative of the Burmese people as \n     determined by the 1990 election.\n\n     SEC. 3. BAN AGAINST TRADE THAT SUPPORTS THE MILITARY REGIME \n                   OF BURMA.\n\n       (a) General Ban.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, until such time as the President determines and \n     certifies to Congress that Burma has met the conditions \n     described in paragraph (3), no article may be imported into \n     the United States that is produced, mined, manufactured, \n     grown, or assembled in Burma.\n       (2) Ban on imports from certain companies.--The import \n     restrictions contained in paragraph (1) shall apply to, among \n     other entities--\n       (A) the SPDC, any ministry of the SPDC, a member of the \n     SPDC or an immediate family member of such member;\n       (B) known narcotics traffickers from Burma or an immediate \n     family member of such narcotics trafficker;\n       (C) the Union of Myanmar Economics Holdings Incorporated \n     (UMEHI) or any company in which the UMEHI has a fiduciary \n     interest;\n       (D) the Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC) or any company \n     in which the MEC has a fiduciary interest;\n       (E) the Union Solidarity and Development Association \n     (USDA); and\n       (F) any successor entity for the SPDC, UMEHI, MEC, or USDA.\n       (3) Conditions described.--The conditions described in this \n     paragraph are the following:\n       (A) The SPDC has made substantial and measurable progress \n     to end violations of internationally recognized human rights \n     including rape, and the Secretary of State, after \n     consultation with the ILO Secretary General and relevant \n     nongovernmental organizations, reports to the appropriate \n     congressional committees that the SPDC no longer \n     systematically violates workers rights, including the use of \n     forced and child labor, and conscription of child-soldiers.\n       (B) The SPDC has made measurable and substantial progress \n     toward implementing a democratic government including--\n       (i) releasing all political prisoners;\n       (ii) allowing freedom of speech and the press;\n       (iii) allowing freedom of association;\n       (iv) permitting the peaceful exercise of religion; and\n       (v) bringing to a conclusion an agreement between the SPDC \n     and the democratic forces led by the NLD and Burma's ethnic \n     nationalities on the transfer of power to a civilian \n     government accountable to the Burmese people through \n     democratic elections under the rule of law.\n       (C) Pursuant to the terms of section 706 of the Foreign \n     Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003 (Public Law \n     107-228), Burma has not failed demonstrably to make \n     substantial efforts to adhere to its obligations under \n     international counternarcotics agreements and to take other \n     effective counternarcotics measures, including the arrest and \n     extradition of all individuals under indictment in the United \n     States for narcotics trafficking, and concrete and measurable \n     actions to stem the flow of illicit drug money into Burma's \n     banking system and economic enterprises and to stop the \n     manufacture and export of methamphetamines.\n       (4) Appropriate congressional committees.--In this \n     subsection, the term ``appropriate congressional committees'' \n     means the Committees on Foreign Relations and Appropriations \n     of the Senate and the Committees on International Relations \n     and Appropriations of the House of Representatives.\n       (b) Waiver Authorities.--\n       (1) In general.--The President may waive the prohibitions \n     described in this section for any or all products imported \n     from Burma to the United States if the President determines \n     and notifies the Committees on Appropriations and Foreign \n     Relations of the Senate and the Committees on Appropriations \n     and International Relations of the House of Representatives \n     that to do so is in the national security interest of the \n     United States.\n       (2) International obligations.--The President may waive any \n     provision of this Act found to be in violation of any \n     international obligations of the United States pursuant to \n     any final ruling relating to Burma under the dispute \n     settlement procedures of the World Trade Organization.\n       (c) Duration of Trade Ban.--The President may terminate the \n     restrictions contained in this Act upon the request of a \n     democratically elected government in Burma, provided that all \n     the conditions in subsection (a)(3) have been met.\n\n     SEC. 4. FREEZING ASSETS OF THE BURMESE REGIME IN THE UNITED \n                   STATES.\n\n       Not later than 60 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Secretary of the Treasury shall direct, and \n     promulgate regulations to the same, that any United States \n     financial institution holding funds belonging to the SPDC or \n     the assets of those individuals who hold senior positions in \n     the SPDC or its political arm, the Union Solidarity \n     Development Association, shall promptly report those assets \n     to the Office of Foreign Assets Control. The Secretary of the \n     Treasury may take such action as may be necessary to secure \n     such assets or funds.\n\n[[Page S7394]]\n\n     SEC. 5. LOANS AT INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.\n\n       The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United \n     States executive director to each appropriate international \n     financial institution in which the United States \n     participates, to oppose, and vote against the extension by \n     such institution of any loan or financial or technical \n     assistance to Burma until such time as the conditions \n     described in section 3(a)(3) are met.\n\n     SEC. 6. EXPANSION OF VISA BAN.\n\n       (a) In General.--\n       (1) Visa ban.--The President is authorized to deny visas \n     and entry to the former and present leadership of the SPDC or \n     the Union Solidarity Development Association.\n       (2) Updates.--The Secretary of State shall coordinate on a \n     biannual basis with representatives of the European Union to \n     ensure that an individual who is banned from obtaining a visa \n     by the European Union for the reasons described in paragraph \n     (1) is also banned from receiving a visa from the United \n     States.\n       (b) Publication.--The Secretary of State shall post on the \n     Department of State's website the names of individuals whose \n     entry into the United States is banned under subsection (a).\n\n     SEC. 7. CONDEMNATION OF THE REGIME AND DISSEMINATION OF \n                   INFORMATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Congress encourages the Secretary of State \n     to highlight the abysmal record of the SPDC to the \n     international community and use all appropriate fora, \n     including the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Regional \n     Forum and Asian Nations Regional Forum, to encourage other \n     states to restrict financial resources to the SPDC and \n     Burmese companies while offering political recognition and \n     support to Burma's democratic movement including the National \n     League for Democracy and Burma's ethnic groups.\n       (b) United States Embassy.--The United States embassy in \n     Rangoon shall take all steps necessary to provide access of \n     information and United States policy decisions to media \n     organs not under the control of the ruling military regime.\n\n     SEC. 8. SUPPORT DEMOCRACY ACTIVISTS IN BURMA.\n\n       (a) In General.--The President is authorized to use all \n     available resources to assist Burmese democracy activists \n     dedicated to nonviolent opposition to the regime in their \n     efforts to promote freedom, democracy, and human rights in \n     Burma, including a listing of constraints on such \n     programming.\n       (b) Reports.--\n       (1) First report.--Not later than 3 months after the date \n     of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall \n     provide the Committees on Appropriations and Foreign \n     Relations of the Senate and the Committees on Appropriations \n     and International Relations of the House of Representatives a \n     comprehensive report on its short- and long-term programs and \n     activities to support democracy activists in Burma, including \n     a list of constraints on such programming.\n       (2) Report on resources.--Not later than 6 months after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall \n     provide the Committees on Appropriations and Foreign \n     Relations of the Senate and the Committees on Appropriations \n     and International Relations of the House of Representatives a \n     report identifying resources that will be necessary for the \n     reconstruction of Burma, after the SPDC is removed from \n     power, including--\n       (A) the formation of democratic institutions;\n       (B) establishing the rule of law;\n       (C) establishing freedom of the press;\n       (D) providing for the successful reintegration of military \n     officers and personnel into Burmese society; and\n       (E) providing health, educational, and economic \n     development.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KYL (for himself and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 1183. A bill to develop and deploy technologies to defeat Internet \njamming and censorship, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nForeign Relations.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the ``Global \nInternet Freedom Act of 2003'' be printed in today's Congressional \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1183\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Global Internet Freedom Act \n     of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of \n     association are fundamental characteristics of a free \n     society. The first amendment to the Constitution of the \n     United States guarantees that ``Congress shall make no law . \n     . . abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the \n     right of the people peaceably to assemble.''. These \n     constitutional provisions guarantee the rights of Americans \n     to communicate and associate with one another without \n     restriction, including unfettered communication and \n     association via the Internet. Article 19 of the United \n     Nation's Universal Declaration of Human Rights explicitly \n     guarantees the freedom to ``receive and impart information \n     and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers''.\n       (2) All people have the right to communicate freely with \n     others, and to have unrestricted access to news and \n     information, on the Internet.\n       (3) With nearly 10 percent of the world's population now \n     online, and more gaining access each day, the Internet stands \n     to become the most powerful engine for democratization and \n     the free exchange of ideas ever invented.\n       (4) Unrestricted access to news and information on the \n     Internet is a check on repressive rule by authoritarian \n     regimes around the world.\n       (5) The governments of Burma, Cuba, Laos, North Korea, the \n     People's Republic of China, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Vietnam, \n     among others, are taking active measures to keep their \n     citizens from freely accessing the Internet and obtaining \n     international political, religious, and economic news and \n     information.\n       (6) Intergovernmental, nongovernmental, and media \n     organizations have reported the widespread and increasing \n     pattern by authoritarian governments to block, jam, and \n     monitor Internet access and content using methods that \n     include--\n       (A) firewalls, filters, and ``black boxes'';\n       (B) surveillance of e-mail messages and message boards;\n       (C) the use of particular words to identify content to be \n     monitored;\n       (D) ``stealth blocking'' individuals from visiting \n     websites;\n       (E) the development of ``black lists'' of users that visit \n     certain websites; and\n       (F) the denial of access to the Internet.\n       (7) The transmission of the Voice of America and Radio Free \n     Asia, as well as hundreds of news sources with an Internet \n     presence, are routinely being jammed by repressive \n     governments.\n       (8) Since the 1940s, the United States has deployed anti-\n     jamming technologies to make Voice of America and other \n     United States Government sponsored broadcasting available to \n     people in nations with governments that seek to block news \n     and information.\n       (9) The United States Government has thus far commenced \n     only modest steps to fund and deploy technologies to defeat \n     Internet censorship. As of January 2003, the Voice of America \n     and Radio Free Asia have committed a total of $1,000,000 for \n     technology to counter Internet jamming by the People's \n     Republic of China. This technology, which has been successful \n     in attracting 100,000 electronic hits per day from the \n     People's Republic of China, has been relied upon by Voice of \n     America and Radio Free Asia to ensure access to their \n     programming by citizens of the People's Republic of China, \n     but United States Government financial support for the \n     technology has lapsed. In most other countries there is no \n     meaningful United States support for Internet freedom.\n       (10) The success of United States policy in support of \n     freedom of speech, press, and association requires new \n     initiatives to defeat totalitarian and authoritarian controls \n     on news and information over the Internet.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to adopt an effective and robust global Internet \n     freedom policy;\n       (2) to establish an office within the International \n     Broadcasting Bureau with the sole mission of countering \n     Internet jamming and blocking by repressive regimes;\n       (3) to expedite the development and deployment of \n     technology to protect Internet freedom around the world;\n       (4) to authorize the commitment of a substantial portion of \n     United States international broadcasting resources to the \n     continued development and implementation of technologies to \n     counter the jamming of the Internet;\n       (5) to utilize the expertise of the private sector in the \n     development and implementation of such technologies, so that \n     the many current technologies used commercially for securing \n     business transactions and providing virtual meeting space can \n     be used to promote democracy and freedom; and\n       (6) to bring to bear the pressure of the free world on \n     repressive governments guilty of Internet censorship and the \n     intimidation and persecution of their citizens who use the \n     Internet.\n\n     SEC. 4. DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT OF TECHNOLOGIES TO DEFEAT \n                   INTERNET JAMMING AND CENSORSHIP.\n\n       (a) Establishment of Office of Global Internet Freedom.--\n     There is established in the International Broadcasting Bureau \n     the Office of Global Internet Freedom (hereinafter in this \n     section referred to as the ``Office''). The Office shall be \n     headed by a Director who shall develop and implement a \n     comprehensive global strategy to combat state-sponsored and \n     state-directed jamming of the Internet and persecution of \n     those who use the Internet.\n       (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated to the Office $30,000,000 for each of the \n     fiscal years 2004 and 2005.\n       (c) Cooperation of Other Federal Departments and \n     Agencies.--The head of each department and agency of the \n     United States Government shall cooperate fully with, and \n     assist in the implementation of, the strategy developed by \n     the Director of the Office and\n\n[[Page S7395]]\n\n     shall make such resources and information available to the \n     Director as is necessary for the achievement of the purposes \n     of this Act.\n       (d) Report to Congress.--\n       (1) In general.--On March 1 following the date of enactment \n     of this Act, and annually thereafter, the Director of the \n     Office shall submit to Congress a report on the status of \n     state interference with Internet use and of efforts by the \n     United States to counter such interference.\n       (2) Content.--Each report required by paragraph (1) shall--\n       (A) list the countries that pursue policies of Internet \n     censorship, blocking, and other abuses;\n       (B) provide information concerning the government agencies \n     or quasi-governmental organizations that implement Internet \n     censorship; and\n       (C) describe with the greatest particularity practicable \n     the technological means by which such blocking and other \n     abuses are accomplished.\n       (3) Forms of report.--In the discretion of the Director, a \n     report required by paragraph (1) may be submitted in both a \n     classified and a nonclassified form.\n       (e) Limitation on Authority.--Nothing in this Act shall be \n     interpreted to authorize any action by the United States to \n     interfere with foreign national censorship in furtherance of \n     legitimate law enforcement aims that is consistent with the \n     United Nation's Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n\n     SEC. 5. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n        It is the sense of Congress that the United States \n     should--\n       (1) publicly, prominently, and consistently denounce \n     governments that restrict, censor, ban, and block access to \n     information on the Internet;\n       (2) direct the United States Representative to the United \n     Nations to submit a resolution at the first annual meeting of \n     the United Nations Human Rights Commission after the date of \n     enactment of this Act that condemns all governments that \n     practice Internet censorship and deny individuals the freedom \n     to access and share information; and\n       (3) deploy, at the earliest practicable date, technologies \n     aimed at defeating state-directed Internet censorship and the \n     persecution of those who use the Internet.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH (for himself, Mrs Clinton, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \n        Fitzgerald, and Mr. Lautenberg):\n  S. 1184. A bill to establish a National Foundation for the Study of \nHolocaust Assets; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Holocaust \nVictims' Assets, Restitution Policy, and Remembrance Act of 2003. In \nthis effort, I am joined by my colleagues: Senator Clinton from New \nYork, Senator Murray from Washington, Senator, Lautenberg, from New \nJersey and Senator Dodd from Connecticut. I appreciate their support \nfor this important legislation.\n  We are motivated by a desire to achieve justice for Holocaust victims \nand their families, and we recognize that if such justice is to be \nattained, the United States must continue to lead the world by example.\n  The United States has provided leadership in this area ever since \nAmerican troops liberated the death camps in Nazi Germany. This \nlegislation recognizes that the struggle for justice requires continued \nAmerican leadership and that the Foundation is the appropriate \nmechanism for that leadership.\n  The purpose of this act is to create a public/private Foundation \ndedicated to supporting research and education in the area of \nHolocaust-era assets and restitution policy and promoting innovative \nsolutions to restitution issues.\n  The need for the Foundation arises from the findings of the \nPresidential advisory Commission on Holocaust Assets in the United \nStates. I was proud to serve as commissioner on that Commission. The \nCommission identified several policy initiatives that require U.S. \nleadership, including: creating mechanisms to assist claimants in \nobtaining resolution of claims; supporting databases of victims' claims \nfor the restitution of personal property; reviewing the degree to which \nother nations have adhered to agreements reached at international \nconferences on Holocaust issues; synthesizing the work of other \nnational commissions throughout the world; supporting further research \nand review of Holocaust-era assets; and disseminating information about \nrestitution programs to survivors and their families.\n  If the nations of the world are to be convinced of our lasting \ncommitment to justice for Holocaust victims and if continued work on \nHolocaust assets issues is to be truly effective, the Foundation must \nhave the stamp of the Federal Government. But the Federal Government \ncannot, and should not, perform these tasks by itself. It will \ncoordinate the efforts of the Federal Government, State governments, \nthe private sector and individuals here, and abroad, to help people \nlocate and identify assets who would otherwise have no ability to do \nso. It will encourage policy makers to deal with contemporary \nrestitution issues, including how best to treat unclaimed assets.\n  Each passing day reveals the existence of still unclaimed assets. \nThis bill will create an institution able to provide the academic \ncenter of research into this area of continuing importance. It will \nalso show that the United States is willing to ask of itself no less \nthan it asks of the international community.\n  The restitution of property is part of a larger process of obtaining \na measure of justice for the victims of Europe's major human disasters \nof the 20th century--fascism and communism. Justice for these \nindividuals is long overdue.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Holocaust Victims' Assets, \n     Restitution Policy, and Remembrance Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States should continue to lead the \n     international effort to identify, protect, and return looted \n     assets taken by the Nazis and their collaborators from \n     victims of the Holocaust.\n       (2) The citizens of the United States should understand \n     exactly how the United States Government dealt with the \n     assets looted from victims of the Nazis that came into its \n     possession.\n       (3) The United States forces in Europe made extraordinary \n     efforts to locate and restitute assets taken by the Nazis and \n     their collaborators from victims of the Holocaust.\n       (4) However, the restitution policy formulated by the \n     United States and implemented in the countries in Europe \n     occupied by the United States had many inadequacies and fell \n     short of realizing the goal of returning stolen property to \n     the victims.\n       (5) As a result of these United States policies and their \n     implementation, there remain today many survivors or heirs of \n     survivors who have not had restored to them that which the \n     Nazis looted.\n       (6) The Presidential Advisory Commission on Holocaust \n     Assets in the United States, established in Public Law 105-\n     186, found the following:\n       (A) Despite the undertaking by United States agencies to \n     preserve, protect, and return looted assets, United States \n     restitution policy could never fully address the unimaginable \n     dimension and complexity of restituting assets to victims of \n     the Holocaust. Many inadequacies reveal that United States \n     authorities were driven by necessity, and practical concerns \n     of restitution commingled with conflicting interests, \n     priorities, and political considerations. Restitution \n     competed with, and was often subordinated to, the desire to \n     bring American troops home, the need to rebuild devastated \n     European economies, and provide humanitarian assistance to \n     millions of displaced persons, and the Cold War.\n       (B) With respect to many types of assets, the United States \n     followed international legal tradition and undertook only to \n     restore property to national governments, which it assumed \n     would be responsible for satisfying the claims of their \n     citizens. Because this practice excluded those who no longer \n     had a nation to represent their interests, or who had fallen \n     victim to the Nazi genocide, the United States also \n     designated certain ``successor organizations'' to sell \n     heirless and unclaimed property and apply the proceeds to the \n     care, resettlement, and rehabilitation of surviving victims. \n     This practice led many assets to be too hastily labeled as \n     heirless or unidentifiable, with the result that they were \n     assigned to the successor organizations, rather than returned \n     to their rightful owners.\n       (C) Far more regrettable is the United States failure to \n     adequately assist victims, heirs, and successor organizations \n     to identify victims' assets, instead relying upon them to \n     present their own claims, often within unrealistically short \n     deadlines, with the result that much victim property was \n     never recovered.\n       (D) Even when property was returned to individual owners or \n     their heirs, it was often only after protracted, cumbersome, \n     and expensive administrative proceedings that yielded \n     settlements far less than the full value of the assets \n     concerned.\n       (E) While the overall record of the United States is one in \n     which its citizens can legitimately take pride, even the most \n     farsighted\n\n[[Page S7396]]\n\n     and best-intentioned policies intended to restitute stolen \n     property to its country of origin failed to realize the goal \n     of returning property to the victims who suffered the loss.\n       (F) In many instances, policy and circumstance combined and \n     led to results that can be improved upon now, to provide a \n     modicum of justice to Holocaust victims and their heirs and \n     in memory of those who did not survive.\n       (7) The United States Government should promote both the \n     review of Holocaust-era assets in Federal, State, and private \n     institutions, and the return of such assets to victims or \n     their heirs.\n       (8) The best way to achieve this is to create a single \n     institution to serve as a centralized repository for research \n     and information about Holocaust-era assets.\n       (9) Enhancing these policies will also assist victims of \n     future armed conflicts around the world.\n       (10) The Government of the United States has worked to \n     address the consequences of the National Socialist era with \n     other governments and nongovernmental organizations, \n     including the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against \n     Germany, which has worked since 1951 with the Government of \n     the United States and with other governments to accomplish \n     material restitution of the looted assets of Holocaust \n     victims, wherever those assets were identified, and has \n     played a major role in allocating restitution funds and funds \n     contributed by the United States and other donor countries to \n     the Nazi Persecutee Relief Fund.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to introduce \nthe ``Rural Provider Equity Act of 2003'' with Senator Harkin and other \nmembers of the Senate Rural Health Caucus. This legislation \ncomprehensively addresses the Medicare payment issues of rural \nphysicians, rural health clinics, ambulance providers, home health \nagencies, community health centers, mental health providers and other \ncritical mid-level clinicians.\n  The current Medicare program has many payment formula disparities \nthat are biased against rural providers, which result in them being \npaid significantly less than their urban counterparts for the same \nservices. The geographic inequities that exist within the Medicare \nprogram continually put rural providers at a disadvantage and adversely \naffect seniors; access to a quality health care in these communities.\n  Many physicians are being forced to limit the number of Medicare \npatients they serve because of poor reimbursement rates. The ``Rural \nProviders Equity Act'' is necessary to adequately pay physicians to \nthey can continue caring for the elderly. In addition to establishing a \nwork geographic index of 1.0, physicians practicing in federally \ndesignated Health Professional Shortage Areas will automatically start \nreceiving the Medicare ten percent bonus payment to which they are \nentitled.\n  In recognition of the difficulties rural and frontier communities \nface in recruiting and retaining primary care clinicians; this \nlegislation includes a provision providing tax exemptions to National \nHealth Service Corps, NHSC, loan-repayments. The NHSC provides \nscholarships, loan-repayments, and stipends for clinicians who agree to \nserve in nationally designated underserved urban and rural communities. \nIn the current NHSC loan program, recipients are given money to offset \ntheir tax liabilities. If this money was made available, more \nclinicians would be able to participate in the program and care for the \nunderserved.\n  Home health care agencies and ambulance services are critical \nelements of the continuum of care in rural areas. These providers face \nunique circumstances in the distances they are required to travel to \nprovide services. The current Medicare payment system does not make \nadequate adjustments to reflect the reality of rural and frontier \nhealth care. The ``Rural Provider Equity Act of 2003'' recognizes the \nsituation of these providers by increasing their Medicare payments to \nbetter cover their costs of providing services to seniors.\n  By caring for folks in underserved areas, rural health clinics and \ncommunity health centers are a key component of the rural health care \ndelivery system. As not every small town can sustain a hospital, we \nneed to ensure these types of facilities are paid adequately and are \nprovided enough flexibility to meet the health care needs of the \ncommunities they serve.\n  The ``Rural Providers Equity Act of 2003'' also permits mental health \ncounselors and marriage and family therapists to bill Medicare for \nservices provided to seniors. This will result in an increased choice \nof mental health providers for seniors and enhance their ability to \naccess mental health services where they live.\n  Rural seniors are often forced to travel long distances to utilize \nthe services of mental health providers currently recognized by the \nMedicare program. Rural communities have difficulty recruiting and \nretaining providers, especially mental health providers. In many small \ntowns, a mental health counselor or a marriage and family therapist is \nthe only mental health care provider in the area. Medicare law--as it \nexists today--compounds the situation because only psychiatrists, \nclinical psychologists, clinical social workers and clinical nurse \nspecialists are able to bill Medicare for their services.\n  Virtually all of Wyoming is designated a mental health professional \nshortage area and will greatly benefit from this legislation. Wyoming \nhas 174 psychologists, 37 psychiatrists and 263 clinical social workers \nfor a total of 474 Medicare eligible mental health providers. Enactment \nof this provision will more than double the number of mental health \nproviders available to seniors in my state with the addition of 528 \nmental health counselors and 61 marriage and family therapists \ncurrently licensed in the state.\n  Health care in rural America is at a critical juncture, and Congress \nmust act now so providers receive this down payment towards Medicare \nequity to ensure rural seniors continue to have access to the health \ncare services they deserve. I urge all my colleagues interested in \nrural health to cosponsor the ``Rural Provider Equity Act of 2003.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1185\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1187\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION. 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``At-Risk Consumer Protection \n     Through Food Safety Labeling Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) consumption of food contaminated with microbial \n     pathogens such as bacteria, parasites, viruses, and their \n     toxins causes an estimated 76,000,000 illnesses, 325,000 \n     hospitalizations, and 5,000 deaths each year in the United \n     States;\n       (2) Government economists estimate that illnesses from \n     Campylobacter, Salmonella, E. coli O157:H7, E. coli non-\n     O157:H7 STEC, Listeria, and Toxoplasma gondii cause \n     $6,900,000,000 in medical costs, lost productivity, and \n     premature death in the United States each year;\n       (3) in particular, Listeria monocytogenes is the cause of \n     2,500 illnesses and 500 deaths annually, with economic costs \n     of $2,300,000,000;\n       (4) people that face relatively higher risks from foodborne \n     illness and associated complications include the very young, \n     the very old, pregnant women, and the immunocompromised, such \n     as persons with AIDS and cancer;\n       (5) outbreaks of foodborne illness are becoming \n     increasingly widespread in both geographic area and duration, \n     making detection and containment difficult;\n       (6) in 1998, following a major listeriosis outbreak from \n     deli meats, many ready-to-eat meat and poultry processors \n     established Listeria testing programs, but others have no \n     Listeria testing and control program at all, giving them an \n     unfair advantage in production costs over firms that are \n     taking steps to protect public health;\n       (7)(A) in 1989, the Secretary of Agriculture established a \n     performance standard allowing zero tolerance for Listeria \n     monocytogenes that prohibits detectable levels of the \n     pathogen in ready-to-eat meat and poultry products; and\n       (B) a performance standard for Listeria monocytogenes of \n     nondetectable levels in ready-to-eat meat products--\n       (i) is appropriate to protect at-risk consumers (including \n     pregnant women) (referred to in this section as ``at-risk \n     consumers'') from severe health consequences or death from \n     exposure to Listeria monocytogenes; and\n       (ii) is necessary to provide an adequate safety margin for \n     at-risk consumers;\n       (8) in February 2001, the Secretary of Agriculture proposed \n     regulations establishing performance standards for the \n     production of processed meat and poultry products, including \n     requirements for controlling Listeria monocytogenes, but, in \n     the time since the public comment period closed in September \n     2001, little progress has been made in finalizing the \n     regulation;\n       (9) in 2002, an outbreak of foodborne listeriosis linked to \n     ready-to-eat turkey deli meat in Pennsylvania, New York, New \n     Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Connecticut, and Michigan--\n       (A) sickened 53 persons;\n       (B) killed 8 persons; and\n       (C) caused at least 3 pregnant women to suffer miscarriages \n     or stillbirths;\n       (10) in a March 21, 2003, speech to the North American Meat \n     Processors, Food Safety and Inspection Service Administrator \n     Dr. Gary McKee said the agency's December 2002 directive \n     outlining Listeria testing procedures for agency inspectors \n     is only an interim measure;\n       (11) to ensure the safety of at-risk consumers, ready-to-\n     eat meat and poultry products not produced under a \n     scientifically validated program to address Listeria \n     monocytogenes should be required to bear a label advising at-\n     risk consumers of the Government's recommendations not to \n     consume ready-to-eat meat and poultry products without \n     heating the products until steaming hot; and\n       (12) all data generated through scientifically validated \n     programs to address Listeria monocytogenes should be shared \n     with the Department of Agriculture and used to improve \n     scientific research regarding the safety of ready-to-eat \n     foods.\n\n     SEC. 3.

which was referred to the Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation:\n\n                              S. Res. 159\n\n       Whereas the Federal Communications Commission moved with \n     unreasonable haste in considering the issue of media \n     concentration and did not previously disclose the proposed \n     ownership rule the Commission implemented in its June 2, \n     2003, ruling on media ownership rules;\n       Whereas the Commission did not provide an opportunity for \n     the public to review, debate, and comment on the proposed \n     changes prior to the ruling;\n       Whereas it would have been appropriate for the Commission \n     to include such public review, debate, and comment on the \n     specific provisions of its proposal prior to issuing a ruling \n     with such broad implications;\n       Whereas there is no indication that the Commission has \n     adequately addressed the impact of the proposed ownership \n     rule changes on industry market share and consumer prices;\n       Whereas greater media concentration could threaten the \n     diversity of and extent of local content in broadcast \n     programming and news, and has the potential to inhibit or \n     remove local control over such programming;\n       Whereas, despite the rapid growth of vital Spanish-language \n     media outlets in the past several years, there is no \n     indication that the Commission considered treating Spanish-\n     language media separately for purposes of its broadcast media \n     ownership restrictions, thereby failing to extend to Spanish \n     speakers the same protections afforded members of the \n     English-speaking broadcast community; and\n       Whereas it is in the public interest to maintain local \n     control and promote diversity in television programming, \n     which the previous ownership rules had been designed to \n     ensure: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the June \n     2, 2003, ruling of the Federal Communications Commission \n     weakening the Nation's media ownership rules is not in the \n     public interest and should be rescinded.\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, lying on the desk before us is a resolution \nrelating to the Federal Communications Commission's June 2, 2003, \nruling weakening the Nation's media ownership rules. I say very \nemphatically that those rules are not in the public interest and should \nbe rescinded. I have laid that on the desk for my colleagues. I \nencourage all Members to get a copy of that and read it. I respectfully \nrequest that if anyone wants to be a cosponsor, I would love to have \nthem cosponsor that today.\n  As we all know, 2 days ago, the Federal Communications Commission by \na vote of 3 to 2 rolled back longstanding rules governing media \nownership. This ruling eases the ban on cross-ownership of newspapers, \ntelevision stations, and radio stations, and allows media corporations \nto own more outlets locally and nationwide.\n  The new rules have the potential of placing significant control over \nwhat the public sees and hears and reads in the hands of a small number \nof media conglomerates. Ultimately, having a few entities control a \nvast percentage of the American media market will stifle the diversity \nof ideas, viewpoints, and opinions.\n  It reminds me a little bit of Henry Ford who at one point told his \ncustomers that could order any color they wanted as long as it was \nblack. I feel the same way--that we may be getting to that point with \nregard to our media; that we can see and read and hear anything we want \nas long as it comes through them.\n  The diversity of viewpoints is critical to our democracy. It is one \nof the foundations of American society and the American system of \ngovernment. One thing we believe very strongly in America is the \nmarketplace of ideas--a free and open and robust marketplace of ideas \nwhere people can exchange ideas and concepts freely and openly and not \nhave that go through a national corporate conglomeration.\n  I am very confident that this proposed rule change sets the stage for \nhomegeniztion--not diversification but homogenization. That is not a \ngood thing for this country. It is not a good thing for our system.\n  Supporters of the FCC ruling say that the large media mergers do not \nstifle diversity. What they say is you can turn on cable right now and \nyou get dozens--maybe hundreds--of channels in some systems, or you can \nturn on a radio station. But let me say this. Is it really diversity \nwhen the ideologies, the principles, and the viewpoints are being \npresented through the myopic lens of a singular, cookie-cutter point of \nview? I am concerned that is where we are getting to today with this \nruling that will rush us headlong into this calamity.\n  I think if the majority of Americans look at this issue they would \nunderstand that it does; that this ruling does not promote diversity \nbut, in fact, limits it.\n  There is a broad array of special interest groups, of consumer \nadvocates, of civil rights and religious groups, small business, \nwhatever--a broad array of interests--that are opposed. They are \nopposed to this ruling for very sound reasons. That is why I rise today \nto offer this resolution.\n  I also wish to take this moment to publicly support the efforts of \nSenator Ted Stevens and Senator Fritz Hollings because they are taking \nthe lead in trying to codify the 35-percent ownership cap. I am not \nonly supportive of their legislation but I am also a cosponsor.\n  This resolution is in no way competition to that but, in my view, \nthis resolution is a logical extension of their efforts. It is \nunfortunate that we have to come here today to consider resolutions and \nlegislation on this issue. The frustrations and the hostility out there \nin the public domain about this ruling and about corporate ownership of \nmedia outlets has been exacerbated by the FCC's inability to \ncommunicate to the public in rational terms and explain why this \nproposal is a good idea.\n  In spite of 2 years of study, we need more time to study this. So \nfar, the advocates of this position have made a very unconvincing case.\n  One thing we need to understand in this country is that there is a \nfundamental difference in owning and operating a newspaper and in \nowning and operating regular television stations. Anyone today, if they \nchose to, could start a newspaper. All you really need in today's world \nis the ability to do some desk-top publishing and get out there and \nhave a way to distribute your publication. But to have a radio station \nor a television station requires a license from the Government. That \nlicense is a sacred trust. It is a trust that they are going to have \nbroadcasts in the community interest. They are going to have the \nprogramming that the community wants. They are going to play a vital \nrole in our system when it comes to news and information and getting \ninformation out to the public which is important for them to have.\n  One example of the FCC's shortcoming on this issue is the fact that \nthe FCC has made no case for examining the Spanish language media as a \nseparate market. I think everybody in this room understands it is a \nseparate market. But because they have not seen it as a separate \nmarket, they look at mergers and acquisitions and their analysis is \nskewed in favor of the merger and the acquisition.\n  Thank you, Mr. President and other Members of the Senate, for the \nindulgence and this time.\n  I would like to remind everyone that this is out here for everyone to \nlook at. I would very much appreciate as many cosponsors as we could \nhave. I think it is important that the Senate send a very clear message \non this topic.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/04/senate-section/article/S7403-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7403-S7404]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 48--SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF \n ``NATIONAL EPILEPSY AWARENESS MONTH'' AND URGING FUNDING FOR EPILEPSY \n                     RESEARCH AND SERVICE PROGRAMS\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN (for herself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Craig, Ms. Landrieu, Ms. \nCantwell, and Mr. DeWine) submitted the following concurrent \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n[[Page S7404]]\n\n                            S.

Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to submit a \nSenate Concurrent Resolution designating the week of June 9, 2003 as \nNational Oceans Week.\n  As a Nation with more than 95,000 miles of coastline, the United \nStates is highly dependent on the resources and services of the oceans \nthat affect many important aspects of our lives, often in ways we do \nnot fully realize. As Chair of the Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on \nOceans, Fisheries, and Coast Guard, I believe it is important for us to \nrecognize the many benefits that the oceans provide, and I am happy \nthat 19 other Senators are joining me in sponsoring this Senate \nConcurrent Resolution that formally recognizes the ocean's many \nbenefits.\n  Our oceans are capable of significant biological productivity that \nproduces food, which provides nourishment for citizens across the globe \nand sustains fishery dependent communities. Oceans regulate global \nclimate and the cycling of oxygen, carbon, and water in our atmosphere, \nand oceans provide a vital means of transporting goods between \ncountries and thereby support the global economy. In addition to these \nbiological, physical, and economic benefits, the oceans remain a \nlargely unexplored domain that can enrich our lives in countless other \nways. For all these reasons and more, I believe it is important to \nrecognize the many ways we rely upon the oceans.\n  The capacity of the oceans to supply these resources and services, \nhowever, is finite. Much of our nation's attention is currently focused \non several recent reports that point to the destructive nature of \nforeign overfishing, the negative impacts of harmful algal blooms and \noil spills, and the coastal habitat loss associated with uncoordinated \ndevelopment activities. Collectively, these and other human impacts can \nsignificantly affect how oceans function. We need to be constantly \nlooking for ways to minimize these impacts and help sustain the oceans' \nproductive capacity, which in turn will provide us with the resources \nthat enhance the quality of our lives.\n  Given the extent to which the United States depends on and uses the \noceans, it is incumbent upon us to take a leadership role in ocean \nscience and conservation. We must recognize this responsibility and \ncontinue to seek ways to promote comprehensive stewardship and \nunderstanding of the ocean and the resources it contains. For this and \nother reasons, I co-sponsored Senator Hollings' legislation \nestablishing the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy in 2000, and I look \nforward to reviewing its recommendations later this year.\n\n[[Page S7405]]\n\n  The Resolution we are submitting today urges the President to issue a \nproclamation calling upon the people of the United States to observe \nthe week of June 9, 2003, with appropriate recognition, programs, and \nactivities to further ocean literacy, education, and exploration. \nDuring this week on Capitol Hill, I am pleased to be an Honorary Co-\nhost of Capitol Hill Oceans Week, a series of events and discussions \ndesigned to facilitate awareness of the oceans within the Congress. As \na country, we should use this week to further expand our awareness of \nthe oceans and engage in discussions and activities that will help \nocean resource conservation.\n  I would like to thank my fellow Senators who are joining me in this \neffort to establish National Oceans Week, and I hope that this week \nwill help contribute to a better awareness of and appreciation for the \noceans. It is through such efforts that ocean stewardship can expand \nand take hold as an important national ethic.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor this \nresolution with Senators Snowe, Hollings, and McCain. In 1998 we \nrecognized the International Year of the Oceans, and it is time we \nunderscore the importance of oceans in our daily lives through an \nannual celebration of National Oceans Week. The global oceans need our \nattention now more than ever. Today, we are faced with the challenge of \nsustainably managing our interactions with the marine environment, in \nthe face of increasing pressures from population growth and a global \neconomy. While we have been making significant progress in this arena, \nthere are constant reminders that we have not yet achieved our goal of \nsupporting ocean-related industries while maintaining high ecological \nstandards.\n  The recent oil spill of the Bouchard barge in Buzzard's Bay, MA, \nvividly demonstrates that we must be ever vigilant in striving for the \nbalance between ecological protection and economic growth--as well as \nthe need to balance competing economic interests--in this case, an \nimportant local seafood industry with our need for energy. Although we \nhave seen a marked improvement in the safe marine transport of oil \nsince the passage of the Oil Pollution Act in 1990, all possible care \nmust be taken to ensure that we have a system in place that adequately \nprotects our marine environment.\n  Marine fisheries are also a vitally important component of our \ncoastal economies and culture, especially in the Bay State. We are \nmaking progress in restoring our overfished stocks to sustainable \nlevels, and we are committed to staying the course to reduce mortality, \nimprove water quality and restore habitat. But we must press forward to \nensure all nations are pulling their weight in providing sustainable \nfisheries management. Recent reports show international fleets have had \na dramatic impact that appears to go largely unchecked. Living marine \nresources, particularly highly migratory species like tuna and \nswordfish, know no boundaries, and we cannot tolerate lawlessness by \nany nation in the management of these stocks.\n  The Marine Mammal Protection Act has proved to be a very successful \nconservation tool, bringing numerous species back from the brink of \nextinction. However, there is still much more to be done. I am \nparticularly familiar with the example of the North Atlantic right \nwhales, one of the most endangered species of marine mammals in the \nworld, with a population of approximately 300 individuals. \nUnfortunately, our local New England waters are often the areas where \nthese endangered whales literally collide with the fishing industry and \nthe marine transportation industry. The plight of the right whales \nhighlights the importance of working with a wide variety of interests \nto find solutions that will make a difference.\n  Congress has already asked a panel of experts to develop a plan of \naction for our oceans in the Oceans Act of 2000. This federal mandated \nU.S. Commission on Ocean Policy will help us understand what steps are \nneeded to advance our knowledge and improve our management of the \nmarine environment. Later this year, the Commission will make \nrecommendations on how we can improve our ocean governance, investment \nand implementation, research, education and marine operations, and \nstewardship. Despite these great efforts, there is much more to do. \nIncreased public attention to our Nation's ocean issues is essential if \nwe are to make further headway. This is why, today, I am honored to \njoin Senator Snowe in introducing this resolution to declare the week \nof June 9, 2003, as National Oceans Week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/04/senate-section/article/S7405-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7405]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED & PROPOSED\n\n       SA 847.

RESTRICTIONS ON THE USE OF MTBE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) since 1979, methyl tertiary butyl ether (referred to in \n     this section as ``MTBE'') has been used nationwide at low \n     levels in gasoline to replace lead as an octane booster or \n     anti-knocking agent;\n       (2) Public Law 101-549 (commonly known as the ``Clean Air \n     Act Amendments of 1990'') (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) \n     established a fuel oxygenate standard under which \n     reformulated gasoline must contain at least 2 percent oxygen \n     by weight;\n       (3) at the time of the adoption of the fuel oxygenate \n     standard, Congress was aware that--\n       (A) significant use of MTBE could result from the adoption \n     of that standard; and\n       (B) the use of MTBE would likely be important to the cost-\n     effective implementation of that standard;\n       (4) Congress is aware that gasoline and its component \n     additives have leaked from storage tanks, with consequences \n     for water quality;\n       (5) the fuel industry responded to the fuel oxygenate \n     standard established by Public Law 101-549 by making \n     substantial investments in--\n       (A) MTBE production capacity; and\n       (B) systems to deliver MTBE-containing gasoline to the \n     marketplace;\n       (6) when leaked or spilled into the environment, MTBE may \n     cause serious problems of drinking water quality;\n       (7) in recent years, MTBE has been detected in water \n     sources throughout the United States;\n       (8) MTBE can be detected by smell and taste at low \n     concentrations;\n       (9) while small quantities of MTBE can render water \n     supplies unpalatable, the precise human health effects of \n     MTBE consumption at low levels are yet unknown as of the date \n     of enactment of this Act;\n       (10) in the report entitled ``Achieving Clean Air and Clean \n     Water: The Report of the Blue Ribbon Panel on Oxygenates in \n     Gasoline'' and dated September 1999, Congress was urged--\n       (A) to eliminate the fuel oxygenate standard;\n       (B) to greatly reduce use of MTBE; and\n       (C) to maintain the environmental performance of \n     reformulated gasoline;\n       (11) Congress has--\n       (A) reconsidered the relative value of MTBE in gasoline; \n     and\n       (B) decided to eliminate use of MTBE as a fuel additive;\n       (12) the timeline for elimination of use of MTBE as a fuel \n     additive must be established in a manner that achieves an \n     appropriate balance among the goals of--\n       (A) environmental protection;\n       (B) adequate energy supply; and\n       (C) reasonable fuel prices; and\n       (13) it is appropriate for Congress to provide some limited \n     transition assistance--\n       (A) to merchant producers of MTBE who produced MTBE in \n     response to a market created by the oxygenate requirement \n     contained in the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.); and\n       (B) for the purpose of mitigating any fuel supply problems \n     that may result from elimination of a widely-used fuel \n     additive.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are--\n       (1) to eliminate use of MTBE as a fuel oxygenate; and\n       (2) to provide assistance to merchant producers of MTBE in \n     making the transition from producing MTBE to producing other \n     fuel additives.\n       (c) Authority for Water Quality Protection From Fuels.--\n     Section 211(c) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7545(c)) is \n     amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (1)(A)--\n       (A) by inserting ``fuel or fuel additive or'' after \n     ``Administrator any''; and\n       (B) by striking ``air pollution which'' and inserting ``air \n     pollution, or water pollution, that'';\n       (2) in paragraph (4)(B), by inserting ``or water quality \n     protection,'' after ``emission control,'';
