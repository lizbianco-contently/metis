Mr. President, the majority leader will be coming at a \nlater time. I simply wanted to say that we renew our request on this \nissue which people feel so strongly about relating to marriage, that we \nmove forward and vote on Resolution 40 that is now before the Senate. \nWe have indicated, through our leader, Senator Daschle, and again \nyesterday, that we would be willing to move to that resolution \nposthaste. We would be willing to cooperate with the majority, have \nwhatever debate time they wanted on the resolution itself. But we on \nthis side are disappointed. Yesterday morning we were told the majority \nhad another constitutional amendment they wanted to vote on relating to \nmarriage, making it two. Then later in the day, we were told they still \nhad a third one, which is certainly a recipe for having no vote on \nanything.\n  If there is no vote on the substance of this marriage amendment, it \nwill lie at the feet of the majority. They have the ability to have an \nup-or-down vote on this resolution as soon as they want it. It is not \ngood for the process to have an open season on amendments. What would \nhappen is we would move to the marriage amendment and then, by simple \nmajorities, one could attach whatever one wanted to it. The majority \nrealizes we would never have an up-or-down vote on a marriage amendment \nbecause it would be filled with all kinds of other things.\n  This reminds me of the same thing that took place last week on \nsomething some Members also felt very strongly about--class action. On \nthat, there was a sufficient number of Democrats, I am told, who would \nhave been able to move forward with this legislation. But instead of \nmoving forward on it, the majority again decided they didn't want to. \nThey wouldn't allow a limited number of amendments. Therefore, we did \nnothing.\n  We have wasted 2 weeks. This will be the second week. I am told that \nwhen we finish the marriage amendment, which will be very shortly, if \nthe procedures are as indicated--the majority leader filed cloture last \nnight and we would move to the matter Wednesday to vote on it--the \nmajority has indicated they want to move to the Australian free-trade \nagreement.\n  Now, I know Australia has been a good ally of this country, but, for \nHeaven's sake, we have so many more important things to do and we are \ngoing to take valuable Senate time away from the appropriations bills, \none of which is on the floor, the one relating to homeland security.\n  The Presiding Officer has indicated that, with certain limitations, \nhe would be willing to move forward on that bill. While we may not \naccept those limitations, we would certainly be willing to work with \nthe chairman of the Appropriations Committee to move forward on that \nlegislation.\n  We had a briefing last week on homeland security. We are having \nanother one tomorrow dealing with the emergency evacuation of this \nCapitol complex. There are things we need to do rather than have \nanother free-trade agreement.\n  I hope the majority will see the light and allow us to vote on the \nmarriage amendment tomorrow, or whenever they choose, if they want more \ntime to debate it. I think it would be good for the people of this \ncountry if they knew how people stood on the constitutional amendment \nbefore this body.\n\n[[Page S7944]]\n\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent that the \nfirst half hour of morning business run against our side.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

We are going to be discussing \nwhether we put into the Constitution a ban on gay marriage.

Mr. President, I rise to discuss unanswered questions \nregarding the no-bid contract that the administration awarded \nHalliburton last year to operate Iraq's oil infrastructure.\n  As my colleagues know, I have been outspoken in my criticism of this \nno-bid contract awarded by the Bush administration to the company that \nthe Vice President led for 5 years as CEO. This one contract alone has \ncost the U.S. taxpayers $2.2 billion. That is $2.2 billion in public \nfunds that were given to a company through a contract on which no other \ncompanies were allowed to bid.\n  Recognizing this condition, we had a unanimous vote one night in the \nSenate, when it was decided that we would no longer ever, in connection \nwith the Iraq war, issue any no-bid contracts. We forced that out into \nthe open, even though it was the intention of the Republican majority \nto keep it from being discontinued, the no-bid contract business.\n  To make matters worse, the Vice President maintains a continuing \nfinancial relationship with Halliburton, even as the company reaps the \nbenefit of multibillion-dollar contracts from the Bush-Cheney \nadministration. I believe it is ethically inappropriate, but the Vice \nPresident's response to criticism has been to dismiss the concerns with \nquestionable statements.\n  For example, on September 14, 2003, the Vice President was asked \nabout his relationship with Halliburton and the no-bid contract on \n``Meet the Press.'' Vice President Cheney told Tim Russert:\n\n       I've severed all of my ties with the company, gotten rid of \n     all of my financial interest. I have no financial interest in \n     Halliburton of any kind and haven't had, now, for over three \n     years.\n\n  The problem with that statement is that when he said it, he held over \n400,000 Halliburton stock options and continues to receive deferred \nsalary from the company.\n  But that is not all the Vice President said that day. Look at his \nother statement on this placard:\n\n       [A]s Vice President, I have absolutely no influence of, \n     involvement of, knowledge of in any way, shape or form of \n     contracts led by the [Army] Corps of Engineers or anybody \n     else in the Federal Government.\n\n  September 14, 2003.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I will.\n  Mr. REID. We have 5 extra minutes. Mr. President, I yield that time \nto the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Lautenberg.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I appreciate that very much because \nthey want to shut down the debate on Halliburton, whose receivables \nwere $161 million larger than the Pentagon wanted to pay because they \nknew there were overcharges, but they do not want to let that debate \nhappen here. I thank the Senator from Nevada for those extra 5 minutes.\n  For months, the Vice President's allies pointed to this statement \nsaying that he made it clear that he stays out of all issues relating \nto Halliburton's contracts. But now an e-mail from March 2003 has \nbecome public, and it seriously challenges Vice President Cheney's \nclaim of a hands-off policy. In fact, the e-mail message suggests that \nthe Vice President's office had an active role in Halliburton's no-bid \ncontract.\n  Look at this e-mail:\n\n       Feith--\n\n  Feith was Under Secretary of the Department of Defense.\n\n       Feith approved, contingent on informing the WH tomorrow. We \n     anticipate no issues since action has been coordinated with \n     the VP's office. Expect PA press release and Congressional \n     coordination tomorrow AM and declass action to us early in \n     PM. . . .\n\n  They are saying go ahead, fellows, don't worry about anything, this \nis cleared with the Vice President's office, perhaps even including the \nknowledge that maybe there would be some overcharges, but so what. What \nabout profiteering during the war? We have lost over 800 people in \nIraq, but the fact that the taxpayers are being cheated in the process, \nwell, that is kind of normal business, and they don't want that aired \non this floor of the Senate.\n  This e-mail tells a very different tale than what the Vice President \nhas been saying. The date of this e-mail is a mere 3 days before \nHalliburton was given the no-bid contract. The e-mail says that Under \nSecretary of Defense for Policy, Douglas Feith, approved, giving the \nno-bid contract to Halliburton contingent upon the White House giving \nthe green light. Browning then says that he or she ``anticipates no \nissues'' because the awarding of the contract has been ``coordinated \nwith the Vice President's office.''\n  This is damning information. Despite the signs of misconduct, the \nSenate has done nothing to investigate this matter. I have written to \nAttorney General Ashcroft asking for a special counsel to be appointed, \nsimilar to that action taken in the Valerie Plame case. Several laws \nmay have been broken in the awarding of the Halliburton contract, \nincluding the Competition in Contracting Act and criminal conspiracy. I \nhave also asked the chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee to \nissue subpoenas to the Pentagon and the Vice President's office \nregarding communication between those two offices on Halliburton \ncontracts.\n  In my view, the credibility of this institution is at stake, not that \nanybody seems to care. Here we are seeing the\n\n[[Page S7945]]\n\ntop level of the executive branch arranging sweetheart billion-dollar \nprocurement deals for the former employer of the Vice President, an \nemployer with whom the Vice President has a continuing financial \ninterest. Are we not even going to look into it? I guess, based on what \nI have seen this morning, it does not seem we are going to be permitted \nto do so, but we are going to continue to bring this to the public. \nThey deserve to know, even if our colleagues on the other side are not \ninterested in hearing it.\n  The Vice President has a financial interest in Halliburton, and it \nis, indeed, significant. The Vice President holds 433,000 unexercised \nHalliburton stock options, and even though most of the exercised prices \nare above the current market price, the majority of the options extend \nto 2009.\n  In addition to the stock options, Vice President Cheney continues to \nreceive deferred salary from Halliburton, and it is a significant sum. \nIn fact, the Vice President's salary rivals his Government pay. He is \nlooking at salaries that are very competitive to his Government salary. \nThe Government salary is $186,000, going to $198,000 over a period of \ntime, and the Halliburton salary is $205,000. It starts out almost \n$20,000 higher, and then it sinks to $30,000 in the middle but creeps \nback to where it is a $20,000 differential. Not much when we are \ntalking about the kind of moneys Halliburton has paid the Vice \nPresident.\n  With these revelations concerning the Vice President's involvement in \nthe no-bid contract, it is time for this Senate to act. In the last \nadministration, someone would sneeze and it would be investigated \naround here. Remember Whitewater? That was a $203,000 investment 15 \nyears before President Clinton took office. Not only was there nothing \nto the charges, but it had nothing to do with Government conduct. Yet \nhere we are talking about $2.2 billion in taxpayer funds that were \npossibly illegally awarded, and we have done nothing to investigate it.\n  I urge my colleagues to uphold our constitutional duties and \ninvestigate this critical issue.\n  What does it say to the public at large if you want to overcharge the \nGovernment and you have the right connections, perhaps you can do it or \nperhaps you can arrange it. The fact is, people out there are sweating \nto make a living, sweating to pay their bills, sweating to educate \ntheir kids, and sweating to pay the prices that prescription drugs now \ncost. But when we have an item such as a $160 million overcharge, in \nwartime, that is called profiteering, and in the war I served in a long \ntime ago, World War II, profiteering would hold you out for scorn \nacross this country. It never would be tolerated. It would be brought \nto the courts, it would be brought to the Congress, and it would be \nshut down promptly.\n\n  Halliburton's $85,000 maintenance plan: Needed an oil change but \nbought a new truck; $85,000 was spent because they did not want to take \nthe time out to change the oil in the truck. So they went ahead and \nbought a new one. What the heck, the taxpayers are paying for it, and \nno one is going to get excited here. It is obvious, as we see this \nmorning and every day.\n  It is with regret that I bring this to our attention, but I think it \nmust be done. I am not doing this for political reasons; I am doing \nthis because the citizens of the United States are entitled to a fair \nbreak. I will tell you, if it were in the local hardware store, or \nsomething such as that, and they were overcharging you and not telling \nyou the price in advance, we would hear about it in our offices. But, \nno, after all, this is only a $2.5 billion contract; what is there to \nget excited about?\n  I thank my colleagues for the attention they have given me this \nmorning, and I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  I ask the minority leader, is he using leader time?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will be using my leader time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/13/senate-section/article/S7945-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7945-S7946]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     MANY ISSUES NEED SENATE DEBATE\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I come to the floor again not to pose a \nunanimous consent request, because we attempted that again last night, \nbut to remind my colleagues that we have proposed to our colleagues on \nthe majority that we would be happy to agree to a unanimous consent \nthat would allow us an up-or-down vote on the amendment that is now the \nsubject of a motion to proceed. We had said we were prepared to do that \nlast Friday. We had said that it is important for us to have a good, \nvigorous debate about the amendment, but now there is a debate among \nthe majority apparently about several versions of the amendment they \nwant to use.\n  Usually, when someone is in the majority, they come to the floor with \na majority draft, hopefully a draft that has been passed out of the \ncommittee with careful consideration and thoughtful debate. That has \nnot happened in this case. This amendment never came out of the \ncommittee. It was simply put on the calendar and now it is the subject \nof a debate on the motion to proceed.\n  Even with all of that, we said if they want to have a debate on that \namendment, that is fine. Unfortunately, because the majority cannot \nagree among itself and because it has several versions that it now \nwants to present to the Senate, versions all to amend the U.S. \nConstitution, and because, of course, we cannot be limited just to \nthose provisions, there are other amendments that would be offered \nsubject to a simple majority, amendments that could deal with any 1 of \nthe other 17 amendments that are pending.\n  There are 67 different proposals for amending the Constitution \ncurrently pending in the 108th Congress. Any 1 of those 67 proposals \nwould be fair game. There are many that have to do with gay marriage. \nThere are many that have to do with flags, victims' rights, freedom of \nspeech, campaign finance. There are a lot of amendments. We could be on \namendments for the rest of this month. So this is not what I would \nimagine most people would prefer, but that is where we find ourselves \ntoday.\n\n  We are prepared to accept the unanimous consent agreement to go to \nthe amendment that has been proposed to the Senate, but that is not \napparently what our friends on the other side prefer to do. So we will \nhave the vote on the motion to proceed.\n  The sad thing is there are so many other things that ought to be \ndone. We were briefed just last week in a very sober setting in 407 \nabout our circumstances involving homeland security and the \npossibilities of additional new threats to our country. Yet the \nHomeland Security bill languishes. There have been suggestions within \nour caucus to make a motion to proceed to homeland security, and at \nsome point, I will say now that is a very real possibility that we will \nmove to homeland security because the majority refuses to do so.\n  It is difficult for us to understand why we ought to be in this \nsituation. This is the middle of July. We have yet to take up the \nHomeland Security appropriations bill, in spite of these warnings of \nnew threats to our country. Why would we not take up that bill? That is \njust one of the questions, one of the issues, that trouble many of us.\n  The majority leader has promised to vote on reimportation. I do not \nknow when we are going to take up reimportation. We are now through the \nmiddle of July. He has indicated that after the vote on the \nconstitutional amendment we are likely to go to the free-trade \nagreements.\n  So I am not sure when we squeeze in a good debate about whether we \ncan provide lower drug prices to seniors. That, too, could be the \nmotion that could be the subject of debate on a motion to proceed. That \nis already on the calendar. The majority leader has promised a vote on \nmental health parity. We thought it would be January or February, then \nmaybe March. Well, here it is now with fewer than 30 days remaining, \nand in spite of that promise there is no commitment to go to mental \nhealth parity.\n  Many of us would love to see a debate and a vote on whether we should \nnegotiate lower prices with the drug companies for seniors.\n\n[[Page S7946]]\n\n  That is on the list.\n  After what happened in the Supreme Court not long ago, there is a \nreal question now about whether we ought to revive the debate on \nPatients' Bill of Rights. Patients' Bill of Rights ought to be the \nsubject of debate in the Chamber, not to mention all the other \nappropriations bills, rail security legislation, legislation dealing \nwith our borders, our ports, our railroad tunnels.\n  This continues to be a historic Congress in its inability to do the \nthings the American people would expect of us. I have heard all the \ncharges of obstructionism. They can't get their act together. That is \nthe fact. They are unable to decide among themselves what their \npriorities are. As a result, the priorities of the Nation languish.\n  We face a real crisis, as I mentioned a moment ago, in our country, \ninvolving the rising cost of prescription drugs. Last year, Congress \npassed a bill that was supposed to solve that crisis. Seven months \nlater it is clear that it is not working and prices are going up as \nfast as ever. We should not and we must not accept that.\n  We have an obligation to consider new ideas, to search for new \nsolutions. President Roosevelt was fond of saying:\n\n       Take a method and try it. If it fails, admit it frankly, \n     and try another. But, by all means, try something.\n\n  A couple of weeks ago my friend Senator Pryor from Arkansas was \nspeaking here. He suggested that we follow a ``do right'' approach to \nour work. I completely agree. As we tackle issues, we should ask \nourselves a simple question: Are we doing right by America? In the case \nof prescription drugs, I would ask the question: Are we doing right by \nAmerica's seniors? The answer, unfortunately, is no.\n  According to a report by the AARP, the cost of the most-prescribed \nbrand name prescription drugs has risen above the rate of inflation for \neach of the past 4 years, steadily eroding the fixed incomes of \nseniors. Last year the cost of drugs rose three times the rate of \ninflation. But as bad as that was, this year appears to be even worse. \nThe AARP revealed recently that during the first quarter of 2004, drug \nprices rose more than 3\\1/2\\ times the rate of inflation and there is \nno end in sight. The typical senior will pay $191 more for drugs this \nyear than in 2003.\n  Statistics cannot do justice to the hardship this is placing on \nAmericans.\n  Not long ago my office was contacted by a man whose name is Stan \nPitts. Stan's diabetes has left him virtually blind and unable to work. \nControlling his illness requires 13 different prescriptions. In all, \nhis monthly drug bill is $1,267. When he could no longer work as a \ncomputer technician, Stan went on disability, which paid him $1,162 per \nmonth. It is not much, not even enough to cover his drug costs, but it \nstill disqualified him from receiving any other assistance, including \nfood stamps, housing, and Medicare.\n  There are no good answers for Stan today. All he can do is try to \nbalance his needs and his income as long as he can. If he does not take \nhis medicine, his illness will worsen and he will eventually die. If he \ndoesn't pay his rent, he will be out on the street. So he alternates. \nOne month he pays for his medicine. The next month he pays his rent, \nand so on. This only delays the inevitable. Eventually, he will be \nevicted and eventually there will be nothing left to sell or exchange \nto pay his drug bill.\n  That is the future waiting for Stan Pitts, and it will be the future \nfor thousands of more Americans unless we do something.\n  The White House and congressional Republicans seem content to rest on \ntheir Medicare and drug card program. Since its introduction 2 months \nago, seniors have expressed concern that it is too confusing, it \ndoesn't cover their medications, and it doesn't protect them against \nprice gouging. The Wall Street Journal reported recently that whatever \ndiscounts the cards might have provided have already been factored into \ndrug company pricing strategies. In fact, drugmakers have already \nraised prices so much that the so-called discounts offered by this \nprogram will do little more than return the drugs to their original \nprices.\n\n  Families USA recently concluded that families are worse off today \nwith the drug card than they were in 2001, when the President took \noffice. Furthermore, the official Web site established to help simplify \nthe program for seniors has only made the problem worse. The prices are \nactually inaccurate. The information on the Web site is confusing and \nvery unhelpful. Last week we learned that many of the pharmacies listed \nas participants in fact do not participate at all. Some are no longer \nin business and their windows are boarded up.\n  Seniors have been thrust into a maze of contradicting information. \nEven those who navigate it successfully will have few, if any, savings \nto show for their efforts. One couple from Rapid City who recently \nwrote me found the whole process, in their words, ``foolish.'' They \nwrote:\n\n       This solution is not a benefit to the senior citizens, but \n     instead is an economic boon for the drug companies. . . .\n\n  So rather than participate in the drug card program, they have \nstarted buying their drugs from Canadian pharmacies. They do not like \nto break the law, but they say they will have no other choice. The drug \nthey need is 60 percent cheaper in Canada than it is here.\n  This family is not alone. Pharmaceutical companies charge American \nconsumers the highest prices in the world. Some medicines cost American \npatients five times more than they cost patients in other countries. In \neffect, our citizens are charged a tax simply for being American. As a \nresult, millions of Americans are having trouble affording lifesaving \nmedication.\n  Seniors should not be made to feel like criminals just because they \ncannot afford a $1,000-per-month drug bill. It is wrong that seniors \nare left to struggle alone, and what makes it worse is the fact it is \ntotally unnecessary.\n  The good news for America's seniors is we can do right by them. There \nare low-cost alternatives that dramatically reduce the price of \nprescription drugs. We know, for instance, that by enabling Americans \nto reimport medications safely from other industrialized countries we \ncan bring down drug costs immediately. At the same time, we should be \nable to take advantage of the method the VA has already used to reduce \ndrug costs, and employ the unrivaled purchasing power of the Government \nto negotiate better prices for 41 million Americans.\n  The administration opposes each of these commonsense measures. \nApparently, the White House is so committed to protecting the profits \nof pharmaceutical companies, it is negotiating trade pacts that would \nincrease the drug costs of other countries. Rather than running up the \npharmaceutical costs of other countries, the administration should work \nwith us to lower the price to Americans.\n  The fact is, there is no mystery to the problem of bringing down drug \ncosts. There is no hidden secret; no puzzle to solve. We can do right \nby our seniors by making a simple choice. Let's put their interests \nahead of the demands of the drug companies and HMOs. By taking simple \ncommonsense steps, we can bring the cost of drugs and health care \nwithin reach of every American. When we do that, we will know we have \ndone right by America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN.

Mr. President, last week I noted here in the Senate that \nit has been almost a year since the identity of a covert CIA agent was \nrevealed in print by a columnist, Robert Novak. It has now been 365 \ndays, 1 year, and yet we still don't know who blew her cover, who \nleaked her name, who in the NSC, National Security Council, CIA, gave \nthis information to people in the White House. It is clear that Valerie \nPlame's cover was blown as part of an effort at that time to discredit \nand retaliate against critics of the administration, especially anyone \nwho dared to suggest that some of the intelligence used to justify the \nwar in Iraq was fraud or fabricated.\n  If the administration were to try to continue this campaign of \nvengeance today, I suppose they would have to go after the entire \nSenate Intelligence Committee. I believe its report that it just put \nout verifies the fact that this was done in a vengeful manner.\n\n[[Page S7947]]\n\n  As we all know, Ms. Plame's husband, former Ambassador Joseph Wilson, \nwas sent by the CIA on a factfinding mission to Niger early in 2002 to \nexamine claims that Saddam Hussein had sought to purchase uranium from \nNiger. Wilson said he found the claims lacked credibility. The \nIntelligence Committee report provides an interesting new perspective \non these events. It indicates that in October of 2002, CIA Director \nTenet called the Deputy National Security Adviser, Stephen Hadley, to \nexpress the CIA's serious concerns about references to uranium and \nAfrica in a speech the President was going to give in Cincinnati.\n  Guess what. The references were removed.\n  Then in December of 2002, the State Department officials advised that \nthe documents underlying the claim were likely forgeries. That is in \nDecember. However, the President comes before a joint session in \nJanuary and says that the ``British Government has learned that Saddam \nHussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from \nAfrica.''\n  One thing that remains unclear throughout this series of events is \nexactly how and why the same NSC officials--National Security Council \nofficials--who heard Director Tenet's concerns in October, who removed \nthat language from the speech the President was giving in Cincinnati, \nwho also knew the State Department in December had said these were \nprobably forgeries, how did they allow this back into the State of the \nUnion Message in January 2003?\n  We still don't have a full picture of how the administration \nmanipulated intelligence on Iraq. The Intelligence Committee report \nstops short of that inquiry. But it is clear that the intelligence \ncommunity felt a great deal of pressure to conform its views to the \nadministration's public characterizations of certainty about Iraqi \nproduction of weapons of mass destruction and Iraq's connections to \nterrorism.\n  The minority views of the report note that former Director Tenet \nconfirmed that agency staff raised with him the matter of ``repetitive \ntasking'' and the pressure that it created. The CIA ombudsman told the \ncommittee that he believed ``the `hammering' of the Bush administration \non Iraq intelligence was harder than he had previously witnessed in his \n32-year career.''\n  The minority views went on to say:\n\n       By the time American troops had been deployed overseas and \n     were poised to attack Iraq, the administration had skillfully \n     manipulated and cowed the intelligence community into \n     approving public statements that conveyed a level of \n     conviction and certainty that was not supported by an \n     objective reading of the underlying intelligence reporting.\n\n  That was the fundamental point that Ambassador Wilson made in his op-\ned in the New York Times: Intelligence was stretched to fit a \npredetermined course of action.\n  One year later--365 days later--we still don't know who was involved \nin leaking this name and exposing a covert CIA agent. We don't know who \ngave this classified information to the leakers in the White House.\n  The disclosure of Ms. Plame's identity was malicious and probably \ncriminal. Mr. Fitzgerald, the special prosecutor, has been conducting a \nthorough investigation but with very little assistance from the person \nwho could easily get to the bottom of it--the President of the United \nStates.\n  I believe the President has been too cavalier, too dismissive of the \nsituation. He has made only one statement on this issue. Here is what \nhe said:\n\n       This is a town that likes to leak. I do not know if we are \n     going to find out the senior administration official. Now \n     this is a large administration, and there's a lot of senior \n     officials. I don't have any idea.\n\n  That is the President of the United States.\n  Where is his outrage?\n  What about the Vice President? We know he can be relentless when he \nis on a quest for information to justify the war in Iraq. Vice \nPresident Cheney personally journeyed to CIA headquarters repeatedly--I \nhave heard up to eight or nine times--to meet directly with analysts on \nIraq. I am further told that was unheard of before, that Vice \nPresidents have never done this before.\n\n  Here is Vice President Cheney personally going to CIA headquarters \nacross the river eight or nine times to sit down with analysts to tell \nthem to get their story straight.\n  Where is that kind of determination when it comes to finding the \npeople who committed treasonous acts against this country and leaked \nMs. Plame's identity?\n  This administration has used the power of the Presidency to bend \nfacts to fit predetermined views and then to suppress dissent.\n  That is why so much rests on the outcome of Mr. Fitzgerald's \ninvestigation. We need to send a clear message to any President that \nsacrificing intelligence assets and breaching national security is \nwrong and it is against the law.\n  We should be as vigorous and determined and unrelenting in finding \nthese perpetrators, finding those who broke this law, finding those who \nundermined the security of our country as we are in going after any \ndrug pusher or drug dealer anywhere in the United States.\n  This President, President Bush--yes, President Bush--has got to come \nout and help the special prosecutor. Quit hiding behind executive \nprivilege. Quit hiding behind the fact that this is a large \nadministration, and maybe we will never find out who did it. It is time \nfor the President to come clean, and for the Vice President to come \nclean; otherwise, I fear for the future of our intelligence community \nand what kind of freedom they will have to give correct analysis to \nfuture Presidents of the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns).

Mr. President, last Friday the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee released a report on the CIA's threat assessments regarding \nIraq conducted in the years prior to the liberation of that country. \nThat the CIA overestimated the extent of Hussein's WMD infrastructure \nand underestimated the threat posed by al-Qaida prior to September 11 \nraises critical issues worthy of debate and deliberation. \nUnfortunately, we are not having this debate.\n  We know now that America was basically blind for over a decade \nthroughout the Middle East, that we lacked agents in Iraq and \nAfghanistan or Arabic linguists or Middle east experts.\n  We also know that there are structural problems that have frustrated \nthe intelligence community's ability to provide the best possible \ninformation to political leaders. And we know these structural flaws \nled to inaccurate estimates that misinformed policy makers.\n  Rather than working to fix the problems of the intelligence \ncommunity, some Democrats are now issuing statements notably at odds \nwith their prior positions.\n  The Vice-Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Senator \nRockefeller, accused the Bush administration of pressuring the CIA to \ncome up with a certain viewpoint, even as he endorsed a committee \nreport that concludes the opposite.\n  The Senator from West Virginia went further and charged that: ``Our \nstanding in the world has never been lower. We have fostered a deep \nhatred of America in the Muslim world, and that will grow. As a direct \nconsequence, our nation is more vulnerable today than ever before.''\n  Oddly, these charges are at variance with the sensible claims he and \nother critics of the President have said for years about the threat \nSaddam Hussein posed to the United States.\n  In October 2002, Senator Rockefeller, then as now a member of the \nIntelligence Committee and privy to the sensitive intelligence data \nthat administration officials use, gave a thoughtful speech defending \nhis vote in favor of the use of force resolution. It was a very good \nspeech. So let me highlight a few quotes from the speech of our good \nfriend from West Virginia. He said:\n\n       There is no doubt in my mind Saddam Hussein is a despicable \n     dictator, a war criminal, a regional menace, and a real and \n     growing threat to the United States . . .\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       Saddam's government has contact with many international \n     terrorist organizations that likely have cells here in the \n     United States . . .\n\n[[Page S7948]]\n\n       We also should remember we have always underestimated the \n     progress that Saddam Hussein has been able to make in the \n     development of weapons of mass destruction . . .\n\n  The Senator from West Virginia continues:\n\n       Saddam's existing biological and chemical weapons \n     capabilities pose real threats to America today, tomorrow. \n     Saddam has used chemical weapons before, both against Iraq's \n     enemies and against his own people . . . At the end of the \n     day, we cannot let the security of the American people rest \n     in the hands of somebody whose track record gives us every \n     reason to fear that he is prepared to use the weapons he has \n     used against his enemies before . . .\n       There has been some debate over how ``imminent'' a threat \n     Iraq poses. I do believe Iraq poses an imminent threat. I \n     also believe after September 11, that question is \n     increasingly outdated. It is in the nature of these weapons \n     that he has and the way they are targeted against civilian \n     populations, that the documented capability and demonstrated \n     intent may be the only warning we get. To insist on further \n     evidence could put some of our fellow Americans at risk. Can \n     we afford to take that chance? I do not think we can.\n\n  That was Senator Rockfeller back in 2002. I agree with what he said. \nSenator Rockefeller's assessment was a reasonable judgment at the time \ngiven Hussein's belligerence, his refusal to open his country to \nweapons inspectors, decades of intelligence collection, and the fact \nthat not a single international intelligence agency believed that Iraq \ndid not have WMD. Indeed, what we have found in Iraq indicates that \nHussein maintained the capacity to produce chemical and biological \nweapons, even if he had destroyed or shipped out of country his \nstockpiles of WMD.\n\n  Senator Rockefeller is not the only democrat to change his tune. \nSenator John Kerry, with Senator Edwards at his side, told the New York \nTimes over the weekend that President Bush ``certainly misled America \nabout nuclear involvement, and he misled America about the types of \nweapons that were there, and he misled America about how the would go \nabout using the authority he was given.''\n  But in March of 1998, the Senator from Massachusetts declared on the \nSenate floor that Iraq continued clandestinely to maintain its WMD \nstockpiles and programs. This is what he said in 1998.\n\n       We do know that he had them [WMD] in his inventory, and the \n     means of delivering them. We do know that his chemical, \n     biological, and nuclear weapons development programs were \n     proceeding with his active support.\n       We have evidence . . . that despite his pledges at the \n     conclusion of the war that no further work would be done in \n     these weapons of mass destruction programs, and that all \n     prior work and weapons that resulted from it would be \n     destroyed, this work has continued illegally and covertly.\n       And, Mr. President, We have every reason to believe that \n     Saddam Hussein will continue to do everything in his power to \n     further develop weapons of mass destruction and the ability \n     to deliver those weapons, and that he will use those weapons \n     without concern or pangs of conscience if ever and whenever \n     his own calculations persuade him in is in his interests to \n     do so .  .  .\n       .  .  . The United States must take every feasible step to \n     lead the world to remove this unacceptable threat.\n\n  I have to ask: How can Senator Kerry claim he was misled by the \ncurrent President into believing precisely the allegations he made back \nin 1998, when President Bush was Governor Bush?\n  Those who hold Senator Kerry's view would have you believe that \nPresident Bush invented these allegations and forced this war upon an \nunwilling Congress. Far from it.\n  Senator Edwards noted in 2002:\n\n       As a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I firmly \n     believe that the issue of Iraq is not about politics. It's \n     about national security. We know that for at least 20 years, \n     Saddam Hussein has aggressively and obsessively sought \n     weapons of mass destruction through every means available.\n       We know that he has chemical and biological weapons today . \n     . . I believe that Saddam Hussein's Iraqi regime represents a \n     clear threat to the United States, to our allies, to our \n     interest around the world, and to the values of freedom and \n     democracy we hold dear.\n\n  Now, I find it troubling that neither Senator Kerry, nor his running \nmate seems to recall his own prior assessments of the threats posed by \nthe Hussein regime.\n  I believe America is better off with Hussein gone, and I know the \nIraqis are happy with his ouster and increasingly optimistic about \ntheir future. Unfortunately, some here in the Senate don't share their \noptimism.\n  Equally perplexing is a partisan view of this United States economy. \nJust as partisans see no threat from Iraq now when they call it a \nthreat a few years back, they see a Great Depression now when they \nwould have called it a great recovery a few years back.\n  They claim signs of this Great Depression are all around. But the \ncold, hard, inconvenient fact for their theory is that we have added \n1.3 million jobs so far this year. The unemployment rate has been \ndropping for a year, to 5.6 percent today. That is below the average of \nthe 1970s, the 1980s, and the 1990s, but the naysayers read it as proof \nof an economic collapse.\n  They point to all sorts of signs of weakness in our economy, such as \nstrongest annual growth in 20 years, low mortgage rates, low inflation \nrates and the highest productivity rates in half a century. The stock \nmarket has ``crashed'' upward by 40 percent in the last 2 years. NASDAQ \nhas had a 70 percent gain! The ``human costs'' of this Great Depression \nare apparent, such as having the highest homeownership rate in United \nStates history.\n  This is the new speak of the Great Depression.\n  We don't have a depression; what we have is political spin. We have \npolitical leaders who are trying to convince the American people that \nthe economy is bad, that we have not gotten over the 2001 recession, \nthe terrorist attacks of 9/11, the corporate scandals, or the \nuncertainties of war.\n  Yet the facts say we are well on our way, and we won't rest until \nevery American who wants a job, has a job.\n  I understand the spin game in Washington. We can spin a lot of things \nin Washington, but a weak economy can't be spun as a strong one, and a \nstrong economy can't be twisted as a weak one.\n  Ant I can only hope my friends have not dizzied themselves so much \nthat they cannot separate reality from politics or understand the \ndifference between a recovery and a depression.

Mr. President, I thank the deputy majority leader for his \nexcellent comments. As a member of the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence, I congratulate him on his very thorough and thoughtful \ndiscussion of the work of the Intelligence Committee.\n  Last week, as we all recall, the committee released a remarkable \nreport unanimously supported by the Democrat and Republican members of \nthe committee. However, despite the findings of fact, which took a year \nof interviews by staff of over 200 people reviewing 15,000 documents, \nthe campaign continues to attempt to politicize this process perfectly \nconsistent with the political strategy memo uncovered last November \ndesigned by minority staff to show how the Intelligence Committee could \nbe manipulated in order to hamper the President and his administration \nduring the election year. The fact this is a time of war is apparently \ninsufficient justification for leaving politics at the water's edge.\n  No rule of law should ever stifle honest debate, discourse, or \ndissent in this country, but somewhere public leaders can recognize \nself-discipline can be a benefit to our troops and our Nation. I saw a \nreport recently that in the 1944 election, as Republican candidate \nThomas Dewey was set to blame President Roosevelt for what transpired \nat Pearl Harbor, General Marshall appealed to Dewey, arguing that the \nNation should be united against the real enemy. Dewey acted on behalf \nof the country. I guess times were different then.\n  In this country, we need to make sure our service men and women \nunderstand that while we can have our debate, we can demonstrate more \ndisdain for the enemy than we have for the opposition party.\n  Since Friday, we have heard the suggestions that the efforts of our \ntroops to depose Saddam Hussein and set the long-term stage for peace \nand democracy in the most dangerous region in the world was not--yes, \nnot--warranted. Besides being wrong, what kind\n\n[[Page S7949]]\n\nof horrible message is this to send our troops and their families, not \nto mention the enemy, whose only hope is to win in Washington what they \ncannot win from our troops on the battlefield?\n  If it is the will of this body that we cut and run, then let's debate \nand vote on it. Maybe we need a sense-of-the-Senate resolution, in any \ncase, to send a message to our troops and the enemy that we intend to \nsee this through. If we agree on it, as I believe we do, we should let \nour troops do what they are doing, and we should spend our time \nsupporting their efforts, not retracting from their mission.\n  Of course, we should be focused on the need to provide better \nintelligence, but some of us have been saying that since the 1970s when \nour intelligence collection was destroyed. Some of us had said that \nwhen we failed to predict the Iraqi Army would amass on the Kuwaiti \nborder and when intelligence failed to predict they would cross over \nand overtake Kuwait and threaten Saudi Arabia. Some of us said that \nwhen we learned the estimates of Saddam Hussein's nuclear capability \nwere not 5 to 10 years in the future but less than 1 year. All we need \nto know about the quality of intelligence in the region is to know we \ndid not have one single agent on the ground.\n  As said in today's editorial in Investor's Business Daily, \nintelligence spending was cut, the number of spies sharply dropped, so \nsharply, in fact, that after 9/11 the CIA had to create a 5-year plan \nto undo the damage. During President Clinton's two terms, the number of \nspies fell an estimated 20 percent, the budget tumbled by some \nestimates as much as 30 percent--it is classified--spy satellites got \ntaken down, experienced analysts got fired.\n  Well, much has been said of the pressure that policymakers allegedly \nput on the intelligence community to get hard answers to important \nquestions. We just heard that repeated in the Chamber. They are talking \nabout pressure to change the analysis. Let's go back to what the \nbipartisan committee unanimously concluded.\n  Conclusion No. 11.\n\n       Several of the allegations of pressure on the intelligence \n     community analysts involved repeated questioning. The \n     committee--\n\n  That is the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence--\n\n     believes that the intelligence community analysts should \n     expect difficult and repeated questions regarding threat \n     information. Just as the post-9/11 environment lowered the \n     intelligence community's reporting threshold, it has also \n     affected the intensity with which policymakers will review \n     and question threat information.\n\n  With respect to the Vice President, conclusion No. 84:\n\n       The committee found no evidence that the Vice President's \n     visits to the Central Intelligence Agency were attempts to \n     pressure analysts, were perceived as intended to pressure \n     analysts by those who participated in the briefings on Iraq's \n     weapons of mass destruction programs or did pressure analysts \n     to change their conclusions.\n\n  Conclusion No. 102:\n\n       The committee found that none of the analysts or other \n     people interviewed by the committee said they were pressured \n     to change their conclusions related to Iraq's links to \n     terrorism.\n\n  Now, talking to the people who work in the intelligence community, \nthey are expected to get tough questions. They need to be able to \ndefend what they have produced, and a good policymaker will challenge \nthem not to change the evidence, and there was no evidence--zip, zero, \nnone--of pressure to change.\n  I ought to mention Ambassador Wilson's name was raised. The committee \nalso found that his so-called review was inadequate and did not \nconclusively determine that there was not an effort--in fact, some \nanalysts were led to conclude from what he brought back that it was \nmore likely that Iraq was trying to get uranium from Africa, and I \nwould refer my colleagues to Chairman Roberts' additional views.\n  The partisan suggestions continue nevertheless, as administration \nofficials are accused of making the same charges against Saddam's \nregime as the Senators themselves made in 1998 and during the debate \nfor war which was overwhelmingly adopted in 2002. Candidates accuse our \nPresident and Vice President of having little swing with our so-called \nallies. Yet somehow they must have had enough swing to intimidate the \nEnglish, French, Swiss, German, U.N. and Russian intelligence agencies \nto fall for the same WMD charge. This notion did not survive \ninvestigative scrutiny, and it does not survive common sense. \nFurthermore, it is a gross insult to analysts in the intelligence \ncommunity to suggest they conform their views to the pleasure of \npolicymakers.\n  Again, I would draw the attention of my colleagues to yesterday's \nWall Street Journal editorial on this subject, which says something \nthat I said in the Chamber last Friday. A few apologies would seem to \nbe in order. I think apologies are owed to the Vice President and to \nthe administration. And yet we are still continuing to hear the same \nmisguided, unsubstantiated charges made. Some Senators trying to win \nthe White House away are criticizing the President for looking at the \nsame intelligence they did and coming to the same conclusion they did. \nIs political victory more important than victory in Iraq? Has political \nvictory become so important that some believe it necessary to divide \nAmerica with this blame game while their sons and daughters are risking \ntheir lives abroad? If we are going to blame someone, I recommend we \nall agree to start with Saddam and bin Laden. Have we forgotten who the \nreal enemy of peace, democracy, and humanity really is?\n  Recall what President Clinton said who saw the intelligence in 1998. \nPresident Clinton said:\n\n       The fact is that so long as Saddam remains in power, he \n     threatens the well-being of his people, the peace of this \n     region, the security of the world. The best way to end that \n     threat once and for all is with the new Iraqi Government, a \n     government ready to live in peace with its neighbors, a \n     government that respects the rights of its people. Saddam \n     will strike again at his neighbors and he will make war on \n     his own people, and mark my words, he will develop weapons of \n     mass destruction. He will deploy them and he will use them.\n\n  My colleague, the deputy majority leader from Kentucky, has already \npointed out the words of the Senators in this body, and I agree with \nhim and I endorse that reference. But as we focus to the point of \nobsession on intelligence--and we must make it better if we are to stop \nfuture acts of terror--we cannot leave behind our own personal \nintelligence. We do not exist to swallow whole what the intelligence \ncommunity feeds us. Sometimes they are wrong, sometimes lazy, but most \nof the time they work tirelessly under dangerous conditions and are \ndead right, and other times their guesses, which is much of what \nintelligence is all about, may not be as good as ours. But in the case \nof Saddam, who in this body needed a CIA report to understand that the \nman and his despicable sons set to lead Iraq through the first half of \nthe new century? Ordinary citizens need not have a security clearance \nbut need only to have watched or read the news over the previous 20 \nyears.\n  What don't we know about this man's evil intention, his hatred for \nthe U.S., his willingness not only to pursue but use weapons of mass \ndestruction? Is his track record of insanity meaningless?\n\n  By the time a crazed maniac invades two foreign countries, defies \nrepeatedly the mandates of the U.N., fires missiles at Israel, fires \nmissiles at our patrol aircraft, pays suicide bombers to blow up \ninnocent women and children, not only builds and stockpiles weapons of \nmass destruction but uses them, fills mass graves by the tens of \nthousands, attempts to assassinate our former President, and suggests \nthat perhaps his only regret in 1990 was not waiting a few more months \nso he would have the nuclear capability to confront our troops, what \nelse do we really need to know about this man? Do we really need the \nCIA to introduce Saddam to the Senate? Can it be true that there is \nthis signal that unless WMD are found, Saddam is somehow acquitted? \nLook at the thousands and thousands of people he killed with the WMD.\n  In retrospect, many things are more clear, including that we would \nhave been better off taking care of him in 1991, but in post-9/11 could \nwe really afford to trust him, to let him continue to fester \nindefinitely? Were we prepared to wait until the threat was imminent? \nPresident Bush said we can't wait until the threat is imminent, meaning \nto wait until the threat is executed which is too late. We didn't know \nhis invasion of Kuwait was imminent until we saw his tanks through the \ndust of the Kuwaiti desert. We knew bin Laden was a threat but the\n\n[[Page S7950]]\n\nthreat did not appear imminent until after the USS Cole was bombed, \nafter the embassies were bombed, after the towers were dropped, killing \n3,000 innocent Americans.\n  While it may be lost on some perhaps in this body, but in our \nnational news media, the burdens of leadership are not lost on this \nPresident. While no one else may see the irony, President Bush does. He \nsees a 9/11 commission asking: Why didn't the administration act on \nsketchy intelligence at the very same time some on the other side are \nasking why did the administration act on sketchy intelligence? The \nfirst investigation answers the second to anyone sitting in the hottest \npolitical seat in America. Meanwhile, the hottest job abroad is being \nfaithfully executed by our soldiers, marines, airmen, and civilian \nsupport personnel.\n  I am proud my son is a marine who expects to get his turn to serve in \nthe sandbox. I want him to return safely, but I want him to win, and I \nwant our troops abroad to win, and I want them to know that America is \nbehind them and to know that addressing the most dangerous nation in \nthe most dangerous region of the world makes this world safer because \nit will if Washington will let it.\n  Winning the real war on terror is more important than winning the \npolitical war for the White House. We want to win the war on terror and \nwe must. The continued charges of pressure and misinformation are \ntotally off the mark based on what the Intelligence Committee found. \nThere is no question that we are better off. The region is safer, the \nIraqi people are much safer, and we in the United States are much safer \nbecause we have deposed Saddam Hussein, because we have enacted the \nPATRIOT Act, because we have pursued very vigorously the war on terror.\n  We ought to be strengthening that war, supporting our troops, \nsupporting our agencies here at home and not trying to phony up charges \nof pressure to win political points.\n  I ask unanimous consent that two editorials, one from the Wall Street \nJournal and one from Investor's Business Daily, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the Investor's Business Daily, July 13, 2004]\n\n                            Pointing Fingers\n\n       It's a little funny watching some of the very same people \n     who voted repeatedly in the 1990s to strip the CIA of its \n     spies and slash its budget now taking it to task for not \n     doing its job.\n       It is true the CIA failed to anticipate Sept. 11--though \n     it's not clear any organization operating in a democratic \n     society could have done so.\n       It's also true the CIA made mistakes in estimating the \n     scope of Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction \n     programs--and in suggesting the U.S. would find stockpiles of \n     WMDs when it invaded.\n       (Although, it's equally clear the CIA wasn't entirely \n     wrong: Iraq did have WMD programs, and coalition troops did \n     find weapons of mass destruction--namely, deadly sarin and \n     mustard gas--in Iraq, though not in the amounts the CIA \n     hinted they would).\n       Nonetheless, in a predictable game of political tag, some \n     try to pin the blame for the CIA's failures on President \n     Bush--as if the eight years of massive intelligence cuts in \n     the 1990s played no role at all.\n       It's a matter of record: President Clinton slashed \n     intelligence spending and cut the number of spies sharply--so \n     sharply, in fact, the CIA after 9-11 had to create a five-\n     year plan to undo the damage.\n       During his two terms, the number of spies fell an estimated \n     20%. The budget tumbled, by some estimates as much as 30% \n     (it's classified). Spy satellites got taken down. Experienced \n     analysts got fired.\n       That doesn't mean Clinton had no spying priorities. He did: \n     the economy. In place of a relentless focus on the growing \n     terror threat, the Clinton White House made ``economic \n     security'' its top priority.\n       Typical was this comment from then-Secretary of State \n     Warren Christopher: ``Our national security is inseparable \n     from our economic security.''\n       So much for terrorism.\n       Unfortunately, terrorists found the U.S. an easy target \n     during the decade. They started with the World Trade Center \n     bombing in 1993, killing six and wounding a thousand more. \n     They kept at it, blowing up a U.S. barracks in Saudi Arabia, \n     attacking U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, and bombing \n     the USS Cole in port in Yemen. They murdered hundreds in \n     these and other terror attacks.\n       Yet, it was still ``the economy stupid'' in the White \n     House--an attitude that found many allies among Congress' \n     Democrats.\n       That includes Sen. John Kerry. He proposed deep cuts for \n     the CIA in 1994 and 1995.\n       We mention this because the report on the CIA's \n     shortcomings has been the source of a good deal of finger-\n     pointing. Bush often gets the blame, even though the weakened \n     intelligence community he inherited was Clinton's creation.\n       The CIA, no doubt, needs reforms. But its troubles didn't \n     arise in just the last three years. And playing political \n     football with America's intelligence failures won't make us \n     more secure.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, July 12, 2004]\n\n                          Of ``Lies'' and WMD\n\n       ``The Committee did not find any evidence that \n     Administration officials attempted to coerce, influence or \n     pressure analysts to change their judgments related to Iraq's \n     weapons of mass destruction capabilities.''\n       So reads Conclusion 83 of the Senate Intelligence \n     Committee's report on prewar intelligence on Iraq. The \n     committee likewise found no evidence of pressure to link Iraq \n     to al Qaeda. So it appears that some of the claims about WMD \n     used by the Bush Administration and others to argue for war \n     in Iraq were mistaken because they were based on erroneous \n     information provided by the CIA.\n       A few apologies would seem to be in order. Allegations of \n     lying or misleading the nation to war are about the most \n     serious charge that can be leveled against a President. But \n     according to this unanimous study, signed by Jay Rockefeller \n     and seven other Democrats, those frequent charges from \n     prominent Democrats and the media are without merit.\n       Or to put it more directly, if President Bush was ``lying'' \n     about WMD, then so was Mr. Rockefeller when he relied on CIA \n     evidence to claim in October 2002 that Saddam Hussein's \n     weapons ``pose a very real threat to America.'' Also lying at \n     the time were John Kerry, John Edwards, Bill and Hillary \n     Clinton, and so on. Yet, Mr. Rockefeller is still suggesting \n     on the talk shows, based on nothing but inference and \n     innuendo, that there was undue political Bush ``pressure'' on \n     CIA analysts.\n       The West Virginia Democrat also asserted on Friday that \n     Undersecretary of Defense Douglas Feith has been running a \n     rogue intelligence operation that is ``not lawful.'' Mr. \n     Feith's shop has spent more than 1,800 hours responding to \n     queries from the Senate and has submitted thousands of pages \n     of documents--none of which supports such a charge. Shouldn't \n     even hyper-partisan Senators have to meet some minimum \n     standard of honesty?\n       In fact, the report shows that one of the first allegations \n     of false intelligence was itself a distortion: Mr. Bush's \n     allegedly misleading claim in the 2003 State of the Union \n     address that Iraq has been seeking uranium ore from Africa. \n     The Senate report notes that Presidential accuser and former \n     CIA consultant Joe Wilson returned from his trip to Africa \n     with no information that cast serious doubt on such a claim; \n     and that, contrary to Mr. Wilson's public claims, his wife (a \n     CIA employee) was involved in helping arrange his mission.\n       ``When coordinating the State of the Union, no Central \n     Intelligence Agency (CIA) analysts or officials told the \n     National Security Council (NSC) to remove the `16 words' or \n     that there were concerns about the credibility of the Iraq-\n     Niger Uranium reporting,'' the report says. In short, Joe \n     Wilson is a partisan fraud whose trip disproved nothing, and \n     what CIA doubts there were on Niger weren't shared with the \n     White House.\n       The broader CIA failure on Iraq's WMD is troubling, though \n     it is important to keep in mind that this was a global \n     failure. Every serious intelligence service thought Saddam \n     still had WMD, and the same consensus existed across the \n     entire U.S. intelligence community. One very alarming \n     explanation, says the report, is that the CIA had ``no \n     [human] sources collecting against weapons of mass \n     destruction in Iraq after 1998.'' That's right. Not one \n     source.\n       When asked why not, a CIA officer replied ``because it's \n     very hard to sustain.'' The report's rather obvious answer is \n     that spying ``should be within the norm of the CIA's \n     activities and capabilities,'' and some blame for this human \n     intelligence failure has to fall on recently departed \n     Director George Tenet and his predecessor, John Deutch.\n       The Senate report blames these CIA failures not just on \n     management but also on ``a risk averse corporate culture.'' \n     This sound right, and Acting Director John McLaughlin's \n     rejection of this criticism on Friday is all the more reason \n     for Mr. Bush to name a real replacement. Richard Armitage has \n     been mentioned for the job, but the Deputy Secretary of State \n     has been consistently wrong about Iran, which will be a \n     principal threat going forward, and his and Colin Powell's \n     philosophy at the State Department has been to let the \n     bureaucrats run the place. We can think of better choices.\n       One real danger now is that the intelligence community will \n     react to this Iraq criticism by taking even fewer risks, or \n     by underestimating future threats as it has so often in the \n     past. (The failure to detect that Saddam was within a year of \n     having a nuclear bomb prior to the 1991 Gulf War is a prime \n     example.) The process of developing ``national intelligence \n     estimates,'' or NIEs, will only reinforce this sense of \n     internal lowest-common-denominator, conformity. If the Senate \n     is looking for a place to recommend long-term reform, \n     dispensing with NIEs would be a good place to start.\n       Above all, it's important to remember that the Senate \n     report does not claim that the\n\n[[Page S7951]]\n\n     overall assessment of Iraq as a threat was mistaken. U.N. \n     Resolution 1441 gave Saddam ample opportunity to come clean \n     about his weapons, but he refused. The reports from David Kay \n     and his WMD task force have since shown that Saddam violated \n     1441 in multiple ways.\n       Saddam retained a ``just-in-time'' capability to make WMD, \n     even if he destroyed, hid or removed the ``stockpiles'' that \n     the CIA believed he had. It's fanciful to think, especially \n     in light of the Oil for Food scandal, that U.N.-led \n     containment was a realistic option for another 12 years, or \n     that once containment ended Saddam wouldn't have expanded his \n     weapons capacity very quickly. The Senate report makes clear \n     we need a better CIA, not that we should have left in power a \n     homicidal, WMD-using dictator.\n\n  Mr. BOND.

Mr. President, I urge my colleagues and our leadership on \nboth sides of the aisle to find a way for us to work together to \naddress some of the critical issues facing this country. We have in \nconference now on a highway bill, a transportation bill that is \nimportant for economic development, for the creation of jobs, and for \nsafety. I hope the conference will not become so obsessed with \nachieving the highest possible funding level that we wind up not \ngetting a bill. It takes leadership and courage. It also takes being \nwilling to accept what you can get, and get a conclusion that is good \nfor everybody and move forward.\n  We need an energy bill. The very idea that we still do not have a \nnational energy policy is indefensible. Yet we continue to labor over \nhow do we get an energy bill, what is in the package, and how are we \ngoing to get back to the floor of the Senate. We need to find a way to \ndo that.\n  The very idea that there is an effort to block the FSC/ETI JOBS \ngrowth bill, which involves a ruling by the WTO which has led to \nAmerican products being hit with a penalty in Europe, and that we are \nnot going to go to conference until we get some guarantee of what the \nresult will be or that one Senator will be able to decide the \nconference report, what have we come to? We should get this bill in \nconference and get a result. Does it need to be changed? Yes. Has it \nbecome bloated? Absolutely. But if we don't deal with this, American \nproducts are going to wind up facing a penalty of 12 percent or more \nbefore we get a chance to address it again. It could go up to 17 \npercent. We are not going to deal with the job growth provisions in \nthis legislation. We need to find a way to get it done.\n  I hope our leaders will find a way to get these conferences going or \nget us into conference and get a result, because we need to get this \ndone for the American people. I know it is a political season--\nPresidential campaigns, Senate races, and congressional. I still \nmaintain, as I always have, that the best politics is results. Get \nthings done for the people. There is plenty of credit to go around.\n  If we stand here and find a way to question each other's motives and \nblock and obstruct and confuse, we are going to pay a price as an \ninstitution. I worry about that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/13/senate-section/article/S7951-3", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7951-S7952]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, on the Select Committee on Intelligence \nreport, I emphasize again, this was a unanimous bipartisan vote. There \nare problems with the intelligence community. We did not get what we \nneeded before we went to war in Iraq. It was flawed and misleading and \ninaccurate. We should acknowledge that. But all the effort that is \ngoing on now to find a way to fix political blame is a mistake. We \nshould be working together to produce results. That is why I am working \nwith Senator Feinstein of California on some proposals. That is why I \nam working with Senator Wyden on some proposals.\n  We have 1 minute remaining?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am happy to not object, but Senator \nLautenberg was on the floor this morning and asked for an additional 5 \nminutes, and it was objected to.\n  Mr. LOTT. I think I have 1 minute left.\n  Mr. REID. I was just waiting for an opportunity to say what I just \nsaid.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we need to find a way to deal with the \nproblem.\n  The point I want to make is, Congress is now like somebody that has \nbeen at the scene of an accident. We saw it happen, but now we are \npretending we weren't there. Congress is a part of this problem. For 20 \nyears we have underfunded, we have limited human intelligence. We have \nimproperly funded the intelligence community. We have allowed a \nsituation where 80 percent of the money for the intelligence community \nis under the Department of Defense, not the CIA.\n  Let me give some numbers. During the 1990s, the number of CIA \nstations declined by 30 percent. The number of agents declined by 40 \npercent. The volume of intelligence reports decreased by 50 percent.\n  The intelligence community connected the dots, and got it wrong. It \nwas not just our intelligence community that got it wrong--there was a \nglobal breakdown in intelligence analysis. The report is not an \nindictment of the hard-working and dedicated men and women who put \ntheir lives on the line, and are charged with connecting the dots. It \nis a criticism of the process and community at large, and demonstrative \nof a lack of leadership, oversight, and insufficient investment.\n  The breakdown in intelligence capability evolved over several years. \nIt was recognized in 1976 by a 5-volume report by the Church committee. \nOur intelligence gathering and analysis capability--especially human \nintelligence and linguists--was gutted in the 20 years that followed, \nparticularly in the 1990s, when the Congress did not adequately fund \nthe intelligence community.\n  President Clinton relied on this same analysis of the Iraqi threat \nwhen he signed the Iraqi Liberation Act. The Congress relied on this \nsame intelligence when we passed several resolutions regarding Iraq; \nPresident Bush relied on this intelligence when making his decisions as \nwell. Many have asked whether I want to change my vote given today's \nassessment of pre-war intelligence--I do not.\n  Saddam Hussein was a mass murderer who used weapons of mass \ndestruction on his own people; supported terrorism and trained \nterrorists; provided ``bonuses'' to the families of terrorists; a \ndestabilizing factor in the Mideast.\n  Let's not play armchair quarterback by asking ``what would have \nhappened if.'' The country would be much better served if the Congress \nand the President took action as soon as possible to fix the \norganization, leadership, and oversight problems that we have with our \nintelligence community.\n  When the American people read the Intelligence Committee's report, \nthey will see some fundamental things that need to be changed in the \nintelligence community. First and foremost it is evident that the \nDirector of Central Intelligence does not really control all aspects of \nthe intelligence community. In fact, as I have said, 80 percent of \nintelligence dollars go to the Department of Defense, not the CIA. \nMoreover, many of people that lead the 15 agencies that comprise the \nintelligence community work for the Department of Defense, not the \nDirector of Central Intelligence.\n\n[[Page S7952]]\n\n  To fix this problem, Senator Feinstein and I are about to propose \nlegislation that will establish a Director of National Intelligence--or \nDNI. The DNI will be a Cabinet-level position that will lead the \nintelligence community, and be responsible for aggregating intelligence \nfor the President.\n  As for the specific processes that cry out for reform, the report \nfocuses on two in particular. One, layering of uncertain conclusions--\njudgments were layered upon other judgments, and specific concerns and \nuncertainties were simply lost; two, group think--because we knew \nSaddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, and used them on his \npeople, any data that appeared to support this continued behavior was \nviewed favorably, and dissenting data was discounted or underreported.\n  Those ``process'' types of deficiencies quickly lead one to ask: How \ncan the intelligence community provide better oversight and supervision \nof ``expert'' analysts; and how can the Congress provide more effective \noversight of the intelligence community? There are clearly process \nreforms needed within the intelligence community, and Congress's \noversight of that community.\n  I know that Chairman Roberts and Vice Chairman Rockefeller, are very \nconcerned that our intelligence community is broken, and are committed \nto taking action in the coming weeks and month to address many of the \nmost critical deficiencies.\n  With particular regard to congressional oversight, I believe that \nthere are some fundamental things that need to be changed such as term \nlimits of committee members. Currently, members can only serve on the \nSenate Intelligence Committee for 8 years. That means that when they \nknow enough to be conversant in the intelligence business, they need to \nrotate off of the committee. We need intelligence committee members who \ncan speak the lingo and understand the processes. Consequently, term \nlimits need to be eliminated.\n  Also, the jurisdiction of the Intelligence Committee regarding \nclassified matter is sometimes muddied due to overlap with the Armed \nServices Committee. I submit that a simplified approach to jurisdiction \ncould enhance oversight and accountability.\n  The process of document classification and redaction also needs to be \nreviewed. When the Intelligence Committee first prepared this report, \nthe CIA recommended that about half of it be redacted. I understand the \nneed to protect the names of sources and intelligence methods. But I \ncan tell you that most of those redactions were not of that nature; \nthey were everyday, unclassified words.\n  The report you see today is less than 20 percent redacted, and the \nIntelligence Committee is still working with the CIA to release more of \nthe report.\n  Notwithstanding, it is my belief that in matters such as these, the \nCIA is too close to the intelligence process to provide an objective \nview of what really needs to be classified. Consequently, I am working \nwith Senator Wyden to propose legislation that will establish a small \nindependent group under the President that will review documents such \nas this report to ensure that classification decisions are independent \nand objective. In addition, I urge the President to nominate as soon as \npossible a candidate to serve as the Director for Central Intelligence.\n  This is a critical time of this Nation as we fight the global war on \nterrorism, and we need to have effective leadership in-place at the CIA \nas soon as possible. As we make progress in fixing the intelligence \ncommunity, I repeat my call to both sides of the aisle to not \npoliticize the issues or the prospective remedies. We owe it to the \nAmerican people and to the members of the intelligence community to fix \nthe fundamental problems outlined in this report, and create an \nintelligence community that can best serve the national security \ninterests of the United States.\n  We are part of the problem. Let's find the solution.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/13/senate-section/article/S7952-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7952]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I take this opportunity, before we \ncontinue with the debate, to talk about how important it is that we \ndebate in an earnest and sincere way the issue of marriage. Marriage \ndoes matter. It is important to the American people.\n  We heard earlier comments about how bringing up issues such as class \naction lawsuits, the marriage amendment, and trade were just wasting \nthe Congress's time. Yet the other side doesn't think it is a waste of \ntime to raise taxes, to increase more laws so we have fewer and fewer \nrights, to restrict the free enterprise system, and in a sense create \nmore government.\n  In the debate on marriage, we are trying to accomplish a number of \nthings. No. 1, we want to define marriage as the union of a man and a \nwoman. No. 2, we want to restrict the action of the court's ability to \ndefine marriage. Then, No. 3--and perhaps the most important part of \nthis debate--we want to give the American people an opportunity to \ndebate this through their elected representatives in the Congress here \nand in the State legislatures.\n  It has been a grassroots type of process from the bottom up. We have \nheard a lot of concerns from people all over America about the way the \ncourts are dealing with the issue of marriage and their frustrations in \nnot being able to address this issue.\n  We heard a lot of good comments from some of my colleagues yesterday \nin debating the marriage amendment. In favor, we have had Senators \nHatch, Santorum, Smith, Frist, Bunning, Kyl, Cornyn, Sessions, Lott, \nand Brownback--all explaining why it is important that we move forward \nin passing this amendment.\n  We have heard pretty much procedural arguments from the other side. \nOur side was talking about their concern about losing the institution \nof marriage, that it is basically a fundamental building block of \nsociety, and if we want democracies such as the United States to \nsurvive, we need to have good, functioning families. If families do \nwell, children do well. We will hear more about that today. Then we \nwill hear about the democratic process in which we allow American \ncitizens to participate. This is the essence of what we were talking \nabout yesterday and the inevitability of what is going to happen \nthrough our courts, that there is a master plan out there from those \nwho want to destroy the institution of marriage to, first, begin to \ntake this issue to a few select courts throughout this country at the \nState level.\n  We begin to see this in States such as Vermont and Massachusetts and \na number of other States, and then proceed up through the States; and \nonce they get favorable rulings from a few courts that are dominated \npretty much by activist judges and judges who want to ignore the \ntradition of marriage for thousands of years, and want to bypass the \nlegislative process--then once they have established their basis, they \nwant to take it to the Federal courts, and they will eventually move it \nto the Supreme Court.\n  We heard arguments yesterday about how Members of this Congress and \nconstitutional scholars believe that the Supreme Court--if it reaches \nthe Supreme Court--by a very slim majority is probably prone to rule in \na way that would eliminate the traditional family as we know it.\n  So this is an important issue. It is a very timely issue. We have 46 \nStates that have individuals living in them--at least 46--who have \nsame-sex marriage licenses. They have been granted them as a couple \nthrough either Massachusetts or Oregon or California. We\n\n[[Page S7953]]\n\nhave 11 States that have had court cases filed in them today. So the \nplatform for action from those who favor same-sex marriages has been \nwell established.\n  Now, in reaction to that, we have some 48 States that have laws they \nhave passed supporting traditional marriage--that being a union between \na man and a woman. At least 10 States have constitutional amendments on \nthe ballot. We have at least 3 States still gathering petitions. So \nmore than 20 percent of the States have constitutional amendments that \nwill be pending before them as we move into the election cycle.\n  Mr. President, I am sympathetic to this idea of federalism. I am \nsympathetic to the idea that we need to protect the definition of the \ntraditional family. Federalism does not demand that we redefine the \nfamily. More important, it does not demand that we stand idly by while \nthe courts redefine marriage for us, without giving us an opportunity \nto act.\n  This is an important issue, and it is very timely that we have this \ndebate today in the Senate, a debate in which we try to define marriage \nand limit the rule of the Federal court and we allow States, through a \ndemocratic process, to proceed as they see fit toward providing \nbenefits through civil unions or domestic partnerships. Marriage simply \nshould not be left to the courts alone.\n  In my view, a large majority of Americans are with us. Marriage \nmatters. It matters to children and it is a societal building block.\n  I had an opportunity to review the testimony of Governor Romney from \nMassachusetts. I ask unanimous consent that his testimony be printed in \nthe Record as it was presented to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     Testimony of Hon. Mitt Romney\n\n       Chairman Hatch, Senator Leahy, Senator Kennedy, \n     distinguished members of the committee, thank you for \n     inviting me to testify today.\n       As you all know, last November a divided Massachusetts \n     Supreme Judicial Court reformulated the definition of \n     marriage according to their interpretation of the \n     Massachusetts Constitution.\n       As I am sure you also know, I believe that decision was \n     wrong. Marriage is not ``an evolving paradigm,'' as the Court \n     said, but is a fundamental and universal social institution \n     that bears a real and substantial relation to the public \n     health, safety, morals, and general welfare of all of the \n     people of Massachusetts.\n       The Court said that the traditional idea of marriage ``is \n     rooted in persistent prejudices'' and ``works a deep and \n     scarring hardship on a very real segment of the community for \n     no rational reason.'' Marriage is ``a caste-like system,'' \n     added the concurrence, defended by nothing more than a \n     ``mantra of tradition.''\n       And so the Court simply redefined marriage, and, based on \n     their reading of the Massachusetts Constitution, declared \n     that ``the right to marry means little if it does not include \n     the right to marry the person of one's choice.''\n       This is no minor change, or slight adjustment. It is a \n     fundamental break with all of our laws, experiences and \n     traditions.\n       When some in the state Senate asked whether a ``civil \n     unions'' bill would satisfy the ruling, the Court rejected \n     the alternative, writing that traditional marriage amounts to \n     ``invidious discrimination'' and that ``no amount of \n     tinkering would remove that stain.''\n       In response, our legislature proposed a constitutional \n     amendment that ``only the union of one man and one woman \n     shall be valid or recognized as a marriage in \n     Massachusetts,'' and establishing civil unions for same-sex \n     couples. While I do not think civil unions should be written \n     into the constitution, the main and laudable effect of the \n     amendment would be to overturn the Court's decision.\n       This was the first step in the legitimate process, by which \n     the representatives of the people turn to the sovereign \n     people to decide this momentous issue. But it takes time to \n     amend the constitution in Massachusetts. The legislature must \n     pass this amendment again, and then it would be submitted to \n     the people for consideration.\n       Because it will take time to follow the process of \n     constitutional amendment in the Commonwealth, I asked the \n     Massachusetts Attorney General to call for the Court to \n     withhold their pronouncement until the people could consider \n     the question, so that they would not be excluded from a \n     decision as fundamental to our societal well-being as the \n     definition of marriage. He declined to do so.\n       Several last minute challenges to the decision were also \n     summarily rejected.\n       So, as a result, on May 17, the Commonwealth of \n     Massachusetts began issuing marriage licenses to persons of \n     the same sex. These licenses are valid for up to 60 days and \n     are filed with the State Department of Public Health two \n     months after a marriage has taken place. Therefore, we do not \n     have official statistics and information yet from our \n     Department of Public Health. However, the Boston Globe \n     recently surveyed the 351 cities and towns in Massachusetts \n     and the results of their survey do provide some information \n     on the activity since May 17.\n       According to the Globe, in the first week that the issuance \n     of marriage licenses to same-sex couples became legal, over \n     2,400 such licenses were issued. The vast majority of these \n     licenses were issued to Massachusetts residents, because our \n     state does have a law which prohibits couples from entering \n     into valid marriages in Massachusetts if there is an \n     impediment to marriage in their home state. Applicants are \n     required to sign a form signifying their intent to reside in \n     Massachusetts in order to receive a license.\n       Originally, we were aware of six communities where the \n     clerks refused to honor that law. The Globe reports that at \n     least 164 out-of-state couples, from 27 states and \n     Washington, DC, were issued licenses by these clerks. 56 of \n     those couples specified on their application that they do not \n     intend to move to Massachusetts. For those couples whose \n     unions would not be recognized in their home state, according \n     to Massachusetts law, their marriage is null and void.\n       At my request, the Attorney General directed the city and \n     town clerks to comply with the existing Massachusetts law, \n     and it is my understanding that currently, all the cities and \n     towns are in compliance. Legislation is pending in the \n     Massachusetts legislature which would repeal this residency \n     law and, although it has passed the Senate, it doesn't appear \n     likely to pass the House in the short period remaining before \n     adjournment.\n       Nevertheless, other actions are underway to eliminate the \n     residency requirement. Two suits have been filed against this \n     law, one from a dozen Massachusetts towns and another from \n     several same-sex couples from Maine, New Hampshire, New York, \n     Rhode Island and Connecticut. The couples argue that this new \n     right is so powerful that denying it to non-residents \n     violates the Massachusetts constitution, as well as the \n     Privileges and Immunities Clause of the U.S. Constitution.\n       With the inauguration of same-sex marriages, a plethora of \n     legal and regulatory issues are now arising. Although we will \n     eventually be able to sort these issues out, it will take \n     time. And, more importantly, we must move through many of \n     these issues without the benefit of adequate time for full \n     consideration of all the impacts. I expect that we will \n     continue to see new issues arising for the foreseeable future \n     as the Commonwealth struggles to understand all the changes \n     that will now be sought due to this judicial ruling.\n       A number of the issues we are now reviewing relate to state \n     benefits. In some cases, we have been in contact with the \n     federal government to understand their position on the \n     eligibility for benefits that are provided by the state but \n     funded by the federal government. For example, we have been \n     told that we cannot use federal funds to provide meals for an \n     elderly same-sex spouse if the person's eligibility for the \n     services is due to their spousal status. We have not heard \n     yet from the Veterans Administration as to whether we can \n     bury two same-sex spouses at our state Veterans cemeteries. \n     Medicaid is a particularly interesting situation. Under our \n     state laws, we use federal income eligibility guidelines. In \n     this case, since the marriage is not recognized by the \n     federal government, the person will be deemed eligible for \n     Medicaid based on their individual income, not their two-\n     spouse income. And, CMS has confirmed that federal matching \n     funds will be available in this instance. However, if the \n     person is eligible for Medicaid due to their spousal \n     relationship, federal matching funds cannot be used since the \n     federal government does not recognize the marriage. \n     Similarly, CMS has notified us that federal transfer of asset \n     rules regarding spouses will not apply, nor will spousal \n     impoverishment provisions apply, to same sex spouses.\n       There are other very troubling issues. We now must consider \n     whether to amend our birth registration process, which \n     currently requires the name of a mother and a father. Should \n     we change our birth registration document to read ``Parent \n     A'' and ``Parent B''? What impact would this have on child \n     support enforcement, considering that birth certificates are \n     a critical tool that are used to find and force absentee \n     fathers to provide child support.\n       A number of legal issues are expected related to divorce \n     and inheritance rights, particularly regarding those couples \n     who move out of Massachusetts to states where their marriage \n     is not recognized. The private sector is also beginning to \n     grapple with ramifications of this change. We have been told \n     anecdotally that some companies may be dropping domestic \n     partnership benefits now that same-sex couples can wed, thus \n     eliminating a benefit that was available in the past. Pension \n     issues are also expected to arise, particularly for surviving \n     spouses who do not meet the requirement for number of years \n     married when marriage was not legal prior to May 17.\n       These issues will not be confined to Massachusetts alone. \n     Our state's borders are porous. Citizens of our state will \n     travel and may face sickness and injury in other states. In \n     those cases, their spousal relationship may not be \n     recognized, and it would be likely that litigation would \n     result. Massachusetts residents will move to other states, \n     and\n\n[[Page S7954]]\n\n     thus issues related to property rights, employer benefits, \n     inheritance, and many others will arise. It is not possible \n     for the issue to remain solely a Massachusetts issue; it must \n     now be confronted on a national basis.\n       We need an amendment that restores and protects our \n     societal definition of marriage, blocks judges from changing \n     that definition and then, consistent with the principles of \n     federalism, leaves other policy issues regarding marriage to \n     state legislatures.\n       The real threat to the states is not the constitutional \n     amendment process, in which the states participate, but \n     activist judges who disregard the law and redefine marriage \n     in order to impose their will on the states, and on the whole \n     nation.\n       At this point, the only way to reestablish the status quo \n     ante is to preserve the definition of marriage in the federal \n     constitution before courts redefine it out of existence.\n       Congress has been gathering evidence and considering \n     testimony about the need for a constitutional amendment to \n     protect marriage. The time fast approaches for debate, and \n     then decision.\n       The decision you will make will determine whether the \n     American people will be allowed to have a say in this matter, \n     or whether the courts will decide this matter for them.\n       At the heart of American democracy is the principle that \n     the most fundamental decisions in society should ultimately \n     be decided by the people themselves. Surely the definition of \n     society's core institution, marriage, is such a decision.\n       Let me conclude with this point: Despite the warning signs, \n     the Massachusetts Legislation hesitated, and refused to act. \n     But the court had no such reluctance, and acted decisively. \n     Now on the defensive, the legislature has begun the long and \n     difficult process of amending the Constitution to undo what \n     the Court has done. But it may soon be too late.\n       This is what happened in Massachusetts. It is in your hands \n     to determine whether or not this will be the fate of the \n     nation.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, if you read carefully through his \ntestimony, he talks about the fundamental change that is happening in \nMassachusetts and many of the issues that he as a Governor in a State \nthat has a court that actually went contrary to the wishes of the \nlegislature to redefine marriage as something different than a union of \na man and a woman. He talked about the effect that this redefinition is \nhaving on such basic programs as meals for the elderly and veterans and \nspousal benefits, burial rights, Medicaid, birth registration process, \nchild support enforcement, inheritance, private sector, how employees \nare struggling with this particular issue. He makes a very important \npoint that States are porous. So what is going on in Massachusetts has \nthe potential to have an impact on other States, particularly if this \ngets to the U.S. Supreme Court, or we find the U.S. Supreme Court \ndeciding to overrule DOMA, the Defense of Marriage Act, and decide that \nsomehow or other it is unconstitutional.\n  Many of us have looked at what has happened in other countries where \nthey have liberalized the marriage laws, particularly the Scandinavian \ncountries and the Netherlands. In the Scandinavian countries, for \nexample, for a number of years they have recognized same-sex marriage. \nAs a result of that, there has been a very disturbing trend in that \nmore and more children are born out of wedlock. In fact, if you look at \nthe figures today in some of the Scandinavian countries, well over 50 \npercent of their children are born out of wedlock. We looked, more \nrecently, at what has happened to the Netherlands--a country which \ntraditionally, before 5 years ago, had a very strong record as far as \nchildren being born in wedlock, a country that promoted the idea of \ntraditional marriage. But they have changed; they changed the \ndefinition of marriage, and they allow same-sex marriage. They are \nseeing that now there is an alarming increase in the number of children \nthat are born out of wedlock.\n  We are faced with a challenge from the courts that will fundamentally \nchange this society in America if the Congress does not act. We heard \narguments yesterday about the Goodridge case in Massachusetts and \nLawrence v. Texas, using the privacy issue, combined with the good \nfaith and credit laws of the Constitution, and how the courts are \nsetting the groundwork to overturn what traditional marriage means in \nthe United States.\n  So it is very appropriate that we have this debate now. It is very \nappropriate that we have a full debate. I have been rather disappointed \nthat we have not had more actual debate on the meaning of marriage from \nthe other side. We have had debate about procedure, and I think there \nis a frustration about procedure. But I want the American people to \nunderstand that there is a fundamental difference between the way \nRepublicans do business and the Democrats do business. We believe in a \nbottom-up approach. So we work for a consensus. I spent a long time at \nthe very start of this process looking at a number of proposals on how \nwe are going to amend the Constitution, working with grassroots groups \nand with my colleagues, and working with constitutional scholars.\n  We eventually came up with a conclusion, with the Judiciary Committee \nputting the final touches on the amendment, that the kind of language \nwe need is what is now embodied in the amendment that is up before the \nSenate today for debate. This is where we developed the consensus. When \nyou develop a consensus, that doesn't mean other ideas cannot come \nforward. As we strive, then, the next step is to strive for consensus \non the Senate floor. I have been working personally with Senator Gordon \nSmith from Oregon. He and I have been working together to strive for \nconsensus.\n\n  So this idea that all of a sudden we would just deal with the first \nsentence in this amendment is not anything that is an unexpected result \non this side because we recognize that perhaps maybe we cannot get an \nideal amendment to move forward, perhaps maybe we have to work toward \nanother version of the amendment that I have introduced that would \nallow for us to establish a consensus on the Senate floor.\n  That is where Senator Smith has come in with his proposal, and \nactually he does it at the request of myself and other Members of the \nSenate because we are working for a consensus. That is what the Senate \nis all about. So I hope that we can get serious participation from the \nother side in the debate on this floor; we do have a number of Senators \non the Republican side who want to continue to talk about how important \nmarriage is.\n  So my hope is that we can move forward in a civilized and thoughtful \nmanner on how important traditional marriage is to America, and to give \nthe American people an opportunity to participate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am glad to hear Senator Allard say he \nwelcomes the debate because that is the reason I came to the Senate \nfloor today: to debate this issue. As someone who has been married 42 \nyears, as a Democratic woman, I believe I can talk about marriage and \nwhat we need to do to strengthen marriage.\n  Unfortunately, there is not one item on the table here that \nstrengthens marriage and helps people stay married, that helps the \nfamily, and that is going to be part of what I talk about.\n  It is interesting that Senator Allard said there is a great \ndifference between Republicans and Democrats on this issue. I beg to \ndiffer with him. You cannot say you stand and speak for all Republicans \ntoday. In the ``Roll Call,'' it says:\n\n       True Conservatives Oppose the Federal Marriage Amendment.\n\n  George Will:\n\n       Amending the Constitution to define marriage as between a \n     man and a woman would be unwise for two reasons. \n     Constitutionalizing social policy is generally a misuse of \n     fundamental law. And it would be especially imprudent to end \n     state responsibility for marriage law at a moment when we \n     require evidence of the sort that can be generated by \n     allowing the states to be laboratories of social policy.\n\n  That is George Will, a Republican syndicated conservative columnist.\n  Then we have Lynne Cheney, wife of Dick Cheney, a Republican:\n\n       I thought that the formula [Dick Cheney] used in 2000 was \n     very good. First of all, to be clear that people should be \n     free to enter into their relationships that they choose. And, \n     secondly, to recognize what's historically been the \n     situation, that when it comes to conferring legal status on \n     relationships, that is a matter left to the states.\n\n  That is none other than Lynne Cheney, the wife of the Republican Vice \nPresident, a Republican herself and conservative.\n  Then there is Bob Barr, former Congressman from Georgia and author of \nthe Defense of Marriage Act:\n\n       Marriage is a quintessential state issue. The Defense of \n     Marriage Act goes as far as is necessary in codifying the \n     federal legal status and parameters of marriage. A \n     constitutional amendment is both unnecessary and needlessly \n     intrusive and punitive.\n\n\n[[Page S7955]]\n\n\n  Bob Barr.\n  Senator Alan Simpson, a former Senator from Wyoming, Republican \nconservative:\n\n       A federal amendment to define marriage would do nothing to \n     strengthen families--just the opposite. And it would \n     unnecessarily undermine one of the core principles I have \n     always believed the GOP stood for: federalism.\n\n  That is Alan Simpson, a former Republican Senator.\n  Then Lyn Nofziger, former White House Press Secretary and assistant \nto President Ronald Reagan, a Republican:\n\n       There are two kind of amendments. One kind would give the \n     federal government more authority, usually at the expense of \n     the states, and broaden its intrusions into the lives of its \n     citizens. These include--\n\n  And he lists the ones with which he disagrees, with which I do not \nagree. He says the equal rights amendment would do that. He also says \nthat proposals to ban same-sex marriage and abortion would violate \nfederalism.\n\n  He says:\n\n       I favor neither of the latter two but I oppose \n     constitutional amendments that would ban them.\n\n  In other words, he agrees that gay marriage is not what he supports, \nbut he does not believe in this constitutional amendment.\n  Mr. President, I say to Members of the Senate and anyone else \nlistening to the debate, let's be clear, when the manager stood up and \nsaid Republicans and Democrats have a different approach, he forgot \nabout a few Republicans who do not agree with him: George Will, Lynne \nCheney, Bob Barr, Alan Simpson, and Lyn Nofziger. And by the way, quite \na few on his side of the aisle stated they do not support the \namendment. Let's be clear here, this is not a question of Republicans \nversus Democrats.\n  After today, we have 27 legislative days until adjournment--27 \nlegislative days to deal with the most pressing issues of the country.\n  There were three developments around here in the last few days that \nunderscore the work we should be doing right now.\n  First, we were all summoned to the secret briefing room here in the \nCapitol and told we were under the threat of attack from al-Qaida \nbetween now and election day. Why is it that I can tell you this if it \nwas secret? Because it has been all over. Immediately from that room \ncame Tom Ridge, the head of the Department of Homeland Security, to a \npress conference to announce this threat. This is serious. Let's put up \nwhat Tom Ridge said so my colleagues can see it for themselves:\n\n       Credible reporting now indicates that al-Qaeda is moving \n     forward with its plans to carry out a large-scale attack in \n     the United States in an effort to disrupt our democratic \n     process.\n\n  July 8, 2004.\n  I have a question to my colleagues in the Senate and to all Americans \nwho may be listening to this debate: What is more important to you, \nwhat is more a threat to you--al-Qaida moving forward with its plans to \ncarry out a large-scale attack in America to disrupt our democratic \nprocess or two people who happen to be of the same gender moving in \ntogether down your street?\n  Let us be honest. However we feel about gay marriage or civil unions \nor domestic partnerships, however we feel on those matters, what is \nmore of a threat to you and your family? You need to ask that question, \nput aside politics, and whatever answer you come up with, I have to \nbelieve most would say al-Qaida, not Mary and Carol or Jim and Carl, \nbut al-Qaida, people whose names we do not know.\n  That is the first thing that happened last week. What else happened. \nA new report was released showing that the intelligence of our country \nis in disarray, intelligence we relied upon, intelligence that was used \nto make the case for war where more than 800 of our beautiful Americans \nare dead and 5,000 or more of them are injured, some without legs, some \nwithout arms, some who will never be the same, most of whom will never \nbe the same.\n  What is more important to America today? Fixing the intelligence \nproblem--we do not even have a head of the CIA; maybe it is time we \nthought about getting someone to be permanently in charge--or worrying \nabout two people of the same gender who move in together down your \nstreet? I believe you need to ask yourself that question as you watch \nus in the Senate in this debate: What is more important to you, to your \nfamily, to your security, to your children?\n\n  Some of you are worried about a draft; you are very worried about a \ndraft. What is more important--fixing our intelligence, making sure al-\nQaida cells are drummed out of this country?\n  By the way, I looked at reports from this administration 30 days \nafter 9/11, and do you know what they told us? Al-Qaida was in 45 \ncountries, including America. Not one cell was in Iraq. Instead of \ngoing after al-Qaida, we turned around and went into Iraq based on \nfaulty information.\n  Our people are dead and dying to this minute, to this day, to this \nmoment. I visit them at Walter Reed, and I see the damage done. There \nare many Californians. I pay tribute to every one of those brave, \nunbelievably patriotic, caring members of the armed services who have \ngiven their lives with honor, deep honor when your Commander in Chief \nasks you to sacrifice yourselves for a decision he has made. You are \nhonorable. And, no, you did not die in vain when your Commander in \nChief asked you to go. Of course not.\n  I ask you, with our people dying every day, with the intelligence \nfailures we have seen--and by the way, in my opinion, not only was the \nintelligence wrong, not only was it misused, not only was it \nmisinterpreted, it appears to me there was pressure brought to bear to \nskew that intelligence, and that is the next phase of our inquiry that \nwe will go into.\n  What kind of pressure was put on people to come up with an opinion? \nHow does that relate to all of this? Because we are not talking about \nways to stop al-Qaida. We are not talking about ways to fix our \nintelligence. We are talking about amending the Constitution of the \nUnited States, which is a very serious thing to do. It has hardly been \ndone in the history of our Nation. Our forefathers were brilliant about \nmaking a constitution that is so flexible that we do not have to amend \nit every other day, but that is what we are doing about two people of \nthe same gender who may want to care about each other. That is what we \nare doing today. That is what we did yesterday. That is what we did \nFriday. That is what we will do tomorrow. If the Senate proceeds, that \nis what we will do for the immediate future.\n  I hope the Senate will not proceed to it with all that we have to do.\n  There is a third thing that happened. In addition to being warned by \nTom Ridge, in addition to being told by a bipartisan committee that our \nintelligence is in disarray in this country, there is something else \nnew. We have news yesterday that discussions are being held within this \nadministration about whether and how to possibly postpone elections if \nthere is an attack on election day or in and around election day.\n  To this Senator, to even consider postponing our elections, the most \nardent symbol of American democracy, because of terrorist threats is \nnothing more than allowing the fear that they bring to rule this \ncountry. This country is too strong for that. This country is too great \nfor that. With our men and women overseas, literally dying for the \nrights of other people to vote, how could we even consider postponing \nthe election?\n  If this administration is so concerned about the possibility of \nterrorist attacks--and to listen to them and to read this clearly they \nare--and if they are even seriously thinking of disrupting the \ncenterpiece of American democracy, then our priority in the Senate and \nin the administration should be how to best defend against those \nattacks, not how to close polling places. Talk about misplaced \npriorities. It is worse than Alice in Wonderland. One has to pinch \nthemselves, in light of all that we know, that we are more worried as a \nSenate about two people of the same gender caring about each other \nwanting to visit each other in the hospital than we are about these \nunbelievable threats that are facing our Nation, and we are not doing \nanything about that.\n  Let me tell the American people who may be listening, as well as my \ncolleagues, what is not being done to make them safer. We do not yet \nhave a port security bill which has been voted\n\n[[Page S7956]]\n\nin a unanimous fashion out of the Commerce Committee. It would create \ncommand and control centers to improve security at America's ports. \nThere has been no action by the full Senate.\n  My understanding is the bill was going to be brought here and there \nwere difficulties with it on the other side of the aisle; the \nRepublicans did not want to bring it up. Rail security, another bill \nvoted unanimously out of the Commerce Committee, on which I serve, \nagain there has been no action by the full Senate.\n  I have to say, in every report one reads Madrid is mentioned. The \nrail security problems are major.\n  So here we have a port security bill that unanimously came out of the \ncommittee, a rail security bill that unanimously came out of the \ncommittee, and those on the other side, the Republicans, are objecting \nto bringing those bills forward.\n\n  Transit security, $5 billion over the next 3 years to improve \nsecurity on local transit systems approved by the Banking Committee in \nMay, and there has been no action by the full Senate. Nuclear plant \nsecurity, a bill to assess threats to and require improvements at \nnuclear facilities approved by another committee that I sit on, the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, there has been no action by the \nfull Senate. Chemical plant security, a bill to require chemical \nfacilities to have and implement a new security plan to protect against \nterrorist attacks approved again by the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee October 2003, no action by the full Senate.\n  Airline security, the administration is cutting the number of air \nmarshals. I had the privilege of writing the language in the air \nsecurity bill that we passed after 9/11 to put air marshals on high-\nrisk flights. What do we see? Cutting back on air marshals, not \ntraining enough pilots for the Federal flight deck officer program that \nallows for pilots to carry a weapon in the cockpit if he or she is \ntrained as a sky marshal. The administration is not moving forward with \nthat at all. They are slow-walking it. They have approved only a few \npilots.\n  What about the threat of shoulder-fired missiles? I have been working \non that with Chuck Schumer, Steve Israel, and others. They are slow-\nwalking these countermeasures. We know there are tens of thousands of \nshoulder-fired missiles. Terrorist groups have them. They can buy them \nfor very little money on the black market. We know that aircraft have \nbeen shot at and shot down. What are we doing about it? Again, slow-\nwalking this.\n  While Air Force One is protected when the President travels, he has \ncountermeasures on that plane, and I fully support it and thank \ngoodness we have it, but if we can do it there--and in Israel they can \nprotect their commercial airlines--why can we not do it here? I will \ntell my colleagues the reason. The other side does not want to bring up \nthese issues. They want to worry about two people of the same gender \ncaring about each other and they are going to make a whole deal over \nthis for days and days.\n  We have been warned over and over again. The FBI warned us a long \ntime ago about the threat of shoulder-fired missiles. They are slow-\nwalking that. They are holding the port security bill at the desk, the \nrail security bill at the desk, the transit security bill at the desk, \nthe nuclear plant security bill at the desk, the chemical plant \nsecurity bill is being held at the desk.\n  How about the COPS Program? We all supported that. We want to put \n50,000 more cops on the beat. We put 100,000--and I see my colleague, \nthe senior Senator from California, and I know about the great work \nthat committee did on the COPS Program. But, oh, no, the Bush budget \nrequest cuts the COPS program by 87 percent and no new hires.\n  So now we see why the Republicans want to talk about gay marriage. \nThey cannot point to anything they have done in the past to make us \nsafer.\n  Firefighters, the Bush budget cuts firefighter assistance by one-\nthird and provides no funding for the SAFER Act to hire 75,000 new \nfirefighters.\n  We all remember the heroes after 9/11 and how everyone, Republican \nand Democrat, rallied around our firefighters. The cynicism around this \nplace is unbelievable.\n  First responders, the bill to provide FEMA assistance to local first \nresponders was approved by the EPW Committee in July of 2003. There has \nbeen no action by the full Senate.\n  So I have shown--and I have not even gone into them in great detail--\nwhat we ought to be doing if our focus is defending our homeland.\n  It seems we do not have any problem focusing our resources abroad, \ntrying to bring democracy to others while this administration seems \ncompletely at a loss on how to protect us at home. It is extraordinary \nto me. To come out to a microphone and say to the American people, look \nat these threats, here are Tom Ridge's own words:\n\n       Credible reporting now indicates that al-Qaida is moving \n     forward with its plans to carry out a large-scale attack in \n     the United States in an effort to disrupt our Democratic \n     process.\n\n  We then hear proposals discussed on how to delay the elections. This \nis pretty clear. But any leader who gives you this, and then doesn't \nstep to the microphone and say: And, American people, we know how to \nprotect you; we know how to make our ports safer; we know how to make \nour railroads safer; we know how to protect you against a guerrilla \nattack against a nuclear powerplant--oh, no, they give out iodine \npills. That is what they do in this administration. They send iodine \npills to people who live within 100 miles of a plant so they can be \n``protected'' from cancer. It is extraordinary to me.\n  The other thing they do is they hold press conferences on the war in \nIraq. Then they say it is going to get worse before it gets better. I \ndon't understand that kind of leadership. Maybe I am old fashioned, but \nI think leadership is about seeing a problem and fixing it to the best \nof your ability--laying out the plans on how you are going to fix it. \nIf you do not do that, you fail the test of leadership.\n  We need to be stronger at home. We need to be respected abroad. \nSenator Kerry and Senator Edwards are taking that message across this \ncountry. What I am trying to say today is that message is real.\n  I am saying there are many things we can do. I have just laid out 10 \nthings we should be doing now instead of worrying about two people of \nthe same gender moving down the street who happen to care about each \nother. But all we hear about is the fear part, and no plan. Remember \nhow we had no plan for Iraq, except the military plan which was \nbrilliantly executed, but then there was nothing after it? We have no \nplan to protect our homeland.\n  It is time to stop the fear mongering like this, unless you are going \nto say what we are doing to make us safer and carry it out. We have to \nstart protecting our people, our homeland, and our democracy at home. \nBut, again, what does the administration want to do? A constitutional \namendment to prohibit gay marriage. A constitutional amendment that \nwill deny--and make no mistake about it--millions of Americans equal \nrights because even if it doesn't say so explicitly, it will mean that \nthose in domestic partnerships or in civil unions--which I strongly \nsupport--will not get equal rights or equal responsibilities.\n  Let's be clear. The authors of this amendment say it has nothing to \ndo with domestic partnerships or civil unions; those are fine.\n  No. I will have later in my statement the lawyers who tell us that, \nin fact, it will be impossible for domestic partners or civil unions to \nreceive anywhere near the same rights or responsibilities as married \ncouples. This constitutional amendment, if it passes, would guarantee \nlegal challenges to civil unions and domestic partnerships, as I said. \nThat is David Reeves, a partner and legal expert at a well-respected \nlaw firm here in Washington.\n  How about the American Bar Association? They say:\n\n       The language of the constitutional amendment is so vague \n     that the amendment could be interpreted to ban civil unions \n     and domestic partnerships and the benefits that come with \n     them.\n\n  So be clear what you are doing. Even if you oppose marriage between \npeople of the same gender, if you support civil unions or domestic \npartnerships, you are condemning them because they will not be able to \nhave the same benefits. This constitutional amendment is divisive to \nthis country. It even divided Lynne Cheney from Dick Cheney. Let's\n\n[[Page S7957]]\n\njust look at what Dick Cheney said before he changed his mind in this \nelection year. This is the statement that now his wife supports:\n\n       The fact of the matter is we live in a free society and \n     freedom means freedom for everybody. And I think that means \n     that people should feel free to enter into any kind of \n     relationship they want to enter into. It's really no-one \n     else's business in terms of trying to regulate or prohibit \n     behavior in that regard.\n\n  This is what he says:\n\n       I think different states are likely to come to different \n     conclusions, and that's appropriate. I don't think there \n     should necessarily be a Federal policy in this area.\n\n  That was Dick Cheney in the year 2000. Now, because the President has \ndecided that he needs to do this right now rather than keep us safe \nfrom al-Qaida and move forward and help us get our legislative packages \nthrough to protect the American people, that this is more important, \nthen Vice President Cheney now supports the amendment. But his wife \nLynne has taken a decidedly different view. I have, in fact, shown you \nthat before. Her comments:\n\n       I thought the formula Dick Cheney used in 2000 was very \n     good. First of all, to be clear that people should be free to \n     enter into their relationships that they choose and secondly \n     to recognize what's historically been the situation, that \n     when it comes to conferring legal status on relationships, \n     that is a matter left to the States.\n\n  So when I say it is divisive to the country, it has divided Mrs. \nCheney from Dick Cheney and that is just an example of how it divides \npeople.\n  I will tell you the reason it does. First, it is unnecessary. The \nStates are taking care of this. Second, we are enshrining \ndiscrimination into the Constitution, a document that is meant to \nexpand rights. We have never, underline never, amended the Constitution \nto deny rights, to deny equality.\n  In his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this \nyear, University of Chicago Law School professor, Cas Sunstein, noted \nthat:\n\n       All of the amendments to the Constitution are either \n     expansions of individual rights or attempts to remedy \n     problems in the structure of government. The sole exception \n     being the 18th amendment that established prohibition and \n     that attempt to write social policy into the Constitution was \n     such a disaster that it was repealed less than 15 years \n     later.\n\n  The list of adopted constitutional amendments is short but \nimpressive. There are the first 10 amendments, the Bill of Rights, that \nguarantees important liberties to the American people, from freedom of \nspeech and the press, to the right to be secure in our homes, to the \nfreedom of religion. It is the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments that \nundid the terrible injustices of slavery, ensuring African Americans \nthe right to vote and guaranteeing everyone equal protection under the \nlaw.\n  Then there is the 19th amendment that gave women the right to vote. \nWe know what a struggle that was. The suffragettes worked mightily, \nlong and hard.\n  The 24th amendment banned poll taxes to further ensure that \nminorities have the right to vote.\n\n  The 26th amendment gave 18-year-olds the right to vote. I remember \nthat debate was, if you are old enough to die for your country, you \nshould be old enough to vote in your country.\n  It is quite an impressive list. It is a short list. It obviously \nsought to expand freedom and equality, and it did so.\n  The other day I happened to see my grandchild watching a show. They \nwere singing a song--which I will not sing, so don't panic--which goes \nlike this, in words:\n\n       One of these things is not like the other,\n       One of these things just doesn't belong.\n\n  This proposal before us today doesn't belong in the Constitution of \nthe United States of America. That is why so many organizations, 127, \nhave come out against this amendment. Let's take a look at them. It is \na huge list. Many of these groups have absolutely no interest in the \ndebate over same-sex marriage, but they share one common goal: \nPreventing discrimination from being written into our Constitution. Let \nme mention a few of these:\n  The Japanese-American Citizen League says:\n\n       The Japanese-American community is keenly aware of what it \n     means to be the target the Government sanctions and \n     implemented discrimination and mistrust. We believe \n     discrimination in any form is un-American.\n\n  The National Council of La Raza, the National Black Justice \nCoalition, the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the \nLeadership Conference on Civil Rights, the Labor Council for Latin \nAmerican Advancement, the American Jewish Committee, the NAACP, the \nNational Asian-Pacific American Women's Forum, the National Hispanic \nLeadership Agenda say that this will be the first time in history that \nan amendment to our Constitution ``would restrict the rights of a whole \nclass of people in conflict with its guiding principle of equal \nprotection.''\n  These Americans who are in these groups--and by the way, there are a \nlot of religious organizations in this group: The Religious Action \nCenter, you have a number of religions--the Interfaith Alliance, \nUniversity Fellowship of Metropolitan Community Churches, Presbyterian \nChurch Washington Office--a lot of these folks, not only do they not \nwant to see discrimination written into the Constitution, but they \nbelieve the Constitution is a gift to us. I agree with that--a gift we \ninherited from giants among men who wrote it 217 years ago. We know no \ndocument is perfect, but when we amend the Constitution, it would be to \nexpand rights, not to take away rights from decent, loyal Americans. \nThis great Constitution of ours should never be used to make a group of \nAmericans permanent second-class citizens.\n\n  This Constitutional amendment is so flawed it couldn't pass the \nJudiciary Committee. The leadership has to bypass the committee in \norder to get this bill before the full Senate. Sometimes that happens. \nWe have seen it happen with various bills that come to the Senate \nfloor. This isn't just a bill; this is an amendment to the Constitution \nof the United States. It needs to get 67 votes in the Senate. We don't \neven know if a majority of the Senate is in favor of it; yet here it \nis. Instead of doing what they would do to protect our people, this is \nwhat we are doing.\n  This amendment would make it impossible, if it passed, for States to \nsay that two people who love each other, care for each other, and are \nwilling to die for each other, have no inheritance rights, equal \nhospitalization rights, or equal benefits under the law. That is an \noutrage.\n  Don't let anyone tell you: I am for this amendment because it \nbasically says marriage is between a man and woman, but I support civil \nunions and domestic partnerships. You can't do it. The lawyers tell us \nthat once this is enshrined in the Constitution, the States will not be \nable to confer equal benefits on civil unions or domestic partnerships. \nMarriage is not a Federal issue; it is a matter of State law. For some \nit is a religious issue. Some religions recognize same-sex marriages \nand some do not. Again, many religions oppose this amendment, including \nthe Alliance of Baptists, Episcopal Church, the 216th General Assembly \nPresbyterian Church.\n  When I got married, it was a religious service and I had my civil \nrecognition, so I had both religion and civil present. Guess what. The \nFederal Government wasn't involved. That was OK. That is the way it has \nbeen.\n  My State has a domestic partnership law. California's law I believe \nis a good start. It gives same-sex couples many of the same rights and \nresponsibilities as married couples. It isn't perfect. I think we need \nto do more. But even this imperfect law means so much to some people in \nCalifornia. For this Congress to take that away from them by amending \nthis Constitution is wrong and it is mean spirited. That is what \nexperts tell us will happen. My State has made this decision. Other \nStates are making their decisions. What is wrong with that?\n  The very same people who are always preaching States rights now feel \nthey must move forward. I already gave you Vice President Cheney's \nstatement about the fact that we live in a free society, freedom means \nfreedom for everybody, and he didn't think there ought to be a Federal \npolicy in this area. I believe those words of his from the year 2000 \nstand up. Frankly, the words he is uttering today are just bowing to \nthe political pollsters. That is really a shame. The Constitution is \ntoo great a document for it to be used as a political football. The \nConstitution is too great a document to be used as an applause meter \nbefore a convention. Yet that is what we are seeing.\n\n[[Page S7958]]\n\n  I don't know what message the people who are bringing this to you \nwant to convey. Is it to send a message that certain Americans are \ninferior? I hope not. But that is a message that is being sent to a lot \nof people who are hurting right now.\n  I have heard my colleagues say the reason for this amendment is that \nthe American family is in a fragile condition. One of my colleagues \nsays marriage is under assault by gay marriage or gay relationships.\n  I want to tell you something straight from my heart. Not one married \ncouple has ever come up to me and said that their marriage is under \nassault because two people of the same gender living down the street \ncare about each other. If your marriage is under assault because of \nthat, you have other issues that you should deal with.\n  If we were truly concerned about strengthening marriage and families \nin this country, I will tell you there are a lot of things we could do, \njust like we could do a lot of things to make us safer. There are a lot \nof things we can do.\n  We have not raised the minimum wage in 8 years. People are trying to \nhold their families together on a minimum wage. Two people working on a \nminimum wage are probably just at the poverty line. Why don't we raise \nour minimum wage and help our low-income families? We could pass a bill \nto make sure our families and our married couples have the same health \ninsurance as we have. I think it is a great idea. Open it up. We could \npass a bill like that. We could pass a bill to make sure all children \nhave a high-quality education. We could fully fund the No Child Left \nBehind Act. That would take pressure off of our families. Instead of \nfreezing the number of children in afterschool programs--and I have a \nlot in my heart about that because I wrote the afterschool law with \nSenator Ensign. We have frozen that program for 3 years. We have a \nmillion kids in it. That is another one. Open it up. Let these children \nin. Take the pressure off our families. Take the assault off our \nmarriages. That would really help. Keeping our children safe until mom \nor dad comes home is something we could do.\n  Now we have some saying the amendment is needed to stop the activist \njudges. Not one Federal judge has ruled on the issue of same-sex \nmarriage.\n  I have to say: Is this a new thing we now have on the other side? \nSuddenly they are upset about activist judges. I can understand if they \nare concerned about activist judges. Why did they vote for many of them \nfor the most part? My colleagues voted to confirm James Leon Holmes. \nRegarding women's right to choose, where was the concern when he said \nthe ``concern for rape victims is a red herring because conceptions \nfrom rape occur with the same frequency as snow in Miami.'' He is going \nto take that opinion that is so wrong and defies science and is so \nactivist in nature so he can change the law.\n  Where was the concern about William Pryor, who our colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle voted for, who said the Federal Government \nshould not be involved in the business of public education or the \ncontrol of street crime? Imagine a Republican saying that when it was \nDwight Eisenhower who wrote the very first public education bill.\n  All of a sudden, we have concern about activist judges when they are \nvoting for activist judges every day.\n  This same William Pryor called the Voting Rights Act, which \nguarantees voting rights to all of us, an affront to federalism. They \ndidn't have a problem with that.\n  What about Charles Pickering, who worked to reduce the sentence for a \nman convicted of burning a cross on the lawn of an interracial couple?\n  What about activist judges who stopped the State recount in the \nrecent Presidential election and essentially decided that election when \nmost legal scholars said, they won't do it, the Supreme Court will \nallow a recount to go forward.\n  On every count, this argument seems to me to be disingenuous and only \nbefore the Senate to hurt some people who are going to cast a tough \nvote, so use it in 30-second spots. Indeed, some of those 30-second \nspots have already begun.\n  Shame on us. This job is too important, this country is too great. \nThe Senate means too much to too many people to use it like this. It is \nnot right.\n  If this was really about activist judges, we would be debating this \nafter a Federal judge has actually acted. By the way, the timing of \nthat would be inconvenient for my colleagues on the other side because \nno Federal judge will act before the Democratic Convention.\n  What we see--and it is really sad, but it has to be said--is crass, \ncold-hearted politics. Distracting attention from the real issues \nfacing our Nation, this constitutional amendment is being used as a \nweapon of mass distraction. Again, already it is being used in 30-\nsecond commercials.\n  I hope and I pray the people of this country will see this debate for \nwhat it is. Members are going to hear a string of speeches: We have to \ndo this because marriage is under assault.\n  The next question is, If marriage is under assault, what are you \ndoing to help make family life easier for our people, easier for our \nhard-working people at a time when women and men both have to work \nbecause it is so tough, at a time when actual wages have gone up 1 \npercent but the cost of health care almost 30 percent, the cost of gas \nup, the cost of college tuition up well over 20 percent, the worst job \nrecord in the last 3 years?\n  Since this administration took over, we have had the worse job \ncreation record since Herbert Hoover. Fewer jobs are in existence today \nthan when George Bush took over. Do Members want to take the strain off \nof our marriages, off of our families? Let's have an economic recovery. \nLet's stop the good jobs from going abroad by giving incentives to \ncreate jobs here. Let's raise the minimum wage. Let's assure the people \nof this country that they will be protected from the threat of \nshoulder-fired missiles.\n  When we go up to that secret room upstairs and we are told that al-\nQaida is moving forward to disrupt our democratic process and to attack \nour country, what do we come down here to do? Nothing to take away that \nthreat. Holding bills at the desk, including rail security, transit \nsecurity, port security, chemical plant security, nuclear plant \nsecurity--I could go on with the other issues we ought to be \ndiscussing. But, no, we do not have time to take care of that.\n  Now I hear we are going to go to the Australian free-trade agreement \nafter this. I love the Australians and they are great friends of \nAmerica. But I love the people I represent, too. And when I see threats \nlike this, I cannot sleep at night, worried about it. I didn't come \nhere to stand and debate constitutional amendments that do nothing to \nmake life better for anyone in this country. But that is what they want \nto do. It is a very sad day.\n  We are all God's children. No two of us are alike. We have different \ncolor eyes. We have different color hair. We have different color skin. \nWe are different genders, different religions, different backgrounds, \ndifferent views. I come from a State of 35 million people, the \nmost unbelievably diverse State in the Nation. Yes, different sexual \norientations is part of that mix. We are all different. Yet we are all \nGod's children. We are all united behind this country and the common \ncause of freedom, justice, fairness, and equality. That is what unites \nus.\n\n  In this Chamber, we have a job to do. That is to advance the cause of \nfreedom and justice and equality, and to advance the status of our \npeople economically. Doing this does not help any of it.\n  A constitutional amendment before the Senate is an attempt to use our \ndiversity to divide us instead of to unite us. Ironically, it is being \nbrought by the President and his friends in the Senate who said he \nwould be the great uniter, a healer; that he would change the tone in \nWashington.\n  The tone has changed. It is worse than it has ever been in all my \nyears here, and this is the end of my second term in the Senate. I was \nin the House for 10 years. Before that I was in local government. I \nhave never seen a worse tone.\n  This constitutional amendment is an attempt to appeal to our \nprejudice instead of to our compassion, to our hatreds instead of to \nour hopes, to our fears instead of our dreams. The constitutional \namendment is an appeal to\n\n[[Page S7959]]\n\nwhat is the worst in us instead of what is best in us. We are better \nthan that, or we should be better than that.\n  In his first inaugural address, Republican President Abraham Lincoln \nappealed to the better angels of our nature. This amendment flies in \nthe face of those words.\n  Regardless of what anyone thinks about gay marriage, regardless of \nwhether Members are for domestic partnerships or civil unions--which, \nagain, I strongly support--regardless of whether Members support or \noppose the laws in their State, this constitutional amendment should be \ndefeated, and the motion to proceed, if it is a vote on that, I hope \nthat fails, as well. The signal will be, when we defeat this motion to \nproceed, the message we are sending is we want to get to the business \nof the American people that will make marriages better and stronger, \nthat will protect our people from threat of terrorist attack, not to \nsit here and talk about a constitutional amendment which the author \nknows hasn't got one slim chance of passing. He is taking up valuable \ntime on an issue that does nothing at all to help our people.\n  I urge my colleagues to do the right thing. I urge my colleagues to \nput the Constitution above any political gain. I urge my colleagues to \nput the Constitution above their political well-being.\n  Here is what I have known in the many years I have run for office. \nWhen you take a stand out of deep conviction, people know. They may not \neven agree, but they ask, Do I want someone who is willing to take a \nhard stand and someone I can trust to do that when the chips are down? \nThey want that. They will see that is what a true patriot is, not \nsomeone who reads the polls and says the polls show this or that. The \npoint in the Senate sometimes is to lead. I wish it would be that way \nevery day, but especially it should be that way when there is an \namendment to the Constitution. I hope once we dispose of this and vote \ndown the motion to proceed, and they do not get enough votes on that, \nwe can turn our attention to the awesome challenges and the difficult \nissues we face. Once we send that signal, America will see we did right \nby the Senate, we did right by our constituents, and we did right by \nthis country that we love so much and we hold so dearly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I will yield to my good friend from \nMissouri, but first I will make a couple points.\n  First, we are just beginning to defend marriage. This debate may go \nwell beyond this year. I anticipate we will have more votes. But the \nmessage is, we are just beginning.\n  Second, this is a moderate amendment. We do allow States the \nopportunity to find civil unions and domestic partnerships. This is not \na civil rights union. This is not a civil rights issue.\n  I will have an opportunity later on in our debate this afternoon to \ntalk about these very points.\n  First, I call on my good friend, the junior Senator from Missouri.\n  I served with him in the House, and I am proud to call him my friend. \nHe is doing a great job in the Senate. I yield to the Senator from \nMissouri, Mr. Talent.\n  Mr. TALENT. I understand we have about 20 minutes until lunch. May I \nhave the 20 minutes?\n  Mr. ALLARD. Twenty minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. TALENT. I appreciate that. I very much appreciate the kind words \nof my friend from Colorado in introducing me. That is probably more \nthan I deserve, and it is certainly better than I usually get when I \nstand up to speak on the Senate floor.\n  We are in the midst of another filibuster. I say that because if I \ndidn't say it, given the Senate procedures, it would not be evident to \npeople that that is what is happening. But we are filibustering yet \nanother measure before the Senate. This one has a little twist to it. \nThose who are filibustering are willing to allow us to go to a vote on \nthe amendment, if we have no amendment to the amendment. In other \nwords, if nobody wants to offer any amendment to change this amendment \nat all, to try and perfect it, then they will permit an immediate vote. \nSo what we are told is that we must either have an immediate vote \nwithout any changes even being considered or no vote at all.\n  I suspect that the filibuster will be sustained when we vote on it. \nIt is a shame because this is an important measure, and the people are \nentitled to see who in this body is for protecting traditional marriage \nand who is not, because nothing less than that is at stake. Members of \nthe Senate should not be mistaken or deceived by discussions of other \nissues or attempts to restate what this amendment is about or \nassurances that we don't really need to do anything and everything will \nbe OK.\n  The courts of this country are engaged in a process by which they are \ngoing to force the people, whether they like it or not, to accept a \nfundamental change in the basic building block of our society. I kind \nof think that is important. I think it is worth debating. It is a sign \nof the regard in which marriage is held by some of those who are \nfilibustering that they don't think it is important enough to be worth \ndebating.\n  Marriage is our oldest social institution. I was thinking about this \nthe other day. It is not older than the impulse to seek God, but it is \nolder than our formal religions. It is older than our system of \nproperty. It is older than our system of justice. It certainly predates \nour political institutions, our Constitution, even our union in this \ncountry. And marriage may be the most important of all these \ninstitutions because it represents the accumulated wisdom of literally \nhundreds of generations over thousands of years about how best to lay \nthe foundation of a home in which we can raise and socialize our \nchildren.\n  Every society has to be able to do certain things in order to \nsurvive. It has to produce wealth, goods, and services so people can \nlive. It has to resolve disputes so that people don't kill each other \nover problems that they have. It has to be able to raise children who \nare reasonably content, reasonably well adjusted, and reasonably \ncommitted to the norms of that society. It is possible to do that. I \nput in that word for those in the gallery who may have teenagers as I \ndo. It is possible for children to be reasonably content, well \nadjusted, and committed to the norms of society. And the way that we do \nthat, the way we have decided over the millennia to do that in this \ncountry, and, indeed, throughout the world, is through marriage.\n\n  It doesn't always work that way, obviously. No human society, no \nhuman institution is perfect. A spouse may die. The marriage may break \nup. The marriage may be so completely dysfunctional that maybe it ought \nto break up. People sometimes are single when children are born, and \nvery often in those circumstances the person who is raising the child \nis able to make it work. They act heroically to raise the child on \ntheir own.\n  If a child in that circumstance went to his mom or dad or aunt or \nuncle or grandma or grandpa or guardian, whoever was trying to raise \nhim or her on his own and said, When I grow up, when I want to have \nchildren, would you recommend that I try and find somebody who is \ncommitted to raising the child--say it is a girl--if I try and find a \nman who is committed to me and committed to the home and committed to \nraising our children in that context, would you recommend that I do \nthat or not? How many of those single moms or dads or grandmas or \ngrandpas or aunts or uncles who have raised kids or are raising kids, \nhow many would say, No, do it the other way? They would say: Do it that \nway, if you can.\n  It is hard under any circumstances. But it is less hard if you have a \nhusband or a wife who is there, who is committed, who wants to help. \nThat is what marriage is about. Americans know that as a matter of \ncommonsense. Americans live in this civilization. Americans of all \ndifferent backgrounds, all different ethnicities, all different \nreligions, all support traditional marriage. They know that, if \npossible, kids should be raised by a mom and a dad, committed in the \ncontext of marriage to their family. Americans know that and have known \nit. They have built that society and that culture.\n  The social scientists have figured it out. Here is a representative \nstatement. The Senator from Kansas read a\n\n[[Page S7960]]\n\nnumber of similar statements the other day, but this was by Scott M. \nStanley who is a Ph.D. at the Center for Marital and Family Studies at \nthe University of Denver, which my friend from Colorado has the honor \nto represent. He said:\n\n       As a result of decades of accumulated data, many family \n     scientists, from the fields of sociology, psychology and \n     economics, have concluded--\n\n  Here is the news bulletin--\n\n     children and adults on average experience the highest level \n     of overall well-being in the context of healthy marital \n     relationships.\n\n  And what is marriage? We are entitled to ask that about all our \nsocial institutions. What is it? It is not complicated. In short form, \nit is one mom, one dad, one at a time. Everybody has the same right to \nget married. There is no discrimination involved in a social \ninstitution. Everybody has the same right to get married. But nobody \nhas the right to marry anybody they want to. There are certain \nrestrictions. You can't marry a close relative. You can't marry \nsomebody who is already married. Is that discrimination if we tell \npeople, No, you can't marry somebody if they are already married? That \nis not marriage. And you can't marry somebody of the same sex.\n\n  And why? Because marriage is the institution--remember, it is many \nthings; yes, it is an expression of love and commitment between two \npeople and that is beautiful--that we in our society rely upon for \nraising our children. And it is best for kids, if possible and where \npossible, to have a mom and a dad. And that is one thing that two \npeople of the same sex cannot give children. They cannot give them a \nmom and a dad.\n  It comes down to this: People in this country are free to live the \nway they want to live. That is one of our cultural norms that, by the \nway, marriage supports. Marriage is the building block of a society \nwhich believes, among other things, that people should be free. And \npeople are free to live the way they want.\n  The Senator from California talked about two same-sex people who love \neach other and want to live together. Legally people are free to do \nthat. But that does not mean that they are free to change the basic \ncultural institutions on the health of which everybody and everybody's \nrights depend.\n  We have models of this around the world. In Scandinavia they have \nchanged traditional marriage, legalized same-sex marriage. The result \nthere is increasingly nobody gets married. Fewer and fewer kids are \nraised outside of that context. It is not good. If you think it is \ngood, come down here and say that. Say that is why you want to oppose \nthe amendment.\n  It is worth asking also how we got here. No legislature has acted on \nthis. I haven't heard about hearings in the State legislatures around \nthe country. No referendum has passed. I served in the legislature for \n8 years in Missouri and was proud to do so. I served on the committees \nthat considered family law. We debated a lot of issues involving family \nlaw. We changed the law a lot. It has not happened in this country. \nPeople have not adopted referendum. In fact, all the actions have been \nthe other way. To the extent that they have passed referendum or laws, \nthey have all been in support of traditional marriage.\n  So how did we get here?\n  We got here because a majority of the Massachusetts Supreme Court \ndecided people should have the right to same-sex marriage. Because of \nthe way our Federal system works, it is very likely--whether people \nwant to admit this or not--that other courts will force people in other \nStates to recognize same-sex marriage because one State has. That is \nthe way our system works. It may not happen, but it is quite likely to \nhappen.\n  When I heard about that decision by the Massachusetts Supreme Court, \nI asked myself: What about everybody else's rights? What is the most \nbasic political right people in this country, and indeed throughout the \nfree world, have? What is the political right that people in this \ncountry have fought and died for for hundreds of years? We see people \naround the world now heroically fighting for this. The first and most \nbasic right is the right of the people to govern themselves.\n  The Framers thought that right was so self-evident, you didn't have \nto argue for it. Maybe we should restate it for the Massachusetts \nSupreme Court. It means that the only just government is the one that \nderives its powers from the consent of the governed. That means that \nevery act of any governmental body has to be the result of a process in \nwhich the people have, at some time, consented.\n  In this country, people have to consent to the acts by which they are \ngoverned. Typically, they could do that through the process of a \nrepresentative democracy. They elect people or defeat them, depending \non whether they agree with them. We would not tolerate it for a second \nif a President got up one day and said: I don't like the way our \nsociety is functioning; I am going to issue a decree and everybody has \nto do it differently now.\n  It would not matter whether we agreed, we would say you don't have \nthe authority to do that. It is because of that basic right of self-\ngovernment that judges are supposed to construe and apply the law, not \ninvent and impose the law.\n  Now, the construction may be strict or liberal. Provisions of the \nConstitution may be vague. But the construction has to be a faithful \nconstruction--whether it is strict or liberal--to the proper exercise \nwithin the American constitutional system of the judicial power. Even \nif a provision of the Constitution is so vague that we are not certain \nwhat the right answer, the right interpretation is, it doesn't mean \nthere are no wrong interpretations. It doesn't mean there are no \ninterpretations which clearly are outside of the scope of what the \npeople who wrote the document said or intended.\n  I want to assert this before the Senate now: It is wrong to say the \nConstitution of the United States, or any of the several States, \ncontains a right to same-sex marriage. It is intellectually dishonest \nto claim that the Massachusetts decision was one of interpretation and \napplication, rather than invention and imposition. They were not \ninterpreting the Constitution; they were imposing what they wanted on \nthe people of Massachusetts, without their consent.\n  In this country, you don't do that. I have been around legislative \nbodies a long time. I have won some battles and lost some. Sometimes I \nthink I have lost a lot more than I have won. Certainly, when I served \nin the minority in the Congress and in the legislature, I lost more \nbattles than I won. That is the way the system works. I can live with \nthat. But I don't like being told I have no right to participate. I \ndon't like being told my views are such that I cannot petition the \nrepresentative process to get what I want out of it.\n  Unless we pass a constitutional amendment, we will allow the courts \nof this country to disenfranchise tens of millions of Americans on an \nissue that is of greater importance to them on a day-to-day basis--\nbecause it involves the way in which their children and other people's \nchildren are going to be raised--than most of the issues we discuss. If \nwe cannot agree in this body on anything else, we can agree on this: \nEverybody should have the right to advance their point of view in the \nlegislative process on this issue, and that we can trust the good sense \nof the American people to produce the right result in the end. I \nam willing to do that, but the only way we can do that is by passing a \nconstitutional amendment. That is what this country is about.\n\n  I have just a few minutes. I will deal with some of the arguments \nthat have been raised against this. One is that this is political. \nWell, I have been in legislative bodies a long time. When people start \ntalking about a bill or an argument being political, they are really \nsaying that we know if we have to vote on this, we are going to vote in \na way that people probably don't like back home, and we would really \nrather not vote on it.\n  Let me say this. This is not a battle that my friend from Colorado \nsought when he introduced this amendment. This battle is being forced \nupon us by the courts of the country. If you don't want to vote on \nthis, get the Massachusetts Supreme Court to reverse itself. We will go \nback to what we had before, and gladly so.\n  Another argument is that we are holding up other business. I say to \nthe people who are making that argument, as I said at great length on \nthe floor of the Senate the other day, you are filibustering the other \nbusiness. If you\n\n[[Page S7961]]\n\nwant to go to other business, stop filibustering it. You filibustered \nthe class action bill last week, the welfare bill, the Energy bill, \nmedical malpractice, and judicial nominations. You can filibuster if \nyou want.\n  Unfortunately, here we allowed very broad filibustering. But one \nthing you cannot do is filibuster and then accuse everybody else of \nbeing obstructionists. That isn't right. Let the other measures go and \nwe will go with them.\n  Another argument is that we should show more respect for the \nConstitution and that we should not amend the Constitution. You know, \nthat is kind of a selective argument. That says basically you can amend \nit through the courts. The courts can amend it any way they want, \nwithout regard to the right of the people to govern themselves; but we \ncannot amend it through the process that the people have provided to \namend it. The argument is kind of cheeky. It says we can get court \ndecisions that exclude you from participating in the normal process, so \nyou cannot pass a law to do anything about it. But then, if you go to \nthe constitutional amendment process, which is the only process we have \nleft open to you, you are not showing any respect for the Constitution.\n  Look, my time is running out. I see a colleague who may want to add a \nword or two at the end. You are either for protecting traditional \nmarriage or you are not. There is no way around this debate. The courts \nare forcing it on us. They have changed the law in Massachusetts. \nPeople are getting married there and filing lawsuits in other States to \nchallenge those State laws. This is here. We are either going to do \nsomething about it or we are not. You are either for protecting \ntraditional marriage or you are not. It is not about homeland security. \nIt is about whether you really think that marriage, as we have \nunderstood it for thousands of years, is important in some sense, even \nif you cannot explain it, to the kind of society we live in. I think \nso. I know most of the people think so.\n  My tone has been one of frustration. I am sorry about that. This \nfrustrates me. It is something that, clearly, we ought to do. I don't \nknow anybody who has come down here and argued against traditional \nmarriage. Let's pass this constitutional amendment, work on it for a \nreasonable amount of time, get it in as good a shape as we can, and do \nthe business the people expect us to do. Let them make their own \ndecisions about their own culture.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I thank the Senate, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we allow the \nSenator from Texas an additional 10 minutes to discuss the Hispanic \nconference that she is having here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Reserving the right to object, I ask unanimous consent \nto modify the request of my friend from Colorado that after the Senator \nfrom Texas speaks on the Hispanic convention for 10 minutes, the \nSenator from California and I be given an additional 15 minutes to talk \nabout the renewal of the assault weapons ban.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Unfortunately, the Chair will not be able to \npreside and has to object to the unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I have no objection to the Senator from \nTexas speaking for 10 minutes. I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate resumes business at 2:15 p.m., at some point between 2:15 p.m. \nand 5 p.m. today, we be given 15 minutes to talk about this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate this opportunity to talk about the \nFederal marriage amendment before the Senate. It is important that we \nfocus on this very important issue and look at the reason we are taking \nit up.\n  Some people come up to me and say: Why are we doing this now? We \nalready have the Defense of Marriage Act. Additionally, people say: Is \nthis such a pressing issue that it needs to be discussed right now?\n  I cosponsored this amendment because if we wait until the Defense of \nMarriage Act is taken through the courts and potentially declared \nunconstitutional, questions would arise about what marriage is in our \ncountry.\n  I do not think many would disagree that the traditional concept of \nmarriage is what must be protected. Traditional marriage has been the \nfoundation of our families for generations, in fact, centuries. It is \nbest for our children now, and is the best chance our children have for \nbrighter futures.\n  Inevitably, single-parent households exist due to death or an \ninability to keep marriages together. But it is proven, that if \npossible, a married couple, a man and a woman, raising a family give \nchildren the best chance to succeed in their lives.\n  Today, same-sex couples from 46 States have traveled to \nMassachusetts, California, and Oregon to receive marriage licenses with \nthe intention of returning to their respective States to challenge \ntheir State's laws. Forty-two States have specific laws defining \nmarriage as the union of a man and a woman. My State of Texas has such \na law.\n  Activist judges and lawyers have been using the judicial system to \nundermine the traditional definition of marriage without public consent \nor debate. This is not just an attack on our families, but also on our \ndemocratic form of government. Elected representatives of the people \nare supposed to make the laws of our country.\n\n  In 1996, Congress enacted the Defense of Marriage Act--it was passed \n85 to 14 on the Senate floor--to protect marriage by allowing States to \nrefuse to recognize an act of any other jurisdiction that designates a \nrelationship between individuals of the same sex as a marriage.\n  I have heard arguments that DOMA would not withstand a full faith and \ncredit Constitutional challenge, but we continue to see courts, such as \nthe Massachusetts Supreme Court, and officials in California deny the \nlaws of this country and their particular States.\n  I do not think the Constitution should be amended lightly. I would \nlike to see our Constitution amended only when it is absolutely \nnecessary to correct a fundamental problem. However, this is one of \nthose times. This is one of those times when we have judges acting as \nlegislators. This must be stopped and can only be stopped by the \nConstitution.\n  The full faith and credit clause of our Constitution says:\n\n       Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the \n     public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other \n     State. And the Congress may by general Laws prescribe the \n     Manner in which such Acts, Records, and Proceedings shall be \n     proved, and the Effect thereof.\n\n  The full faith and credit clause should not be used by the courts to \nvalidate marriages because marriages are not legal judgments, they are \ncivil contracts. Unfortunately, we are witnessing a change where \nactivist judges are making laws with their judgments, and the full \nfaith and credit clause faces enormous challenge.\n  Currently, there are 11 States facing court challenges to their \nmarriage laws. Recent court decisions indicate that neither State \nattempts to define marriage nor DOMA may be sufficient to protect the \nability of States to define marriage. At least seven States will have \nState constitutional amendments on their ballots in 2004 to define \nmarriage as between a man and a woman.\n  In my State of Texas where the legislature passed a law defining \nmarriage as between a man and a woman, controversy now exists about how \nState courts must treat civil unions. The State attorney general has \nsaid that Texas does not recognize Vermont civil unions, and, \ntherefore, no divorce or separation must be granted in Texas for this \nunion.\n  These are just a few of the questions that are beginning to arise \nbecause of the acts of judges in Massachusetts and local officials in \nCalifornia.\n  It is very important that elected representatives make this decision. \nPeople must have the right to hear the discussion, talk about it, and \nbe represented by their elected officials. That is the issue here.\n  I do not think we will have the votes on Wednesday to proceed to this \ncritical issue, but this is an important step toward starting the \ndebate. Marriage between a man and a woman that produces children and \nstrong families is\n\n[[Page S7962]]\n\nfundamental to our society and demands this safeguard. This is the core \nand fabric of our society.\n  I hope in the next few days, weeks, and months we have a civilized \ndebate. This is not about being anti-homosexual. Not at all. I think \neveryone believes gays and lesbians should have the ability to lead \ntheir lives as they choose, as should all consenting adults. But we \ndon't want to tear down traditional marriage and the American family. \nWe need to protect traditional marriage. We should not allow some \nStates to impose their definition of marriage on other States. States \nmust have the right to accept or reject anything that has not been \ndemonstrated the will of the people through their representatives.\n  I appreciate being given the time to speak on this issue. It is an \nimportant issue for our country, and I hope we will carefully consider \nthe ramifications if we do not take action to protect traditional \nmarriage and the American family.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/13/senate-section/article/S7962-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7962]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have spoken to the manager of the bill for \nthe majority and I want to say a few brief words now and then I will \nyield 30 minutes to the Senator from Wisconsin. Following that, \nRepublicans will speak for whatever time they desire and the Democrats \nwill then follow with remarks by Senator Durbin for up to 30 minutes.\n  I simply ask unanimous consent that following my brief remarks, \nSenator Feingold be recognized for up to 30 minutes; following his \nremarks the time revert to whatever the majority feels appropriate; \nfollowing their remarks, that Senator Durbin will be recognized for up \nto 30 minutes; then trying to balance out this time, following the \nreversion back to Republicans, Senator Lautenberg will be recognized \nfor up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Reno Gazette-Journal, a newspaper that \nhas been in existence for many years, a Gannett newspaper in Reno, NV, \nwhich is certainly not a bed of liberalism, published a very short \neditorial today. It says:\n\n       The plan to redefine marriage in a constitutional amendment \n     could not be a better election year wedge. The fact that \n     Lynne Cheney, champion of conservative causes, parted company \n     with her husband, Vice President Dick Cheney, on same-sex \n     marriage is illustrative of just how divisive it's become.\n       Typically, vice presidents support their presidents and \n     political wives back their husbands, regardless of personal \n     feelings. This time, the human aspect of the debate was too \n     much for a political wife to overcome.\n       As the mother of a lesbian, Lynne Cheney, of necessity, \n     would be finely attuned to all the arguments. And no one \n     should expect a parent to disregard an offspring for a \n     political agenda. Anyway, it is debatable that an amendment \n     would help a traditional conception of marriage. And, some \n     Senators indicate they are less than willing to try.\n       The administration is wading into deep waters, fracturing \n     families, and merging the church and the state. That's not \n     the way the system is supposed to work. It would be best for \n     government to leave this issue alone.\n\n  I am not an avid reader of the Washington Times. In fact, I didn't \nread it today. But it was brought to my attention and I did read the \nWashington Times:\n\n       GOP split on marriage proposals.\n       Senate Republican leaders, who had been seeking a clear \n     vote on a constitutional amendment on same-sex ``marriage,'' \n     yesterday found themselves outmaneuvered by Democrats and \n     divided over which of two proposals to pursue.\n       President Bush and Senate Republican leaders support the \n     Federal Marriage Amendment, which defines marriage as the \n     union of a man and a woman and restricts the court's ability \n     to rule on the issue. But some Republicans want to vote on an \n     alternative, simpler version--leaving Republican leaders \n     scrambling. . . .\n\n  Let's understand where we are on this issue. Senator Daschle, in good \nfaith, Friday, came to the floor and said we need to get to the \nbusiness at hand. There is an important marriage amendment pending \nabout which people on both sides of the aisle have strong feelings. \nTherefore, it would be better that we vote on the amendment, the one \nthat has been on the Senate floor. We were told at that time by the \nmajority leader that sounded like a pretty good idea, that he would \nhave to check with his caucus.\n  Surprisingly, Friday we were unable to get that unanimous consent \nagreement entered. Monday we come back--no deal. In the morning, we \nwere told they want to vote on two constitutional amendments regarding \nmarriage. In the afternoon, we were told they want to vote on three \nconstitutional amendments on marriage.\n  It is a simple choice. We are willing to vote on the legislation \nbefore this body, S.J. Res. 40. Why don't we do that? The reason we are \nnot going to do it is because the majority has decided they want the \nissue. They do not care how the votes fall; they want the issue. That \nis wrong. Everyone should understand this is a march to nowhere, and \nthe majority knows that.\n  I don't know what is happening around here. Class action is an issue \nfor which there were enough Members here--Democrats and Republicans--to \npass it. The majority would not even allow a vote--not a single vote--\non that issue. They want the issue.\n  They want to bash Democrats as being opposed to any reform of the \ntort system.\n  On medical malpractice, on asbestos, on class action they want the \nissue. They don't want to resolve the issue. One would think the people \nin the State of Ohio, in the State of Texas, in the State of Nevada, in \nthe State of Wisconsin, in the State of Illinois, and in every other \nState would know how Senators feel on the amendment before this body.\n  They are not going to get that chance because we are going to be \nforced into a procedural vote. That is wrong.\n  We are willing to vote on S.J. Res. 40. We have said that. We keep \nsaying that, but, no, the issue is more important than the merits of \nthis matter, which is too bad.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the Constitution of the United States is \na historic guarantee of individual freedom. It has served as a beacon \nof hope, an example to people around the world who yearn to be free and \nto live their lives without government interference with their most \nbasic human decisions.\n  I took an oath when I joined this body to support and defend the \nConstitution. I am saddened, therefore, to be standing on the floor \ntoday debating a constitutional amendment that is inconsistent with our \nNation's history of expanding freedom and liberty. It is all the more \nunfortunate because it has become all too clear that having this debate \nat this time is aimed at scoring points in an election year. Even a \nleading proponent of this amendment admits that we are engaged in a \npolitical exercise, pure and simple.\n  Paul Weyrich, president of the Free Congress Foundation, recently \nstated:\n\n       The President has bet the farm on Iraq.\n\n  So the proper solution, according to Mr. Weyrich, is to ``change the \nsubject'' from Iraq to the Federal marriage amendment.\n  Mr. Weyrich also recently stated:\n\n       If [President Bush] wishes to be reelected then he had \n     better be up front on this issue, because if the election is \n     solely on Iraq, we're talking about President Kerry.\n\n  I am loathe to come to that kind of conclusion. But I believe it to \nbe the truth.\n  There we have it. This proposed constitutional amendment is a poorly \ndisguised diversionary tactic that is essentially a political stunt.\n\n  Will this proposed constitutional amendment create jobs for mothers \nand fathers, husbands and wives, and stop the flow of American jobs \noverseas?\n  Will this proposed constitutional amendment secure a good education \nfor our children? Will this proposed constitutional amendment improve \nthe\n\n[[Page S7963]]\n\nlives of American families on any of these issues? Obviously not.\n  Instead of Congress and the President getting to work on issues that \nwould help American families, we are spending time--in fact a lot of \ntime--on the Senate floor on a poorly thought out, divisive, and \npolitically motivated constitutional amendment that everyone knows has \nno chance of success in this Chamber. What is even more troubling is \nthat this effort risks stoking fear and encouraging bigotry toward one \ngroup of Americans.\n  So here we are, debating a constitutional amendment in search of a \njustification. This debate is not really about supporting marriage. We \nall agree that good and strong marriages should be supported and \ncelebrated. The debate on this floor today is about whether we should \namend the U.S. Constitution to define marriage. The answer to that \nquestion has to be no. We do not need Congress to legislate for all \nStates, for all time, on a matter that has been traditionally handled \nby the States and religious institutions since the founding of our \nNation. For that reason alone, this amendment should be defeated.\n  At the outset, let me state in the strongest terms I can that I \nobject to the Senate discussing and debating this proposed \nconstitutional amendment without it first going through the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. We are here today debating a proposed amendment to \nour Nation's governing charter. In fact, this is the very first time \nthis particular amendment has even been brought before the Senate, and \nneither the Judiciary Committee nor the Constitution Subcommittee has \ndebated and marked up this proposal.\n  One might ask why the supporters of this proposed amendment feel the \nneed to rush to the floor and bypass the committee process. I suspect \nit is because they fear they do not have enough votes on the committee \nto approve the amendment and report it to the floor. It may also be \nthat the time it would have taken to examine the amendment and debate \nit in committee would have interfered with the predetermined political \nschedule for considering it on the Senate floor. Or perhaps that \ncommittee consideration would expose the weaknesses in the amendment \nand reduce support in the Senate. But in any event, the decision to \nbypass the committee process is highly unusual and very much to be \nregretted.\n  Senate leadership has not previously made a habit of bypassing the \ncommittee process when it considers a constitutional amendment. In \nfact, in this session of Congress alone, the Constitution Subcommittee \nhas held markups on three proposed constitutional amendments: the \nvictims' rights amendment, the continuity of government amendment, and, \nmost recently, the flag amendment. The Judiciary Committee should be \nallowed to serve its proper role in marking up proposed constitutional \namendments before they are brought to the Senate floor.\n  Respecting the committee process for any piece of legislation is \nimportant. But it is absolutely necessary for proposed amendments to \nthe Nation's Constitution. Amending the Constitution should not be \ntaken lightly. A rush to debate and pass this amendment--particularly \nsince it raises so many questions--is not in the best interests of this \nbody or of this country.\n  I might add that in the past quarter century, only two constitutional \namendments were considered by the full Senate without committee \nconsideration. One of these amendments, involving campaign finance \nrestrictions, was discharged from committee by unanimous consent so it \ncould be debated at the same time as campaign finance reform \nlegislation. The other amendment to be brought directly to the Senate \nfloor was an amendment to abolish the Electoral College and provide for \nthe direct election of the President. What happened on the Senate floor \nto that amendment is very instructive.\n  In 1979, the current chairman of the Judiciary Committee, the Senator \nfrom Utah, was serving in the position that I hold today, the ranking \nmember of the Constitution Subcommittee. He strongly objected to \nallowing a constitutional amendment to be brought to the Senate floor \nwithout first going through the Constitution Subcommittee and the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  Senator Hatch stated the following during the debate in 1979:\n\n       As the ranking minority member of the Committee on the \n     Judiciary, Subcommittee on the Constitution, I feel very \n     strongly that there are ways to propose constitutional \n     amendments and there are ways not to propose constitutional \n     amendments. In this particular case, I think this is not the \n     way to propose a constitutional amendment, and especially one \n     that has the potential of altering the basic democratic \n     federalism of the American political structure.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       To bypass the committee is, I think, to denigrate the \n     committee process, especially when an amendment to the \n     Constitution of the United States of America, the most \n     important document in the history of the Nation, is involved.\n\n  I could not agree more with the words of a then somewhat junior \nSenator who is now the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee. His view then is exactly my view now, and I think the whole \nSenate should take his position very seriously.\n  His position was supported by another distinguished Republican member \nof the Judiciary Committee, Senator Alan Simpson of Wyoming, who said \nthe following:\n\n       We are talking about amending the fundamental law of the \n     land--the law that controls the creation and enforcement of \n     all other laws, the law that embodies the procedural \n     consensus and most basic values of all Americans, that gives \n     our nation much of its unity and our government its \n     legitimacy. We should consider proposals to amend the \n     Constitution more carefully than any other measure that comes \n     before us.\n\n  Senator Simpson continued:\n\n       I think the American people would strongly disapprove of \n     what is being attempted here. This kind of procedure should \n     not be used for a constitutional amendment. It is bound to \n     adversely affect--to some degree the legitimacy of the \n     process. I know it will affect us all greatly if this \n     amendment is passed without adequate consideration by the \n     present Senate.\n\n  And he added the following, and having served with Senator Simpson, I \ncan imagine the gentle irony in his voice:\n\n       Perhaps I will eventually learn that Senators do not have \n     time to make considered decisions even on amendments to the \n     Constitution. . . . However, I am not at that point yet. I \n     trust it will never be bad form in the U.S. Senate to demand \n     respect for the legislative process.\n\n  Finally, let me quote the then-ranking member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Strom Thurmond, who served in this body for nearly a \nhalf century and as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee for 6 years. \nSenator Thurmond strongly supported his colleague, the Senator from \nUtah. He said:\n\n       The best place to study these issues is before the full \n     Judiciary Committee of the U.S. Senate. I see no reason why \n     this committee should be short circuited by this bill not \n     being referred here. If a bill of this nature is not going to \n     be referred to a committee to consider it, I do not know why \n     we need Committees in the U.S. Senate.\n\n  Senator Thurmond concluded:\n\n       The Judiciary Committee is the proper machinery for \n     referral of this resolution. It is set up under our rules for \n     considering a measure of this kind. It should be utilized and \n     should not be sidestepped as is attempted to do here with \n     this procedure.\n\n  This debate, which took place just over 25 years ago, had a good \noutcome. The Senate voted to send the constitutional amendment back to \nthe Judiciary Committee. Those Senators who urged the Senate not to \nbypass the committee process prevailed.\n  Now, a quarter of a century later, we are in a similar situation. All \nof the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee sent a letter to the \nCommittee Chairman a few weeks ago, urging him to follow regular order \non this amendment and let the full Committee and Subcommittee on the \nConstitution debate and mark up this constitutional amendment. I ask \nthat our letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    June 25, 2004.\n     Honorable Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Last week, the Republican leadership \n     announced that it will bring the Federal Marriage Amendment \n     (``FMA'') to the floor of the Senate during the week of July \n     12. Press reports indicate that this particular date was \n     chosen because some want to have a vote on this amendment \n     prior to the Democratic convention at the end of the month. \n     We urge you to prevail upon your colleagues in the leadership \n     to\n\n[[Page S7964]]\n\n     allow the Judiciary Committee and the Subcommittee on the \n     Constitution, Civil Rights, and Property Rights to debate and \n     mark up the amendment prior to its being taken up on the \n     floor. The Judiciary Committee has a long and productive \n     tradition of considering amendments to the Constitution. We \n     believe that breaking with that tradition in this instance \n     would be a serious mistake.\n       The FMA has never before been considered by the Senate. It \n     is a controversial measure sure to inspire heated debate on \n     the floor and in the country. So far, four hearings have been \n     held on this topic in both the Senate and the House. \n     Religious leaders, legal scholars, legislators, psychologists \n     and other health professionals, and advocates for children \n     and families are divided on the need to amend the \n     Constitution in this way. It seems clear to us that there is \n     no consensus in the Senate, or in the country, that this \n     amendment is needed or appropriate.\n       Furthermore, while the language of the FMA has recently \n     been modified, there is still significant doubt as to its \n     intent and effect. In these circumstances, we believe it is \n     premature to consider the amendment at all, but at the very \n     least, consideration by the Judiciary Committee may clarify \n     and even narrow the issues for the floor.\n       As you know, it is highly unusual for a constitutional \n     amendment to come to the Senate floor without committee \n     action. In the last decade, constitutional amendments \n     relating to a balanced budget, term limits, flag desecration, \n     and victims rights have all gone through the Judiciary \n     Committee prior to receiving floor consideration. The only \n     amendment that received a floor vote without first being \n     marked up in committee was Sen. Hollings' campaign finance \n     constitutional amendment. That measure was discharged from \n     committee by unanimous consent so it could be debated on the \n     floor during debate on campaign finance reform legislation.\n       You will undoubtedly recall that during the 96th Congress, \n     a constitutional amendment providing for the direct election \n     of the President and Vice-President was brought directly to \n     the Senate floor. You argued strenuously at that time for \n     ``regular order'': ``As the ranking minority member of the \n     Committee on the Judiciary, Subcommittee on the Constitution, \n     I feel very strongly that there are ways to propose \n     constitutional amendments and there are ways not to propose \n     constitutional amendments. . . . I think this is the way not \n     to propose a constitutional amendment. . . . To bypass the \n     committee is, I think, to denigrate the committee process, \n     especially when an amendment to the Constitution of the \n     United States of America, the most important document in the \n     history of the Nation, is involved.'' Cong. Rec. 5003-5004 \n     (Mar. 14, 1979). Your arguments prevailed and the Senate \n     agreed to recommit the amendment to the Judiciary Committee.\n       Mr. Chairman, you were right in 1979 that the proper course \n     to follow when an amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States is proposed is to allow the Judiciary Committee to \n     consider it and report it to the floor before the full Senate \n     is asked to debate it. That is the course that should be \n     followed here. We hope you will continue to protect the \n     jurisdiction of the Committee in discussions with those who \n     want to rush the Senate into a premature vote for political \n     reasons.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n         Patrick Leahy, Herb Kohl, Charles E. Schumer, Edward M. \n           Kennedy, Dianne Feinstein, Richard J. Durbin, Joseph R. \n           Biden, Jr., Russell D. Feingold, John Edwards.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Unfortunately, our pleas have fallen on deaf ears. The \nJudiciary Committee, which in the last decade has considered and \nreported to the floor constitutional amendments dealing with a balanced \nbudget, term limits, flag desecration, and victims' rights has been \nbypassed for this Federal marriage amendment. I have not heard a \ncompelling argument explaining why the committee process should be \nignored in this case.\n  In fact, I have not heard even a remotely persuasive argument of any \nkind why the committee process should be bypassed.\n  The committee process is even more important for this amendment than \nfor some of the amendments we have considered recently. This amendment \nis being considered for the first time in the Senate. Changes have been \nmade to the language of the amendment within the past few months. Just \nyesterday, we heard that further changes are being contemplated by some \nsupporters of the amendment. There is significant doubt about how this \namendment will be interpreted and what effect it will have on a whole \nvariety of state and local laws and ordinances. It is exactly in this \nsituation that the committee process can be very helpful. Issues can be \nexplored in depth and modifications can be offered to clarify the \nmeaning and effect of the amendment. It is not clear what would happen \nin our committee if we were given the opportunity to mark up this \namendment. But I know we would have a much better idea of what the \namendment does and doesn't do than we have today.\n  The Framers of the Constitution deliberately put into place a \ndifficult process for amending the Constitution to prevent the \nConstitution from being used as a tool for enacting policies better \nleft to the legislative process. A proposed amendment must pass both \nhouses of Congress by a two-thirds majority, not a simple majority. \nAfter a proposed amendment has passed both Houses, it must be ratified \nby three-fourths of the states.\n  Citizens for the Constitution, a bipartisan blue-ribbon committee of \nformer public officials, journalists, professors, and others, has \nsuggested a set of guidelines for evaluating proposed amendments to the \nConstitution. The members of this committee are people who do not \nnecessarily agree with each other on the substantive merits of proposed \namendments, but they do agree that a deliberative, respectful process \nshould be followed.\n  Citizens for the Constitution reports that in the history of our \nnation, more than 11,000 proposed constitutional amendments have been \nintroduced in Congress, but only 33 have received the needed \ncongressional supermajorities and only 27 of those have been ratified \nby three-fourths of the States. The bar for amending our Constitution \nis very high indeed.\n  One guideline from Citizens for the Constitution, is particularly \nrelevant to our discussion today. The guidelines ask, ``has there been \na full and fair debate on the merits of the proposed amendment?'' In \nthis case, the answer is no. There has not been a full debate. We have \nhad four hearings in the Judiciary Committee but there are still \nunanswered questions about this amendment. This is especially troubling \nbecause the sponsors of the amendment have changed its text during the \ncourse of our hearings and even stated conflicting interpretations of \ntheir amendment. The committee process could help us sort these issues \nout and narrow them for the floor. But the committee process has been \nabandoned for this amendment. That is a real shame.\n  The current procedural situation highlights the problem with \nbypassing the Judiciary Committee. The Senator from Colorado introduced \nthe first version of the Federal marriage amendment in November of last \nyear. A revised version was then introduced the morning of a hearing in \nthe Judiciary Committee in March of this year.\n  Now, after bypassing the committee to bring the amendment to the \nfloor of the Senate, we hear that supporters want a vote on yet another \nversion of the amendment. We had four hearings in the Judiciary \nCommittee on the issue of same sex marriage, but none of them concerned \nthis new text that the leadership now wants to bring to a vote. That is \nwhy we needed a subcommittee and committee markup on this amendment. So \nalternative language could be considered and debated. That didn't \nhappen here and that is why there is ``disarray'' among supporters of \nthe amendment as one press report put it this morning. So instead of an \nup or down vote on the amendment before us, we will most likely have a \nprocedural vote tomorrow. And the reason for that, make no mistake, is \nthat this amendment simply was not ready for floor consideration. It \nwasn't ready. It should have gone through the Judiciary Committee.\n  Aside from my objection to the failure to follow the proper process \nand allow committee consideration of this amendment, as was so \neloquently argued 25 years ago by the Senator from Utah, Senator \nSimpson and Senator Thurmond, I also object to this amendment on the \nmerits.\n  There is no doubt that the proposed federal marriage amendment would \nalter the basic principles of federalism that have served our nation \nwell for over 200 years. Our Constitution granted limited, enumerated \npowers to the Federal Government, while reserving the remaining issues \nof government, including family law, to State governments. Marriage has \ntraditionally been regulated by the States. As Professor Dale Carpenter \ntold the Constitution Subcommittee last September, ``never before have \nwe adopted a constitutional amendment to limit the States' ability to \ncontrol their own family law.''\n  Yet, that is exactly what this proposed amendment would do. It would\n\n[[Page S7965]]\n\nlimit the ability of states to make their own judgments as to how best \nto define and recognize marriage or any legally sanctioned unions.\n  Surely both Republicans and Democrats can agree that marriage is best \nleft to the States and religious institutions.\n  One of our distinguished former colleagues, Republican Senator Alan \nSimpson, opposes an amendment to the Constitution on marriage. In an \nop-ed in the Washington Post last September, he stated:\n\n       In our system of government, laws affecting family life are \n     under the jurisdiction of the states, not the federal \n     government. This is as it should be. . . . [Our Founders] saw \n     that contentious social issues would be best handled in the \n     legislatures of the states, where debates could be held \n     closest to home. That's why we should let the states decide \n     how best to define and recognize any legally sanctioned \n     unions--marriage or otherwise.\n\n  Columnist William Safire has also urged his conservative colleagues \nto refrain from amending the Constitution in this way. Commentator \nGeorge Will takes the same position.\n  I recognize that the current debate on same-sex marriage was hastened \nby a decision of the highest court in Massachusetts issued last fall. \nThat decision, the Goodridge decision, said that the state must issue \nmarriage licenses to same-sex couples. But the court did not say that \nother States must do so. And it did not say that churches, synagogues, \nmosques, or other religious institutions must recognize same-sex \nunions. Even Governor Romney, who testified before the committee at our \nlast hearing, admitted that the court's decision in no way requires \nreligious institutions to recognize same-sex unions. No religious \ninstitution is required to recognize same-sex unions in Massachusetts \nor elsewhere. That was true before the Goodridge decision, and it \nremains true today.\n\n  I might add, that this Federal amendment would appear to interfere \nwith the will of the people of Massachusetts who have already taken \nsteps to respond to their court's decision. It would very likely \nnullify the state constitutional amendment that is currently pending in \nMassachusetts.\n  Now, the supporters of the Federal marriage amendment would have \nAmericans believe that if same-sex couples are allowed to marry in \nMassachusetts, we will soon see courts in other states requiring those \nStates to recognize same-sex marriages, too. But this is a purely \nhypothetical concern, hardly a sound basis for amending our Nation's \ngoverning charter.\n  As Professor Lea Brilmayer testified at a Constitution Subcommittee \nhearing, no court has required a State to recognize a same-sex marriage \nperformed in another State. And as Professor Carpenter testified, ``the \nFull Faith and Credit Clause has never been understood to mean that \nevery state must recognize every marriage performed in every other \nstate. Each state may refuse to recognize a marriage performed in \nanother state if that marriage would violate the public policy of that \nstate.''\n  In fact, Congress and most States have already taken steps to \nreaffirm this principle. And these actions so far stand unchallenged. \nIn 1996, Congress passed the Defense of Marriage Act, a bill I did not \nsupport, but it is now the law. DOMA is effectively a reaffirmation of \nthe Full Faith and Credit Clause as applied to marriage. It states that \nno State shall be forced to recognize a same-sex marriage authorized by \nanother state.\n  In addition, 38 States have passed what have come to be called \n``State DOMAs,'' declaring as a matter of public policy that they will \nnot recognize same-sex marriages.\n  There has not yet been a successful challenge to the Federal or State \nDOMAs. Of course, it is possible that the law could change. A case \ncould be brought challenging the Federal DOMA or a State DOMA, and the \nSupreme Court could strike it down. But do we really want to amend the \nConstitution just in case the Supreme Court in the future reaches a \nparticular result? We should all pause and think about the \nramifications of our action before we launch a preemptive strike \nagainst the governing document of this Nation.\n  Former Representative Bob Barr, the author of the Federal DOMA, \nstrongly opposes amending the Constitution. He believes that amending \nthe Constitution with publicly contested social policies would \n``cheapen the sacrosanct nature of that document.''\n  He also warned:\n\n       We meddle with the Constitution to our own peril. If we \n     begin to treat the Constitution as our personal sandbox, in \n     which to build and destroy castles as we please, we risk \n     diluting the grandeur of having a Constitution in the first \n     place.\n\n  My colleagues, those are the words of the author of the Federal DOMA \nstatute. That is what he said about the wisdom of trying to amend the \nConstitution in this manner.\n  Concerns have also been raised that the Federal marriage amendment \ncould prevent the people of a State from choosing to recognize civil \nunions or grant domestic partnership benefits at the State level. The \nproposed amendment could be construed to challenge already existing \ncivil union and domestic partnership laws or to bar future attempts to \nenact such laws. Representative Barr also warned that the proposed \nmarriage amendment could apply to not only States, but private sectors \nas well. Certainly, our hearings in the Judiciary Committee did not lay \nthese concerns to rest. If anything, they made them stronger.\n  We should not seek to amend the Constitution in a way that would \nreduce its grandeur. Under our longstanding system of federalism, we \nshould leave the regulation of marriage to the States and religious \ninstitutions and get to work on the real issues that Americans are \nfacing and deserve our attention and action.\n  As I stand here, there are Americans across our country out of work, \nlanguishing in failing schools, struggling to pay the month's bills, or \nworrying about their lack of health insurance. Instead of spending our \nlimited time this session on a proposal that is destined to fail and \nwill only divide Americans from each other, we should be addressing the \nissues that will make our Nation more secure and the future of our \nfamilies brighter.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this ill-advised and divisive \nconstitutional amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I think under the previous consent order \nwe would now go to 30 minutes on this side and then over to the Senator \nfrom Illinois for the next 30 minutes. We may, in fact, depending on \nwho shows up, try to divide our 30 minutes among several Senators. I \nask unanimous consent that we be allowed to do so in case there is any \ndoubt.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I am delighted that we are finally \nbeginning to have a real debate on the floor of the Senate on the \nimportance of preserving traditional marriage. Up until this point, I \nam sorry to say, we really hadn't had much of a debate because our \nattempts to raise this issue, starting on Friday, had been met mainly \nwith silence from the other side. But we have had a number of \nSenators--Senators Boxer, Reid, now Feingold--who have spoken and \nstated their objections. I would like to respond briefly. I believe \nthen that Mr. Inhofe, the Senator from Oklahoma, will be here. I will \ncertainly turn to him.\n  First of all, we are told by the distinguished Democratic whip that \nRepublicans have raised a political issue. I would suggest to you that \nwhen judges in Massachusetts and elsewhere threaten to mandate same-sex \nmarriage on the people of this country without the opportunity for the \npeople of this country or their elected representatives to cast a vote \nor to have a voice in that decision, that is not a vote in favor of \ndemocratic government, one preserved by our Constitution that \nrecognizes the sovereignty of a free people, not of a few life-tenured \njudges or perhaps judges who none of us have had a chance to vote on or \nto express any disapproval of in terms of judges from Massachusetts who \nhave radically redefined the institution of marriage in that State.\n  Contrary to the hopeful expressions by some of my colleagues and \nperhaps others in the media, this is not an issue that can just be \nconfined to one State, the State of Massachusetts, because, in fact, \nsame-sex couples have gone to that State and have taken advantage of \nthis new law and then moved back to their States of residence, 46 \ndifferent States. And then, of course, we understand the process. And \nthen a number\n\n[[Page S7966]]\n\nof those have, in turn, filed lawsuits in their home States seeking to \nforce legal recognition on their same-sex marriage that was conducted \nin Massachusetts in their home State.\n\n  This is not an isolated event. This is part of a long-term litigation \nstrategy. Indeed, we know that even as long ago as when the Defense of \nMarriage Act was passed by this body overwhelmingly--I believe it was \n85 Senators who voted in favor of it on a bipartisan basis--there were \nsome Senators back then who, of course, didn't vote for it, such as the \nSenator from Wisconsin, as is certainly his privilege. But we know that \nothers did not vote for it at the time, including Senator Kerry, who \nsaid at the time:\n\n       DOMA is unconstitutional, unnecessary, and unprecedented. \n     This is an unconstitutional, unprecedented, unnecessary, and \n     meanspirited bill.\n\n  At the same time, of course, 85 of his colleagues in this body on a \nbipartisan basis sought to express their confidence in the importance \nof preserving traditional marriage back then. Then, of course, there \nwere other Senators who made the same expression.\n  Legal scholars have for some time now, including Laurence Tribe from \nHarvard Law School, Cass Sunstein, and others, expressed their opinion \nas a legal matter that the Defense of Marriage Act is unconstitutional, \nand then we have, most recently, the most recent edition of the Harvard \nLaw Review, which is entitled ``Litigating The Defense of Marriage Act, \nThe Next Battleground For Same-Sex Marriage.'' This literally sets out \na roadmap for any lawyer who wants to challenge the preservation of \ntraditional marriage in their State or, indeed, in any State in the \nUnited States by seeking a judicial declaration in a court that the \nFederal Constitution mandates same-sex marriage.\n  So this is not some political issue that we or the leadership on this \nside of the aisle dreamed up. This is a debate that has been raging for \nsome time now, at least since 1996, when Senator Kerry, Senator \nKennedy, and others expressed on the public record that they believed \nthe Defense of Marriage Act was unconstitutional at the time. They were \nparroting the statements of legal scholars and others to the same \neffect.\n  So this is, in my view, a question of whether we the people have a \nsay. As Abraham Lincoln said, we are a government of the people, by the \npeople, and for the people. But what our opponents on the other side of \nthe aisle and on this issue would say is, look, we have four judges in \nMassachusetts who have laid down the law in Massachusetts, and there is \nreally nothing you can do about it. The fact is, it has now been \nexported to 46 other States, and there are approximately 10 lawsuits \npresently pending to seek to force the recognition of those same-sex \nmarriages in those States, and this is part of a national litigation \nstrategy.\n  I say to those who think we ought to sit on the sidelines and remain \nspectators and remain silent, we are not going to remain silent, we are \nnot going to stand still, nor did the Framers of our Constitution \ncontemplate the people standing still when, by virtue of the passage of \ntime and experience, or in this case when judges seek to amend the \nConstitution under the guise of interpretation, none of the Framers, no \npart of the Constitution contemplates that the people of this country \nshould just remain silent.\n  If we want a government of the people, by the people, and for the \npeople, this is an important debate. I want to say something before I \ndefer to the Senator from Oklahoma, who wants to speak, just by way of \nresponse--and I will reserve the rest of my remarks for the remaining \ntime we have allotted in this 30-minute timeslot.\n  The Senator from Nevada, the distinguished Democratic whip, has \nchastised this side of the aisle, the Republican majority leader, for \nrefusing to accept their offer for an up-or-down vote on the Allard \namendment. What he didn't tell you is they stipulated that it must be \nwithout any amendments being offered on the floor. In other words, \ntheir offer attempted to stifle debate and stifle the right of Senators \nto offer amendments. They know, as we all know, there are other \namendments that have been discussed over the last year or so. I think \nif we want to have a full, fair, and honest debate, since there are \nconcerns there wasn't adequate deliberation in the Judiciary Committee, \nthis is the place to have it. We ought not to try to stifle debate or \nthe right of any Senator to offer an appropriate amendment.\n  At this point, I will reserve the remainder of our allotted time and \nask that the Senator from Oklahoma be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. President, I have been watching, with a great deal of interest, \nthe debate that has been taking place. I took some time last night to \nget what I believe to be very salient quotes. One is by an Irish poet, \nWilliam Yeats:\n\n       I think a man and a woman should choose each other for \n     life, for the simple reason that a long life with all its \n     accidents is barely enough time for a man and a woman to \n     understand each other and . . . to understand is to love.\n\n  I think there are several of us in this room, including the Presiding \nOfficer, who understand very well what Dr. Yeats is talking about.\n  The next one comes out of the Talmud, the Jewish oral interpretation \nof the Torah:\n\n       A wife is the joy of a man's heart.\n\n  Mark Twain said:\n\n       After all these years, I see that I was mistaken about Eve \n     in the beginning; it is better to live outside the Garden \n     with her than inside it without her.\n\n  Homer, the Greek philosopher, said:\n\n       There is nothing nobler or more admirable than when two \n     people who see eye-to-eye keep house as man and wife, \n     confounding their enemies and delighting their friends.\n\n  William Penn said:\n\n       Between a man and his wife nothing ought to rule but love.\n\n  Andrew Jackson said:\n\n       Heaven will be no heaven to me if I do not meet my wife \n     there.\n\n  Those things sound good and poetic. I happen to have been married for \n45 years. My wife and I have 20 kids and grandkids and it started just \nwith us. We think about the tradition in this country and how it has \nbeen this way as long as we can remember.\n  I have heard people say on this floor, when talking about this issue, \nthat this perhaps should be a State issue. As a general rule, you will \nnot find anybody who is a stronger supporter of State rights than I am. \nBut this is a national issue. The definition of marriage is and has \nbeen a national issue.\n  In the late 19th century, Congress would not admit Utah into the \nUnion unless it abolished polygamy and committed to the common national \ndefinition of marriage as one man and one woman.\n  In 1996, Congress passed a Defense of Marriage Act into law, which \ndefines marriage as one man and one woman for the purposes of all \nFederal law.\n  Another, and perhaps more compelling, argument that this should be \nhandled on a Federal level is that people constantly travel and \nrelocate across State lines throughout the Nation. Same-sex couples are \nalready traveling across country to get married. As a result of this \nmobility, same-sex couples with marriage certificates will become \nentangled in the legal systems of other States in which they live. They \nwill do business, buy and sell property, write wills, commit and suffer \ntorts, go to the hospital, get divorced, and have custody battles over \ntheir children.\n  A State-by-State approach to gay marriage will be a logistical and \nlegal mess that will force the courts to intervene and require all \nStates to recognize same-sex marriages. This is the only possible \noutcome.\n  This issue needs to be addressed now. The definition of marriage must \nbe addressed, and it must be addressed now. Activist lawyers and judges \nare working quickly through the courts to force same-sex marriage on \nour country.\n  In June of 2003, the U.S. Supreme Court signaled its possible support \nfor same-sex marriage when it struck down a sodomy ban in Texas. That \nwas Lawrence v. Texas. I am sure the junior Senator from Texas is very \nfamiliar with that.\n  Earlier this year, the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled that same-\nsex couples could marry, and that ruling went into effect on May 17. \nThe State's high court's ruling clearly ignored tradition--even its own \nState legislature.\n  In response to the courts ruling, the Massachusetts Senate drafted a \n``civil\n\n[[Page S7967]]\n\nunion'' bill specifically designed to satisfy the court's edict while \npreserving traditional marriage.\n  Despite the fact that all legal rights and benefits were provided in \nthe civil unions legislation, the court rejected this alternative \nlegislation, insisting on redefining marriage.\n  In his dissenting statement, Massachusetts Supreme Court Justice \nSosman said:\n\n       It is surely pertinent . . . to recognize that this \n     proffered change affects not just a load-bearing wall of our \n     social structure but the very cornerstone of that structure.\n       The majority stripped the elected representatives of their \n     right to evaluate ``the consequences of that alteration, to \n     make sure that it can be done safely, without either \n     temporary or lasting damage to the structural integrity of \n     the entire edifice.''\n\n  Even Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, in his testimony on June 22, \n2004, before the Senate Judiciary Committee, stated:\n\n       Marriage is not an evolving paradigm, as the court said, \n     but it is a fundamental and universal social institution that \n     bears a real and substantial relation to the public health, \n     safety, morals, and general welfare of all the people of \n     Massachusetts.\n       We need an amendment that restores and protects our \n     societal definition of marriage, [and] blocks judges from \n     changing that definition . . . at this point, the only way to \n     reestablish the status quo . . . is to preserve the \n     definition of marriage in the federal Constitution before \n     courts redefine it out of existence.\n\n  Not only has the Massachusetts court ruling affected that State, it \nhas and will continue to open the floodgate of similar decisions by \nother State courts across the country.\n  Lawsuits are already pending in 11 States to ask the courts to \ndeclare that traditional marriage laws are unconstitutional. Same-sex \ncouples from at least 46 States have received marriage licenses in \nMassachusetts, California, and Oregon and have returned to their home \nStates. Many of these couples will now sue to overturn their home \nState's marriage laws. There is already a lawsuit in Seattle to force \nthe State to recognize same-sex marriage in Oregon.\n  Unfortunately, the Federal Defense of Marriage Act, DOMA, does not \nprotect States from lawsuits such as these. State and Federal courts \nare poised to strike DOMA down under the equal protection and due \nprocess clauses in the Constitution. This would essentially force \nrecognition of same-sex marriages.\n  Why protecting traditional marriage matters: Marriage is about much \nmore than romantic love. I know from my experience. My wife Kay and I \nhave been married for 45 years. We understand these things. For the \npurpose of society and our legal system, marriage is the ideal \nenvironment for raising children and thriving communities.\n  Our laws protect marriage between a man and a woman, not because of \nlove or romance, but because marriage provides a good, strong, stable \nenvironment for raising children and is good for society as a whole. \nThe evidence of the benefits to children being raised by a mother and \nfather is overwhelming.\n  In societies where marriage has been redefined, potential parents \nbecome less likely to marry and out-of-wedlock births increase. This is \nbecause marriage loses its unique status in society as the institution \nwhere childbearing and parenting is centered. It becomes little more \nthan an optional arrangement, not the presumptive locus of family life.\n\n  According to a February article in the Weekly Standard by Stanley \nKurtz:\n\n       A majority of children in Sweden and Norway are born out of \n     wedlock.\n\n  A majority, that is more than half of the children are born out of \nwedlock.\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       Sixty percent of first-born children in Denmark have \n     unmarried parents--not coincidentally, these countries have \n     had something close to full gay marriage for a decade or \n     more.\n       In 1989, Denmark had legalized de facto gay marriage, and \n     Norway and Sweden followed in 1993 and 1994, respectively.\n\n  Additionally, according to Barbara Dafoe Whitehead, codirector of the \nNational Marriage Project at Rutgers, State University of New Jersey, \nin her testimony before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions Committee on April 28 of this year, marriage has many \nbenefits. She is speaking clinically when she gives these evaluations.\n  It can be a source of ``economic, educational, and social advantage \nfor most children. Children from intact families are far less likely to \nbe poor or to experience persistent economic insecurity. Estimates \nsuggest that children experience a 70-percent drop in their household \nincome in the immediate aftermath of divorce and, unless there is a \nremarriage, the income is still 40-45 percent lower 6 years later than \nfor children from intact families.''\n  Ms. Whitehead goes on to say:\n\n       Children from intact married parent families are more \n     likely to stay in [and do better in] school.\n\n  In fact, according to Patrick Fagan, a fellow at the Heritage \nFoundation, in his testimony before the Senate Subcommittee on Science, \nTechnology, and Space on May 13 of this year:\n\n       U.S. children from intact families that worship God \n     frequently have an average GPA of 2.94 while children from \n     fragmented families that worship little or not at all have an \n     average GPA of--\n\n  Some 30 percent or less.\n  Ms. Whitehead also says:\n\n       Marriage provides economies of scale, encourages \n     specialization and cooperation, provides access to work-\n     related benefits such as retirement savings, pensions, and \n     life insurance, promotes saving, and generates help and \n     support from kin and community.\n       On the verge of retirement, one study found married \n     couples' net worth is more than twice that in other \n     households.\n       A study of retirement data from 1992 by Purdue University \n     sociologists found that individuals who are not continuously \n     married have significantly lower wealth than those who remain \n     married throughout the life course.\n\n  That is significant because we have been talking about the emotional \nside. We have been talking about the things that I think are no-\nbrainers, that most of the American people, in spite of the arguments \nto the contrary, talk about. But there are economic reasons. There are \nreasons of prosperity and happiness that are being dealt with in this \nresolution.\n\n  I have quotes from a number of Senators and conservatives. They have \ndone such a good job, those who are in this Chamber. In listening, I \nhave found a few points they said that are worth repeating.\n  My colleague, Senator Allard from Colorado, believes our Founding \nFathers never envisioned that we would be changing the very structure \nof marriage, that we would be changing this core structure of society. \nWe are in danger of losing a several-thousand-year-old tradition, one \nthat has been vital to the survival of civilization itself.\n  This small group of activists and judicial elite, as my colleague \nfrom Kansas, Senator Brownback, said, ``do not have a right to redefine \nmarriage and impose a radical social experiment on our entire \nsociety.''\n  ``This is not a battle over civil rights, it is a battle over whether \nmarriage will be emptied of its meaning in contradiction to the will of \nthe people and their duly elected representatives.''\n  This is an ``assault on the American family,'' as my colleague, \nSenator Cornyn, the junior Senator from Texas, said.\n  And my colleague from Alabama, Senator Sessions, said:\n\n       If there are not families to raise . . . children, who will \n     raise them? Who will do that responsibility? It will fall on \n     the State.\n\n  This, to me, is one of the most troubling outcomes of the whole gay \nmarriage issue. As my colleague from California, Senator Boxer, said, \nwe have ``misplaced priorities'' in addressing this issue right now. I \nsay to my colleague, I do not think our priorities are misplaced when \nwe are looking at creating a whole new class of children from these gay \nmarriages who could end up completely dependent on the State, on the \ntaxpayers--the American people.\n  I do not think our priorities are misplaced when we are concerned \nabout following in the footsteps of countries where out-of-wedlock \nbirths have skyrocketed. And I do not think our priorities are misled \nwhen some activist, rogue judges and others are undermining the \nlegislative process in taking away the voice of our elected officials.\n  Additionally, several prominent, respected conservative voices in our \ncountry have spoken out against the idea of gay marriage and in support \nof the traditional definition.\n  According to ``Focus on the Family,'' headed by Dr. James Dobson--I \nwas just on his program a little while ago:\n\n\n[[Page S7968]]\n\n\n       Family is the fundamental building block of all human \n     civilizations.\n       Marriage is the glue that holds it together. The health of \n     our culture, its citizens, and their children is intimately \n     linked to the health and well-being of marriage.\n\n  Chuck Colson, a man who most people in this body know quite well, was \nthe founder of Prison Fellowship. He has this to say about the prospect \nof gay marriage:\n\n       The redefiners of marriage are working tirelessly. Their \n     agenda is to tear down traditional marriage and make it \n     meaningless by removing its distinctives.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       Marriage, as an institution between a man and a woman, is \n     basically for procreation.\n       Homosexual marriage, therefore, is an oxymoron. There is no \n     such thing. It is something else.\n       It is two people coming together for recreation, not for \n     procreation. Procreation can only happen between a man and a \n     woman.\n       Every society has recognized this, going back to the \n     beginning of recorded history. Societies recognize that it is \n     in their self-interest to preserve this institution and to \n     give it a distinct status under the law.\n       Marriage is the institution that civilizes and propagates \n     the human race. It is where children are raised and learn the \n     ways of right and wrong. Their consciences are formed in the \n     family.\n\n  Finally, the Reverend Billy Graham's son, Franklin Graham, was in my \nhometown of Tulsa a couple of weeks ago. He said:\n\n       There is a real movement for same-sex marriage. We could \n     lose marriage in this country the way that we know it.\n\n  That is really what this is all about. We can dance around it and try \nto cater to certain groups, but I find something that has served me \nwell for a number of years when something like this comes up, and that \nis to go back to the law, go back to the Scriptures. In Genesis 2:18, \n21-24, God said:\n\n       It is not good that man should be alone; I will make him a \n     helper comparable to him . . . and the Lord God caused a deep \n     sleep to fall on Adam, and he slept; and He took one of his \n     ribs, and closed up the flesh in its place. Then the rib \n     which the Lord God had taken from man He made into a woman, \n     and He brought her to the man. And Adam said, ``This is now \n     bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh. She shall be called \n     woman, because she was taken out of man.'' Therefore a man \n     shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, \n     and they shall become one flesh.\n\n  In Matthew 19:4-6, Jesus said:\n\n       Have you not read that He who made them at the beginning \n     made them male and female, and for this reason a man shall \n     leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and \n     the two shall become one flesh? So then, they are no longer \n     two but one flesh . . .\n\n  The reason I read these two Scriptures is because they were quoted at \na very significant event that took place 45 years ago. It was when my \nwife and I were married.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. ENZI. I ask unanimous consent that I be given an additional 3 \nminutes for a total of 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Nevada is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on a topic that is \nvery important. That is the preservation of the most important \nstructure in our society. I rise to speak on the topic of marriage and \nthe need for the Federal Marriage Amendment. But before I do, I want to \nthank my good friend from Oregon, Senator Gordon Smith, for the speech \nhe gave on this very topic last Friday. His speech was eloquent and his \nthoughts profound. For those who did not have the opportunity to see or \nhear the speech, I strongly encourage them to read it. I also want to \nthank the floor manager of this resolution, Senator Cornyn from the \nState of Texas, for his thoughtful commentary and his leadership on \nthis issue. And so I thank both Senators.\n  I have given a considerable amount of thought on the topic of the \nFederal Marriage Amendment over the last weeks and months. My thoughts \nhave focused on what the meaning and purpose of marriage is. All words \nhave meaning. The word marriage has meaning deep rooted in our culture. \nThere are certain words that have such an important meaning that they \ninvoke strong emotions within each of us. For me, marriage is one such \nword. The word marriage represents an institution with historically \nuniversal understanding. Its meaning is one that has been constant \nthroughout time and across all cultures. I can think of no other word, \nand no other institution, that enjoys such a special status with such \nan important meaning.\n  For me personally, I understand the importance that the presence of \nboth a father and mother has in the life of a child. I understand this \nbecause, for a time, I was raised by a single mom. I do not, in any \nway, want to suggest that single parents are not doing their best to \nraise their children. As a single mom, my own mother did her very best \nto take care of me, my brother and my sister.\n  Single parents are doing right by their children. Single parents, \nlike my mom, deserve to be praised. But those circumstances are not the \nideal in which to raise children. Marriage is that ideal.\n  When I was nine, my mom met and married the man who is my dad. With \ntheir marriage, there was finally someone in our home who was a strong \nmale role model for me and my brother. I finally had a positive example \nof what it meant to be a father and a husband. Someone I could look up \nto and someone I could emulate. My dad's presence in our house made an \nimmediate impact on me in a way that my mother alone simply could not. \nHis presence also impacted me in ways that has helped me love and care \nfor my own wife and my own children.\n  The presence of a mother and father in the life of a child is \ncrucial. Mothers and fathers bring their own special qualities to their \nown relationship and to the approach they take to raise their children. \nIt has been said that a boy will look to his mother as the type of \nwoman he wants to marry and his father as the model for how to treat \nher. For that reason, and so many more children need both a father and \nmother. That is the universally recognized ideal on which marriage is \nbased.\n  Marriage recognizes the ideal of a father and mother living together \nto raise their children. Marriage is the ideal that is the cornerstone \non which our society was founded. This Congress, and all previous \nCongresses, have enacted laws to further that ideal. In fact, in 1996, \nthis Senate passed the Defense of Marriage Act by a vote of 85 to 14. \nThe House of Representatives also passed DOMA overwhelmingly. My own \nState of Nevada has adopted a DOMA Amendment to our State constitution. \nAs required by our State's constitution, this amendment was adopted two \ntimes by the voters of my State. So I would hope that no one in this \nbody would take issue with the statement that marriage between one man \nand woman is the ideal. Congress overwhelmingly adopted legislation \nagreeing with that statement only 8 years ago.\n  For those who say that the Constitution is so sacred that we cannot \nor should not adopt the Federal Marriage Amendment, I would simply make \ntwo points. First, marriage, and the sanctity of that institution, \npredates the American Constitution. It predates the founding of our \nNation and even the landing at Plymouth Rock. Marriage, as a social \ninstitution, predates every other institution on which ordered society \nin America, and the world as a whole, has relied including even the \nchurch itself. Second, the Founding Fathers envisioned the possibility \nthat future generations may need to amend the Constitution. In their \nwisdom they allowed the amendment process to begin either with Congress \nor with the States. So we are considering this amendment, in the manner \ncontemplated by the Founding Fathers, which is to say consistent with \nthe Constitution itself.\n  It is with concern that I have read about how a few unelected judges \nand some locally elected government officials have taken steps to \nredefine marriage to fit their own agenda. It is not right to mold \nmarriage to fit the desires of a few, against the wishes of so many, \nand to ignore the important role that marriage has played in our \nhistory.\n  During the course of this debate, I have heard many people suggest \nthat the Federal DOMA law, which I referenced earlier, is not under \nattack. And that an amendment is premature\n\n[[Page S7969]]\n\nso long as DOMA is still law. But because of last year's Supreme Court \ndecision in Lawrence v. Texas, many Constitutional scholars believe \nthat Federal DOMA, and State DOMAs adopted in 41 other States, that \ndefined marriage as between one man and one woman will most certainly \nbe struck down.\n  Judicial activism is a huge problem in America. The Constitution is a \nliving document in that it can be amended by the process our Founders \nset up, but not by activist judges. So the question before us today is: \nWill the Constitution be adopted in the manner proscribed by that \ndocument or by unelected judges?\n  It does not appear that this amendment will pass this year. In fact, \nit may take years to adopt this amendment. But it is critical to have \nthis debate and vote here in Washington, DC so that the States can \ncontinue the debate and so that the people know exactly where each one \nof us stands on this issue.\n  In the end, for a healthy society, we need to have a tolerant society \nbut also a society which strives for the ideal. That ideal is for \nchildren to be raised by one father and one mother bonded by the \ninstitution of marriage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Texas has \nexpired.\n  The Senator from Illinois is now recognized for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, for those who are witnessing this debate \non the floor of the Senate, it is a historic moment. It is rare the \nSenate engages in a debate on the question of amending this document, \nthe Constitution of the United States. There are so many things that \ndivide us on the floor of the Senate, between Republicans and \nDemocrats, but there is one thing we are united behind, and that is our \noath of office. That oath of office is explicit. This, in part, is what \nit says. Each of us takes this oath. To the best of our ability we \nwill:\n\n     . . . preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the \n     United States.\n\n  Isn't it interesting that when this Constitution was written, our \nFounding Fathers wanted to make certain that whoever served as \nPresident, Vice President, Member of the House or Senate, would not \nswear their loyalty to the United States of America but would swear \ntheir loyalty to this document. You could not become a Member of this \nbody unless you were prepared, under oath, to say you would preserve, \nprotect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.\n  The Founding Fathers understood the importance of this document they \nhad written. They knew it embodied within its four corners the basic \nprinciples of America. It wasn't a dead document. It was a living \ndocument which could be changed. But I think the oath of office which \neach of us takes is a reminder of our solemn responsibility when it \ncomes to this Constitution.\n  We may propose amendments to laws, make motions on the floor, pass \nresolutions, make our speeches, but I am one who believes when it comes \nto this document we have a special responsibility. It is a \nresponsibility which requires respect and humility--humility.\n  Before this Senator from Illinois will propose a change in one word \nin this Constitution of the United States of America, I have to be \nconvinced, I have to be absolutely sure it is essential--essential for \nthis union to continue and essential for the rights and liberties of \nevery American citizen.\n  Oh, we debate bills back and forth. We change sentences, we change \npunctuation, we make wholesale changes in the law. But the laws come \nand go, as Members of the House and Senate come and go. This document \nendures.\n  Over 11,000 times Members of the Congress have proposed changing this \ndocument. Over 11,000 times they have come to the floor of the House or \nthe Senate and said: The Founding Fathers didn't get it right, they \ndidn't consider this possibility. And over 11,000 different times, \noverwhelmingly, their suggestions have been rejected. Why? Because of \nthe respect and the humility which each of us brings to this debate on \na constitutional amendment.\n  Today, those who are witnessing this debate are witnessing another \nattempt to amend the Constitution of the United States. How often has \nit been done? Since Thomas Jefferson's Bill of Rights--which originally \nproposed, I believe, had 12 amendments; only 10 were originally \napproved--we have only amended this document 17 times. One time we \nrealized we made a mistake. We passed an amendment prohibiting the sale \nof liquor in the United States and a few years later we repealed it. \nBut by and large, only 17 times in the course of the history of the \nUnited States of America has this Congress said this document is \ninsufficient; this document does not meet the needs of America; this \ndocument must be changed.\n  To those who are following this debate, and to my colleagues, I will \ntell them the proposed amendment before us today does not meet the \ntest. It does not meet the requirement to say to those who founded this \nNation and to all who carried on since that we need to pass this \nFederal marriage amendment. I believe it is plain wrong. It is wrong in \nthree specifics.\n  First, we are talking about the institution of marriage. \nTraditionally, marriage is defined by each and every State. One State \nestablishes a certain age of eligibility. Another State will establish \na certain blood test that may need to be taken. Another State will \nlimit whether certain members of families can marry. All of these \nprovisions and limitations on marriage are State and local \nresponsibilities. Not once will you find in this Constitution of the \nUnited States the requirement that the Federal Government in Washington \nestablish a standard for marriage in America. So what we are discussing \ntoday is a proposed amendment to the Constitution that is clearly \noutside of the purview and scope of this Constitution which we have \nsworn to preserve and defend.\n\n  Second, there is no court ruling that brings us to this moment in \nthis debate. It is not as if some Federal court or even a State court \nhas said this Constitution requires that people of the same gender be \nallowed to marry. Not one single court in America has said that. So we \ncome here today, the argument being made that we should preempt the \npossibility that at some time in the future some court will decide that \nin fact a marriage between people of the same gender in one State must \nbe upheld in other States. There has never--repeat, never--been a case \nin any State or Federal court that says that. Yet we come to the floor \nof the Senate today as if the decision were handed down last week and \nwe must stand up once and for all to preserve the right of marriage to \nbe confined to an institution between a man and a woman. It is \ntraditionally a State decision on what defines marriage. There is no \ncontroversy that brings us to the floor today.\n  What is even worse, we come to this debate with this constitutional \namendment which has been proposed, and we come to the floor to debate \nit without a single markup by the Senate Judiciary Committee to debate \nthe language that is being proposed. Does that show respect for the \nConstitution? Does that show the appropriate humility which every \nMember of Congress should have? Of course it does not. Those who wrote \nthis amendment were changing it by day. And now they want to change it \nagain. They tell us the language given to us last week has to be \nchanged again--maybe twice.\n  Does this strike you as a work in progress? Does this strike you as \nthe kind of language which should be put in this enduring document? Or \ndoes it strike you that we are taking a roller to a Rembrandt; that we \nare suggesting changes in our Constitution which have not met the test, \nthe test that they address an issue of enduring significance and that \nthe language crafted should stand beside our Bill of Rights?\n  Today they argue: We need to make a few amendments in this language. \nWe have been thinking it over this week.\n  What is wrong with this picture? Shouldn't we take a step back and \nask whether this is necessary? Ask whether, in fact, there is a court \ndecision which requires it? Ask whether the language which we are \nproposing is language which will endure for generations to come?\n  If we cannot answer each of those questions in the affirmative, then \nfor goodness sakes why don't we move on? I will tell you why we are \nnot. Because this debate is not about changing the Constitution--no. \nThey say in politics for everything that is done, there is a\n\n[[Page S7970]]\n\ngood reason and a real reason. The good reason that is being given for \nthis debate is to change the Constitution. That is not the real reason. \nThe real reason is to change the subject of the President's election \ncampaign because the Republican side of the aisle and those who are \nsupporting this administration don't want to debate this Presidential \nelection campaign on the issues most Americans identify as important in \ntheir lives. They don't want to debate the President's economic policy \nand the squeeze it has put on middle-income families. They don't want \nto debate what is happening in Iraq. They want to change the subject. \nThey want to debate the future of marriage in America. That, to them, \nis more important and that is why we are here today. That is why there \nare statewide referenda in many battleground States like Missouri. And \nthat is why we are hellbent to consider this amendment literally days \nbefore a certain political party coincidentally has its convention in \nthe State of Massachusetts. That is what this is all about--changing \nthe subject of the Presidential campaign.\n  Oh, they tell us in the Judiciary Committee: Incidentally, we are \ngoing to bring the flag-burning amendment up again, too. We have had \nthis amendment up before us at other times, but they are anxious for us \nto vote on this again before the election campaign.\n  Do you know what I think we need? I don't think we need an amendment \nto the Constitution. I think we need a permanent law of the land that \nsays there will be no constitutional amendment which will be proposed \nin a Presidential election year. Frankly, that will cause many of my \ncolleagues to suppress the urge to use this Constitution as some sort \nof a political platform to try to win votes in an election.\n  When you take a look at this particular amendment, you find, of \ncourse, that we are considering and taking up many days of debate \nrather than considering other issues we ought to be talking about here \non the floor of the Senate.\n  Do you recall the press conference last week when the Secretary of \nHomeland Security, Tom Ridge, told America of the danger of al-Qaida, a \nreal danger; that they are plotting massive casualties to be brought on \nvictims in America? We didn't know where or when, but he warned \nAmerica, along with the Director of the FBI.\n  Then you probably read yesterday speculation about whether we might \nhave to postpone a Presidential election because of terrorism. And you \nthink to yourself: For heaven's sake, I guess America is still in \ndanger; and sadly we are. Then you might think to yourself: I certainly \nhope the men and women serving in the Senate are doing everything they \ncan to make our Nation safer. That is a natural reaction, one which you \nmight expect.\n  All you have to do is look at the calendar of business of the Senate \non the desk of every Senator and turn to the back page. You will find \nthe status of appropriations bills that have not been considered by the \nSenate. Among the first two bills on the list is the Homeland Security \nappropriations bill--sitting on the calendar of the Senate for almost a \nmonth.\n  We are warned by this administration that our security is in \nquestion, that America may be in danger, and we are told by the \nRepublican leadership on the Senate floor that we don't have time to \nappropriate the money to make America safer. Instead, we are going to \ndebate a constitutional amendment over an issue that has not even \nreached the point in any court in the land to require a constitutional \namendment.\n  That is just one of many issues that we could be considering.\n  What have we done to try to reduce the squeeze on middle-income \nfamilies from increased costs for health care, increased costs for \nprescription drugs, increased costs for gasoline, increased costs for \ncollege education? The answer is nothing. We are too busy debating a \nconstitutional amendment about an issue that does not exist. It says \nsomething about the priorities of the leadership.\n  We have not passed a budget resolution this year. We have 12 \nappropriations bills, including the Department of Homeland Security, \nthat have not been enacted. This is all about changing the subject.\n  Paul Weyrich, CEO and chairman of the Free Congress Foundation, was \nvery direct and blunt. He recommended that the President ``change the \nsubject'' from Iraq to the Federal marriage amendment. It won't work \nbecause we pick up the newspaper every morning and we are reminded of \nthe brave men and women in uniform who are literally risking their \nlives in Iraq. We cannot, we should not, and we will not forget them. \nAnd our attention will not be diverted from the danger to their lives \nand the prayers and hopes of their families. Yet that is the political \nagenda. That is what is before us.\n  We have bypassed the Judiciary Committee. The suggestion has been \nthat we take this amendment which has been proposed, change it one, \ntwo, three, or four times, and vote on it. But the changes may include \nadding other amendments to it. Is that possible? Could we put in more \nthan one constitutional amendment? Of course. So we have turned into \nnot a Senate but a constitutional convention. Is that what we are \nsupposed to be doing, rather than appropriating money for homeland \nsecurity, rather than addressing the timely issues that America's \nfamilies are facing? I hope not.\n  We have had one hearing on the text of a proposed amendment, and it \nwas less than 24 hours after a new version had been written. This \nconstitutional amendment is changing on a regular basis.\n  I might say that Senator Cornyn of Texas, on Friday, came and spoke \non the Senate floor. He said those who oppose this constitutional \namendment, as I do, ``have chosen to boycott good faith desire to have \nan honest discussion about the issue.'' That was his quote. Senator \nAllard and others have said similar things.\n  For the record, the Judiciary Committee, the committee of \njurisdiction, has held four hearings on this issue. Senators Feingold, \nKennedy, and I attended all four of those hearings. There was no \nboycott involved. We attended those hearings and asked questions about \nthis issue. But there was never a markup. It was brought to the Senate \nfloor with changes that are being made as we speak.\n\n  In the past, Senator Hatch, now chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, rejected this. He said you can't bring a constitutional \namendment to the floor without at least going through the Judiciary \nCommittee and looking at the language and seeing if there are better \nwords. Here is what Senator Hatch said in 1979:\n\n       To bypass the committee is, I think, to denigrate the \n     committee process, especially when an amendment to the \n     Constitution of the United States of America, the most \n     important document in the history of the Nation, is involved.\n\n  That is what Senator Hatch said 25 years ago. But that is not the \nprocess he has followed as chairman of the committee today. He has \ntaken a much different path.\n  This would be, incidentally, only the second time in history in which \nwe would have enacted an amendment to the Constitution of the United \nStates which would restrict the rights of American citizens.\n  Historically, our amendment process has been to expand the rights and \nliberties of Americans, African Americans, women, and others to give \nthem voice in the democratic process. This would be the second time in \nhistory in which we would restrict the rights of Americans. The other \ntime, as I mentioned earlier, we said with the prohibition amendment \nthat we would restrict the right to sell liquor and alcoholic beverages \nin America. That is the one other time we did it. We did it because of \na temperance crusade brought on by some religious groups and others, \nand then realized a few years later that it was wrong. This would be \nonly the second time in history when we would use the amendment process \nto restrict the rights of American citizens.\n  We have no controversy at hand. The proposed amendment would be \nunique in that no constitutional amendment has been ratified in \nresponse to a State court ruling. There are four constitutional \namendments that overrule Supreme Court decisions, but no constitutional \namendment has ever been ratified in response to a nonexistent Supreme \nCourt ruling. That is the case here.\n  As I listened to those on the other side arguing earlier, I couldn't \nbelieve some of the things they said. The Senator from Texas said when \njudges in\n\n[[Page S7971]]\n\nMassachusetts mandate same-sex marriage on our Nation, they export that \nmarriage to other States. That is not a fact. There is nothing that has \nhappened in the State of Massachusetts which has changed the marriage \nlaws in Illinois, in Wyoming, in Nevada, in Texas. Nothing they have \ndone changes the standard for marriage in my State.\n  He went on to say that it is a question of whether the people shall \nhave a voice in this process. I certainly believe the people of America \nshould have a voice in the promulgation of law. But in this situation, \nthe people of Massachusetts have a voice and have a process and have \nbefore them a constitutional amendment which will eliminate same-sex \nmarriage but protect the rights of civil union. The people of \nMassachusetts will ultimately vote on that question as will their \nlegislators.\n  If you want to give the people of Massachusetts a voice in the \nprocess, they already have it. They are exercising it. There is no need \nfor a constitutional amendment to either embellish it or reduce it in \nany way.\n  Then, the Senator from Texas said we on the Democratic side were \ntrying to stifle debate on this constitutional amendment by not \nallowing the Republicans to amend it two, three, four times, or more. \nWe are not trying to stifle the debate. That is what this is all about. \nThis exchange is about debate. But how can you debate a moving target? \nHow can you debate a proposal to the Constitution of the United States \nwhich may change 15 minutes from now, an hour from now, tomorrow, or \nThursday? Shouldn't the Republican majority that brings this to the \nfloor meet their solemn obligation to put language before us befitting \nthe Constitution and not make this a construction project, a work in \nprogress? That is what they want to do.\n\n  The Senator from Nevada on the Republican side said earlier that \njudicial activists are taking away the power of the legislative branch. \nThat is not a fact. What happened in Massachusetts happened under the \nMassachusetts Constitution, which is being amended by their legislature \nas required and submitted to the people of Massachusetts. If the people \nare to have the final voice on this issue in Massachusetts, that is \nexactly what is going to happen.\n  The text of this proposed constitutional amendment, incidentally, is \ncontradictory and unclear. There are some who oppose same-sex marriage \nbut believe that civil unions should be allowed, as they are in many \nStates, and as recognized by many private companies. But the language \nof this proposed Federal amendment, as it stands today--it may change--\nsays:\n\n       Neither this Constitution nor the Constitution of any State \n     shall be construed to require that marriage or the legal \n     incidents thereof be conferred upon any union other than a \n     union of a man and a woman.\n\n  The operative words that should have been debated in the committee, \nand should be debated here are ``the legal incidents thereof.''\n  What does it mean? Let me give a practical example. In the District \nof Columbia, they have enacted a law that if you have a partner you are \nliving with of the same gender, you can declare that for purposes of \nbeing covered by your partner's health insurance. If one person in that \nhousehold, two men or two women, is working, and one is not, the person \nworking can claim the partner living at home as covered by the same \nhealth insurance policy just as it applies to men and women in \nmarriage.\n  What is wrong with that? What is so scandalous about that, that \npeople desperate for health insurance coverage would have someone they \nlove and share a home with be covered by health insurance?\n  Yet this constitutional amendment would put that and other legal \nincidents of marriage, such as civil unions, in jeopardy.\n  Let me note what has been said by Vice President Cheney. He was \ninvolved in a debate with Senator Lieberman 4 years ago in the Vice \nPresidential race, and this issue came up. Let me read what Vice \nPresident Cheney said when it came to the issue of defining marriage:\n\n       It's really no one else's business in terms of trying to \n     regulate or prohibit behavior in that regard. . . . I think \n     different states are likely to come to different conclusions \n     and that's appropriate. I don't think there should \n     necessarily be a federal policy in this area.\n\n  That is what Vice President Cheney said. I think he is right.\n  Let me read what Vice President Cheney's wife said. I am sure it took \ncourage for her to say it, but she did just this week. Lynne Cheney, \nthe wife of Vice President Cheney:\n\n       People should be free to enter into their relationships \n     that they choose. When it comes to conferring legal status on \n     relationships, that is a matter left to the states.\n\n  I am sure that did not make the Vice President or his wife popular in \nthe White House, maybe not among their Republican colleagues, but they \nare right. This is a decision which clearly should be left to the \nStates.\n  Today at lunch, the Senate Historian told us a story of Aaron Burr, a \nman who had served as Vice President and a man who left the Senate \nunder extraordinary circumstances on March 1, 1805. This is what Aaron \nBurr said as he left the Senate about this Senate:\n\n     . . . is a sanctuary; a citadel of law, of order, and of \n     liberty; and it is here--it is here, in this exalted refuge; \n     here, if anywhere, will resistance be made to the storms of \n     political phrenzy and the silent arts of corruption; and if \n     the Constitution be destined ever to perish by the \n     sacrilegious hands of the demagogue or the usurper, which God \n     avert, its expiring agonies will be witnessed on this floor.\n\n  You don't hear many speeches like that on the floor of the Senate \nanymore, but Aaron Burr was correct. This is where the debate has to \ntake place. This is where this debate on this constitutional amendment \nhas to end. This is where Members of the Senate who have sworn to \nuphold, protect, and defend this Constitution of the United States will \nremind our colleagues to take a step back and show the respect and \nhumility which this document deserves. To let this constitutional \namendment process be taken captive by those who are trying to win votes \nin November is wrong. Whether it is done by Republicans or Democrats, \nit is just wrong. I think the American people understand that.\n  There are strong feelings about a man and a woman that are shared by \nme and by others, but we also have strong feelings about this document, \na document which I have taken an oath under God to uphold and defend. \nAnd I will do that by opposing this amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Is the Senator aware, through the Chair I direct this \nquestion, in the State of Nevada, on two separate occasions, there was \na vote by the people of the State of Nevada on whether they should \ninclude in the Nevada State Constitution a prohibition for gay \nmarriage; is the Senator aware that took place?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I was not aware.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, it has taken place. It was long and \narduous. It took a period of years to accomplish.\n  Would the Senator agree that the State of Nevada had the right to do \nthat; whether they agree with the conclusion or not, didn't they have \nthe right to do that?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Certainly.\n  I say to the Senator, that is the argument that has been made on the \nother side, that the people should be allowed to speak on the issue, \nand if that is the case, in Nevada, Illinois, or wherever it might be, \nthen honoring that decision would seem to be consistent with the \nestablishment of all America.\n  Mr. REID. Through the Chair, I further question my friend, is the \nSenator aware in that debate over a period of years that lots and lots \nof money was spent in ads for and against the amendment, door-to-door \nactivities took place, many more grassroots activities, editorials in \nnewspapers, all in the State of Nevada? Whether you were for or against \nthe ban on same-sex marriages, these activities took place in the State \nof Nevada; and now in the State of Nevada, in its constitution, there \nis a prohibition.\n  The people of the State of Nevada had a right to do that; didn't \nthey?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I believe they do. I think the Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Is the Senator also aware that we have been told the reason \nwe are not going to vote on this amendment, Resolution 40 now before \nthe Senate, is that Senator Gordon Smith has another amendment he wants \nto offer and he does want a vote? Has the Senator been told that is the \nfact?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes, I have.\n\n[[Page S7972]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Through the Chair, I direct this to the Senator from \nIllinois. From today's Congressional Daily, p.m. edition, it says: \nSenator Gordon Smith, Republican from Oregon, today denied that he has \ninsisted the Senate vote on his alternative constitutional amendment \nbanning gay marriage, telling reporters he favors Minority Leader \nDaschle's proposal to vote up or down on the underlying amendment \nsponsored by Wayne Allard, Republican from Colorado.\n  Is the Senator from Illinois aware that Senator Daschle has requested \non more than one occasion that we have an up-or-down vote on the \nresolution that is now before this Senate, that we have all been \nstudying and doing our best to understand, that we should vote up or \ndown on this? Does the Senator agree that is what we should do?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes, I do. Let's bring this to a vote. The sooner, the \nbetter.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is aware, however, is he not, as stated by the \nmajority, this is a work in progress? They, obviously, are not sure \nwhat they want to vote on. Or is it just a political issue and they \nwant to vote on nothing, they want to have another class action where \nthey had victory in their grasp but they did not want to work on the \nsubstance; they wanted to maintain a political issue that Democrats \nwere obstructing, which we were not? Is the Senator aware, it could be \nthe same situation?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say there is a striking similarity. It appears they \nwant to vote more than they want an amendment. Let's be honest about \nwhat it is about. They want to put some Senators on the spot. Trust me, \nthe ads will be running, if they have not started already, in States \nacross the Nation. If you oppose this constitutional amendment, they \nwill say you are against traditional marriage. Virtually every one of \nour colleagues on both sides of the aisle, for that matter, support \ntraditional marriage between a man and a woman.\n\n  I have been married 37 years, and I think the Senator from Nevada may \nhave been married longer. I respect this institution and have committed \nmy life to it with my wife. I think we all understand that. But \nunderstand, as well, a ``no'' vote on this amendment will be used for \npolitical purposes to change the subject of the election campaign.\n  I say to the Senator from Nevada, as my time is closing, there is one \npoint I would like to make. Things have changed in my life experience, \nand in many others', over the time I have been in the Congress and even \nbefore. There was a time when, if there were gay members of a family, \npeople just did not talk about it. No reference was made to it; very \nlittle was said about it. It was the aunt or uncle who never got \nmarried and no one has talked about it.\n  That is changing in families across America. People have had the \ncourage to come forward and say: I have a different sexual orientation. \nFor some reason, God has made me with a different nature. I think more \nand more families are accepting of that fact, as they should be. I \ndon't know what God's plan was in bringing a man or woman to this Earth \nwith a different sexual orientation, but in many cases they have.\n  All we have said, those Members on our side, is though we may not \nsupport gay marriage or marriage of the same sex, we ask for tolerance \nand understanding.\n  The phone calls I have been receiving in my office have been phone \ncalls generated by people who sincerely support this amendment and many \nwho have some different agenda. It is, unfortunately, a very strident \nand hateful agenda. I hope that whatever the outcome of this amendment, \nwe will say to the American people: Be tolerant; be understanding. Some \npeople are different but they are our family. They are our neighbors. \nThey are our fellow Americans.\n  This proposed constitutional amendment is divisive and unnecessary, \nand contains many ambiguities and unresolved issues that have not been \nexamined or considered by the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  We have less than 30 legislative days left this year. There already \nare more pressing issues than we could possibly address in that short \ntime, without spending this week on a proposed constitutional amendment \nthat even its supporters acknowledge does not have the votes to \nsucceed.\n  In light of Secretary Ridge's announcement last week, we should be \nfocusing our attention on homeland security, including port and rail \nsecurity.\n  We must address the everyday needs and concerns of American citizens, \nespecially those being squeezed in the middle class.\n  Since President George W. Bush has come to office, average weekly \nearnings have risen only 1 percent, while gas prices have risen 25 \npercent; college tuition has risen 28 percent; and family health care \npremiums have skyrocketed by 36 percent.\n  Unfortunately, this Senate has ignored these concerns and has done \nnothing to increase wages. For example, we have not increased the \nminimum wage in almost 7 years, and the benefit of that increase has \nbeen completely erased by inflation.\n  Even worse, unless Congress acts to restrict the President's proposed \novertime regulations before our August recess, those regulations will \nslash the paychecks for thousands of Americans currently receiving \novertime compensation by 25 percent.\n  Finally, we still have not passed a budget resolution this year and \nhave 12 appropriations bills that must be enacted.\n  So why are we debating this constitutional amendment instead of \naddressing these more pressing issues?\n  I suggest that there is an effort here to try to divert American \nfamilies from their real concerns.\n  In fact, this is a strategy that was advocated by Paul Weyrich, CEO \nand chairman of the Free Congress Foundation, who recommended that the \nPresident ``change the subject'' from Iraq to the Federal Marriage \nAmendment.\n  We must not allow for such politicization of our Constitution--our \nNation's most sacred document. That is why I believe we must ban the \nproposal of constitutional amendments in a Presidential election year--\ncertainly within 6 months of an election.\n  By considering this issue outside of Presidential election years, we \nmay be better able to consider the implications of this proposal \nwithout added political pressures. This may be one reason why only 3 of \nthe 27 amendments to our Constitution have been passed by Congress in \nPresidential election years.\n  Of course, I do not mean to imply that those who support this \namendment have only political motives. Some of my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle sincerely believe that no issue is more \nimportant than this one.\n  However, the Judiciary Committee simply has not given this proposed \nconstitutional amendment the thorough and measured consideration worthy \nof a possible change to our constitution--certainly not if one believes \nthis is the most important issue facing our society today.\n  During the 108th Congress, the Senate Judiciary Committee has held \nhearings on four proposed constitutional amendments: victims rights, \nflag desecration, the continuity of Congress, and this one.\n  Three of those proposed amendments have been debated and marked up by \nthe Constitution Subcommittee, following the long-standing tradition of \nour committee. The amendment today is the only one that bypassed this \ntraditional consideration.\n  It is ironic that the victims' rights and flag desecration amendments \nhave followed the committee's traditional process, even though both \nhave been considered by the Senate in the past, while this proposed \namendment--which has never been considered by the Senate before--\nbypassed the full committee and subcommittee markups and barely even \nhad a hearing.\n  Although the Judiciary Committee and Constitution Subcommittee have \nheld four hearings on the issue of same-sex marriage, only one hearing \nwas on the text of a proposed constitutional amendment--and that \nhearing was held less than 24 hours after this new version of the \nproposed amendment was introduced.\n  Furthermore, unlike our committee's hearings on the victims' rights \namendment and flag discretion amendment, the only hearing on the text \nof this proposed amendment did not have a representative from the \nDepartment of\n\n[[Page S7973]]\n\nJustice to share the administration's views.\n  On the issue of hearings, before I go further, I would like to \nrespond to Senator Cornyn, who on Friday said that in committee \nhearings on this issue, Senators who oppose this constitutional \namendment ``have chosen to boycott a good-faith desire to have an \nhonest discussion about this issue.'' Senator Allard and others have \nmade similar comments.\n  For the record, the Judiciary Committee--as the committee of \njurisdiction--has held four hearings on this issue. Senators Feingold, \nKennedy, and I attended all four, and at each one, Democratic Senators \noutnumbered Republican Senators.\n  This is hardly evidence of a refusal to engage in an honest \ndiscussion. In fact, just the opposite is true: We are asking for a \nfull and thorough debate--but in the committee of jurisdiction, where \nsuch consideration is not only appropriate, but necessary, before we \ndebate this proposal on the Senate floor.\n  This request is the same as the one made by Senator Hatch in 1979, \nwhen a constitutional amendment regarding the direct election of the \nPresident and Vice President bypassed the Judiciary Committee and was \ndebated on the floor.\n  In that debate, Senator Hatch, then ranking member of the \nConstitution Subcommittee, said:\n\n       To bypass the committee is, I think, to denigrate the \n     committee process, especially when an amendment to the \n     Constitution of the United States of America, the most \n     important document in the history of the Nation, is involved.\n\n  Senator Hatch's argument prevailed, and the proposed constitutional \namendment was referred to the Judiciary Committee by unanimous consent.\n  Unfortunately, Senator Hatch has taken a different path with this \nproposed constitutional amendment, which is only the second \nconstitutional amendment in more than a decade to be debated on the \nSenate floor after being placed directly on the Calendar without \ncommittee referral or report.\n  I believe anything less than full consideration and debate by the \nJudiciary Committee not only would denigrate the committee process, but \nalso would be a disservice to those who sincerely believe this is the \nmost important issue facing our country. Without such examination, many \nissues in the proposal before us today will remain unresolved and \nunclear.\n  The most important issue we must resolve is whether a constitutional \namendment regarding marriage is necessary.\n  I am aware that Article V of the Constitution provides for \namendments, and I agree that the Constitution is a living document.\n  However, as James Madison wrote in The Federalist No. 49, the \nConstitution should be amended only on ``great and extraordinary \noccasions.''\n  Our Nation has heeded that advice, and although there have been more \nthan 11,000 proposed constitutional amendments since 1789, we have \namended our Constitution only 27 times, including the adoption of the \nBill of Rights in 1791.\n  We must continue to approach constitutional amendments with great \nhumility and respect. To do otherwise would be to take a roller to a \nRembrandt.\n  The last time Congress submitted a constitutional amendment that was \nratified by the States was more than 30 years ago, when the voting age \nwas lowered to 18. That amendment was appropriate because it followed \nthe principle of six other constitutional amendments that expanded \nvoting rights.\n  By contrast, the proposed amendment we are considering today would be \nthe first constitutional amendment to restrict the rights of \nindividuals since the 18th Amendment regarding Prohibition was ratified \nin 1919. Fourteen years later, that amendment was repealed.\n  This proposed amendment also would be unique in that no \nconstitutional amendment has been ratified in response to a State court \nruling.\n  Furthermore, although there are four constitutional amendments that \noverruled Supreme Court decisions, no constitutional amendment has been \nratified in response to a non-existent Supreme Court ruling. In other \nwords, this proposal is a solution in search of a problem.\n  In 1996--another Presidential election year--Congress passed the \nDefense of Marriage Act, under which no State can force another State \nto recognize the marriages of same-sex couples. In other words, each \nState has its own power to define marriage.\n  In the 8 years since DOMA was passed, it has never been successfully \nchallenged. Although many have speculated that it may be \nunconstitutional, not a single Federal judge in this country has \nindicated that DOMA is unconstitutional or unlawful in any way, shape, \nor form. DOMA is still good law.\n  Our country now has a preemptive foreign policy. I do not think we \nshould have a preemptive Constitution. This proposed amendment would \npreempt the possibility that the Defense of Marriage Act will be found \nunconstitutional. That is premature and therefore inappropriate for an \namendment to our Constitution.\n  The concerns I have raised thus far are reason enough to oppose this \nconstitutional amendment. However, I have not even discussed the text \nof the proposal itself.\n  This constitutional amendment States the following:\n  Marriage in the United States shall consist only of the union of a \nman and a woman. Neither this Constitution, nor the constitution of any \nState, shall be construed to require that marriage or the legal \nincidents thereof be conferred upon any union other than the union of a \nman and a woman.\n  These two sentences are contradictory. The first sentence states that \nmarriage must be between a man and a woman. But the second sentence \nsuggests that marriage other than between a man and a woman would be \npermissible as long as that recognition occurred through a statute, \nrather than constitutional means.\n  Which is it? Does this proposed constitutional amendment permit \nStates to enact laws that would allow marriage to consist of the union \nof same-sex couples? If so, the first sentence must be modified. If \nnot, the language in the second sentence must be more explicit to \nreflect the fact that this constitutional amendment would take away the \nright of States to define marriage within their borders.\n  Furthermore, the overall intent and scope of the first sentence also \nare unclear. At first, this language seems straightforward enough. \nHowever, there are at least two ambiguities regarding this sentence.\n  First, Representative Marilyn Musgrave, the House sponsor of this \nproposed constitutional amendment has stated the following:\n\n       In summary, the first sentence of the FMA is designed to \n     ensure that no governmental entity . . . at any level of \n     government . . . shall have power to alter the definition of \n     marriage so that it is other than a union of one man and one \n     woman.\n\n  However, as Representative Bob Barr noted in his testimony before the \nJudiciary Committee, the scope of this first sentence is not limited to \ngovernment actors. According to Representative Barr, this sentence \n``appears to bind everyone in the United States to one definition of \nmarriage.''\n  As a result, religions that marry couples of the same sex in \nreligious ceremonies may be barred from doing so. This blurs the line \nbetween church and State and threatens the Free Exercise Clause of the \nFirst Amendment.\n  While I take the sponsor at her word that this is not her intention, \nthe language again is ambiguous and must be clarified.\n  Secondly, it is uncertain whether arrangements such as civil unions \nand domestic partnerships could exist at all under this first sentence \nof the Federal Marriage Amendment.\n  Although Senator Allard and Representative Musgrave have stated that \nthis sentence should not apply to civil unions or domestic \npartnerships, lawsuits have been brought in California and Pennsylvania \nthat challenge domestic partnership laws based on the States' \ndefinition of marriage as being between a man and woman.\n  Dennis Archer, president of the American Bar Association, agrees that \nthere is ambiguity and sent a letter to the Senate which States the \nfollowing:\n\n       Despite the claims of the resolution's authors, it is \n     unclear whether a State would be prohibited from passing laws \n     permitting civil unions or domestic partnerships and \n     providing State-conferred benefits to the couples involved.\n\n  Based on these lawsuits and the ABA's opinion, the language of this\n\n[[Page S7974]]\n\namendment must be more explicit regarding whether civil unions and \ndomestic partnerships could exist.\n  The second sentence also is full of ambiguity and undefined terms.\n  For example, what does the term ``legal incidents thereof'' entail?\n  I asked Professor Phyllis Bossin, who is Chair of the American Bar \nAssociation Family Law Section and who testified before the Judiciary \nCommittee on behalf of the American Bar Association, what this phrase \nmeant.\n  She said there were hundreds of such rights and responsibilities and \nprovided a list of dozens of them, including the following: the right \nto visit in a hospital; the ability to authorize medical treatment; \nfamily health insurance; the ability to consent to organ donation; \neligibility for life or disability insurance; interstate succession, \nwhich is when a spouse dies without a will; the right to adopt; \ndomestic violence laws; the right to seek compensation for wrongful \ndeath; and the ability to file joint petitions to immigrate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Professor Bossin's list of selected \nlegal incidents of marriage be submitted for the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nResponse of Phyllis G. Bossin on Behalf of the American Bar Association \n              to Questions From Senator Richard J. Durbin\n\n\n a proposed constitutional amendment to preserve traditional marriage, \n                             march 23, 2004\n\n       (1) The Federal Marriage Amendment (S.J. Res. 30) states \n     the following: ``Neither this Constitution, nor the \n     constitution of any State, shall be construed to require that \n     marriage or the legal incidents thereof be conferred upon any \n     union other than the union of a man and a woman.''\n       (a) What does the phrase ``legal incidents'' of marriage \n     mean?\n       Answer: ``Legal incidents of marriage'' are those rights \n     that exist as a matter of law by virtue of the marital \n     relationship itself. Among the hundreds of such rights and \n     responsibilities, some are:\n       (1) Family law: (a) Distribution of property upon divorce \n     (particularly marital or community property); (b) Right to \n     seek spousal support (alimony, maintenance); (c) Right to \n     seek custody, visitation, parenting time; (d) Automatic \n     presumption of parentage for children born during marriage; \n     (e) Right to adopt; (f) Application of common law marriage \n     (in states that recognize common law marriage; (g) Right to \n     enter into prenuptial agreements; (h) Right to change name at \n     time of marriage; (i) Domestic violence laws (including \n     restraining orders and right to occupy home); (j) Duty to \n     support spouse during marriage; (k) Liability for family \n     expense; (l) Automatic coverage of spouse under most auto \n     policies; (m) Right to seek divorce; (n) Right to annulment; \n     and (o) Right to seek/receive child support.\n       (2) Taxation: (a) Right to file jointly; (b) Tax rates; (c) \n     Exemptions; and (d) Transfer of property between partners \n     without tax consequences (gift or estate tax).\n       (3) Health Care Law: (a) Surrogate decision making \n     (authorizing treatment or withdrawal of treatment); (b) \n     Access to medical records; (c) Right to visit in hospital; \n     (d) Consent to organ donation; (e) Consent to autopsy; (f) \n     Right to make funeral arrangements or dispose of remains; and \n     (g) Family health insurance, including rights under COBRA.\n       (4) Probate: (a) Intestate succession (rights to property \n     when one spouse dies without a will); (b) Protection from \n     being disinherited (right to challenge will or elect to take \n     against the will); and (c) Preferential status to be named \n     guardian or executor/administrator.\n       (5) Torts: (a) Right to seek compensation for wrongful \n     death and emotional distress; and (b) Right to seek \n     compensation for loss of consortium.\n       (6) Government Benefits and Programs: (a) Survivor benefits \n     (Social Security); (b) Military benefits (survivor, housing, \n     health care, PX); (c) Eligibility (and consideration of \n     family income) for welfare benefits; (d) Disqualification \n     from programs because of status of family member; and (e) \n     Disclosure requirements for public officials (and their \n     family members).\n       (7) Private Sector benefits: Labor Law: (a) Family Health \n     insurance, including rights under COBRA; (b) Eligibility for \n     life insurance (such as group coverage for spouses); (c) \n     Eligibility for disability insurance; (d) Right to take sick \n     leave to care for seriously ill spouse; (e) Qualified \n     Domestic Relations Orders (to divide pension benefits upon \n     divorce between spouses); (f) Ability to roll over spouse's \n     401(K) or other retirement accounts and tax deferral on \n     income distributed by deceased spouse; (g) Discrimination \n     based on marital status; and (h) Eligibility for family \n     memberships and discounts.\n       (8) Real Estate: (a) Eligibility for tenancy by the \n     entirety (traditionally only available to husbands and wives, \n     a form of tenancy in which the joint ownership and right of \n     survivorship generally cannot be eliminated as a result of \n     one spouse transferring his or her interest to the other); \n     (b) Need for spouse's approval for real estate transaction; \n     (c) Dower rights; (d) Homestead rights; and (e) Rent control \n     protections, where applicable.\n       (9) Bankruptcy: (a) Joint filing.\n       (10) Immigration: (a) Joint petitions to immigrate; and (b) \n     Preferred status for spouses or family members (immigrating \n     separately).\n       (11) Criminal Law: (a) Privilege not to testify.\n       (12) Miscellaneous: (a) Benefits and rules pertaining to \n     family farm; (b) Right to request and obtain absentee ballot; \n     (c) Consideration of family income for purpose of student aid \n     eligibility; (d) Access to campus housing for married \n     students; and (e) Economic disclosure requirements of public \n     officials (and spouse and family members).\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Under the Federal Marriage Amendment, none of these legal \nincidents could be provided by Federal or State courts. For example, \nProfessor Bossin cited a California trial court ruling that the State \nconstitution requires a partner in a same-sex union be allowed to sue \nfor the wrongful death of her partner. This proposed constitutional \namendment would preclude such a finding by a court.\n  This amendment also would have prohibited Vermont from establishing \ncivil unions, because a court had ruled that the law to create such \nrelationships was constitutionally required.\n  These examples go far beyond the scope of ``marriage,'' but they do \nnot tell even half of the story: Under the Federal Marriage Amendment, \nall State and Federal laws that provide any of these ``legal incidents \nof marriage'' could be struck down.\n  Senator Allard and others who support this amendment argue that it \nwould allow State legislatures to provide the legal incidents of \nmarriage through legislation, and that this amendment only constrains \ncourts. However, a more critical analysis--which, again, should have \nbeen done at the committee level--demonstrates that this simply is not \nthe case. For example, Professor Bossin has stated that the right to \nadopt is a legal incident of marriage. What if the Pennsylvania State \nlegislature enacts a law to allow same-sex couples to adopt, and \nsomeone challenges the constitutionality of that law?\n  Under the second sentence of the proposed Federal Marriage Amendment, \nneither the State constitution nor Federal constitution shall be \nconstrued to require that the right to adopt--as a legal incident of \nmarriage--be conferred upon a same-sex couple. Therefore, the court \nwould have no grounds on which to uphold the constitutionality of this \nlaw, and the law would be struck down.\n  The possibility that even laws conferring the legal incidents of \nmarriage could be invalidated raises serious questions about the intent \nand practical effects of the Federal Marriage Amendment.\n  This proposed constitutional amendment also undermines the democratic \nprocess regarding State constitutional amendments. In Massachusetts, \nthe proposed State constitutional amendment that may be on the ballot \nin 2006 would define marriage as the union of one man and one woman, \nwhile simultaneously establishing civil unions for same-sex couples \nwith ``entirely the same benefits, protections, rights, privileges, and \nobligations that are afforded to persons [who are] married.''\n  However, under the plain reading of this proposed Federal \nconstitutional amendment, the Massachusetts State constitution cannot \nbe construed to require the legal incidents of marriage to be conferred \nto same-sex couples. In other words, even if the people of \nMassachusetts voted to ratify this State constitutional amendment, the \nsecond part of that amendment--the part that establishes civil unions--\nwould be void because of the Federal Marriage Amendment.\n  Furthermore, because of the first sentence of the Federal Marriage \nAmendment, under no circumstance could the people or the State \nlegislature define marriage as other than between a man and a woman. \nHow, then, does the Federal Marriage Amendment achieve its goal of \nadvancing the spirit and principles of democracy.\n  Finally, I believe that words should not be added or deleted from our \nConstitution or from proposed constitutional amendments in a careless \nmanner. Therefore, I would like to know why the original version of \nthis proposal was modified by removing the reference to ``groups.'' The \nfirst version of the Federal Marriage Amend-\n\n[[Page S7975]]\n\nment, S.J. Res. 26, stated that marital status or the legal incidents \nthereof would not be conferred upon ``unmarried couples or groups.''\n  The current version states that marriage or the legal incidents \nthereof shall not be conferred upon ``any union other than the union of \na man and a woman.'' It appears to me this change was made because we \nare still struggling in some parts of our Nation with the idea of \npolygamy. Professor Bossin agrees that the current version of the \nproposed constitutional amendment does not explicitly prohibit \npolygamy, because polygamists enter into the union of a man and a \nwoman--they simply do it multiple times.\n  Was it in fact the intent of the sponsors to leave the door open for \npolygamy? If so, why should polygamous groups be treated differently \nfrom same-sex couples? If not, why was the reference to ``groups'' \ndeleted from the original version?\n  In addition to expressing my serious procedural and substantive \nconcerns, I would like to address some of the arguments in support of \nthis proposed constitutional amendment.\n  First, I have heard many Senators argue that this constitutional \namendment is necessary to provide the American people with a voice and \nto protect marriage from so-called activist judges. As I already have \nnoted, this proposed constitutional amendment actually undermines \ndemocracy by removing the power of the people and their elected \nrepresentatives to define marriage in their States, to provide for \ncivil unions in their State constitutions, or even to enact legislation \nto provide the legal incidents of marriage.\n  I also disagree that democracy is pitted against so-called judicial \nactivism. As University of Colorado constitutional law professor \nRichard Collins said, judicial activism is ``more of an insult than a \nphilosophy.''\n  To argue that judicial activism is contrary to democracy is to \nsuggest that a case like Brown v. Board of Education did not promote \ndemocracy in America. That was clearly an activist court, which took \ncontrol of an issue that Congress and the President refused to address: \ndiscrimination in our public schools.\n  In Brown v. Board of Education, an activist Supreme Court said we are \ngoing to give equal opportunity to education across America. Doesn't \nthat further democracy? When we celebrated the 50th anniversary of this \ndecision earlier this year, did anyone argue that it didn't?\n  The same would be said of Griswold v. Connecticut, in which the \nSupreme Court said that families had the right to decide their own \nfamily planning and that the State of Connecticut could not dictate to \nthem what family planning was allowed. It was a matter of privacy in \nfamily decisions. Was this an activist court in derogation of democracy \nthat extended to these families and individuals their right to privacy?\n  In Loving v. Virginia, the Supreme Court said that a ban on \ninterracial marriage was improper. Even though at the time, only 20 \npercent of the American people approved of such marriages, was that \ndecision contrary to democracy or did it promote democracy?\n  Time and time again, judicial activism has promoted democracy. Of \ncourse, we must take care that the courts do not go too far. But to \nsuggest that a constitutional amendment is necessary in this case \nsimply because it was a court ruling--incidentally, by a court that \nconsists of six Republican appointees and only one Democratic \nappointee--is controverted by the obvious legal precedent.\n  I also have heard many Senators argue that this constitutional \namendment is necessary to safeguard the best environment for raising \nchildren. I agree that children raised by two parents are, in general, \nbetter off than children raised by a single parent. Many studies \ndemonstrate this. But studies also demonstrate something else.\n  In 2002, the American Academy of Pediatrics--the largest pediatric \norganization in America--issued a report that Stated the following:\n\n       [T]he weight of evidence gathered during several decades \n     using diverse samples and methodologies is persuasive in \n     demonstrating that there is no systematic difference between \n     gay and nongay parents in emotional health, parenting skills, \n     and attitudes toward parenting. No data have pointed to any \n     risk to children as a result of growing up in a family with \n     one or more gay parents.\n\n  Dr. Ellen Perrin, a professor of pediatrics at Tufts-New England \nMedical Center, who is considered to be the Nation's foremost expert on \nchildren raised by same-sex couples, has studied same-sex couples and \nconcluded the following:\n\n       What we know for sure is that children thrive better in \n     families that include two loving, responsible, and committed \n     parents. We also know that conscientious and nurturing \n     adults, whether they are men or women, heterosexual or \n     homosexual, can be excellent parents. We have a lot of \n     research as well as clinical experience that provide evidence \n     for this fact.\n\n  This evidence is based on our Nation's experience with gay adoption. \nEvery State except Florida allows gay people to adopt.\n  Some States, including my home State of Illinois, allow same-sex \ncouples to jointly petition for adoption. Many others allow for second \nparent adoptions, a legal procedure which allows a same-sex co-parent \nto adopt his or her partner's child. These States have recognized that \nsame-sex couples can step into the lives of adopted children and \nprovide loving and supportive families.\n  Under this proposed constitutional amendment, it would no longer be \npossible for State courts to interpret their constitutions to allow \nsame-sex couples to adopt. Same-sex couples only would be allowed to \nadopt if explicitly permitted by State law--and as I have noted \nearlier, that State law could be challenged as unconstitutional and \nlikely would be struck down.\n  Would that safeguard the best environment for these children? If this \nSenate is interested in the best environment for our children, we \nshould fully fund No Child Left Behind, to provide all children with an \neducational opportunity and to fulfill the promise of Brown v. Board of \nEducation.\n  We also should make college tuition more affordable, and we should \nprovide families with affordable health care.\n  To conclude, I believe the definition of ``traditional marriage'' is \nan evolving one. One hundred and fifty years ago, ``traditional \nmarriage'' in America did not include the ability of African American \nslaves to marry.\n  One hundred years ago, ``traditional marriage'' in some Western \nStates did not include the ability of Asian Americans to marry. Just 40 \nyears ago, ``traditional marriage'' in many States did not include the \nability of African Americans to marry whites.\n  I understand that many supporters of this proposed amendment believe \nthat the situation we face today is a fundamentally different one--that \nwe must amend our Constitution to support the sanctity of marriage.\n  However, the sanctity of marriage is about the religious context of \nmarriage, not the legality of it. We must be careful to separate the \ntwo.\n  Nothing in the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruling requires a church \nto conduct or to consecrate a same-sex union. On the other hand, if \nthis proposed constitutional amendment were ratified, certain religious \nbeliefs regarding the sanctity of marriage would be enshrined in our \nConstitution. This would go beyond the question of legality into \nsanctity, and I believe that we must maintain the bright line between \nthe two that our Framers intended.\n  As one of my colleagues has said, ``I support the sanctity of \nmarriage, but I also support the sanctity of the Constitution.'' \nTherefore, I urge my colleagues to reject this motion to proceed to a \nconstitutional amendment that even the Republican leadership concedes \nis not ready for prime time.\n  Why else would they object to our unanimous consent request to have a \nvote on this resolution, without amendments?\n  The Republican leadership instead would prefer that we make it up as \nwe go along, with one, if not two, amendments here on the Senate \nfloor--amendments that could have been offered in a Constitution \nSubcommittee markup or in a full committee markup, had those not both \nbeen bypassed.\n  We are being asked to tinker with the words of our Nation's \nConstitution on the Senate floor, without even the benefit of committee \nanalysis on the impact of these amendments. Unfortunately, this is not \nthe first time we have considered a constitutional\n\n[[Page S7976]]\n\namendment on the Senate floor that was a work in progress, with the \nsponsors trying to make changes in the midst of a floor debate.\n  During the 106th Congress, sponsors of the victims' rights amendment \ntried to make modifications to that proposal during the floor debate, \nand ultimately, the motion to proceed to that constitutional amendment \nwas withdrawn. I believe that is the course we should follow here \ntoday. We either should vote on this resolution without amendments or \nwithdraw this motion to proceed. If this motion is not withdrawn, I \nurge my colleagues to vote against it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, to try and work out some housekeeping \naspects of what we are doing today, under the order that was entered \nlast evening, we are to be here until 8 o'clock with the time evenly \ndivided. I ask the Chair how much time remains for the minority and the \nmajority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority has 109 minutes, and the majority \nhas 141 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. The minority has 109 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, the distinguished Senator from Texas, I \nwould appreciate his making contact with the majority leader at the \nnearest possible time. We have people who have requested time on our \nside of about 140 minutes. That doesn't work under the 109 minutes. So \nit would be my thinking that maybe we may need a little more time \ntomorrow to continue. I know we have cloture to take place tomorrow. \nThe majority leader wanted ample time to debate. The Senator from \nPennsylvania was on the floor yesterday and was concerned that there \nwas not enough talk on our side of the aisle. I think we have taken \ncare of that today. But if maybe he could check with his leadership to \nfind out if we could stop at a reasonable hour tonight and then maybe \nhave a couple of hours in the morning evenly divided prior to the vote \non cloture. Right now we are going to have trouble cramming all of our \ntime in with what we have left.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I will be glad to do as the Democratic \nwhip requests and check with the majority leader about the time \narrangements.\n  Mr. REID. If I may ask one other question of the Chair, I was off the \nfloor when Senator Schumer asked consent that he and Senator Feinstein \nbe recognized before 5 o'clock. For how much time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. For 15 minutes total.\n  Mr. REID. So that is also something we have to deal with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nTexas is recognized for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I am elated that we are beginning to see \nengagement on this important issue by our colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle. I am always impressed with how articulate and forceful an \nadvocate our colleagues on the other side are, particularly the two \nSenators who have spoken so far this afternoon, Senator Feingold and \nSenator Durbin, with whom I have the privilege of serving on the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. There are some important answers to the questions \nhe raised. There are good answers that resolve each and every objection \nthat has been raised to the amendment.\n  First of all, I would like to respond to the rhetorical question both \nSenator Feingold and earlier Senator Boxer asked. They said: Why can't \nwe let people live their own lives?\n  This amendment is not about making it impossible for people to live \ntheir own lives. Indeed, I agree we should let people live their own \nlives. Of course, we don't believe at the same time that they should be \nable to radically redefine the institution of marriage in the process.\n  From the very beginning of this debate--and I am grateful this has \nbeen a civil, respectful debate--we have made it absolutely clear the \nAmerican people believe in at least two fundamental propositions when \nit comes to this issue. First and foremost, they believe in the \nessential dignity and worth of every human being. But at the same \ntime--and this is not a mutually exclusive concept--they believe in the \nimportance of traditional marriage as the most fundamental building \nblock of a stable society and in the best interest of children. I and \nothers on this side are here talking in support of this amendment and \nencouraging this debate because we believe very strongly that the \npositive case for traditional marriage must be made and we should not \nremain mere spectators on the sideline as judges in Massachusetts or \nanywhere else seek to amend the Constitution without the American \npeople having a voice in the basic laws that govern our institutions or \nour lives. That is what this debate is all about.\n  I found it interesting. Again, I have to hand it to the Senator from \nIllinois. He is a skillful advocate. He must have been one heck of a \nlawyer practicing in private practice. I bet he won more than his fair \nshare of his cases. But he speaks of our oath to support the \nConstitution. Certainly, I believe we all have taken an important oath \nto support the Constitution of laws of the United States. But I would \nlike to direct my colleague's attention to provisions of the \nConstitution he may have overlooked in that broad generalization he \nmade earlier about supporting the Constitution.\n  Indeed, one portion of the Constitution provides that ``all \nlegislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the \nUnited States . . .'' That is Article I, section 1. That is part of the \nConstitution we swore to uphold. And indeed, under that same \nConstitution, courts are given only judicial powers, not legislative \npowers. What we find ourselves having to do in this debate is talk \nabout the abuse of that judicial power, to in essence become a \nsuperlegislature and dictate a radical redefinition of the most \nfundamental institution in our society, the American family. But when \ncourts get it wrong--and indeed, this is part of the genius of our \nFounding Fathers--the Founding Fathers knew that experience, the \npassage of time, or perhaps even a runaway judiciary might make it \nnecessary for us to invoke another important part of the Constitution \nthat we are here invoking today. That is Article V of the Constitution.\n\n  Indeed, to the best of my count, there have been at least six times \nwhen the Congress has amended the Constitution in order to overrule an \nerroneous constitutional interpretation by the Federal courts. So we \nmake no apologies whatsoever in invoking the entire Constitution and \nthe entire process. We make no apology at not sitting back and letting \njudges dictate what the rules are that govern our society, our \nfamilies, and future generations.\n  Senator Feingold and Senator Durbin were concerned about the fact \nthat this amendment did not go through the Senate Judiciary Committee. \nActually, I was a little bit confused about Senator Durbin's position. \nOn the one hand, he said it did not go through the committee. On the \nother hand, he did concede the fact that there were four hearings of \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee on this issue, starting last September, \nand the most recent of which was on June 22, 2004, when Governor Romney \nof Massachusetts appeared before our committee to talk about what he, \nas the Governor of that State, is doing to try to get a constitutional \namendment to overrule the Massachusetts Supreme Court.\n  So we have had four hearings of the Senate Judiciary Committee. I \nknow there have been at least two other committees of the Senate to \nconsider this issue. It is important to put the concerns that were \nexpressed by Senator Feingold and Senator Durbin in that context.\n  As far as the language we are debating is concerned, the so-called \nAllard amendment, that was introduced shortly before, I believe the day \nbefore the March 23 hearing we had this year on the Federal marriage \namendment. Indeed, he had filed his original amendment--and this \nclarification was merely that--in November of 2003. So no Member of the \nSenate should be able to claim, in all fairness, of being surprised by \nthis or being blindsided. Indeed, this is an issue that has been much \ndiscussed since actually before but at least since the time in November \nof 2003, when the Massachusetts Supreme Court first handed down its \nedict rewriting the Massachusetts Constitution to provide a mandate for \nsame-sex marriage.\n\n[[Page S7977]]\n\n  Now, there has been some concern expressed--and I will point out that \nthe so-called Smith amendment, to which the Senator from Nevada \nalluded, is the first sentence of the Allard amendment. So it is \nimpossible for me to understand how they can claim to be surprised by \nan amendment that is just the first sentence of the two-sentence Allard \namendment. Insofar as Senator Smith's position, whether he intends to \noffer it--and I cannot vouch for what Congress Daily says, but it seems \nto be pretty reliable--there is a lot of concern--and I am one on this \nside--that we stifle debate by not permitting a discussion of \nalternative amendments, especially one that makes up the first sentence \nof this two-sentence amendment on which we are having the motion to \nproceed.\n  So there is no surprise. There is no trickery, no attempt to \nblindside our colleagues on the other side of the aisle. This is about \nhaving a full, fair, and open debate. I think that is what we are \ndoing.\n  I believe the Senator from Illinois expressed some concerns about the \nfact that no Federal court has yet mandated same-sex marriage under an \ninterpretation of the U.S. Constitution, and that is true. The fact \nalso is that there are at least four lawsuits currently pending \nattempting to do exactly that. Indeed, these are the latest lawsuits in \na long line of legal opinions rendered by legal scholars, from Laurence \nTribe and others, statements by Senator John Kerry and Senator Ted \nKennedy as recently as 1996 that the Defense of Marriage Act is \nunconstitutional.\n  This language, which I will read from an excerpt out of the Goodridge \nopinion in Massachusetts--and this is really, to me, very \ndisconcerting. The Massachusetts Supreme Court said:\n\n       But neither may the Government, under the guise of \n     protecting ``traditional'' values, even if they be the \n     traditional values of the majority, enshrine in law an \n     invidious discrimination that our Constitution, ``as a \n     charter of governance for every person properly within its \n     reach,'' forbids.\n\n  In that excerpt, they have in effect defined traditional marriage as \ninvidious discrimination. They went on to say:\n\n       For no rational reason, the marriage laws of the \n     Commonwealth discriminate against a defined class; no amount \n     of tinkering with language will eradicate that stain.\n\n  Here again, they are saying that traditional marriage is a stain on \nthe Constitution, on the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and \nno rational basis for those laws exists. This is language that I think \nthe people across America would find very shocking. The fact is, they \nprobably have not had the time or the means to try to find this \nlanguage themselves. That is another reason it is important to have \nthis debate. The Goodridge court goes on to say:\n\n       If, as the separate opinion suggests, the Legislature were \n     to jettison the term ``marriage'' altogether, it might well \n     be rational and permissible. What is not permissible is to \n     retain the word for some and not for others, with all the \n     distinctions thereby engendered.\n\n  Translated into English, what the court said is you cannot preserve \ntraditional marriage for some adult couples but not for same-sex \ncouples. But what you could do, in Massachusetts and elsewhere, is \neliminate the term ``marriage'' altogether. Shocking. Shocking.\n  Now, for those who think that we have somehow on this side of the \naisle dreamed up this crisis, this threat, this assault to the American \nfamily and traditional marriage, let me read just another paragraph. \nThis, again, is the Goodridge decision out of the Massachusetts Supreme \nCourt, mandating same-sex marriage--four judges:\n\n       The separate opinion maintains that, because same-sex civil \n     marriage is not recognized under Federal law and the law of \n     many States, there is a rational basis for the Commonwealth \n     to distinguish same-sex from opposite-sex spouses. . . . We \n     are well aware that current Federal law prohibits recognition \n     by the Federal Government of the validity of same-sex \n     marriages legally entered into in any State, and that it \n     permits other States to refuse to recognize the validity of \n     such marriages. The argument in the separate opinion that, \n     apart from the legal process, society will still accord a \n     lesser status to those marriages is irrelevant. Courts define \n     what is constitutionally permissible, and the Massachusetts \n     constitution does not permit this type of labeling. That \n     there may remain personal residual prejudice against same-sex \n     couples is a proposition all too familiar to other \n     disadvantaged groups. That such prejudice exists is not a \n     reason to insist on less than the Constitution requires.\n\n  That is a direct critique and criticism of the Federal Defense of \nMarriage Act passed in 1996 by a vote of 85 Senators in this body on a \nbipartisan basis. If that isn't a direct signal that the next law under \nattack is the Federal Defense of Marriage Act, I don't know what is. In \nfact, we know that at least four cases are presently pending seeking to \naccomplish just that.\n  Now, there have been those who have expressed concerns, saying why in \nthe world would we want to pass a constitutional amendment until a \nFederal court actually strikes down traditional marriage, even though \nthe Supreme Court has, in Lawrence v. Texas, provided the rationale to \ndo so, and that rationale has been adopted by the Massachusetts Supreme \nCourt, interpreting their Constitution; why in the world do we want to \namend the U.S. Constitution at this time?\n  I might interject that I bet old John Adams, who was the principal \nauthor in 1780 of that Massachusetts Constitution, never dreamed that \nfour judges on the Massachusetts Supreme Court would so contort the \nmeaning of that document as to create a right to same-sex marriage. \nThat is one reason they didn't talk about it explicitly, either in the \nState constitution or in the Federal Constitution.\n  But in terms of why we shouldn't wait to address this matter, I point \nout that Massachusetts is a good example of why. If we wait until it is \ntoo late, it may well take years for the American people, through the \namendment process, to correct that error. In the meantime, we know that \nsame-sex marriages will occur as they currently occur in Massachusetts, \nand those people will not just stay in one State but will move to other \nparts of the country to seek to have those marriages validated under \nthe laws of their own State. But we do have an example of when States \nhave chosen, based on a preliminary ruling suggesting same-sex \nmarriage, to amend their constitution. So it is not unprecedented by \nany means.\n  As a matter of fact, in 1993 and 1996, Hawaii and Alaska courts \nissued preliminary rulings suggesting that same-sex marriage may be \nconstitutionally required, and it was in 1998 that Hawaii and Alaska \npreemptively amended their constitutions before the highest court in \nthose States went as far as the Massachusetts Supreme Court did in the \nGoodridge case. Indeed, in 2000, Nebraska and Nevada preemptively \namended their State constitutions before suits were even filed.\n  I might add, there have been suits filed in Nevada seeking to force \nrecognition of polygamist marriages under the rationale in Lawrence v. \nTexas and Goodridge, and, indeed, in Nebraska, there has been a Federal \nconstitutional challenge to that State Constitution defense of marriage \nprovision under this rationale of the Lawrence case seeking to have the \nFederal Government tell Nebraska it cannot recognize traditional \nmarriage.\n  I want to move to the Allard amendment, which is two sentences. The \nfirst sentence basically says marriage is between a man and a woman. \nThe second sentence seeks to preserve the right of the States to deal \nwith the question of civil unions and to reserve that right to them as \nopposed to having a court mandate it.\n  I was a little baffled as to why the Senator from Illinois expressed \nsome puzzlement at the meaning of that second sentence when, indeed, \nduring one of the hearings we had in the Senate Judiciary Committee, he \nasked Professor Cass Sustein of the University of Chicago Law School:\n\n       Under this language, please explain whether a State \n     legislature could pass a law to establish civil unions.\n\n  Professor Sustein responded:\n\n       I believe it could because no State constitution would be \n     affected.\n\n  We have heard a number of objections raised that this is a State \nissue. We have seen charts being trotted out containing the quotations \nof various public figures. At one time, the Vice President, in a \ndifferent context, said this should be a matter reserved to the States. \nAnd there was a quote from the Vice President's wife, Lynne Cheney, \nexpressing her views, and I certainly respect both of them and their \nright to express their views. But the fact is this cannot be contained \nto one State.\n\n[[Page S7978]]\n\n  It is interesting to hear folks on the other side of the aisle make \nStates rights arguments to folks on this side of the aisle. The shoe is \nusually on the other foot because they are usually the ones seeking to \nhave the Federal Government tell all the States what they should be \ndoing rather than let each State--what Louis Brandeis once called the \nlaboratories of democracy--work out these various policies.\n  The truth is, we are not only talking about whether a State should \nembrace a property tax or a sales tax or perhaps adopt an income tax. \nIn my State, we do not have an income tax, and we are proud of it. We \ndo not want an income tax in the State of Texas. Each State has a right \nto choose its own policies that way.\n  I firmly adhere to that and believe the States rights argument is \nabsolutely true. But to suggest we can somehow, as a practical matter, \ncontain this revolution, this radical social experiment mandated by the \nMassachusetts Supreme Court, in one State denies reality. The fact \nis people have, indeed, married, they have moved to 46 States and now \nwe have at least 10, maybe more, lawsuits as part of a national \nlitigation strategy to force other States to recognize the validity of \nthat marriage. You would have to be blind to that effort to stand up \nhere and say this is a State matter because it is not.\n\n  We know based on the legal arguments of scholars, based on the \ncomments of Senator Kerry back when the Defense of Marriage Act was \npassed in 1996--something he did not vote for, by the way, and he now \nsays he supports marriage as only between a man and a woman, but then \nhe says he does not support a constitutional amendment either. He was \nnot for the statute, he is not for a constitutional amendment, but he \nstill claims to be in favor of traditional marriage. I don't know if, \nagain, this is one of the nuances, quite frankly, that evades me of his \nreasoning process, but you simply cannot have it both ways.\n  Indeed, for reasons we have talked about already at great length, \nwhen as a matter of Federal constitutional interpretation by a court, \nsame-sex marriages are required, no State constitution, no State law, \nnobody has a choice in that matter because our Federal Constitution, \nindeed, speaks for the entire Nation and not one State.\n  So no matter how much well-intentioned individuals may wish we can \navoid this debate and say this is a local issue, this is a State issue, \nwe do not need to be talking about it, that defies reality.\n  I know Senator Durbin had suggested at the close of his comments that \nthis is all an attempt to change the subject; that somehow we do not \nwant to debate what is happening in Iraq, what is happening in the \neconomy. I think the American people certainly know we have debated \nthose issues, and we will continue to debate those issues. Frankly, I \nam proud of what we have been able to accomplish in Iraq under a joint \nresolution passed overwhelmingly by this body authorizing the President \nto remove Saddam Hussein from power in that country, something that had \nbeen the policy of this Congress since at least 1998 when the Democrats \nadvocated, and we all agreed--or at least those here at that time--in \nthe Iraq Liberation Act. Regime change was a policy of the American \nGovernment under Democrat control, under a Democrat, President Bill \nClinton. But it took the present President, George W. Bush, I believe, \nto follow through after Saddam thumbed his nose at 17 resolutions of \nthe United Nations requiring him to open his nation up to weapons \ninspectors.\n  You want to talk about the economy, we are glad to talk about the \neconomy. The economy is roaring back, thanks again to the policies \nadvocated by this side of the aisle and led by President Bush who \ncreated more than 1.5 million new jobs this year alone. Indeed, home \nownership is at an all-time high. The economy is roaring back, so we \nare glad to talk about that.\n  Finally, I have heard Senator Durbin say it before and it makes you \nchuckle when you hear it--well, it is kind of funny. He says he \nbelieves no constitutional amendment should be debated--I cannot \nremember if he said ``debated,'' ``filed'' or ``passed''--during an \nelection year. We did not choose the timing of the Massachusetts \nSupreme Court's decision. I suggest what we are arguing for is a debate \nabout the most fundamental institution in our society, and that is not \na frivolous matter. That is an important matter.\n  Indeed, there are some, including this Senator, who believe it is the \nmost important matter. Of course, those who have made the States rights \narguments, all they need to do is read that Constitution once again, \nthat Senator Durbin spoke eloquently about, to recognize not only does \nit include a constitutional amendment process, but after two-thirds of \nthe Senate and after two-thirds of the House have passed the \nresolution, three-quarters of the States have to ratify the amendment. \nSo those who want to stand in this Chamber and say, We believe in \nStates rights, we believe this ought to be handled by the States, the \nStates retain a voice, a critical voice, a crucial, an essential voice \nin this process through the ratification process.\n  I believe this is an important issue. It cannot be solved at the \nlocal level. It is a national issue requiring a national response. It \nis not premature because to act only after a Federal court mandates \nsame-sex marriage on a national basis under the guise of interpreting \nthe U.S. Constitution, it will take too long for the people to speak \nand to overturn that decision and we will see something akin to what we \nsee now happening in Massachusetts, despite the fact the people of \nMassachusetts have, through their representatives, at least initially, \nchosen to try to overrule that decision by a constitutional amendment.\n\n  The problem is that constitutional amendment cannot be effective \nuntil 2006. So what happens in the interim? What happens in the interim \nis what we see happening today, because of a dictate from the bench by \nfour judges which now we see has a national impact.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The Democratic whip.\n  Mr. REID. Under an order previously entered, Senator Lautenberg is to \nbe recognized for 15 minutes. I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nMikulski--she has been waiting patiently. She had some information that \nshe was supposed to have come 40 minutes ago so she is waiting--have 10 \nminutes immediately following Senator Lautenberg. We have been going \nback and forth, but some of the speeches have been much longer than the \nothers.\n  Mr. CORNYN. We have been going back and forth, and I certainly want \nto accommodate every Senator but I also know the Senator from \nPennsylvania has been here as well.\n  Mr. REID. If I could ask through the Chair, how long does the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania wish to speak?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If Senator Lautenberg is speaking 15 minutes, I will \nspeak for 10 or 15 minutes, if we want to go back and forth.\n  Mr. REID. Maybe we can try this: Following the statement of the \nSenator from New Jersey, the Senator from Pennsylvania would be \nrecognized for 15 minutes and then Senator Mikulski for 10 minutes. We \nalready have an order in effect that Schumer and Feinstein are to be \nrecognized for 15 minutes total. So they would use their time \nimmediately after Senator Mikulski completes her statement. I ask \nunanimous consent that be the case.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I have no problem with that as long as we continue to try \nto observe the back and forth so each side has an opportunity to speak.\n  Mr. REID. We would not go back and forth from Mikulski to Feinstein \nbecause there is already an order entered regarding Feinstein and \nSchumer, but they only total 15 minutes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. With that exception, I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this proposed \namendment to the Constitution as, by the way, has Vice President Cheney \nand Mrs. Cheney. They are opposed. They are not taken by surprise on a \nmoral issue. These are sophisticated people who understand government \nand who have a role to play. They are opposed to this amendment, and I \nthink there is very good reason for that.\n  As Senators, many of us are from different backgrounds but we do all \nshare a solemn oath to uphold the spirit and\n\n[[Page S7979]]\n\nthe letter of the American Constitution. I would like to uphold the \nvalue and the commitment that the Constitution makes to all of us to \nprotect our rights.\n  I have to raise a question, and that is, what is it that makes this \nthe most important business we have in this body right now? Is this the \nonly thing that we want to talk about for the American people to hear \nfrom the Senate? Or would a subject such as the killings that are \ntaking place in Iraq, such as it was announced that three more were \nkilled yesterday, be more important, and that we are stretching to have \nenough reserves to fight the battle and protect our troops in the best \nway possible but we need to have enough of them? Do the American people \ncare about that?\n  Are the American people saying the issue that interests us most is \nwhether a homosexual couple can marry, even though it is taken care of \nin many States and will continue to be? Are we saying, no, the war is \nnot that important, we are going to lay it aside while notices go out \nto families, very often by a knock on the door that is an ominous \ncalling that says your son, your daughter has been killed, your son, \nyour daughter, has been seriously wounded?\n  No, we do not want to discuss that. We have to discuss gay marriage, \nand see whether we can change the Constitution, the Constitution which \nwas designed to expand rights at any time that we saw a default in our \nsystem, whether it had to do with giving the vote to women or the vote \nto 18-year-olds or other expansions of rights.\n  No, we want to do the moral thing. We want to decide who is in charge \nof the morality of this country. The people are in charge of the \nmorality of this country, not the people who are making speeches today.\n  When I think about what affects the American people, how about the \npeople who work 35 or 40 years in a company and see their pensions \ndisappear in front of their eyes because of the deceptive leadership of \ncompanies or falsification of records? No, no, the American people do \nnot want to worry about that. They want to talk about this amendment. \nThat is what they care about.\n  My phone is--no, it is not crowded. In fact, I do not get many calls \nat all about the morality of the constitutional amendment that has been \nproposed and, by the way, creates a constitutional convention so we can \nthrow anything that we want on top of this.\n  No, the American people are not concerned about whether they can pay \ntheir bills or whether drug prices are going through the roof that they \ncannot afford or whether we can give an education to the children who \nwant to learn in Head Start but do not know how. No, those are not the \nissues we want to talk about. We want to talk about whether a gay \ncouple can engage in a relationship or a marriage.\n  Let the States of New Jersey, Massachusetts, and the other States \nthat choose to give that right to give those citizens the same standing \nthat other citizens within those States have. No, we do not want to \ndiscuss that. We want to discuss this issue. We want to discuss what is \nmorally correct. What is morally correct is what the people want, and \nwe ought to let them hear on this floor that we understand the issues \nthat concern them.\n\n  I get calls from families who have people overseas, whether in \nReserve units or regular enlistments, and they ask, what can we do to \nhasten my son's return? I want to see his face.\n  Go to Walter Reed hospital, as I and many others have done. I went \nthere a couple of weeks ago after we buried a young soldier from New \nJersey in Arlington Cemetery. Senator Corzine and I, my colleague in \nthe Senate, decided we should not only pay our respects to the dead but \nalso our respects to the wounded, and we went to Walter Reed Hospital. \nIn one of those rooms there was a young man sitting with his wife and \nhe was staring blankly at the floor. It was not his lack of interest. \nIt was his lack of sight. He could not see anything.\n  He said: I will not be able to see my 28-month-old daughter but I \nstill want to hold her. I still miss her. I still love her.\n  We do not want to discuss those things. We want to discuss what is \nmoral and change the Constitution to impose our value of morality on \nall of America. It is wrong. The proposed constitutional amendment \nbefore us would etch the markings of intolerance, discrimination, and \nbigotry into a document that is based on the enduring truth that \neveryone is created equal.\n  The constitutional amendment that is being offered today would do \nmuch more than ban same-sex marriages. It would also ban civil unions, \nsaying they cannot really live together and share the values of our \nsociety, or domestic partnership laws, even if those relationships are \nspecifically recognized by their fellow residents in their States by \ntheir State legislatures and signed by the Governor.\n  If enacted, I believe this amendment would create a permanent class \nof second-class citizens with fewer rights than the rest of the \npopulation.\n  In fairness and in good conscience, I will not support this mean-\nspirited proposal. Our Constitution is about expanding individual \nrights, not taking them away. The last thing the Constitution should do \nis mandate conditions for some people and another set of rights for a \ndifferent group.\n  What is especially strange in this debate is we have the Republican \nmajority looking to take away a State's right to determine the rules \nfor marriage within its borders. I always thought the Republicans were \nStates righters. I thought they always wanted to give power back to the \nStates. That is what I thought they wanted to do.\n  In my home State of New Jersey, our State legislature, the duly \nelected representatives of the people of New Jersey, drafted, debated, \nand enacted a domestic partnership law. We ought to respect the State \nlaw, not stamp it out.\n  The State of New Jersey decided to establish a domestic partnership \nlaw. The Federal Government has no business telling us we cannot do it. \nIt doesn't violate current Federal law and we should let that stand. \nStates should continue to have the ability to decide whether same-sex \ncouples should have the inheritance rights or pension rights or \nwhatever other legal rights should be respected in a domestic \npartnership.\n  Domestic relations law, the law that governs family issues, has \nalways been the domain of the State, not Federal law. The ability to \ndecide matters of marriage has been with the States since the founding \nof the Republic. But now, those who typically advocate a smaller \nFederal Government--shrink government down to size, get rid of those \npeople who are making their livings there, forget whether they \ncontribute to the general well-being, we want to shrink Federal \nGovernment--now they are seeking to amend the Constitution to take \npower away from the States and put it in the hands of the Government so \nwe can have people running around, morality police, making sure this \ncouple isn't engaged in a relationship that would be prohibited by \nFederal law.\n  Once the Federal Government starts regulating marriage, you have to \nask yourself what is next? Ten years from now what is going to stop \nCongress from prohibiting people getting married unless they pledge to \nhave children? What is to stop this body from outlawing divorce or \nsecond marriages?\n  You have to ask yourself what is it that is driving this agenda? Why, \nin this election year, are we debating an amendment to the Constitution \ndesigned to restrict the rights of gay Americans? It is clearly not a \nlegitimate legislative debate, as there are not near enough votes to \npass this amendment. But that doesn't stop them from wanting to use the \ntime to confuse the American public about what is important, what is \nimportant to the public which is worried about their jobs and the war \nand their kids. No. We want to discuss gay marriage.\n  I have come to an unfortunate conclusion about why we are doing this \namendment. This is gay bashing, plain and simple. That is what this is \nabout. This amendment is picking on productive members of our society, \npeople who pay taxes, want to raise their families and contribute to \ntheir communities, as everyone else does. They want to be like everyone \nelse in their conformity to law. This amendment attempts to divide \nAmerica and it is shameful. It should not be that way.\n  When we see things that are shameful we should not be too spineless \nto respond. Look back on world history. There are notorious examples of \nthose\n\n[[Page S7980]]\n\nwho seek political advantage by picking on segments of society. It is a \nsad day when we see this dynamic happening here in the United States.\n  I urge my colleagues, reject this divisive amendment. Let's get on \nwith the regular business that affects people's everyday lives. We can \ntalk about this after the first of the year. It is not that urgent.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If you support a mother and father for every child, you \nare a hater. If you believe men and women for 5,000 years have bonded \ntogether in marriage, you are a gay basher. Marriage is hate. Marriage \nis a stain. Marriage is an evil thing.\n  That is what we hear. People who stand for traditional marriage are \nhaters, they are bashers, they are mean spirited, they are intolerant. \nThey are all these awful things. That would be the only reason we would \ncome here is because we hate. It is because we are intolerant. It is \nbecause we want to hold people down, restrict their rights. That would \nbe the only reason anyone could possibly come forward and argue that \nchildren need moms and dads.\n  Or is it the only reason? Isn't there a whole body of evidence out \nthere, of 5,000 years of civilization, that shows as plain as this \npiece of paper I am holding up that children need mothers and fathers? \nThat the basic unit of any successful society is moms and dads coming \ntogether to raise children?\n  Imagine what our Founders would say today, in a Constitutional \nConvention--which, by the way I suggest to the Senator from New Jersey \nthis bill does not call for--that anyone who would come forward and \nsuggest that holding marriage should be between a man and a woman is \ndoing something that is hateful, something that is against the basic \nprinciples of equality within our Constitution.\n  The Senator from New Jersey said there is no room for debate on \nmorality here on the floor of the Senate. It is up to the people to \nmake this decision. I wish it were up to the people to make this \ndecision. The Senator from New Jersey knows the people are not going to \nbe able to make this decision. In fact, the people are being frozen out \nof this decision. They are being frozen out by State courts--I would \nargue, soon to be Federal courts. These are people who are not elected, \npeople who are not accountable, people who are not democratic, but they \nare elitists dictating what they believe their world view should be for \nAmerica.\n  The only way for the people to decide, I suggest to the Senator from \nNew Jersey, is exactly the process we have before us. It is the only \nway for the people to decide. Leave it to the people. It is a great \nmantra. Leave it to the States. What those who suggest that we leave it \nto the States are suggesting is to leave it to the State courts. That \nhas always been the secret weapon of those who want to change our \nculture and change our laws without going through the process most of \nus think we have to go through to do that.\n  See, most people who are listening to my voice right now think that \nto change a law in America you actually have to get popular support for \nit, that you have to go before your legislature and petition your \ngovernment. But, no, the Senator from New Jersey figured out a long \ntime ago, as have many others who agree with his position, that the way \nyou accomplish these social transformations that fight against this \nevil, hateful culture that believes in moms and dads and children being \nraised in stable families--the way you do that is you get people on \nthese courts who can then dictate to the rest of us how we now shall \nlive.\n  You have that supported and orchestrated through a variety of \ndifferent ways, from colleges and universities to the media. Anyone who \nspeaks out against this political thought is a hater. Anyone who speaks \nout for traditional truth, for truth that has been established in \nBiblical times, through natural law and a whole host of other cultures, \nin fact every civilization in the history of man--if you stand for that \ntruth that was accepted by all for centuries, for millennia, you are a \nhater. You are someone who wants to oppress people.\n  I am willing to come here and debate the substance of what we are \ndoing. It is an important debate: What will happen to marriage if we do \nnothing? That is an important debate. We should have that debate. But I \nam not suggesting the Senator from New Jersey or anybody else who comes \nhere to defend a change in traditional marriage is doing so because \nthey hate mothers and fathers, because they hate traditional marriage. \nI do not ascribe evil thoughts to them, nor should they to us.\n  There is the incredible intolerance of those who argue for tolerance.\n  You see, tolerance means you must agree with me and how I feel about \nan issue, and if you do not, you are intolerant. Someone who supports \ntraditional values is by definition intolerant because they do not want \nme to be able to do whatever I want to do.\n  I never thought that was the definition of tolerance. I didn't think \ntolerance meant any individual should be able to do everything they \nwant irrespective of the consequence to anybody else. I will check the \ndefinition. I don't think that is what tolerance means.\n  When we change the definition of something so central to the culture \nof any society--and that is what marriage is and what family is--it has \nprofound consequences on children and thereby on the next generation.\n  I am not just making this up. It is real. It is so real it has been a \ngiven forever. I imagine this has been a given forever. All of a \nsudden, now something that is a given, that is a truth of every major \nreligion I am aware of, from natural law to philosophy, all of this \ngiven truth is now seen as pure animus, hatred. But it is not.\n  This constitutional amendment is based on a sincere caring for \nchildren, for family, for the future of this country.\n  The Senator from New Jersey suggested that conservatives should be \nfor States rights and that we want to shrink government. Let me assure \nyou, if we do not stop the change of the definition of traditional \nmarriage, if we let marriage be just a social convention without \nmeaning or without significance, we will shrink government because we \nhave seen where marriage becomes out of favor--whether it is the \nNetherlands or Scandinavia, which I will talk about in a moment, or \nwhether it is subcultures within this country in which marriage is seen \nas an out-of-date convention. In those cultures, children suffer. In \nthose cultures, people do not get married. In those cultures, children \nare born out of wedlock and do not see their fathers and in many cases \ntheir mothers. Society dies.\n  You can say I am a hater, but I will argue that I am a lover. I am a \nlover of traditional family and children who deserve the right to have \na mother and a father. Don't we want that? Is there anyone in the U.S. \nSenate who will stand up and argue that children don't have a right to \na mom and a dad; that our society shouldn't be saying to all people \nthat moms and dads are the best, an ideal, and what we should strive \nfor? When we say that marriage is not that, then we say that children \ndon't deserve that. Let me assure you they will not get that.\n  I will give you a couple of examples. The most dramatic is in the \nNetherlands. Senators Cornyn and Brownback and others have talked about \nit. But this is a country where marriage was a very stable aspect of \ntheir culture. They had the highest marriage rate and the lowest \ndivorce rate in Europe. They had the lowest out-of-wedlock birth rate \nin Europe--until what? Until a social movement began to change the \ndefinition of marriage. You can say a lot of other things happened in \nEurope during that time, true. But the Netherlands has always been, \ninterestingly enough, the country that was able to dam the tide, stem \nthe tide and preserve the traditional family until they began the \nprocess of changing the definition of marriage to expand it.\n  Look at what happened over that period of time: A straight and rapid \ndescent in the number of people getting married and, not surprisingly, \na rapid assent in the children being born out of wedlock.\n  Is this what is best for children? Is this an argument of a hater? Is \nthis an argument of someone who is intolerant or is this an argument of \nsomeone who believes that children deserve what is the ideal for our \nsociety?\n\n[[Page S7981]]\n\n  What has happened in those countries that have allowed people of the \nsame sex to get married? Sweden allowed same-sex unions. There are 8 \nmillion people in Sweden. How many same-sex unions? There were 749. Is \nit worth it that now 60 percent of first-born children born in Sweden \nare born out of wedlock? Is this worth it, 749?\n  By the way, the breakup rate of those marriages is two to three times \nwhat it is in traditional marriage. Is it worth it?\n  I ask kids today what marriage is about. For the longest time, when I \nasked them what marriage is about, they always answered it is about the \nlove of two people. Look at what Hollywood said about marriage. If you \nlook at what leaders in this country say about marriage, maybe that is \nwhat we think it is. You look at the pop stars and celebrities, and \nthat is certainly what it is today. It certainly isn't about families \nand kids.\n  What are we telling our children? Is marriage just about affirming \nthe love of two people? I can assure you that is the motive behind it. \nIt is about affirmation of lifestyle, it is about affirmation of \ndesires. Marriage and family is more than that. Principally, marriage \nand family has been held up not as an affirmation to make you feel good \nabout who you are or who you love, but it is about the selfless giving \nfor the purpose of continuing. It is about selflessness, not \nselfishness. It is not about me all the time. This is a society that is \nso wrapped up in ``me.'' Make me feel good, make me affirmed--me, me, \nme. What about kids? What about the future? The greatest generation of \nAmerica was the greatest generation of America. Why? Because they were \ngiving of themselves for something beyond themselves.\n  The greatest generation that started the baby boom was a generation \nthat understood what family was all about.\n  A young man walked up to me a year and a half ago in Wichita, KS, and \nhanded me this bracelet, and I have worn it every day since. He said \nthis bracelet describes what family is. That is what it is--f-a-m-i-l-\ny. It says it means family. Forget about me; I love you.\n  Is that the kind of family we are debating today?\n  There is a reason we are here. It is not because we hate anybody. It \nis not because we don't respect anybody. It is not because we don't \ndignify their worth and value as a person. It is because there is a \ngroup of people who are trying to change the definition that is central \nto the future of this country.\n  That is why we are here. We didn't pick this fight. We didn't start \nthis battle. They went to the courts, not to the people. They went to \nthe few elitists, and on of the most elitist liberal places in the \nworld, Boston, MA, and said, you, the elite of the east coast, \nNortheastern United States of America, you take your isolated values \nand then sweep them across this country. They didn't go to Omaha, NE. \nThey didn't go to Peoria, IL. They go to San Francisco, to Seattle, to \nBoston, and to New York, and they impose the values across America.\n  That is not democracy. That is not allowing the people of Baltimore, \nthe people of Reno, the people of San Antonio, the people of \nProvidence, the people of Pittsburgh to speak.\n  We have a right to speak. The only way we can do that is through the \nprocess we have before us, article V of the Constitution, which says we \nhave a right to amend the Constitution when things go too far. And \nthings are going too far. I ask my colleagues to give the people a \nchance to speak.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic whip.\n  Mr. REID. The next Democrat speakers in order following the \nstatements of Senators Schumer and Feinstein would be Senator Kennedy \nfor 15 minutes, followed by Senator Dayton for 20 minutes. I ask \nconsent that be in order on this side of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I wish to speak on the Federal marriage \namendment and also on the motion to proceed.\n  Today I rise to talk about the Federal marriage amendment. I first \nwill talk about timing and then about content. First, I will talk about \ntiming. Marriage is not under a threat. It is not in any clear, \nimminent danger of being destroyed. What is in clear and imminent \ndanger and what we have heard is under threat of possible attack is the \nhomeland.\n  There are other issues families are facing that are eroding their \nvery stability such as their economic situation and the cost of health \ncare. If we really want to stand up and protect America and protect \nfamilies, we would be focusing on these and other issues. This \ndiscussion is ill-conceived, ill-timed, and unnecessary.\n  Last week, Homeland Secretary Tom Ridge announced that al-Qaida is \nplanning a large-scale attack on the United States of America. What \nshould we be doing? We should be working on homeland security. We have \na homeland security appropriations bill pending, waiting to come before \nthe Senate. That is what we should be talking about today, not this \namendment.\n  This is why I will vote against the motion to proceed as a protest \nthat we are not meeting the compelling needs of the Nation. We need to \nshow a deterrent strategy, to send a message to the terrorists: Do not \neven think you can affect our elections because we would be united \nacross the aisle to stand up and vote for legislation to protect the \nhomeland. To protect our ports, our cities, our transportation, our \nschools, and, yes, those moms and dads and children we have been \nhearing about all day long. Instead, we are debating the motion to \nproceed to a constitutional amendment. America is united in the war \nagainst terrorism. We should not be divided in a cultural war.\n  Let's talk about another war, the war in Iraq. Right now, we have men \nand women returning with broken bodies, some who have lost their limbs. \nOne cannot go to ward 57 at Walter Reed, the way I have, and see the \nyoung men and women who have lost an arm, lost a leg, lost hope, \nwondering if anybody is ever going to love them again, if they are ever \ngoing to be able to work again, and not want to do everything possible \nto help these young Americans.\n  That is why I am working now on a bipartisan basis with my colleague, \nSenator Kit Bond, on the VA/HUD appropriations bill so we can help our \nveterans, so we can have a prosthetic initiative to give them a \n``smart'' arm with the best technology, to give them a smart leg so \nthey can run the race for life and maybe give them back a life. That is \nwhat we should be focusing on, working on a bipartisan basis, solving \nthe problems that confront the Nation.\n  This amendment is not about policy; it is about politics. It is not \nabout strengthening families; it is about helping the other party get \nelected. If we were serious about helping families, we would be \nfocusing on jobs, on health care, on the rising costs of college \ntuition. This proposed amendment does not help families. Why? It does \nnot create one new job or keep one in this country. It does not pay for \none bottle of prescription drugs that seniors so desperately need. This \namendment does not send one child to college. No, this amendment does \nnot help a family pay for health care for a sick child. What it does do \nis divide. Americans are tired of divisive debates. This amendment is \njust simply a distraction.\n  On the timing, I wish we would put it aside and address our Nation's \nreal needs.\n  I also want to talk about the content should we move to proceed. I \nwill vote against this amendment because it is unneeded and \nunnecessary. Congress in 1996 spoke on this issue. They passed \nsomething called the Defense of Marriage Act. What this legislation did \nwas define marriage as between a man and a woman. It also allows each \nState to determine for itself what it considers marriage under its own \nState law, leaving the concept of federalism intact.\n  Maryland, my own home State, also has a law on the books that defines \nmarriage as between a man and a woman. So when you look at Maryland law \nand you look at Federal law, this constitutional amendment is unneeded.\n  We talk about what the courts are doing. Well, I don't quite see that \nas the same level of threat as terrorism, or the loss of a job on a \nslow boat to China or a fast track to Mexico.\n  Some of my constituents are worried that churches will be forced to \nperform gay marriages. Under separation of\n\n[[Page S7982]]\n\nchurch and State, no law--not a Federal law, not a State law--can force \na church, temple, mosque, or any religious institution to marry a same-\nsex couple. That will be up to their religious determination. Why? \nBecause, again, under separation of church and State, we cannot dictate \nto a church what to do. Because of this constitutional commitment there \ncan be no Federal law, for example, even under equal protection that \ncould force the Catholic Church to ordain women. Our First Amendment \nprovides this protection to religious institutions.\n  And so I reiterate that this amendment is unnecessary.\n  I also oppose this amendment because I take amending the Constitution \nvery seriously. In our entire history, over 200 years, we have only \namended the Constitution 17 times since the Bill of Rights. We have \namended that Constitution to extend rights, not to restrict them. We \namended the Constitution to end slavery. We amended the Constitution to \ngive women the right to vote. We amended the Constitution to give equal \nprotection in law to all citizens. We amended the Constitution to give \ncitizens over age 18 the right to vote. We have never used the \nConstitution as a weapon or as a social policy tool against a minority \nof the population.\n  I am concerned that this amendment would condone discrimination. We \nshould not embark on that path today. It is wrong. It undermines the \nintegrity of the Constitution.\n  When the roll is called on the motion to proceed, I will oppose that \nmotion. There are far more pressing needs for American families and \nthose children we love.\n  When we amend the Constitution, it should be to expand hope and \nopportunity, not to shrink it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I believe Senator Schumer and I have \n15 minutes between us by unanimous consent agreement, and I ask that I \nbe alerted when 8 minutes has passed.\n\n\n                   Expiration of Assault Weapons Ban\n\n  Ten years ago, I introduced an amendment to the crime bill which \nbanned the manufacture and sale of semiautomatic military-style assault \nweapons. Senator Schumer, then a Member of the House, a member of the \nJudiciary Committee, introduced the same amendment in the Judiciary \nCommittee. We were both successful. It passed the Senate, passed the \nHouse, was signed into law by President Clinton.\n  Over the past 10 years, gun traces to semiautomatic military-style \nassault weapons have decreased by two-thirds. The ban has worked. But 2 \nmonths from today, the Federal ban will expire.\n  Once again, new guns such as the Tec-DC9 will flood our streets. If \nyou don't know what a Tec-DC9 is, I am going to show you. This is Gian \nLuigi Ferri, who walked into 101 California Street and killed six \npeople, wounding eight. And this is the Tec-DC-9 he was carrying with a \n30-round clip. He had 250 rounds in additional clips with him. He is \ndead here, shot on the floor, but not until after he had either killed \nor wounded 14 people. The ban will expire despite overwhelming public \nsupport to renew it.\n  Seventy-one percent of all Americans support renewing the ban. So do \n64 percent of people in homes with a gun. The ban is going to expire \ndespite overwhelming support from law enforcement and civic \norganizations. As you can see, nearly every major law enforcement and \ncivic organization in our country supports renewal: the Fraternal Order \nof Police, the Chiefs of Police, the United States Conference of \nMayors, National Association of Counties, and on and on.\n  The ban will expire despite the stated public support of President \nGeorge W. Bush and Attorney General John Ashcroft. As you can see from \nthis letter, the administration has reiterated its official support for \nrenewing the ban time and time again. From the Department of Justice:\n\n       As the President has stated on several occasions, he \n     supports the reauthorization of the current ban . . .\n\n  And the ban will expire despite the support of a majority of \nSenators, 52. Despite all of this, it looks more and more likely that \nthe National Rifle Association will win. The ban will expire, and the \nAmerican people will once again be made less safe.\n  Although President Bush has said he supports the ban, the White House \nhas refused to lift a finger to help us pass the renewal. They are \ninstead playing political hot potato with the Republican leaders in \nCongress.\n  The Hill newspaper, on May 12, said that ``an aide to [the Speaker] \nhas said privately that if the President pushes for it, the ban will \nprobably be reauthorized. But if he doesn't, the chances . . . are \nremote.''\n  The Boston Globe reports that a White House spokesman said ``Bush \nstill supports the ban but is waiting for the House to act.''\n  So the House will act only if the President asks them, and the \nPresident will act only if the House passes it. It is a classic catch-\n22.\n  One month ago, June 14, three former Presidents wrote to President \nBush. Presidents Ford, Carter, and Clinton took the extraordinary step \nof writing a joint letter to President Bush asking him to work to renew \nthe ban and offering their assistance to do so. Let me read just part \nof it:\n\n       We are pleased that you support reauthorization of the . . \n     . Assault Weapons Act, which is scheduled to expire in \n     September. Each of us, along with President Reagan, worked \n     hard in support of this vital law, and it would be a grave \n     mistake if it were allowed to sunset.\n\n  It goes on and expresses what this law means. I could not agree more. \nWe cannot go back to those days. We know these guns are used by gangs, \nby criminals, by grievance killers, by troubled children to kill their \nschoolmates. We also know from al-Qaida training manuals that al-Qaida \nhas recommended that its members travel to the United States to buy \nassault weapons at gun shows. Why? Because it is so easy to do so.\n  As the threat of terrorism around the world increases, how can we let \nthe ban expire and make it that much easier for terrorists to arm \nthemselves with military-style weaponry? And make no mistake, gun \nmanufacturers and sellers are keeping a close watch.\n  In mid-April, Italian customs seized more than 8,000 AK-47 assault \nrifles on their way from the Romanian Port of Constanta to New York and \nthen to Georgia. These guns had a value of more than $7 million.\n\n  Of course, shipping assembled AK-47s would be illegal under the ban \nand under a 1989 Executive order of the first President Bush that \nbanned certain guns from importation. But according to ATF, importing \nthese guns so they can be disassembled, sold for parts, and then \nreassembled would not be illegal, and now purchasers will be allowed to \nreassemble these guns into their banned form. This shipment was not an \nisolated example.\n  Here is an advertisement from Armalite, a company that makes post-ban \nrifles. As we can see from this advertisement, they are offering a \ncoupon for a free flash suppressor for anyone who buys one of these \nguns so that on September 14, once the ban is expired, the gun can be \nmodified to its pre-ban configuration. What do you need a flash \nsuppressor for? If you have a flash suppressor on a gun and a 30-round \nclip in it and you are shooting at night at the police or at neighbors, \nyou can't see where the gun flashes. The flash is suppressed. So if you \nare a criminal, you may need one. If you are a legitimate citizen, you \ndon't.\n  This is the kind of thing we can expect, just 2 months from now: \nCompanies gearing up to once again produce the deadly assault weapons, \nthe high-capacity clips which are now banned, clips, drums, or strips \nof more than 10 bullets, and dangerous accessories we worked so hard to \nstop 10 years ago.\n  I hope that, before September 13, the President and the Congress can \nfind the courage to stand up to the NRA, to listen to law enforcement \nall across the Nation who know that to ban these guns makes sense and \nsaves lives.\n  Listen to the studies that show that crime with assault weapons of \nall kinds has decreased as much as 66 percent. The bottom line is that \neveryone knows this ban should remain law, but time is running out. We \nhave 14 legislative days. Will the House of Representatives step up to \nthe plate and find an opportunity to give the House an opportunity to \nvote to renew the military-style assault weapons legislation?\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the following editorials in the \nRecord.\n\n[[Page S7983]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Seattle Times, May 4, 2004]\n\n                   Extend the Ban on Assault Weapons\n\n       The clock is running out on a 10-year-old federal ban on \n     certain types of semiautomatic assault weapons. Without bold \n     action by President Bush, the common-sense law likely will \n     expire in September.\n       Bush has said he will sign a bill to extend the ban if \n     Congress approves one. But that's unlikely without his strong \n     backing, and he knows it.\n       A strong majority of Americans support the ban on the \n     manufacture, transfer and possession of 19 types of assault \n     weapons, such as the AK-47, the Uzi and the TEC-9. So do the \n     National League of Cities, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the \n     National Educational Association, the American Bar \n     Association and many other organizations. They support it \n     because it makes sense.\n       Seattle Police Chief Gil Kerlikowske is one of hundreds of \n     law-enforcement leaders who back the ban. He says such \n     weapons serve no legitimate purpose for people who aren't \n     police.\n       He's right. These weapons aren't necessary for hunting or \n     self-defense. They are for drug dealers, gang leaders and \n     other criminals. They don't belong on America's streets.\n       In addition to banning 19 specific semiautomatic assault \n     weapons, the 1994 legislation identifies specific \n     characteristics that categorize a weapon as an ``assault \n     weapon.'' It also bans ammunition clips or magazines that \n     hold more than 10 rounds. At the same time, it exempt \n     hundreds of other weapons designed for legitimate uses.\n       The ban isn't perfect. Manufacturers can too easily get \n     around the law by altering their weapons. Still, the fight to \n     keep the ban in place is worth it. And it will be a fight.\n       The National Rifle Association is actively opposing \n     extension of the ban. Republican Majority Leader Tom DeLay \n     said there are not sufficient votes to reauthorize the law. A \n     bill that would have protected gun manufacturers from \n     lawsuits died in March when senators tried to include in the \n     bill the extension of the assault-weapons ban.\n       If the ban expires Sept. 13, the country could once again \n     manufacture and import these military-style weapons. We don't \n     need them.\n       President Bush has said he supports the ban. It's time for \n     him to start acting like it.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           [From the San Francisco Chronicle, April 22, 2004]\n\n                         Renew the Weapons Ban\n\n       The debate over the nation's assault weapons ban will be \n     repeated this spring, with Sen. Dianne Feinstein arguing the \n     need for extending her groundbreaking legislation. Lest she \n     need any more ammunition, tragic news has provided it--the \n     recent cold-blooded slaying of San Francisco police office \n     Isaac Espinoza at the hands of a killer wielding an AK-47 \n     assault rifle.\n       That there is still strong opposition to extending the \n     weapons ban in spite of its obvious merits speaks to the \n     power of the nation's gun lobby, which has fought every \n     effort for sensible gun control. Earlier this year, Senate \n     Republicans killed their own bill aimed at granting gun \n     dealers and manufacturers immunity from lawsuits filed by \n     shooting victims rather than agree to extend Feinstein's \n     legislation.\n       But none of the rhetoric from the National Rifle \n     Association can stand up to the facts. The percentage of \n     assault weapons used in crimes since the original ban passed \n     has been reduced by two-thirds. There is simply no \n     justification for making military-style assault weapons \n     available to the general public.\n       While the NRA seems to gloss over the worst incidents \n     involving assault weapons, such as the horrific 1999 \n     Columbine High School shootings, Bay Area residents cannot. \n     Feinstein's bill grew out of the 1993 massacre of eight \n     people at 101 California Street in San Francisco by a gunman \n     armed with two semiautomatic rifles. The shooting death of \n     officer Espinoza, allegedly at the hands of 21-year-old \n     assailant, serves as a chilling reminder of the availability \n     and danger of assault weapons.\n       The need for the ban is painfully obvious. Reasonable gun \n     control is in everybody's interest, even those citizens who \n     make up the NRA.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  [From the Miami Herald, May 6, 2004]\n\n              Assault-Weapons Ban Is Itself Under Assault\n\n       If Congress allows the federal ban on assault weapons to \n     expire, the law's public-safety successes will disappear with \n     it. Lawmakers should not let that happen. The ban is saving \n     lives.\n       The law prohibits manufacture and importation of 19 types \n     of rapid-fire assault weapons and scores of copy-cats with \n     similar characteristics. In the 10 years since the ban was \n     enacted, its benefits have been undeniable: A U.S. Justice \n     Department analysis shows that banned assault weapons used in \n     crimes dropped by almost 66 percent between 1995 and 2001; \n     they dropped 20 percent in the law's first year, to 3,268 in \n     1995 from 4,077 in 1994. Murders of police officers by \n     assault weapons dropped to zero in late 1995 and 1996 from 16 \n     percent in 1994 and early 1995.\n       For these reasons, police chiefs spoke as one last week in \n     press conferences across the country. They want U.S. \n     lawmakers to reauthorize the assault-weapons ban before it \n     expires in September. So do government officials and, several \n     studies show, the majority of Americans.\n       President Bush supports the ban, but he hasn't been vocal \n     about it. Under pressure from the National Rifle Association \n     to change his position, Bush appears reluctant to repudiate \n     openly a group that supported his candidacy in 2000. But the \n     data should given him ample reason to lead the push for the \n     law's extension. Simply put, we all are safer because of the \n     ban on assault weapons.\n       The ban will sunset on Sept. 13 unless Congress approves \n     new legislation keeping it on the books and Bush signs it \n     into law. Bipartisan legislation would extend the ban for a \n     decade. But reauthorization faces the same heated firefight \n     that the original proposal faced 10 years ago.\n       In 1994, the ban almost sank a multifaceted crime and \n     safety bill. In addition to the ban on assault weapons, the \n     bill contained other sensible measures: It added 100,000 \n     police officers and funded programs to steer youths away from \n     crime.\n       The NRA fought hard to persuade lawmakers to reject the \n     ban. It argued that the ban trampled gun buyers' \n     constitutional rights. Its heavy-handed tactics backfired. \n     Several gun-owning lawmakers from both sides of the aisle \n     resigned NRA memberships, and a congressional majority voted \n     to approve the ban.\n       Lawmakers should stand firm again, rejecting a replay of \n     the NRA's electon-year fear-mongering. The law doesn't stifle \n     gun ownership; it makes killing machines harder to obtain. \n     The ban does not affect weapons owned before it went into \n     effect. In 1995, two Columbine High School students got their \n     hands on assault weapons. We know the carnage they left \n     behind.\n       Assault weapons have no place in civil society. Congress \n     should reauthorize the law that bans them.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            [From the Hartford (CT) Courant, June 11, 2004]\n\n                       Renew Assault Weapons Ban\n\n       Time is running out on efforts to extend the federal \n     assault weapons ban, which is scheduled to expire Sept. 13.\n       There's no good reason why civilians should be allowed to \n     own these rapid firing, military-style weapons, which are \n     favored by criminals. The weapons have no legitimate use for \n     self-defense or hunting.\n       Unfortunately, Republican congressional leaders are ready \n     to do the bidding of the National Rifle Association, which \n     has fought the ban since it became law a decade ago. \n     President Bush favors an extension of the ban, but unless he \n     pressures Congress to act, it's likely that nothing will \n     happen.\n       That would be tragic. Once again, the nation's cities would \n     be flooded with an array of high-powered weapons on streets \n     and in homes. Police officials across the nation have pleaded \n     with Congress to extend the ban.\n       Connecticut U.S. Reps. Christopher Shays, Rosa DeLauro and \n     John Larson are among more than 100 House co-sponsors of the \n     proposed extension. Sen. Christopher J. Dodd recently added \n     his name as a Senate co-sponsor. The remaining members of \n     Connecticut's delegation, Reps. Nancy Johnson and Rob Simmons \n     and Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman, should joint them.\n       The proposed extension also would tighten current law to \n     close a loophole that has allowed manufacturers to sell the \n     weapons simply by making cosmetic changes in the banned \n     models.\n       Passage of the 1994 ban was an important step toward \n     reducing mayhem with powerful guns. Let's not take a step \n     backward.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 21, 2004]\n\n                           Guns and the Gipper\n\n        On last reflection on the death of Ronald Reagan:\n        In the debate over who can lay claim to the Reagan legacy, \n     one aspect of the late president's record has gotten little \n     attention.\n        That was Mr. Reagan's willingness to stand up to the \n     National Rifle Association and support the cause of gun \n     control when he thought it was right.\n        A decade ago, when the proposal to create a federal ban on \n     military-style assault weapons was teetering between \n     Congressional passage and defeat, Mr. Reagan personally \n     lobbied Republican House members to take what he called the \n     ``absolutely necessary'' step of outlawing the bullet-\n     spraying semiautomatic guns favored by criminals. His effort \n     proved crucial, as the legislation passed the House by just a \n     two-vote margin.\n        True, it was only after Mr. Reagan left office that he \n     woke up to the need for sensible national laws like the \n     assault weapons ban and background checks for gun buyers. As \n     president, he signed legislation weakening federal gun laws. \n     Right now, President Bush has the chance to go the Gipper one \n     better by waging a principled fight to renew the 10-year-old \n     assault weapons ban, which is due to expire in September. The \n     president is on record as favoring the ban's continuation. \n     But he steadfastly refuses to do anything to rally lawmakers \n     to renew and strengthen its proven, life-saving provisions. \n     Mr. Bush may please anti-gun-control extremists by presiding \n     over the extinction of the assault weapons ban. We doubt it \n     would have pleased Mr. Reagan.\n\n[[Page S7984]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n         [From the St. Louis (MO) Post-Dispatch, June 25, 2004]\n\n                         A Landmark Settlement\n\n\n                              gun control\n\n       A court in West Virginia has approved a settlement \n     requiring a gun dealer to pay $1 million in damages to two \n     New Jersey police officers seriously wounded by a robber who \n     bought a gun through a straw party in West Virginia. This \n     agreement marks the first time a dealer will pay damages for \n     supplying a firearm to the illegal gun market. The lawsuit \n     accused the dealer, Will Jewelry & Loan of Charleston, W.Va., \n     of negligence and creating a public nuisance by selling a \n     dozen handguns to a straw buyer. The straw buyer bought the \n     weapons for convicted felon James Gray.\n       Dennis Henigan, an official at the Brady Center to Prevent \n     Gun Violence in Washington, noted that the injured officers \n     would have collected nothing had the U.S. Senate approved \n     legislation in March to shield gun makers and dealers from \n     civil lawsuits. For a time, it seemed that the National Rifle \n     Association would pressure Congress to pass this bill. That \n     was before Democrats succeeded in adding two amendments. One \n     would have banned assault weapons, and the other would have \n     required background checks at private gun shows. Furious \n     Senate Republicans pulled the immunity bill and vowed to \n     stall the two amendments by not allowing the House to \n     consider them this year.\n       President George W. Bush can make a difference in this \n     election year by keeping his promise to extend the 1994 ban \n     on military-style assault weapons. The existing ban expires \n     in September. Mr. Bush didn't mention the issue when he \n     invited sporting groups to his ranch in Crawford, Texas, in \n     the spring. Nor did Vice President Dick Cheney mention it \n     when he held an antique rifle at April's NRA convention and \n     accused Democratic presidential candidate Sen. John Kerry of \n     being an enemy of gun makers and users.\n       The president appears to want to have it both ways. He says \n     he favors instituting background checks and extending the \n     weapons ban, yet he had urged the Senate not to add either \n     rider to the gun immunity bill. Granted, some of the banned \n     weapons, including the one Mr. Cheney held at the NRA \n     convention, are prized by collectors. And gun enthusiasts \n     point out that many of the banned weapons are no more \n     dangerous than guns in general but have a bad reputation \n     because of movies that glorify gun violence.\n       Trouble is, this violence spills over into real life. The \n     memory of Columbine is still sharp for many Americans, \n     although the carnage happened five years ago. Images of \n     snipers picking off innocent people in the Washington, DC, \n     area won't soon be forgotten. And the reckless use of \n     handguns and rifles to maim and murder is a daily occurrence \n     in our country.\n       Mr. Bush should give his unequivocal support to extending \n     the ban on military-style weapons that are used mainly to \n     kill people.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Baltimore Sun, July 5, 2004]\n\n                            The Line of Fire\n\n       They buried Carlos Owen, Harley Chisholm III, and Charles \n     Bennett last month. The three Birmingham, Ala., police \n     officers were serving an arrest warrant in one of the city's \n     blighted neighborhoods when they were shot and killed. And \n     the incident has left people in that conservative, gun-owning \n     part of the country wondering whether maybe some weapons \n     shouldn't be so widely available.\n       The gun that killed the officers was an SKS, a rifle \n     similar to the notorious Russian AK-47. It's a military-style \n     assault weapon and, according to the federal Bureau of \n     Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, a rifle often used \n     against law enforcement officers. It fires a 7.62 mm round at \n     2,300 feet per second, a velocity that's capable of \n     penetrating police body armor. Earlier this year, two other \n     Alabama police officers were killed in the line of duty. An \n     SKS was used in both shootings.\n       Why is this cop-killing gun allowed in circulation in this \n     country? It's not outlawed by the 10-year-old federal assault \n     weapons ban. The AK-47 was, but the makers of the SKS found a \n     way around the ban by making some minor modifications. Yet \n     their gun still has some of the most troubling qualities of \n     an assault weapon--an ability to accept a high-capacity \n     magazine and, even as a semiautomatic, spray a large number \n     of large bullets powerfully and accurately.\n       That, and the fact that it's cheap and lethal-looking, has \n     made the SKS a popular gun among criminals. An SKS can be \n     purchased for as little as $200. A used magazine capable of \n     holding 40 rounds might cost an extra $5. It's not a \n     particularly useful gun for hunting. It's not even that \n     popular with the general law-abiding public. All models of \n     assault weapons represent less than 5 percent of the guns in \n     circulation.\n       Yet here we are just a few months shy of the day the \n     federal assault weapons ban is set to expire and there's \n     little hope it will be renewed. It should be renewed--and \n     expanded to cover guns such as the SKS. President Bush said \n     four years ago that he supported an extension of the assault \n     weapons ban. A majority of the Senate supports it, too. \n     Right-wing House Republicans don't. President Bush could \n     probably overcome that opposition, but he won't even talk \n     about the issue. Clearly, he'd rather the whole thing went \n     away quietly.\n       Of course it won't go away for the families of those \n     murdered Birmingham police officers. While a renewal wouldn't \n     take the existing SKS rifles off the street, letting the ban \n     expire in September would open the door to even deadlier \n     models. What message would that decision send to future cop-\n     killers? A lot of Americans, gun owners and police officers \n     included, have been left to ponder: What compelling reason is \n     there to allow bad guys to own assault weapons? And how can \n     the president of the United States continue to claim to \n     support a ban but not lift a finger for the cause?\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   [From the Oregonian, July 5, 2004]\n\n                        Back to Assault Weapons\n\n       Summary: Without pressure from President Bush and action by \n     Congress, the 1994 ban on military-style guns will expire.\n       When a man used an assault rifle to shoot three people at a \n     California community center in 1999, then-presidential \n     candidate George W. Bush declared, ``It makes no sense for \n     assault weapons to be around our society.''\n       It still doesn't. President Bush promised during his first \n     campaign to uphold a ban on assault weapons, but he isn't \n     lifting a finger now to prevent the popular law from \n     expiring. The assault weapons ban approved in 1994 by \n     Congress and signed by President Clinton was written to \n     sunset after 10 years. Time's up at midnight on Sept. 13.\n       The White House claims Bush supports extending the ban and \n     would sign a bill renewing the law if Congress sends him one. \n     But earlier this year, Bush helped defeat a gun bill that \n     included the ban on assault weapons. The president also has \n     done nothing to encourage Congress to act on the issue in the \n     dwindling days of this session.\n       That's a dangerous mistake. Bush was absolutely right when \n     he told voters that assault weapons have no place in American \n     society. These military-style weapons, with rapid-fire \n     capabilities and large-capacity magazines capable of holding \n     dozens of rounds of ammunition, are not hunting or sporting \n     weapons. They are designed for just one thing: shooting \n     people.\n       Polls show that Americans strongly favor renewing the ban \n     on these weapons. In late 2003 an NBC/Wall Street Journal \n     poll found that 78 percent of adults nationwide expressed \n     support for renewing the federal ban. A University of \n     Pennsylvania National Annenberg Election Survey found in \n     April 2004 that even 64 percent of the people in households \n     with guns favor the law.\n       Every major law enforcement organization in the nation \n     backs the ban on assault weapons, including the Fraternal \n     Order of Police, the National Sheriffs' Association and the \n     International Association of Chiefs of Police. Every police \n     agency understands the dangers of these weapons in the hands \n     of drug traffickers, gangs and terrorists.\n       Yet House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and other GOP \n     leaders seem determined to prevent the renewal of the assault \n     weapons ban from even coming to a vote. We strongly urge \n     members of the Oregon congressional delegation to join the \n     bill to reauthorize the ban and to pressure the leadership to \n     bring the matter up for a vote before the law sunsets in \n     September.\n       While several studies show a marked decline since 1994 in \n     assault weapons traced to crime, we'll concede that the \n     federal ban has not been a fully effective defense against \n     these guns. The law grandfathered existing assault weapons in \n     1994, and manufacturers have exploited loopholes in the law \n     by producing copycat weapons with only cosmetic differences.\n       A responsible Congress, and one not in the thrall of the \n     National Rifle Association, would tighten the law, fix the \n     loopholes and make the ban on these weapons permanent. If \n     that's too much to ask, we'd settle for the president to keep \n     his word on this issue and demand that Congress renew the \n     existing ban on assault weapons.\n                                  ____\n\n\n          [From the San Jose (CA) Mercury News, July 5, 2004]\n\n      Bush Is Doing Nothing To Help Extend Ban on Assault Weapons\n\n       The federal law outlawing some of the most dangerous \n     military-style guns will expire Sept. 13, leaving the nation \n     more vulnerable to horrific crimes.\n       The Republican leadership in the House has bottled up the \n     bill extending the 10-year-old assault-weapons ban. But \n     President Bush will bear part of the blame if nothing is \n     done.\n       The president has recently repeated his promise, first made \n     when running for president in 2000, to sign an extension. \n     But, unlike his push for the war in Iraq and a tax cut, he \n     has not lifted a finger to see that the bill reaches his \n     desk, and the gun lobby has vowed to keep it from getting \n     there. Bush wants to have it both ways.\n       The ban has been only modestly successful in curbing the \n     sale of rapid-fire semi-automatic weapons. Gun manufacturers \n     have devised ways around it; copycat models and high-capacity \n     magazines, imported from abroad, proliferate.\n       But the answer is to tighten and to expand the law, along \n     the lines of California's smartly effective 5-year-old \n     assault-weapons ban, and not to return to the days when a \n     wannabe drug dealer or cop killer could buy an Uzi at a local \n     gun shop.\n       Law enforcement groups are urging that the ban be \n     continued. It would be a travesty if officers once again find \n     themselves outgunned on the streets they are sworn to \n     protect.\n\n\n[[Page S7985]]\n\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Chair.\n  I thank my colleague from California for her leadership and her \neloquence on this issue. She has done a wonderful job, and I hope that \nher pleas to the White House and to the House are heeded.\n  We stand on the floor today debating an amendment to the Constitution \nfor which there is already a statute that does the same thing. We are \nignoring basic needs. Instead of debating this amendment, why aren't we \ndebating homeland security? Last Friday there was a warning issued to \nall of us, a severe warning, yet the Homeland Security bill, despite \nthe warning that was issued to us on Friday, languishes.\n  We are here today to bring up another important issue--people's lives \nand these kinds of weapons, which thankfully have been banned on our \nstreets for the last 10 years and, woefully, may be back on our streets \n2 months from today if we do nothing.\n  That is the bottom line. The assault weapons ban has been an amazing \nsuccess. It is supported by the American people overwhelmingly. \nYesterday a poll showed that 79 percent support renewal. Today a new \npoll showed that in the swing States, Midwestern and Southern States, \nwhere there are large numbers of gun owners, overwhelming majorities \nsupport the ban. Gun owners support the ban. Law enforcement supports \nthe ban. The list that my colleague from California showed is lengthy \nand comprehensive.\n  So why wouldn't something that has saved lives, that has been so \nsuccessful, that has helped bring down the crime rate not be brought up \non the floor of the House and is in danger of lapsing? One simple word: \nPolitics. Politics of a small few who seem to call the dance when it \ncomes to dealing with issues like this Street Sweeper.\n\n  Point one is that these weapons are not made for hunting. They are \nnot made for self-defense. They were designed by armies to kill a lot \nof people quickly. They are never used by good people, who certainly \nhave a right to bear arms. In fact, recently al-Qaida told its \nmembership in a training manual found by the U.S. military that \nterrorists should use America's weak gun laws to get serious weapons \nand to try to get assault weapons. Terrorists want these weapons, drug \ndealers want these weapons, criminals want these weapons. Police men \nand women do not want these weapons, hunters do not want these weapons, \nsmall store owners who carry a small sidearm for self-defense don't \nwant these weapons.\n  Why do we have to be on the Senate floor pleading with the President \nand the House for renewal of a law that has been so successful? Again, \none word: Politics. A small group of fanatical people somehow have an \nideological mission that they must restore these weapons to our \nstreets. They don't represent gun owners. They don't represent the \nNorth or the South or the East or the West. They represent their own \nmisguided ideology. But the President, who is on the campaign trail \ntalking about leadership, cowers and shakes before this small group of \nideologues. He has said he is for the renewal of the assault weapons \nban. But according to the House leadership, he has not mentioned once \nto them that he would like the bill to be on the floor of the House of \nRepresentatives. The Speaker of the House says that we need the \nPresident to get this going. The President says the House should do it. \nIt is a classic Abbott and Costello routine, a shell game, a classic \nduck the consequences, or the worst aspects of politics.\n  The bottom line is that if George Bush wanted the assault weapons ban \nto be renewed, it would be. All he would have to do is pick up the \nphone once and call Speaker Hastert and say put it on the floor of the \nHouse; and on the floor of the House it would pass, just as it passed \nthis body a few months ago when the Senator from California and I \noffered it. And then the President would sign it.\n  But the President thinks he can get away with this, that he can get \naway with this nasty little game; that he will keep happy his hard-core \nsmall number of supporters who believe these weapons should be on the \nstreets, and he will not pay the price.\n  Mr. President, I cannot predict how our politics will work out in the \nnext few months. But it is my guess that if this ban is not renewed, \nand AK-47s, Street Sweepers, and Uzis are back on our streets, starting \n2 months from today, that the President will pay a political price for \nit. That is no solace to me. That is no solace to my colleague from \nCalifornia. We would much rather have this renewed, as everybody knows \nit should be.\n  No hunter, no gun owner has been hurt by the inability to carry an \nUzi. Some criminals have been hurt, terrorists have been hurt, but no \nlegitimate citizen who certainly has a right to bear arms. And I \nsupport the second amendment, but I don't support the view that it \nshould be seen through a pi hole.\n  We make one last plea--and we have 13 legislative days left--to the \nPresident of these United States to step up to the plate, show real \nleadership, and ask that the assault weapons ban be put on the floor of \nthe House of Representatives, and that it be renewed because it has \nbeen successful and good for just about everybody.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have several articles printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the New York Times, April 20, 2004]\n\n                   Targeting Voters in the Worst Way\n\n       It is not quite the same as kissing babies, but Vice \n     President Dick Cheney beamed as he handled an antique rifle \n     for his photo-op last weekend at the National Rifle \n     Association convention. Mr. Cheney, the administration's most \n     famous duck hunter, was on a reassurance mission, drawing \n     cheers as he trumpeted President Bush's commitment to \n     hunters' constitutional rights. Mr. Cheney attacked Senator \n     John Kerry, the Democratic challenger, as a firearms wuss, \n     despite Mr. Kerry's beady-eyed display last fall when he \n     blasted pheasants from the Iowa skies in his own vote-hunting \n     foray.\n       Mr. Cheney's personal visit signaled how much of a fence-\n     mending charade the White House is staging to soothe the \n     politically powerful gun lobby. Some N.R.A. members are still \n     miffed at Mr. Bush's ostensible promise--left over from his \n     2000 campaign--to sign a renewal of the 10-year-old ban on \n     assault weapons if that vitally needed measure should ever \n     manage to be passed by the Republican-controlled Congress. \n     But, of course, the Capitol's pro-gun leadership has already \n     made sure that the president's promise bobs as lifelessly as \n     an election-year decoy.\n       Banning assault rifles simply protects society from fast-\n     fire attack weapons designed for waging war, not hunting. But \n     Mr. Bush never once pressed Congress to pass the renewal. \n     Instead, he spent his political capital on the gun lobby's \n     outrageous proposal to grant immunity from damage suits to \n     irresponsible gun manufacturers and dealers.\n       This is the Bush-Cheney team's true record on gun control. \n     Too few voters are aware that the assault weapons ban will \n     certainly expire in September while the president declines to \n     lift a finger to save it. The law's demise looms as another \n     national gun tragedy, even as politicians in both parties \n     calibrate how much more pandering to gun owners will be \n     needed in the hunt for votes in the swing states.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Post-Standard, June 27, 2004]\n\n                              Consider This\n\n        The assault weapons ban might not have become law a decade \n     ago without an assist from what some might consider an \n     unexpected quarter--former president Ronald Reagan.\n        Already out of office, Reagan nevertheless expended what \n     political capital he had left to lobby fellow Republicans. \n     The measure passed the House by just two votes.\n        That same assault weapons ban, which has been doing its \n     job keeping lethal weaponry out of the hands of criminals all \n     these years, is set to expire in September.

The measure--the NRA's top \n     legislative priority--had already passed the House, and this \n     week was close to passage in the Senate as well, until NRA \n     lobbyists stepped in at the last minute and ordered that the \n     bill be killed.\n        Why the sudden change of heart? Because Democrats and \n     moderate Republicans had succeeded in attaching two quite \n     sensible, reasonable gun-safety measures to the bill. One \n     amendment extended the 1994 ban on military-style assault \n     weapons that's set to expire in September; the other closed a \n     loophole that permitted people to buy firearms at gun shows \n     without having to undergo instant background checks.\n        Officially, President Bush backs both measures, although \n     he has done nothing to support them. According to a recent \n     survey by the Consumer Federation of America, the assault \n     rifle ban is also supported by a majority of the nation's gun \n     owners. The assault weapons ban is particularly important to \n     law enforcement officers, who had pleaded with Congress to \n     renew the ban and also close the gun show loophole. According \n     to the Justice Department, the proportion of banned assault \n     weapons traced to crimes had dropped by 65.8 percent since \n     1995, most likely as a result of that law.\n        Nonetheless, U.S. Sen. Zell Miller was among six Democrats \n     who voted against renewing the ban on military-style assault \n     weapons. ``First of all, the term `assault' was dreamed up to \n     give the weapons included a bad name. Who could be for an \n     `assault weapons'? The definition is really `semi-automatic,' \n     and about 15 percent of all firearms owned in the U.S. meet \n     the definition,'' said Miller.\n        Had the gun-immunity bill passed, it would have voided \n     hundreds of pending lawsuits, including those filed by more \n     than 30 cities devastated by gun violence and by dozens of \n     shooting victims and their families. For example, it would \n     have slammed shut the courthouse door to the families of the \n     victims of Beltway snipers John Allen Muhammad and Lee Boyd \n     Malvo. The families are suing Bull's Eye Shooter Supply, the \n     Washington state gun shop where Malvo either bought or stole \n     the semi-automatic rifle used to slaughter 10 people. Between \n     2000 and 2003, the gun shop somehow ``lost'' 230 other guns \n     from its inventory.\n        Bull's Eye tried to have the case dismissed, but the \n     courts ruled that the store had some responsibility to ensure \n     its firearms didn't fall into the hands of criminals. The \n     judge relied on the established legal principle that a person \n     who carelessly furnishes a criminal an open opportunity to \n     commit a crime can be held liable.\n        The NRA and its supporters want to give the gun industry \n     an immunity to being sued that no other American industry \n     enjoys. As they have demonstrated, they want that immunity \n     only on their terms, with no compromise and no tolerance for \n     any effort that might reduce the toll in lost and broken \n     lives attributed to guns. And while that absolutist approach \n     is troubling, the docile willingness of so many in Congress \n     to accommodate that extremism is more troubling still.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Los Angeles Times, May 16, 2004]\n\n                       NRA's Eye Is Fixed on Bush\n\n       Just under four months from today, Americans will be able \n     to walk out of a gun store with an AK-47 rifle, an Uzi or \n     other weapon of mass murder under their arm.\n       Unless Congress acts--and Republican leaders show no \n     inclination to do so--the 10-year-old federal assault gun ban \n     will expire Sept. 13. A word from President Bush would get a \n     renewal before lawmakers, a majority of whom would probably \n     approve it. But the president is silent.\n       Most people, including most gun owners, are properly \n     alarmed. A survey released last month by the University of \n     Pennsylvania's Annenberg Public Policy Center found that 71% \n     of those surveyed and 64% of gun owners wanted Congress to \n     extend the ban.\n       But congressional leaders, too accustomed to taking \n     marching orders from the National Rifle Assn., have stymied \n     the reauthorization bill that Sens. Dianne Feinstein (D-\n     Calif.), John W. Warner (R-Va.) and Charles E. Schumer (D-\n     N.Y.) introduced last year.\n       The 1994 ban bars the manufacture and importation of 19 \n     specific semiautomatic gun models and other models with \n     similar features. These are not hunting weapons; what they do \n     best is mow down humans, from factory workers to 6-year-olds \n     in a school cafeteria. That's why Los Angeles Police Chief \n     William J. Bratton and his colleagues in other cities \n     steadfastly support renewing the ban. Bans by the states on \n     such weapons, including California's, would stay in effect. \n     But there would be no bar against Californians buying such \n     guns in Nevada or elsewhere.\n       The NRA disingenuously insists that the federal law is \n     flawed because it prohibits some guns while permitting \n     virtually identical weapons cosmetically tweaked to evade the \n     law's reach. But when Feinstein proposed a more inclusive \n     ban, similar to California's, which defines assault guns by \n     their generic characteristics, the NRA crushed it. It also \n     blocked her effort to close a loophole in the current law \n     that allows importation of high-capacity bullet clips.\n       However tempting it is to blame Congress for the stalemate \n     over this bill, the leadership failure is really the \n     president's. Bush has said he backs the ban. He also wants \n     the NRA's political endorsement, which the gun group is \n     withholding until after the ban expires. So Bush has put no \n     pressure on Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) or \n     House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) to move Feinstein's \n     measure or its House counterpart.\n       If Bush says the word, Frist and Hastert will put the gun \n     ban extension before their colleagues for a vote. And if Bush \n     means it when he says his top priority is to keep Americans \n     safe, he will do just that.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Los Angeles Times, July 13, 2004]\n\n                       Reload the Assault Gun Ban\n\n       Two months from today, the federal assault weapons ban \n     dissolves like a wisp of gun smoke. Even though he proudly \n     carried the National Rifle Assn.'s seal of approval in 2000, \n     President Bush says he supports renewing the 10-year-old ban, \n     but he has refused to push Congress in that direction. His \n     word to congressional leaders would matter greatly now, just \n     as his continued silence suggests that he values the NRA's \n     support over Americans' safety.\n       The NRA's strategy is to get its friends in Congress to run \n     out the clock on the assault weapons ban. Toward that end, \n     House leaders have blocked any vote on bills to extend the \n     ban for another decade, and a Senate bill amended with \n     renewal language died in March. Yet congressional leaders are \n     pushing for votes on time-wasting wedge issues such as \n     proposed constitutional amendments banning same-sex marriage \n     and flag desecration.\n       The 1994 ban bars the manufacture and importation of 19 \n     specific semiautomatic gun models and others with similar \n     features. These aren't hunting weapons, unless you consider a \n     classroom full of 7-year-olds or swing-shift workers at a \n     factory to be prey.\n       The NRA loudly insists that the law is flawed because it \n     bars some guns while allowing nearly identical weapons that \n     have been cosmetically tweaked. That's absolutely correct. \n     But when Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who sponsored the \n     1994 ban, proposed a more inclusive ban, like California's, \n     which defines assault guns by their generic characteristics, \n     the NRA crushed it. It also killed her effort to close a \n     loophole in the current law that allows importation of high-\n     capacity bullet clips. If the federal law does expire, \n     California's assault gun ban would stay in effect. But there \n     would be no bar against Californians buying these weapons of \n     mass destruction in Nevada or elsewhere.\n       Bush justifies the war in Iraq by insisting that it has \n     made this nation safer. But the president and his \n     congressional allies risk making American cities and towns \n     far more dangerous by their shameful failure to renew the \n     assault gun ban. They have just 61 days left.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 25, 2003]\n\n                         Weapons for Terrorism\n\n       Some of the most efficient firearms sought by terrorists--\n     international as well as domestic--may flood the markets of \n     this country if Congress fails to renew a federal ban on \n     semiautomatic assault-style weapons. The ban is scheduled to \n     expire next year after a decade in force; House Majority \n     Leader Tom DeLay (R-Tex.) announced at one point recently \n     that the House would not even have a vote on the matter. But \n     House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) then insisted that \n     no final decision had been made, noting that he first wants \n     to talk to President Bush, who has been on record as \n     supporting the ban. That's the right position, but it will \n     take more than presidential lip service to uphold it in an \n     election year.\n       The 1994 law made it illegal to manufacture, transfer or \n     possess 19 specific models of semiautomatic weapons. It also \n     banned ammunition magazines that hold more than 10 rounds. If \n     anything, the law needs to be\n\n[[Page S7987]]\n\n     strengthened. A Congressional Research Service report \n     released last week found that U.S. gun laws in general can be \n     easily exploited by terrorist operatives shopping for weapons \n     in this country. In the case of assault weapons, the gun \n     industry has found clever ways to make cosmetic design \n     changes in their models to get around the federal ban. Even \n     so, according to the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, \n     every major law enforcement organization in the country has \n     supported the ban. These groups point out that these firearms \n     remain the weapons of choice for drug traffickers, gangs and \n     paramilitary groups. As weak as the ban may be, evidence \n     exists that the number of assault weapons traced to crimes \n     dips when such laws are in place. In Maryland, for example, a \n     ban on assault pistols took effect in June 1994. The Brady \n     Center found that the number of these guns recovered by \n     Baltimore police in the first six months of 1995 was down 45 \n     percent from the comparable period the year before.\n       The ban on assault weapons needs time and broadening to \n     have more effect. Reopening the gates to still more assault \n     weapons makes no sense in civilized society. Congress and the \n     president ought not make it any easier for terrorists, \n     deranged people, drive-by shooters or criminals--foreign or \n     domestic--to kill and maim.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I want to address the motion to proceed to \nthe amendment now pending before the body, the Federal marriage \namendment. One of the arguments that I hear again and again--I guess I \nam so shocked and amazed that somebody would actually make the argument \nthat I perhaps have not done a very good job in responding to it.\n  For the record, I think it is important to respond to the argument \nthat has been made twice this afternoon on the floor by the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin and the Senator from Maryland, that the constitutional \namendment process is for expanding and not limiting rights. In other \nwords, they think the only permissible purpose of a constitutional \namendment is to expand, not limit individual rights, presumably \nincluding the right to same-sex marriage.\n  These are the same people who accuse supporters of wanting to ``write \ndiscrimination into the Constitution.'' I find the argument disturbing \nand offensive, but I also find it somewhat revealing. I wish that \neveryone who was engaged in this debate would take counsel in the words \nthe distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, who is in the Chamber, \nonce stated during the course of the debate on the Defense of Marriage \nAct back in 1996. Even though he did not support the Defense of \nMarriage Act at that time, he observed that ``there are strongly held \nreligious, ethical, and moral beliefs that are different from mine with \nregard to the issue of same-sex marriage, which I respect and which are \nno indication of intolerance.'' I agree with those words.\n  To those who consider the traditional institution of marriage to be \nabout discrimination, they have already, somehow, made same-sex \nmarriage into a right that is the status quo that those who want to \npreserve traditional marriage are trying to discriminate against. I \ndon't know whether it is just a technique of argument to try to pin the \nidea of discrimination or of wanting to limit rights on those who \nbasically want to preserve the status quo as it has existed in our \ncivilization for 5,000 years, and certainly in this country for as long \nas it has existed or whether they actually have bought into the \nspecious argument that somehow wanting to preserve the institution of \ntraditional marriage for the benefit of the American family and our \nchildren is about limiting rights.\n  It is nothing of the kind. Indeed, both the NAACP and the American \nBar Association have testified that they have no position on whether \ntraditional marriage laws should remain on the books.\n  Now, setting that aside for just a moment, which is rather amazing in \nand of itself, if marriage were about discrimination, surely both the \nNAACP and the American Bar Association would oppose it. But it is not, \nand they did not. To the contrary, religious leaders in every community \nacross America have expressed their support for traditional marriage. \nThey recognize the importance of traditional marriage in their \nrespective communities, including many communities that are all too \nfamiliar with the scourge of discrimination.\n  Indeed, during some of the hearings that we have had on this issue in \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee, we had individuals such as Rev. Ray \nHammond of the Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Boston; \nRev. Richard Richardson of the St. Paul African Methodist Episcopal \nChurch in Boston; and Pastor Daniel de Leon, Sr., of Alianza de \nMinisterious Evangelicos Nacionales, otherwise known as AMEN, and \nTemplo Calvario in Santa Ana, CA. Surely, these people, who have fought \ntheir entire lives against racial discrimination, and who support \ntraditional marriage, cannot be labeled as bigots or wanting to limit \nrights or somehow wanting to write discrimination into the \nConstitution. To the contrary, they understand that it is traditional \nmarriage that represents the status quo.\n  It was a basic assumption of John Adams when he penned the \nMassachusetts Constitution but which was rewritten at the hand of four \njudges on the Massachusetts Supreme Court.\n  It is those of us who are arguing for this constitutional amendment \nto preserve the status quo in this country who are doing just that and \nnot attempting to limit rights. Rather, it is telling that those who \nmake accusations are so intolerant of the democratic process contained \nin article V of the U.S. Constitution that provides a means for the \npeople to express their views and to have a voice, to have a vote on \nsomething as important as this.\n  It is precisely because these activists believe traditional marriage \nis about discrimination that they believe all traditional marriage laws \nare unconstitutional and, therefore, must be abolished by the courts. \nThese activists have left the American people with no middle ground. \nThey accuse others of writing discrimination into the Constitution, yet \nthey are the ones writing the American people out of our constitutional \ndemocracy.\n  As I have often said, and I think it is worth saying again, the \nAmerican people believe in two fundamental propositions, at least, \namong others: One is the essential dignity and worth of every human \nbeing. This is not about wanting to limit rights or wanting to hurt \nanyone. This is about preserving something that is a positive social \ngood in our society, that has stood the test of time, something that is \nimportant to the stability of our civilization, that is important \nbecause it is in the best interest of children.\n  I had the honor for 4 years to serve as attorney general of my State, \nand Texas is one of the few States where the attorney general has the \nprivilege of enforcing child support obligations. I am very proud of \nthe good work the men and women in my office did to improve our \ncollection efforts by more than 80 percent in 4 years because they were \nliterally able to put food on the table and a shelter over children who \ndid not have that because they were denied the right given to them \nunder our laws to have the financial support to which they are \nentitled. But it was there I became very aware of the challenges that \nconfront children in a society that cares only about adults and thinks \nabout children only as an afterthought.\n  We know, as Senator Santorum mentioned, the only place where we \nactually have some experience, some record of what happens when a \nradical experiment with the definition of marriage and traditional \nfamily takes place is we have this correlation with an increase in out-\nof-wedlock childbirths and more and more children who are at risk of a \nwhole host of social ills.\n  As somebody who believes the family first and foremost is there to \nhelp those children as they grow, to avoid those risks and to grow up \nand be productive citizens, I do not think we ought to be taking any \nchances with the most important and fundamental institution we know of \nin our society that is designed to operate in their best interest, not \ncoincidentally so that the American taxpayers do not have to continue \nspending their hard-earned money to provide services that might \notherwise be provided by the family, or build more prisons or provide \nmore opportunities for drug and alcohol rehabilitation, other risks \nthat, unfortunately, too many of our children fall trap to today.\n  I found it very compelling that members of the minority community--\nAfrican-American and Hispanic communities--particularly those who work \nin\n\n[[Page S7988]]\n\nplaces such as Boston and California and elsewhere, are some of the \nmost passionate about the importance of maintaining the traditional \nfamily against this attempt to write them out of our laws and out of \nour Constitution.\n  It seems the supporters of traditional marriage are faced with an \nunhappy task: Either we give up the traditional institution of marriage \nto those activists who want to rewrite the definition, who see marriage \nas nothing more than discrimination, or we enshrine traditional \nmarriage with the constitutional protection our children need and \ndeserve.\n  I believe the traditional institution of marriage is too important to \nsit on the sidelines or to fail to have this important debate. I \nbelieve it is worth defending, and that is why I support this important \namendment.\n  I see the Senator from Massachusetts in the Chamber. I will be glad \nto yield so he may address the Chamber.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, under the previous agreement, I believe I \nam allotted 15 minutes; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 12 minutes.\n  Mr. President, we know there are many urgent challenges our country \nfaces. The war in Iraq has brought sudden new dangers, imposed massive \nnew costs, and is taking more and more American lives each week. At \nhome, unemployment is still a crisis for millions of our citizens. \nRetirement savings are disappearing, school budgets are in crisis, \ncollege tuition is rising, prescription drug costs and other health \ncare expenses are soaring, millions of Americans are uninsured, Federal \nbudget deficits extend as far as the eye can see, we cannot even pass a \nbudget bill, and our good friends, the Senator from California, Mrs. \nFeinstein, and the Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer, spoke to the \nSenate about the importance of continuing the ban on assault weapons \nthat has made such an extraordinary difference in helping to protect \nAmerican lives and which is about to expire in the next several days. \nThat is a matter we ought to be considering if we are interested in \nsecurity and protecting the lives of American citizens, as well as if \nwe are going to protect family values. But, no, that is not the \nopportunity we have under our Republican leadership.\n  We just celebrated the 40th anniversary of the great Civil Rights Act \nof 1964. Yet now, instead of dealing with the real priorities facing \nthe Nation, the Republican leadership, President Bush, wants us to \npersuade Congress to write bigotry back into the Constitution by \ndenying gays and lesbians the right to marry and receive the same \nbenefits and protections married couples now have.\n  It could not be clearer that the Republican leadership has brought up \nthis proposal for pure politics, not for its underlying merits. They \nare hoping to use the issue to drive a wedge between one group of \ncitizens and the rest of the country solely for partisan advantage.\n  The Republican leadership does not want a vote on the merits. Do you \nhear me? The Republican leadership does not want a vote on the merits.\n  Last Friday, Senator Reid informed the Senate that the Democrats were \nwilling to accept a time agreement with a straight up-or-down vote on \nthe Federal marriage amendment on Wednesday. We have cleared it on our \nside to do that, he said; we are ready to move forward on it; we are \nready to rock and roll. Those were the words of the Senator from \nNevada. And the Republican leadership refused our offer.\n  Can you imagine that? We have listened to all these statements, all \nthese speeches about let the Senate exercise its will, let's take \naction, this is urgent, important, and we agreed to do it and they said \nno. No, no, the Republican leadership refused our offer, and we \nquestion their sincerity about this amendment when we offer and agree \nto vote at a certain time and they say, no, no, we are not going to do \nthat; we feel passionately about this amendment; we believe in the \nimportance of our amendment, but we do not want to permit you to vote \non this amendment.\n  In all my years in the Senate, I do not recall a single instance in \nwhich the party that supported a measure refused an up-or-down vote on \nits merits and instead manipulated the process to produce a cloture \nvote on a motion to proceed. That is what we are faced with. You ask us \nwhy we doubt their sincerity, why we question the timing of bringing \nthis up, and the process and the procedure when we on this side say, \nOK, we'll vote on it, and you say no. Oh, yes, we are sincere about our \nmotives, we care deeply about children, we care about the Constitution, \nwe care about all of these issues, but we don't want a vote. That just \ndoesn't add up.\n\n  Obviously, they fear that too many Republican Senators would vote \nagainst the constitutional amendment on its merits. In fact, it is \npossible that it would not even get a majority of Senators to support \nit. When it became clear that a majority of the members in the \nJudiciary Committee did not support this proposal, they simply bypassed \nthe committee process altogether.\n  This is not a serious debate about our constitutional tradition and \nvalues. If it were, we would have a vote on this tomorrow, up or down, \nas the Democratic leadership has proposed. Instead, it is a procedural \nway in order to put people on the record. It is a sham. It is a \ndesperate ploy to divide the Nation for political advantage. The rabid \nreactionary religious right has rarely looked more ridiculous. They \nknow they don't have the votes to come even close to passing this \namendment, but they have a sufficient stranglehold on the White House \nand the Republican leadership in Congress to force the issue to a vote \nanyway, in a desperate effort to arouse their narrowminded constituency \nand somehow gain an advantage in the elections this year. My guess is \ntheir strategy will boomerang and that vastly more Americans will be \nturned off than are turned on by this appeal to stain the Constitution \nwith their language of bigotry.\n  There is absolutely no need to amend the Constitution on this issue. \nAs news reports from across the country make clear, Massachusetts and \nother States are already dealing with the issue, and doing it \neffectively, and doing it according to the wishes of the citizens of \ntheir States. Contrary to the claims of the supporters of the \namendment, no State has been bound--listen to this--no State has been \nbound or will be bound by the rulings or laws on same-sex marriage in \nany other State. That is the constitutional law. You can hear it \ndescribed in other forms out here, and surely it has been, but I have \njust stated the constitutional law.\n  Longstanding constitutional precedents make clear that the States \nhave broad discretion in deciding to what extent they will honor other \nStates' laws on sensitive questions about marriage and raising \nfamilies. The Federal statute enacted in 1996, the Defense of Marriage \nAct, makes the possibility of nationwide enforceability even more \nremote.\n  So if it is not necessary to amend the Constitution, it is necessary \nnot to amend it. In more than 200 years of our history, we have amended \nthe Constitution only 17 times since the adoption of the Bill of \nRights. Many of those amendments have been adopted to expand and \nprotect people's rights.\n  Having endorsed this shameful proposed amendment in an effort to \ndivide Americans and assist the faltering election campaign, President \nBush will go down in history as the first President to try to write \nbigotry back into the Constitution. No one can now claim with a \nstraight face that he has lived up to the campaign promise to be a \nuniter and not a divider.\n\n  The manner in which this amendment has been brought up to the Senate \nfloor is disgraceful. The Republican leadership has decided to bypass \nthe usual process of debating and marking up proposed constitutional \namendments in the Judiciary Committee. They know they do not have the \nvotes to pass it out of the committee. They also know they do not have \nthe two-thirds majority they need to pass the amendment in the full \nSenate, but they have chosen to rush it to the floor of the Senate \nanyway, in an effort to embarrass Democrats before our convention at \nthe end of the month.\n  It is Republicans who should be embarrassed. As Chairman Hatch once \nsaid:\n\n       It denigrates the committee process to bypass the Judiciary \n     Committee, especially when an amendment to the Constitution \n     of the United States of America, the most important document \n     in the history of the Nation, is involved.\n\n  In the past 25 years, only 2 amendments out of 19 have been \nconsidered\n\n[[Page S7989]]\n\non the Senate floor without having been referred to the committee \nfirst. In both these cases, the amendment was brought before the full \nSenate by unanimous consent. Trying to write discrimination in the \nConstitution is bad enough, but throwing the Senate rules out the \nwindow and proceeding with a discriminatory amendment that the majority \nof Americans do not want and a majority of the Senators don't support \nsolely for the purpose of scoring points in a Presidential election \ncampaign demeans this institution and all who have served in it.\n  This debate is about politics--an attempt to drive a wedge between \none group of citizens and the rest of the country solely for partisan \nadvantage. We have rejected that tactic before, and we should reject it \nagain.\n  In the Goodridge case, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court was \ninterpreting the Massachusetts Constitution, not the U.S. Constitution. \nAs a rule, the Federal Government has no authority to tell States how \nto interpret their own laws and constitutions. The Federal marriage \nconstitutional amendment would change this fundamental principle of \nState sovereignty by imposing a rule of interpretation on State courts.\n  I am certainly glad it was not done at other times of American \nhistory. The Massachusetts Constitution was written by John Adams in \n1780. He wrote it virtually himself, much of it copied by the \nConstitutional Convention in 1787.\n  In 1783, the issue of slavery came before the Massachusetts Supreme \nCourt, and Massachusetts has the only constitution of all 50 States \nthat has been interpreted as barring slavery. We were the first State \nof all the States to ban slavery, the only State that banned it in the \nconstitution itself, Massachusetts, under John Adams, the only State, \nin 1783. And we had slaves in my State for 150 years before it.\n  So it is nice to hear our colleagues talk about Massachusetts and \nabout our court and our judges there. I remind our colleagues, of the \nseven Massachusetts judges who voted, six were and are Republicans. \nOnly one is a Democrat. Six are Republicans. I happen to be someone who \nsupports the court decision in Massachusetts. I am proud of them.\n\n  But make no mistake, a vote for the Federal marriage constitutional \namendment is a vote against civil unions, domestic partnerships, and \nother efforts by States to treat gays and lesbians fairly under the \nlaw. It is a vote against allowing States to decide these issues for \nthemselves. It is a vote for imposing discrimination, plain and simple, \non all 50 States.\n  Supporters of the proposed amendment claim that religious freedom is \nsomehow under attack by States that grant the same rights and the same \nbenefits to same-sex couples that married couples now have. But as the \nfirst amendment makes clear, no court, no State, no Congress can tell \nany church, any religious group, how to conduct its own affairs. No \ncourt, no State, no Congress can require any church, any synagogue, any \nmosque to perform a same-sex marriage. Not a single church in \nMassachusetts or any other State has been required to do anything it \ndoesn't want to do, and that will continue to be the case so long as \nthe Federal marriage constitutional amendment does not take place.\n  The true threat to religious freedom is posed by the Federal marriage \namendment itself, which would tell churches they cannot consecrate a \nsame-sex marriage, even though some churches are now doing so. The \namendment would flagrantly interfere with the decisions of religious \ncommunities and undermine the longstanding separation of church and \nstate in our society.\n  As Rabbi Michael Namath, a member of the Union for Reform Judaism and \nthe Central Conference of American Rabbis, explained in a recent forum:\n\n       Some religious traditions, including Reform Judaism, \n     recognize the legitimacy of same-sex unions. Many Reform \n     rabbis around the country routinely perform same-sex \n     weddings. Yet some warn that if the FMA were adopted, \n     performing a religious wedding ceremony for a same-sex couple \n     might be unconstitutional, illegal. . . . The FMA would give \n     the federal government express authority to bar religious \n     groups from sanctioning same-sex marriage--and the authority \n     to punish those that do.\n       . . . Court challenges on ``free exercise'' grounds may not \n     succeed because the Federal Marriage Amendment, being the \n     more recent addition to the Constitution, might supersede the \n     ``free exercise'' clause. If so, this would undermine the \n     foundations of our country.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used the 12 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, those who oppose gay marriage and \ndisagree with the recent decision by the supreme judicial court have a \nfirst amendment right to express their views.\n  There is no justification for attempting to undermine the separation \nof church and state in our society or to write discriminations against \ngays and lesbians in the U.S. Constitution. Too often the debate over \nthe definition of marriage and its legal incidence have ignored the \nvery personal and loving family relationships that would be prohibited \nby a constitutional amendment.\n  More and more children across the country today have same-sex \nparents. What does it do to these children and their well-being when \nthe President of the United States and the Senate Republican leadership \nsay their parents are second-class citizens?\n  The decision by the Massachusetts court addressed the many rights \navailable to married couples under the State law, including the right \nto be treated fairly by the State's tax laws, to share insurance \ncoverage, to visit loved ones in the hospitals, to receive health \nbenefits, family leave benefits, and survivor benefits. In fact, there \nare now more than a thousand Federal rights and benefits based on \nmarriage.\n  Gay couples and their children deserve to share in all of these \nrights and benefits, too. Supporters of the amendment have tried to \nshift the debate away from equal rights by claiming their only concern \nis the definition of marriage, but many supporters of the amendment are \nagainst civil union laws as well and against any other rights for gays \nor lesbians.\n  Just last month we saw a new dawn for civil rights in the Senate. On \nan amendment to the Defense authorization bill, we passed our \nbipartisan hate crimes legislation by an overwhelming majority, 65 to \n33. Thanks in large part to the courageous and effective leadership of \nSenator Gordon Smith, 18 Republican Senators joined all Democratic \nSenators in approving this needed protection against hate-motivated \nviolence. Last month's vote on hate crimes showed the Senate at its \nbest. The decision to bring up this divisive, discriminatory, and \nunnecessary amendment does just the opposite.\n  We have far better things to do in the Senate than write bigotry and \nprejudice into the Constitution. We should deal with the real issues of \nwar and peace, jobs and the economy, and many other priorities demand \nour attention so urgently in these troubled times. I urge my colleagues \nto reject this discriminatory proposal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, did the distinguished Democratic whip wish \nto be recognized?\n  Mr. REID. Did the Senator from Colorado have something he wanted to \nsay?\n  Mr. ALLARD. I was going to yield some time to the senior Senator from \nVirginia.\n  Mr. REID. If I could be heard briefly, we on this side are seeing the \nend of people who wish to speak tonight. The only speakers we have \nremaining, following Senator Dayton, are Senator Clinton for 15 minutes \nand Senator Jeffords for 10 minutes. I ask unanimous consent that in \nthe usual order we have been using today of back and forth, Senator \nClinton next be recognized, Senator Jeffords be recognized following \nthat, and if the Republicans have speakers interspersed between those \nwe understand that.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Let me understand the Senator's request. We have been \nalternating back and forth.\n  Mr. REID. We will continue to do that.\n  Mr. ALLARD. We will continue to do that on this side?\n  Mr. REID. I was saying, if the Republican side did not have a speaker \nwe would go ahead.\n  Mr. ALLARD. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I yield the senior Senator from Virginia \nsuch time as he may consume.\n\n[[Page S7990]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I yield him 10 minutes. It is always a pleasure to be \nable to recognize him because we all admire the work he does. I am \nparticularly proud to be able to serve with him on the Armed Services \nCommittee. He is the chairman and does a great job.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my distinguished colleague from Colorado. I \ncommend him, as well as the Senators from Texas, Pennsylvania, and \nAlabama, and so many who have worked on this important constitutional \namendment, S.J. Res. 40.\n  I have listened to the debate the past several days. I have actually \ngone back, together with my staff, and reviewed the Congressional \nRecord of Friday and Monday. I feel obligated to indicate to the Senate \nmy own views with regard to this resolution and what I intend to do.\n  First, I intend to vote in support of cloture on the motion to \nproceed to the Federal Marriage Amendment, S.J. Res. 40. I feel very \nstrongly that the Senate should be accorded the opportunity to debate \nin full and to amend, if it is necessary, and I think it is necessary, \nS.J. Res. 40.\n  For that purpose, I hope cloture prevails and that we can, as a body, \ncontinue to address this very important legislation. It is of utmost \nseriousness.\n  My greatest concern throughout this process is the heavy weight that \nrests on all of us when we go to amend that document which has enabled \nthis Republic--each morning we open the Senate by our Pledge of \nAllegiance to this Republic, which I think historians will agree is the \nlongest continuous surviving republic in the history of the world. It \nis a remarkable document, the wisdom that is incorporated in our \nConstitution, the Declaration of Independence, and Bill of Rights.\n  Therefore, I think it is incumbent upon the Congress to proceed with \nthe utmost care when amending our Constitution. I think that should be \nbrought out in the ensuing debate if cloture prevails, and I hope it \nwill, and I lend my support.\n  The proposed constitutional amendment reads as follows:\n\n       Marriage in the United States shall consist only of the \n     union of a man and a woman. . . .\n\n  I unequivocally support that part of this resolution. The second \npart, which reads:\n\n       Neither this Constitution, nor the constitution of any \n     State, shall be construed to require that marriage or the \n     legal incidents thereof be conferred upon any union other \n     than the union of a man and woman.\n\n  Therein rests a concern that I have with S.J. Res. 40, and one I will \nwork with others to address in the event hopefully that this Senate \nwill continue its debate and the amendment process. I unequivocally \nsupport the first sentence, as I said. The time-honored tradition of \nmarriage between a man and a woman ought to be protected in light of \nthe attacks by certain opportunists in the judiciary on this time-\nhonored part of our culture and heritage, a culture and heritage that \nour Nation, a young nation, shares with nations far older than ours.\n  Again, the second sentence gives me this pause, despite the \nstatements by many of my colleagues to indicate what they believe the \nintent is. I do not think it speaks to the clarity that the public is \nentitled to and wants, and this could lead to a great deal of confusion \namong the American public, and I do not want to create that confusion. \nIt could lead to considerable litigation.\n  Perhaps of the greatest concern on my part, it could lead to some \nmeasure of hindrance of the ability of the several States, all 50 of \nthem if necessary, to work their will through their legislatures on the \nvery important issues that remain; namely, whether to recognize or not \nto recognize those other forms of relationships, particularly the \ndomestic partnership relationships. For these reasons, I intend to \nalign myself post-cloture with those Senators who seek to modify the \nresolution to retain only, and I repeat to retain only, the first \nsentence:\n\n       Marriage in the United States shall consist only of the \n     union of a man and a woman.\n\n  I see in the Chamber the distinguished Senator from Utah. I wonder if \nI might pose a question. As I look at this language which gives me \npause and I have spoken to, the second sentence, ``Neither this \nConstitution, nor the constitution of any State, shall be construed to \nrequire,'' suppose a State wishes to enact those laws they deem \nnecessary on behalf of the people of that State, either to recognize or \nnot to recognize the domestic partnership. Suppose they wish to put \nthat in as a part of their constitution subject to the passage of this \namendment. How would this amendment then be construed? Would it \noverrule a state's subsequent amendment to its own constitution?\n  Mr. HATCH. If this amendment was passed as the Senator reads that \nlanguage, it does not prohibit the States from having civil unions or \ncivil accommodations.\n  Mr. WARNER. Suppose they wish to do it not by statute but actually by \nan amendment to their constitution? The Senator and I understand that a \nconstitutional amendment has a greater longevity than a statute because \nwhat the legislature does via statute one day they can undo the next \nday.\n  Mr. HATCH. So long as the action of the State, either legislatively \nor constitutionally, does not change the definition of a marriage as \nonly between a man and a woman, the State would have the right to do \nwhatever it wants to in that regard. This just merely makes it clear \nthat nothing in the amendment requires the States to--\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I understand very clearly the intent of this in the minds \nof many. The State legislatures can take such steps. I believe there is \na measure of confusion that causes me to pause. But it reads that \n``neither the Constitution nor the constitution of any State,'' and \nwhat the Senator says is they wish to but legislation not in the form \nof State law, but that constitutional provision would not then be \noverruled by this.\n  Mr. HATCH. The States would have great flexibility under this \namendment. But they could not change the definition of the traditional \nterms. The Senator is correct in his interpretation.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n       We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are \n     created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with \n     certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, \n     liberty and the pursuit of happiness. . . .\n\n  With those immortal words 228 years ago, the signers of the \nDeclaration of Independence set forth the founding principles of this \ncountry. They chose the word ``unalienable'' to mean that those rights \nwere God-given. They were rights with which every person was born, not \nto depend upon the attitudes or ideologies of any government.\n  Eleven years later, after winning their War of Independence, after \ntrying one unsatisfactory design of government, after many discussion, \ndebates, arguments, and compromises, others signed their name to our \nUnited States Constitution. It was a remarkably farsighted document--\ndeserving of the word ``visionary''. It was intended to define, \nprovide, and protect the rights of American citizens and the structure \nof their democratic government.\n  Unfortunately, their founding principles and idealism had some \nglaring deficiencies. When they said all men were created equal, they \nmeant only men, and only white men. It took 130 more years before those \nconstitutional rights were extended fully and equally to all citizens--\nto African-Americans, to women, and to everyone else. Those \nconstitutional amendments signaled only the starting points, not the \nfinish lines, to full opportunities, equal protections, and freedom \nfrom discrimination, harassment, and assault. Those paths were \ndifficult, often dangerous, and sometimes even fatal for their \ntravelers. Slowly, too slowly, unevenly, yet inexorably This country \nhas progressed toward the realization of those God-given rights: life, \nliberty, and the pursuit of happiness, for every American citizen.\n  The life that God gives each of us; the liberty to be as God made us; \nand the right to pursue our individual needs, goals, and fulfillments--\nwhatever necessary ingredients of our happiness. We receive no \nassurances of happiness, but the promise we have the God-given right to \npursue it.\n  Today, we are a Nation of 293 million citizens. That is a lot of very \ndifferent people pursuing a lot of very different forms of happiness. \nIt is an enormous and continuous challenge for government to permit \nlife, liberty, and pursuit of happiness and to decide where limits must \nbe established.\n\n[[Page S7991]]\n\n  The Constitution requires, however, that those limits must apply \nfairly and justly--and that those liberties can only be taken away for \na compelling reason and through a due process.\n  People's differences are no longer legitimate reasons. Not different \ncolors of skin, different religious beliefs, different genders, \nnationalities, or physical characteristics. People don't have to like \nother people's differences, but they must allow and tolerate them.\n  Allowing and tolerating differences is what separates democracies \nfrom dictatorships. Even dictatorships allow behaviors and beliefs \nwhich conform to their ideas and ideologies. However, they will not \npermit or tolerate behaviors and beliefs which differ from theirs. \nThose groups of people are persecuted, punished, and even murdered for \ntheir differences.\n  It is sometimes difficult for those of us who live in democracies to \nallow other beliefs and behaviors, which we dislike or disapprove of. \nIt is especially difficult if those other beliefs or behaviors differ \nfrom our own moral or religious views. Although our Constitution \nseparates ``church and state,'' we do not willingly give up or even \ncompromise our strongly held beliefs based upon our religious teachings \nor moral values.\n  Many Americans who oppose gay and lesbian relationships or marriages \nbelieve they are called to do so by God, by Jesus Christ, by the Bible, \nor by another religion's instructions. Recently, I reread the Bible's \nNew Testament, which provides the foundation and instruction for my \nChristian faith. I reluctantly bring the Bible into this debate, \nbecause I often hear people, who denounce homosexuality, claiming that \n``the Bible'' or ``the New Testament'' supports their views.\n  However, in the entire New Testament, there is only one reference to \nsame-sex relationships, in Chapter Two of Paul's Letter to the Romans. \nJesus Christ does not mention them even once in any of the four \nGospels.\n  Instead, His overriding instruction was to love thy neighbor as \nthyself. That was his second great commandment, which superseded all \nthe rest.\n  Jesus also warned several times to beware of false prophets. How \ncould they be identified? He said that they spread hate, instead of \nlove.\n  I do not understand how some religions developed their strong \nprejudices against gays and lesbians--prejudices which are not only \nunsupported by Jesus' teachings in the Bible, but which even violate \nhis instructions to love one another, as I have loved you, to judge \nnot, lest ye be judged, to spread love, not hatred.\n  Yet the discrimination against gays and lesbians in this country has \nbeen filled with judgment and hatred.\n  Thousands of American citizens have been fired from their jobs, \nevicted from their homes, harassed, threatened, assaulted, even \nmurdered, because of their sexual orientations. Some other Americans \nhave spread that hatred and caused that harm, while professing their \nown religious piety and moral superiority.\n  Who has the authority to dispute that every human being is God's \nintentional creation; that we are different because God made us \ndifferent, not superior, not inferior, just different, equal in the \nsight of God, equal in the U.S. Constitution?\n  There is a better way to resolve this widespread concern about the \neffects of couples' State court decisions on marriage--decisions which \nare being resolved by the legislatures and the people of those States, \nand which contrary to the ``marriage is under terrorist attack'' \nhysteria, as some politicians are promoting, do not threaten either the \nFederal laws or the State laws against same-sex marriages.\n  As others have noted, a 1996 Federal law, called the Defense of \nMarriage Act, already does what the proponents of this constitutional \namendment want to do.\n  The Defense of Marriage Act was passed ``to define and protect the \ninstitution of marriage.'' That law states:\n\n       In determining the meaning of any act of Congress or of any \n     ruling, regulation or interpretation of the various \n     administrative bureaus and agencies of the United States, the \n     word ``marriage'' means only a legal union between one man \n     and one woman as husband and wife.\n\n  The law goes on to say that no State shall be required to recognize a \nsame-sex relationship treated as marriage anywhere else. That is the \nlaw of the United States of America, unchallenged Federal law. How much \nmore protection could the institution of marriage need from the \nCongress? None.\n  The proposed constitutional amendment has not one whit of additional \nlegal protection to what the Federal law already provides, so why are \nwe being subjected to this charade of politicians' piety, an oxymoron \nif ever there was one? It is an election year, a Presidential election \nyear. It is no coincidence that the defense of marriage law was passed \nin 1996, another Presidential election year.\n  One can only wonder how marriage managed to make it through the 2000 \nPresidential election without something being done to it then.\n  That is really what is going on. This political ploy is not about \n``saving marriage''; it is about saving politicians' jobs. Thank \ngoodness we have Senator so and so, they will say back home, to save us \nfrom the heathen hordes. Thank goodness we have the President saving \nus, too. We may not have jobs or health care. We cannot afford \nprescription drugs or gasoline. They are bankrupting the Federal \nGovernment with deficits, they are destroying our credibility \nthroughout the world, they made a mess of Iraq, they cannot find \nweapons of mass destruction or Osama bin Laden or whoever shut down \nCongress with anthrax or ricin, but they are defending marriage--again \nand again and again and again. Let's reelect them.\n  It is a tragic day in America when politicians exploit the \nConstitution of the United States to get themselves reelected. It is a \ntragic day for millions of Americans who are being exploited by those \npoliticians. This is a hurtful, hateful, harmful debate for America, \none that only will get uglier, meaner, more divisive, and more \ndangerous if it moves on to State legislatures as the constitutional \namendment requires.\n  It must be stopped here and now. That is why I will vote against the \nconstitutional amendment. If my colleagues really do want to save \nmarriage for now and for posterity, turn it over to the authority of \nestablished religions. In the many wedding ceremonies which I attend, \nmarriage is described as an institution created by God. Yet those \nservices conclude with ``whom God has joined together let no one cast \nassunder.''\n  If marriage belongs to God, as I believe it does, then our separation \nof church and state government should not interfere with its \nadministration by the properly chosen religious authorities. Instead, \ngovernment should adopt a different term to use for the legal rights \nand responsibilities under a civil contract, which I believe any two \nadults should equally be able to enter into. Giving marriage back to \nthe churches, synagogues, and mosques and separating it from government \nis marriage's salvation and society's solution.\n  Let us direct our efforts to protecting America from al-Qaida. Leave \nthe Constitution alone and leave marriage to God.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have two final speakers tonight, Senator \nClinton and Senator Jeffords. Following that, we would have no more \nspeakers on this side.\n  So when the distinguished chairman of the committee finishes his \nspeech, Senator Clinton will be recognized and following that, Senator \nJeffords.\n  Mr. HATCH. I think Senator Brownback would like to be recognized. \nFollowing Senator Clinton, Senator Brownback will speak.\n  Mr. REID. How much time is left on both sides under the order already \nentered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 40 minutes on the Democrat side.\n  Mr. REID. Fine. And how about the majority?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 75 minutes on the majority side.\n  Mr. REID. After the distinguished Senator from Utah speaks there will \nprobably be no time left.\n  Mr. HATCH. He hopes. I have not noticed the great sense of humor \nlately of the Senator from Nevada but that was very good.\n\n[[Page S7992]]\n\n  I will respond to some of the arguments that my colleagues have been \nmaking against this measure today.\n  First, I thank them for coming to the floor and making themselves \nheard. This is an extremely important issue and it deserves a serious \ndebate. After all, we are talking about traditional marriage. We are \ntalking about traditional marriage that has existed for more than 5,000 \nyears that apparently is going to be overturned if we do not do \nsomething about it.\n  One argument I have heard from my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle is on behalf of States rights. Yesterday, the distinguished \nSenator from California argued that we run the risk of violating the \nsacred rights of the States if we pass this amendment. This morning, \nher colleague from California, the junior Senator from California, made \nthe same point. The distinguished Senator from Wisconsin, too, believes \nmarriage should be defined in the States.\n  When Senators who normally argue for extending national power start \nciting George Will and Bob Barr, we should probably look at their \narguments with a heightened level of scrutiny and maybe even security \nbecause there is something wrong here when these liberal Senators are \nusing as their champions George Will and former Congressman Barr, who \nis one of the most conservative Congressmen who ever sat.\n  When legislators and other advocates who not only tolerate but \nactually embrace repeated judicial amendments to the Constitution--I \nwill talk about judicial amendments to the Constitution--there is \nsudden resistance to popular amendments, the people's amendments, it \nmust be taken with at least a grain of salt.\n  We are talking about judges taking over and amending the Constitution \nat will, which is what is happening in our society, and not only \nJustices of the Supreme Court but four liberal activist justices on the \nMassachusetts Supreme Court, binding every State through the full faith \nand credit clause to their concept of same-gender marriage. It was a 4-\nto-3 vote. Three liberal justices disagreed with the four liberal \njustices in Massachusetts.\n  They surely know, these friends of ours on the other side who are \nsuddenly finding the importance of States rights, they surely know that \nby opposing a constitutional amendment to protect marriage, judges will \ncontinue imposing same-gender marriage over the will of the American \npeople or over the will of the people in the States.\n  Their constituents deserve better than these misleading arguments. \nThey know that.\n  We did not choose the schedule for this issue. It was chosen for us. \nAnd we do act reluctantly.\n  Let me pose a question. If this is such a political issue, why did \nPresident Bush and Vice President Cheney indicate on the campaign trail \nin 2000 that it was premature to pursue an amendment? They both did, by \nthe way. The American people were as opposed to amending traditional \nmarriage then as they are now. The reason for this change in strategy \nis quite simple. In the year 2000, an amendment was premature. It is no \nlonger.\n\n  In 1996, not one State required same-gender marriages--not one. Now, \nhowever, Massachusetts has. Massachusetts has, I have to say, because \nsame-gender marriage is the law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, \ndetermined by four activist, liberal justices.\n  Today, 46 States, for the first time in history, have same-gender \nmarried couples living in them. That was not the case in the year 2000. \nAnd the argument that it was premature to call for a constitutional \namendment was a good argument at that time, but not today, with 46 \nStates with same-gender married couples living in them, and one State \nimposing its will through judicial legislation, if you will, on all 50 \nStates.\n  Eleven States are having not only their traditional marriage laws but \neven a State amendment, in the case of Nebraska, targeted by committed \ninterest groups. In Washington State, a couple married in Oregon is \nseeking recognition of their marriage. In New York, Attorney General \nEliot Spitzer has amazingly concluded that even though New York law \nexplicitly limits marriage to between a man and a woman, he--I guess \nthe ``god almighty'' Attorney General of New York, Eliot Spitzer--will \nrecognize same-gender marriages performed out of State.\n  He may be right because under the full faith and credit clause, that \nis what is going to be imposed on all States because of four avant-\ngarde liberal justices in Massachusetts.\n  The list of legal challenges goes on. In the year 2000, when \nPresident Bush and Vice President Cheney urged patience on this issue, \ntraditional marriage was secure. The States could handle this issue on \ntheir own. Today, they no longer can, all because of four activist, \nliberal justices in Massachusetts versus three liberal justices in \nMassachusetts, in a 4-to-3 verdict.\n  Courts are poised to remove this issue from them, destroying the \ndemocratic principle of self-governance that some of these folks on the \nother side are arguing should never be done. Why, the States ought to \nhave the right to determine these things for themselves.\n  Well, let me go over that one more time.\n  Courts are poised to remove this issue from the States, destroying \nthe democratic principle of self-government that our Constitution was \nestablished to guarantee.\n  Gov. Mitt Romney, in his testimony before our committee last month, \ngot the point and demonstrated the impact of his State court's decision \nto sanction same-gender marriage. I quote him:\n\n       The effect of one state recognizing same-gender marriage \n     will not be confined to Massachusetts alone. Our state's \n     borders are porous. Citizens of our state will travel and may \n     face sickness and injury in other states. In those cases, \n     their spousal relationship may not be recognized, and it \n     would be likely that litigation would result. Massachusetts \n     residents will move to other states, and thus issues related \n     to property rights, employer benefits, inheritance, and many \n     others will arise. It is not possible for the issue to remain \n     solely a Massachusetts issue; it must now be confronted on a \n     national basis.\n\n  We need an amendment that restores and protects our societal \ndefinition of marriage, blocks judges from changing that definition, \nand then, consistent with the principles of federalism, leaves other \npolicy issues regarding marriage to State legislatures. That is how the \nStates can control this. That is the right way to have the people in \ncharge rather than four liberal justices imposing this on all of \nAmerica.\n  Like I say, I think gay people have a right to their lifestyle, \ncertainly in the privacy of their home. But they do not have the right \nto impose that lifestyle or to impose their views on everybody in \nAmerica by changing the definition of marriage. They should not have \nthat right.\n  The real threat to the States is not the constitutional amendment \nprocess, in which the States participate, but activist judges who \ndisregard the law and redefine marriage in order to impose their will \non the States and on the whole Nation.\n  Governor Romney's diagnosis is correct. At this point, a commitment \nto States rights is a recipe for depriving States of any authority over \nthe matter.\n  And so our Republican leadership did what leaders do, they adjusted \ntheir direction. Because the situation today is vastly different than \nwhat we faced in 2000, we require a different solution.\n  Our goals are not what Mrs. Boxer, the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia, has described. Nobody here is concerned about whether same-\ngender couples should care about each other. Nobody here denies them \nthat right. Nobody here is even concerned about that. And nobody is \nconcerned about whether they are moving in down the street.\n  What we are concerned about is the likelihood that the courts are \ngoing to amend the laws in every State in the land by judicial fiat. We \nare concerned that a small interest group is lobbying the courts to do \nits dirty work, hoping that judicial fiat will accomplish what it \ncannot achieve in open political debate.\n  In not one State has the legislature amended its laws to allow for \nsame-gender marriage--not one. We are fooling ourselves if we think \nthat the courts care. They have already begun their work to undermine \ntraditional marriage. And rest assured, more is on the way. If the \nStates think they have sufficiently protected their traditional \ncommitments to marriage, they had better think twice.\n\n[[Page S7993]]\n\n  What we are witnessing is an unprecedented usurpation of the people's \nwill. But those who support this judicial disregard for popular \nauthority do not bravely defend this irresponsible activism. Instead, \nthey take the easy way out. It should be left to the States, they say. \nEasier said than done. The fact is, these decisions are already being \nremoved from the people by judicial fiat, by four justices in \nMassachusetts, of all places. The laws of this country, the laws of \nevery State in the Nation, will be amended to allow for same-sex \nmarriage absent our action. The two distinguished Senators from \nCalifornia, and the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold, \nand many others, do not address this likelihood in the least--not in \nthe slightest.\n  As Senator Daschle is aware, the people of South Dakota are adamantly \nopposed to judicial amendment of their traditional marriage laws, and I \nsuppose in most other States as well--in fact, every other State. For \nthat reason, he has said he opposes same-gender marriage. But what \nhappens when a gay couple moves from Massachusetts to South Dakota and \nseeks to have its union recognized? On this point, which is really the \nonly question in this debate, he and his allies fall silent. What \nhappens? Under the full faith and credit clause, that marriage is going \nto have to be recognized.\n\n  Unfortunately, the will of those citizens will not matter in the \nleast to a judiciary bent on securing same-gender marriage throughout \nthe land. We have demonstrated through our discussion of the Lawrence \ncase, the Romer case, and the Defense of Marriage Act, that the courts \nare ready to act. It is telling that in a constitutional debate we have \nnot heard one peep from the opposition about these relevant legal \nprecedents.\n  I can understand how these discussions might make the opposition \nuncomfortable. Their lesson is clear. Same-gender marriage will replace \ntraditional marriage unless we act. It is that simple.\n  And you folks out there watching this, you better tell your Senators \nthey better act on this or traditional marriage is going to bite the \ndust because of four activist, liberal justices from Massachusetts who \nhad one more vote than the three who voted against them.\n  When we see cracks in a dam, we take steps to repair those cracks. We \ndo not wait until the dam breaks and we have to build a new one. Well, \nthe only way to repair the current legal situation on marriage is to \npass a constitutional amendment. I wish it was not, but it is.\n\n  My colleagues are not addressing the legal concerns. Instead of \narguing about the Constitution, some of them have taken cheap shots and \ncontend that we are engaging in discrimination. Come on. We are in the \n21st century. I don't know of anybody in this body who engages in \ndiscrimination. Certainly I don't.\n  Does this mean more than three-fourths of the States are bigoted? \nThat is how many enacted the Defense of Marriage Act to preserve \ntraditional marriage. Does this mean the vast majority of the American \npeople are bigoted? Or that Senators John Kerry and John Edwards are? \nOf course not. What about Rev. Walter Fauntroy, former Member of \nCongress, the African-American pastor of Washington's New Bethel \nBaptist Church, and Bishop Wilton Gregory, the African- American \npresident of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops? The \nanswer to all of these is no. Similarly, I do not think it is proper to \nconclude that the more than 60 percent of Senator Boxer and Feinstein's \nown constituents who voted for traditional marriage are bigots either. \nThey are not.\n  Those making these slanderous accusations are well aware that many of \nthose in favor of an amendment have frequently pursued legislation to \nprotect the rights of gay citizens. Our attempts to protect traditional \nmarriage laws have nothing to do with the private choices of gay and \nlesbian citizens; they have everything to do with the right of the \nAmerican people to protect traditional marriage, which, in addition to \nits private elements, is a public institution with clear public \npurposes--namely, the rearing of future citizens. Our efforts simply \nseek to maintain the right of the American people to decide this issue \nfor themselves through their elected representatives, which will be \ntaken away from them if we allow the Supreme Court of Massachusetts to \ndictate this rule of law to every State in the Union.\n  My colleagues making these arguments might want to at least look at \narticle V of the Constitution. An amendment only becomes law once \nthree-quarters of the States agree to it. In short, the States are the \nintegral part of the amendment process. I have stopped trying to make \nsense of some of these so-called arguments of those opposed to \nprotecting traditional marriage, but this one, that an amendment that \nrequires the consent of the States would undercut the rights of the \nStates, is particularly galling.\n  There is no going back now. This issue will be decided one way or \nanother. Either the American people will amend the Constitution to \nprotect traditional marriage or the courts will ignore the expressed \ncommitments of citizens in every State and amend the Constitution to \nrequire same-gender marriage. The choice is ours.\n  I simply don't understand how the opposition can seriously claim that \nthis issue does not merit our attention. I suggest it is one of the \nmost important issues to ever come before either body of Congress. \nWithout self-government, all of our other rights are for naught. That \nis exactly what is at stake. We are expanding rights through this \namendment. We are further securing the rights of democratic communities \nto decide this most important of social policies on their own, rather \nthan having them stripped from them by unaccountable and \nunrepresentative judges.\n  Let me make this last point absolutely clear: We are not restricting \nrights with this amendment. We are expanding the rights of democratic \ncommunities to decide issues for themselves.\n  Before I close, I would like to go through a few of these charts \nbecause I believe they make the case very well. This first chart says, \n``Not one legislature has voted to recognize same-sex unions.'' Think \nabout it. In 1996, not one had voted to recognize same-sex unions, not \none. All of the blue stands for the zero. But in 2004, we now have 46 \nStates with same-sex married couples from Massachusetts and some of \nthese other rogue jurisdictions. As you can see, there are very few \nStates--only four--that do not have it: Maine, West Virginia, \nLouisiana, and Montana. Every other State has same-gender marriages \nwithin those States that will have to be recognized under the full \nfaith and credit clause against the wishes of those particular States.\n  Look at this next chart: ``States that define marriage as a union \nbetween a man and a woman.'' The red States or orange States are States \nthat define marriage as the union between a man and a woman. The only \nones that do not are Oregon, New Mexico, Wisconsin, New Jersey, \nConnecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and New York. They are the \nonly States that have not defined marriage as only between a man and a \nwoman. All other States have done that, including Alaska and Hawaii, \nthe two that are out in the ocean there. That is a very telling chart. \nWe have these people saying: We are taking the rights away from the \npeople to decide these things. No. We are taking the rights away from \nthe courts to tell everybody in America what they should do, and all \nthese States that have enacted traditional marriage laws, all of these \nStates are going to be overruled by four liberal, activist, radical \njustices on the Massachusetts Supreme Court.\n  Look at what Kevin Cathcart of Lambda Legal, one of the leading gay \nrights organizations, said:\n\n       We won't stop until we have [same-sex] marriage nationwide.\n\n  Justice Scalia was very prescient when he said:\n\n       The Lawrence decision leaves on pretty shaky grounds State \n     laws limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples.\n\n  Evan Wolfson, director of Freedom to Marry, another gay rights \norganization, said:\n\n       But when Scalia is right, he's right. We stand today on the \n     threshold of winning the freedom to marry. This is a big \n     issue.\n\n  Professor Laurence Tribe, highly respected liberal spokesperson for \nthe liberal cause, constitutional law professor at Harvard Law School, \na person I personally enjoy listening to, very\n\n[[Page S7994]]\n\nbright, very fine teacher, he had this to say:\n\n       You'd have to be tone deaf not to get the message from \n     Lawrence that anything that invites people to give same-sex \n     couples less than full respect is constitutionally suspect.\n\n  Now, one last one here. This last one shows States with pending court \ncases involving same-sex marriage. The ones that are in the rust color, \nyou will notice, are States with pending court cases involving same-sex \nmarriage. These are the States where already we have pending cases: \nWashington, Oregon, California, New Mexico, Wisconsin, Indiana, \nFlorida, North Carolina, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Maryland, \nDelaware, New Jersey, New York, Vermont, and Massachusetts. Those are \nStates where we already have pending cases forcing this on those \nStates. I suppose that most all the others will, too, but they may not \nhave to go into all the other States because any one of those States \ncould also impose this, as Massachusetts has done as well.\n  We are talking about a very important issue, and that is that gays \nshould have a right to their own way of living. I would certainly stand \nup to try and do what is right and fair for gay people in our society. \nI have. I have done it and taken a lot of criticism for having done so. \nI have been right to do so. But they should not have a right to \nredefine traditional marriage through four activist, liberal justices \nin the State of Massachusetts imposing their will on all of America \nbecause of the full faith and credit clause.\n  Even though 40 States have adopted the Defense of Marriage Act, most \nconstitutional scholars agree that the Defense of Marriage Act will be \nruled by these cases unconstitutional, and thus every State in the \nUnion, against the will of the people, will have to recognize gay \nmarriage, or will have their concepts of traditional marriage, which \nhave been uniform throughout the country just blasted into \nsmithereens--all, again, because of a liberal court in Massachusetts.\n\n  I hate to say this, but it is true. Our colleagues on the other side \nwant liberal judges. The reason is because liberal judges can enact \nlegislation from the bench. You will notice the word ``legislation'' \nshould never be part of the judging process. But they can and will \nenact legislation, as these Massachusetts judges have done, which these \nliberals could never get through the elected representatives of the \npeople in a million years. They don't want the people to decide this. \nThey want the courts to decide it. That is what they say when they say \nthey believe in States rights--that Massachusetts should determine for \nall of America how marriage should be defined.\n  As you can see, we are in a plethora of lawsuits. It is not going to \nstop until we take the bull by the horns and pass a constitutional \namendment. I think most people would acknowledge that this amendment \ndoes not have the votes at this point; it doesn't have 67 votes. But \nthis debate is very important. I don't know of a more important debate \nin our country's history. If we undermine traditional marriage in our \nsociety, I think we are going to regret it.\n  I don't think judges should determine the sociology of our society. I \ndon't think they should be legislating from the bench. I don't think \njudges should be making these decisions unilaterally, and a 4-to-3 \ndecision was made in this particular case. I think the people ought to \nmake this decision. We know that 40 States have already adopted the \nDefense of Marriage Act, which is likely to be struck down. I believe \nthe other 10 States will adopt it before it is all over. This was done \nby four activist judges in Massachusetts versus three others who are \nalso liberals, but they would not go as far as to strike down \ntraditional marriage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I have listened with great interest to \nthe debate over the last several days. I believe there are many sincere \npositions being advocated on this floor on really all sides of this \nissue, because there are many sides. This is an incredibly important \nand quite solemn responsibility that we have before us.\n  S.J. Res. 40, this joint resolution, proposes an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States relating to marriage. So maybe even \nmore than the usual debate, this calls for each of us to be engaged, to \nbe accurate, and to be thoughtful about the positions we take with \nrespect to this proposed amendment.\n  Now, a number of my colleagues have come to the floor to speak about \nthe solemn responsibility that we hold in our hands with respect to \namending our Constitution. I am in agreement that the Constitution is a \nliving and working, extraordinary human accomplishment that protects \nour citizens, grants us the rights that make us free, and we in this \nbody took an oath; we swore to defend and protect the Constitution of \nthe United States.\n  So to consider altering this document, one of the greatest documents \nin the history of humanity, is a responsibility no Member can or should \nenter into lightly, for what we do here will not only affect our fellow \ncitizens in the year 2004, but it will affect every generation of \nAmericans to come.\n  As Henry Clay once observed:\n\n       The Constitution of the United States was made not merely \n     for the generation that then existed, but for posterity--\n     unlimited, undefined, endless, perpetual posterity.\n\n  So we do owe an obligation to those we represent today and to future \ngenerations as we embark upon this very solemn undertaking. We should \nnot amend the Constitution to decide any issue that can and will be \nresolved by less drastic means. We should not amend the Constitution to \nfederalize an issue that has been the province of the States since our \nfounding--in fact, as Senator Kennedy reminded us, even before our \nfounding as a nation.\n  I believe marriage is not just a bond but a sacred bond between a man \nand a woman. I have had occasion in my life to defend marriage, to \nstand up for marriage, to believe in the hard work and challenge of \nmarriage. So I take umbrage at anyone who might suggest that those of \nus who worry about amending the Constitution are less committed to the \nsanctity of marriage, or to the fundamental bedrock principle that \nexists between a man and a woman, going back into the midst of history \nas one of the foundational institutions of history and humanity and \ncivilization, and that its primary, principal role during those \nmillennia has been the raising and socializing of children for the \nsociety into which they become adults.\n  Now, if we were really concerned about marriage and the fact that so \nmany marriages today end in divorce, and so many children are then put \ninto the incredibly difficult position of having to live with the \nconsequences of divorce, perhaps 20, 30 years ago we should have been \ndebating an amendment to the Federal Constitution to make divorce \nreally, really hard, to take it out of the States' hands and say that \nwe will not liberalize divorce, we will not move toward no-fault \ndivorce, and we will make it as difficult as possible because we fear \nthe consequences of liberalizing divorce laws.\n  If one looks at the consequences of the numbers of divorces, the \nbreakup of the traditional family, you could make an argument for that. \nIf we were concerned about marriage, why were we not concerned about \nmarriage when marriage was under pressure over the last decades because \nof changing roles, because of changing decisions, because of the laws \nin the States that were making it easier for people--husbands, wives, \nmothers, and fathers--to get divorced?\n  We searched, and I don't see anyone in the history of the Senate or \nthe House who put forward an amendment to try to stop the increasing \nnumber of divorces in order to stem the problem and the difficulties \nthat clearly have been visited upon adults certainly but principally \nchildren because of the ease of divorce in this society over the last \ndecade. We didn't do that.\n  We could stand on this floor for hours talking about the importance \nof marriage, the significance of the role of marriage in not only \nbringing children into the world but enabling them to be successful \ncitizens in the world. How many of us have struggled for years to deal \nwith the consequences of illegitimacy, of out-of-wedlock births, of \ndivorce, of the kinds of anomie and disassociation that too many \nchildren experienced because of that.\n\n[[Page S7995]]\n\n  I think that if we were really concerned about marriage and that we \nbelieved it had a role in the Federal Constitution, we have been \nmissing in action. We should have been in this Chamber trying to amend \nour Constitution to take away at the very first blush the idea of no-\nfault divorce, try to get in there and tell the States what they should \nand should not do with respect to marriage and divorce, maybe try to \nwrite an amendment to the Constitution about custody matters. Maybe we \nshould have it be a presumption in our Federal marriage law that joint \ncustody is the rule. Maybe we ought to just substitute ourselves for \nStates, for judges, for individuals who are making these decisions \nevery single day throughout our Nation.\n  We did not do that, did we? Can any of us stand here and feel good \nabout all of the social consequences, the economic consequences? We \nknow divorce leads to a lowered standard of living for women and \nchildren. Then, of course, if we were to deal with some of the \nconsequences of out-of-wedlock births, the lack of marriage, we could \nhave addressed that in a constitutional amendment. Perhaps we should \nhave amended the Constitution to mandate marriage.\n  Is it really marriage we are protecting? I believe marriage should be \nprotected. I believe marriage is essential, but I do not, for the life \nof me, understand how amending the Constitution of the United States \nwith respect to same-gender marriages really gets at the root of the \nproblem of marriage in America. It is like my late father used to say: \nIt is like closing the barn door after the horse has left.\n  We hear all of these speeches and see these charts about the impact \non marriage. We are living in a society where people have engaged in \ndivorce at a rapid, accelerated rate. We all know it is something that \nhas led to the consequences with respect to the economy, to society, to \npsychology, and emotion that so often mark a young child's path to \nadulthood.\n  So what are we doing here? Some say that even though marriage has \nbeen under pressure--which, indeed, it has--and has suffered because of \nchanging attitudes toward marriage now for quite some years, even \nthough most States are moving as rapidly as possible to prohibit same-\ngender marriages, we have to step in with a Federal constitutional \namendment.\n  The States, which have always defined and enforced the laws of \nmarriage, are taking action. Thirty-eight States--maybe it is up to 40 \nnow--already have laws banning same-sex marriage. Voters in at least \neight States are considering amendments to their constitutions \nreserving marriage to unions between a man and a woman. But the \nsponsors argue that we have to act with a Federal constitutional \namendment because the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution \nwill eventually force States, if there are any left, that do not wish \nto recognize same-sex marriages to do so.\n  That is not the way I read the case law. With all due respect, the \nway I read the case law is that the full faith and credit clause has \nnever been interpreted to mean that every State must recognize every \nmarriage performed in every other State. We had States that allowed \nyoung people to marry when they were 14, and then States that allowed \nyoung people to marry when they were 16 or 18. The full faith and \ncredit clause did not require that any other State recognize the \nvalidity of a marriage of a person below the age of marital consent \naccording to their own laws.\n\n  Every State reserves the right to refuse to recognize a marriage \nperformed in another State if that marriage would violate the State's \npublic policy. Indeed, the Supreme Court has long held that no State \ncan be forced to recognize any marriage. That is what the case law has \nheld. But just to make sure there were no loopholes in that case law, \nthe Congress passed and the President signed the Defense of Marriage \nAct, known as DOMA.\n  The Defense of Marriage Act has not even been challenged at the \nFederal level, and because the Supreme Court has historically held that \nStates do not have to recognize laws of other States that offend their \npublic policy, it is assumed that any challenge would be futile.\n  So what is it we are really focused on and concerned about here?\n  If we look at what has happened in the last several months--and there \nare others in this body who are more able to discuss this than I \nbecause it affects the laws of their States--as Senator Kennedy said, \nin Massachusetts, a court decision will be challenged by a referendum. \nIn California, San Francisco's action permitting the licensing of same-\nsex marriages was stopped by the California State courts. The DOMA law \nthat was enacted already protects States from having to recognize same-\nsex marriage licenses issued in other States.\n  So I worry that, despite what I do believe is the sincere concern on \nthe part of many of the advocates of this amendment, they have rushed \nto judgment without adequate consideration of the laws, the case laws, \nthe actions of the States, and that their very earnest, impassioned \narguments about marriage have certainly overlooked the problems that \nmarriage has encountered in its present traditional state within the \nlast several decades in our country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 more \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, we all know this amendment is not likely \nto pass at this time because concern for our Constitution and the \nsolemn responsibility that falls to us with respect to amending it is a \nbipartisan concern. There are many on the other side who will not \ntamper with the Constitution to deal with the heated politics of the \nmoment. Yet we are taking precious time away from other matters about \nwhich I worry, about which I am concerned, most profoundly the \nchallenges we confront from our adversaries in al-Qaida and elsewhere \nwho we know are plotting and planning against us.\n  I hope that once we hold the vote tomorrow--and the States continue \nto do what the States are doing--that we will get back to the business \nof both protecting and serving the American people and solving the \nproblems they confront each and every day. Maybe we can come to some \nagreement that the Founders had it right and that the concerns that \nhave been expressed about marriage will be taken care of as they \ntraditionally have in the States which have held the responsibility \nsince before our founding as a nation.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York yields the floor. \nThe Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from \nOklahoma, the chairman of our Budget Committee and somebody I would \nlike to recognize in a public way for all of the hard work he has \nprovided for us in the Senate, particularly his hard work on the budget \nas the chairman of the Budget Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized for 15 \nminutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank my colleague from Colorado for yielding. I \ncompliment Senator Allard for his work on this amendment and on this \nissue. It is a very important issue.\n  I also compliment Senator Hatch for the very fine statement he made \nearlier, as well as Senators Santorum, Sessions, and Cornyn. Several of \nour colleagues have made very eloquent remarks about this amendment and \nabout the fact that marriage is under attack. I want to come at it from \na little different perspective.\n  I was the principal sponsor of the Defense of Marriage Act, which \npassed and was signed into law by President Clinton in 1996. I heard my \nvery good friend from Minnesota, Senator Dayton, mention that this is \nabout politics, and I wanted to inform him as the sponsor of DOMA, the \nDefense of Marriage Act, it was not about politics in 1996, it was \nbecause in 1996 the Hawaiian Supreme Court was getting ready to \nlegalize same-sex marriage, and under the general understanding of full \nfaith and credit, if they recognized it, there would be a lot of same-\nsex couples running to Hawaii to be married and they would return to \nother States and those States would be required to recognize it.\n  We thought that was a serious mistake. We did not want that mixed \ncourt\n\n[[Page S7996]]\n\ndecision in Hawaii to become the law of the land. So we passed the \nDefense of Marriage Act. It passed by a vote of 85 to 14.\n  I notice several of the people who are arguing against a \nconstitutional amendment are arguing for States rights. Several of the \npeople who have argued against this amendment also debated and voted \nagainst the Defense of Marriage Act, which was basically a States \nrights approach to the solution.\n  Now, let us frame this as an issue. Marriage is under attack. It is \nunder attack in several respects. It is under attack by a liberal court \nin Massachusetts which wants to redefine marriage, including same-sex \ncouples. They were not elected. It is under attack by mayors in some \ncities: the mayor of San Francisco, and the mayor of New Paltz, NY.\n  They wanted to legalize or grant licenses to same-sex couples. It \nhappened to be against the law in the State of California. It is very \ninteresting that a newly elected mayor would decide to defy State law, \nactually break State law, but he was doing it and gained great \nnotoriety. He was on TV most every day. Then a mayor in New Paltz, NY, \nwanted to do the same thing. I am not sure what the State law in New \nYork is. But marriage is under attack as defined by this Congress. The \nDefense of Marriage Act says marriage is between a man and a woman, and \nyet we had either an unelected court or mayors saying, no, they know \nbetter.\n  So if it is under attack, how is it protected? Is it protected better \nby a statute or by a constitutional amendment? That is a legitimate \ndebate, and I respect people who say we have the Defense of Marriage \nAct, but many of the people who are making that claim voted against the \nDefense of Marriage Act, so I question whether they really believe in \nStates rights or they are using it at this particular point. But it is \nunder attack.\n\n  What has happened differently between now and when the Defense of \nMarriage Act passed in 1996, one decision was the Lawrence decision. \nEvery once in a while I will sit in on a Supreme Court debate. I sat in \njust a month ago on the question on the Pledge of Allegiance, whether \nwe could actually have in the Pledge of Allegiance ``one Nation under \nGod.'' In that case, the Ninth Circuit Court, which makes a lot of very \nabsurd rulings, said we should not have ``one nation under God.'' \nThankfully, the Supreme Court rejected that argument. I enjoyed \nlistening to that debate.\n  I wish I had attended the Lawrence v. Texas debate because I am \nabsolutely astounded at their conclusion. Senator Santorum deserves \ngreat credit because he took a lot of flak, but he denounced that \ndecision. He denounced it strongly, and he was right. I did not pay \nenough attention to the Lawrence decision, nor to the Texas statute, \nwhich probably should have been overturned or should have been repealed \nby the Texas legislature. Possibly that is a debate for another day. \nThey went a lot further than just dealing with the Texas statute.\n  In the Lawrence case, the Supreme Court found:\n\n       . . . a State's governing majority has traditionally viewed \n     a particular practice as immoral is not sufficient reason for \n     upholding a law prohibiting the practice . . .\n\n  Sorry about that, States, sorry if you had morality as part of the \nreason you are legislating, but the Supreme Court thinks that may not \nbe enough.\n  That is a very troubling case. I have heard a lot of constitutional \nscholars and others say because of the Lawrence case the Defense of \nMarriage Act would probably be determined unconstitutional. I hope they \nare wrong.\n  The Defense of Marriage Act passed with 85 votes. I hope the Supreme \nCourt will pay attention to the fact that it passed with 85 votes. That \nwas not 51 to 49. So if they are going to overturn the Congress--\nincidentally, it passed in the House by an overwhelming margin, even \ngreater than that, I believe. So I hope it will not be determined \nunconstitutional. But the Lawrence case does mean marriage is under \nattack.\n  When there is a mayor of San Francisco who decides in spite of State \nlaw that he is going to start granting marriage licenses or a mayor in \nNew York or by a 4-to-3 decision in the State of Massachusetts--all of \nthose things have happened since the Defense of Marriage Act passed. So \nit really boils down to which body, which element of our democracy is \ngoing to be making this decision? If we are going to redefine marriage \nand say that it is legal between same-sex couples, should that not be \ndecided by State legislatures and/or elected Federal officials? It \ncertainly should not be decided by an unelected 4-to-3 decision in one \nliberal court in the country. So to stop that 4-to-3 decision, \nparticularly given the fact that there is a Supreme Court decision \nwhich seems to give credibility to that decision, maybe a \nconstitutional amendment is in order. My guess is it probably will not \npass until they do overturn the Defense of Marriage Act, and then I \nbelieve there really will be a revolt around the country. Then it might \nget the necessary two-thirds vote in both Houses of Congress and be \nratified by three-fourths of the States.\n\n  Our forefathers showed great wisdom in making it very difficult to \namend the Constitution. It has only been amended 27 times--only 17 if \nwe take out the Bill of Rights--in the last 228 years. That is pretty \nremarkable. They made it very difficult to amend the Constitution.\n  We are dealing with something very fundamental when we are talking \nabout how marriage is defined. Marriage is a very esteemed union \nbetween a man and a woman, a contract with Government recognition, with \nbenefits, a sacred union, a sacrament in some religions, a very special \nrelationship, not to be changed or altered, frankly, by a 4-to-3 \ndecision, by an unelected court, trying to redefine something so \nimportant. It should be decided by elected officials.\n  So we have a process. We have the statute process, which we have \ndone, and we have a constitutional process which may be necessary in \nlight of the Lawrence decision and in light of the State of \nMassachusetts, in light of the mayor of San Francisco, in light of \nmayors in other places around the country who wish to make such a \nfundamental change and do it without authority, without election, \nwithout backing.\n  In the State of Hawaii, when the State supreme court there tried to \nredefine marriage, there was an uproar and basically they passed a \nconstitutional amendment that allowed the legislature to define \nmarriage. The legislature defined marriage as a union between a man and \na woman. The legislature stopped it.\n  Hopefully maybe legislative action would be enough, but my concern is \nthat in spite of the fact that 38 States have passed identical \nlegislation to DOMA, in spite of the fact that 4 additional States have \npassed something very close to it, 42 out of 50 States passing \nlegislation basically defining marriage as between a man and a woman, \nis that there still might be a 4-to-3 decision that becomes the law of \nthe land because of what I believe is an absurd decision based on the \nLawrence decision. I hope that is incorrect, but I do want to fight to \ndefend marriage as between a man and a woman. That can be done \nconstitutionally. It can be done statutorily. I do think that people, \nthrough their elected officials, should be making this decision instead \nof an unelected 4-to-3 decision in a court. This is vitally important.\n  So, again, I compliment my colleague, Senator Allard, for his \nleadership on this issue. I hope people will take this very seriously. \nThe benefits of marriage are great. Undermining marriage has great \nnegative consequences for our country, and I hope our colleagues will \nweigh those decisions very closely and at least support the motion to \nproceed. It is a legitimate debate as to whether the amendment should \nbe one sentence or should it be two sentences, should it be rewritten \nor tweaked one way or another. We will not know unless we pass the \nmotion to proceed. So I urge our colleagues to support the motion to \nproceed in tomorrow's vote.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for a \nvery fine statement. He brings a special perspective to this debate \nbecause he was the initial sponsor of the Defense of Marriage Act.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. ALLARD. I yield to the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to follow the \nSenator from Kansas for a period of 12 minutes.\n\n[[Page S7997]]\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Is there an objection to the unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I have another engagement I am supposed \nto be at now.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I do not believe it is going to interfere with you. You \nare next, then I think Senator Brownback.\n  Mr. McCAIN. You are up. Then I asked unanimous consent to follow the \nSenator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ALLARD. You are next.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I find it sad and unfortunate that the \nSenate is spending crucial time on this divisive issue, driven so \nobviously by partisan politics rather than sound public policy. We know \nthis amendment has no chance of passage, so why are we here? Just a \nweek after Secretary Ridge detailed the real threats that the Nation \nfaces right here at home, why are we instead debating the vague and \nquestionable dangers to the institution of marriage. We should be \nworking to fund homeland security, but that bill languishes while we \nlaunch into a cultural war.\n  As of today, the Senate has passed only 1 of the necessary 13 \nappropriations bills for fiscal year 2005. We need to fund veterans \nhealth care, educational programs, worker protection, job training, \nHead Start, environmental preservation, crop insurance, and food \nsafety. We need to reauthorize our Nation's welfare programs. Our \nhighways crumble while the Transportation bill is stalled and we take \nno action.\n  These are the priorities of the American people. But instead of \nfacing these most basic responsibilities, we are here today to make \njudgment calls about people's personal lifestyles. I must ask, where \nare the priorities of the majority leadership? How is it that we have \nto come to use the Senate floor as a warmup for political conventions, \nbowing to extreme religious agendas rather than the agenda of the \nAmerican people? How did this happen?\n  I am afraid the answer can be summed up very easily. We are here \nbecause of election year posturing.\n  I find it ironic that some in this Chamber want to amend our Nation's \nmost sacred and historic document because of some unfounded and \nirrational fear. It is ironic because these are the same people who \nhave argued that we should not trample on States rights. Yet they think \nour States are not capable of deciding how marriage should be defined. \nI believe our States are not only capable but deserving to define \nmarriage in the way they see fit. Every State will bring its own \napproach, and I am proud the way my State led the Nation in addressing \nthis issue more than 4 years ago.\n\n  The Vermont Legislature, a part-time body made up of farmers and \nteachers, passed the civil unions legislation. They gave gay and \nlesbian couples all the same legal rights extended to married couples, \nand the legislature did so in a bipartisan fashion, amid rancorous \nprotests by some who proclaimed Vermont's lawmakers will suffer dire \nconsequences as a result of this decision.\n  I can tell you today that all of these fears have been unfounded, and \nmy home State is better off for the experience. Having witnessed \nVermont's approach, I beg to differ with anyone in this body who argues \nthat States are not able to decide this issue for themselves. Here in \nthe Senate we should be spending our time debating legislation that is \ninclusive, not exclusive. This body did so when it recently passed a \nhate crimes bill to extend the definition of hate crimes to those who \nare targeted solely on sexual orientation, gender, or disability.\n  We should be focusing our energies on passing bills such as the \nEmployment Nondiscrimination Act and the Domestic Partner Health \nBenefits Equity Act. I am proud to support these bills, and I am even \nmore proud because they continue in the great American tradition of \ninclusiveness and tolerance and acceptance.\n  I will vote against this constitutional amendment, and I urge the \nmajority leadership to take up, rather than push aside, the critical \npending legislation that so desperately needs and calls for our \nattention.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from \nKansas. I compliment him in a public way for his leadership on this \nvery important issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized for 15 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank the Senator from Colorado for his leadership \nin putting this issue before the U.S. public and before the world. This \nis something we need to debate.\n  I want to specifically address the argument that is being put forward \nso often from the other side that we do not need to do this now; there \nis no fire burning; there is no particular issue that is going on here; \nthe States can easily handle this; just let them handle it and take \ncare of it; we do not need to do this until the Supreme Court takes it \nup.\n  I want to talk about, Why do we need to take this up now? \nFortunately, we have a case study. People who went to business school, \nwent to law school, learn through case studies. You study a case, study \nwhat took place, and you try to analyze what happened there to figure \nout what could have been done better, what should have been done, what \nwas done, and what was its impact.\n  We have an excellent case study in the Netherlands on what is taking \nplace when this sort of debate occurs. The reason it is important to \nengage this debate now and not wait until after the Supreme Court might \nrule, or after this goes through a number of States, is because of what \nthey went through in the Netherlands.\n  I want to talk about one chart, the out-of-wedlock birth rates in the \nNetherlands, 1970-2003.\n  You can see it does not have a favorable trendline. In 1970, it is \ndown around 2 percent. Indeed, the Netherlands was noted for a long \nperiod of time for having a very low out-of-wedlock birth rate, and \namong European countries they were highly regarded for that. Even \nthough it was an open society, it had a very low out-of-wedlock birth \nrate. People had children in wedlock.\n  Then you can see in 1980 this thing starts rocketing and really \ntaking off. What took place in the Netherlands--and I am going to have \nquotes from some Dutch scholars that just recently came out. We have \nthe material from Stanley Kurtz that a number of people talked about. \nBut what happened there was this ongoing debate for a period of about \n10 years before same-sex marriage passed in the Netherlands, this \npublic debate about, you know, we can have different sorts of family \narrangements, we can have registered partnerships. They had that before \nsame-sex marriage passed.\n  We had symbolic marriage registers for same-sex couples. We had the \nfirst supreme court case loss, first court case loss--and what we had \nwas just this debate and discussion with the society, the culture, over \na period of years saying we can separate this issue of raising children \nand the issue of marriage. We can have marriages just be an expression \nof care and concern and love for each other without really considering \nor thinking about what it is, the union of man and woman and raising \nchildren together.\n  We now have social science data. We have discussed a lot on this \nfloor that the best place to raise a child is in a family with a man \nand woman, a husband and wife, bonded together for life in a low-\nconflict marriage. We know that is the ideal place. We have discussed \nthat. The social science data is clear on it.\n  Yet what you saw take place here as you engage this debate and \nsociety started talking to itself, reforms and court orders, we saw \nsociety saying it is not that critical how marriage is organized in \nlooking at children. It is more about the adults than about the \nchildren. Let us open this institution.\n  What took place was you had this huge growth to where it is up to 30 \npercent of children born out of wedlock in the Netherlands in 2003 from \nthe 1980 total here at 5 percent over that period of time.\n  What do scholars say about this? Dutch scholars are actually saying \nwe\n\n[[Page S7998]]\n\nhave to figure some way to try to reinstitute the notion and the nature \nof traditional marriage. The marriage between a man and woman, raising \nchildren in this type of household, is the best place for us to do \nthat.\n  In recent years, they note, there is statistical evidence of Dutch \nmarital decline, including ``a spectacular rise in the number of \nillegitimate births.'' By creating a social and legal separation \nbetween the ideas of marriage and parenting, these scholars warn, same-\nsex marriage may make young people in the Netherlands feel less \nobligated to marry before having children.\n  Again, this ongoing debate about marriage isn't about forming this \nbond and a family unit. It is how two people express love for one \nanother, and then that started permeating and getting into society.\n  One of the signatories, Dutch law professor M. Van Mourik, said that \n``the reputation of marriage as an institution--in Holland--is in \nserious decline.'' The decision to legalize gay marriage, said Mourik, \nshould certainly have never happened. ``In my view, that has been an \nimportant contributing factor to the decline in the reputation of \nmarriage.''\n  One of the letters' other signatories, Dr. Joost van Loon, believes \ngay marriage has contributed to a decline in the reputation of Dutch \nmarriage. It is ``difficult to imagine'' that the Dutch campaign for \ngay marriage did not have ``serious social consequences,'' said Van \nLoon, citing ``an intensive media campaign based on the claim that \nmarriage and parenthood are unrelated.''\n  My point in saying this and addressing the concerns from the other \nside that it is not particularly timely, we need to do work on other \nthings, is if we don't engage and discuss this and talk about the \nimportance of marriage and the natural union and raising children in \nthat setting, you will see society say, I guess it doesn't matter, \nthese things are separate. And you will see this taking place more \nwhere we have slowed down and stopped the rise in out-of-wedlock births \nin the United States. This isn't something that has been charting up \nfor a long term here, and that has been capped and started back down.\n  Now we are pushing in a welfare reform bill--a discussion about \nmarriage and the welfare reform bill--because we know it is the best \nplace to raise children. It will result in a healthier relationship for \na man and a woman on a long-term basis. People will live healthier, \nlonger, and happier.\n  We don't want this to happen in the United States. The case study is \nhere, and we look at the incredible social experiment--something that \nhas not been done in societies for 5,000 years. We are talking about \nputting that in society. We need to push back and say no, this is not \ngood for children. It is not good for families. It is not good for \nAmerica, nor the American culture.\n  I urge my colleagues when they say this isn't timely to look at what \nhas happened in the case study we have. If this isn't discussed at a \nvery early stage and people say, no, this is not the way we want to go, \nthen you will get this rise taking place and the situation none of us \nwant and that everybody agrees is not good for the children. I think \none has to ask oneself in this debate, where are we going to focus? Are \nwe going to focus on raising the next generation or are we going to \nfocus on other issues? I think clearly the right focus for legislators \nin looking to build a good, strong society in the future is to focus on \nthat next generation.\n  I thank my colleague from Colorado for leading this debate. I thank \nthe Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nArizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I may require 15 minutes. I ask unanimous \nconsent to extend from 12 to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, most Americans believe, as I do, that the \ninstitution of marriage should be reserved for the union of a man and a \nwoman. But only a very small majority, and perhaps not quite a \nmajority, support the idea--at this time--of amending the Constitution \nto prohibit the States from changing the legal definition of marriage \nto include any union other than that between a man and a woman. I know \nthat Americans who support a Federal marriage amendment feel very \nstrongly that same sex marriages judged lawful by the Supreme Court of \nthe Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and permitted, for a brief period, \nunlawfully, in certain other localities, threaten the institution of \nmarriage as a core value of our culture. I know also that many of the \nopponents of the amendment believe it is purposely divisive, \ndiscriminatory and intended to deny some Americans their right to the \npursuit of happiness. And I know that many, many of those Americans who \ndo not presently support the amendment, but oppose same-sex marriage do \nnot perceive it is urgently necessary to address this issue by means of \namending the most successful and enduring political compact in human \nhistory.\n  This close division of public opinion assures us one thing. A Federal \nmarriage amendment to the Constitution will not be adopted by Congress \nthis year, nor next year, nor anytime soon until a substantial majority \nof Americans are persuaded that such a consequential action is as \nvitally important and necessary as the proponents feel it is today. It \nis perfectly appropriate for Americans who do feel that strongly today \nto call the offices of their elected representatives and urge them to \nsupport the amendment. But their efforts would be better spent trying \nto convince a supermajority of the public to share their urgency \nbecause until they do there will not be a supermajority in Congress and \namong State legislatures willing to amend our Constitution.\n  By my count, there is not at this time even a small majority of \nsenators who would vote for Senator Allard's amendment, much less the \n67 votes required by the Constitution. That won't change unless public \nopinion changes significantly. The founders, wisely, made certain that \nthe Constitution is difficult to amend, and, as a practical political \nmatter, can't be done without overwhelming public approval. And thank \nGod for that. Were it any easier I fear we could not make the claim for \nthe Constitution's enduring success that I have just made.\n  Many, if not most, Americans have reasoned that there is no \noverriding urgent need to act at this time. And they are right to do \nso. The legal definition of marriage has always been left to the states \nto decide, in accordance with the prevailing standards of their \nneighborhoods and communities. Certainly, that view has prevailed for \nmany years in my party where we adhere to a rather stricter federalism \nthan has always been the case in the prevailing views among our friends \nin the Democratic Party. Some fear that the decision in Massachusetts \nwill ultimately result in the imposition of different views on marriage \nin communities where the traditional view of marriage is considered \nsingular and sacred. But there really is insufficient reason presently \nto fear such a result.\n  I supported the Defense of Marriage Act adopted by Congress and \nsigned into law by President Clinton in 1996. As my colleagues know, \nthe Defense of Marriage Act, DOMA, was proposed in response to a \ndecision by the Supreme Court of the State of Hawaii which concluded \nthat a law banning same-sex marriages may violate the Equal Protection \nClause of Hawaii's constitution. DOMA provides States an exemption from \nthe ``full faith and credit'' clause so that each State would be able \nto decide for itself whether to recognize same-sex marriage. The law \nneither compels a State to recognize a same-sex marriage from another \nState, nor does it prohibit States from recognizing such marriages. It \nsimply protects each State's right to choose how it will define \nmarriage. Currently, 39 States have defense of marriage laws in place. \nAnd thus far, there has yet to be a successful challenge to DOMA in \nFederal Court.\n  The Defense of Marriage Act represents the quintessentially \nfederalist and Republican approach to this issue. The constitutional \namendment we are debating today strikes me as antithetical in every way \nto the core philosophy of Republicans. It usurps from the states a \nfundamental authority they have always possessed, and imposes a Federal \nremedy for a problem that most states do not believe confronts them, \nand which they feel capable of\n\n[[Page S7999]]\n\nresolving should it confront them, again according to local standards \nand customs.\n  If a constitution is to be amended, it should be a State \nconstitution. According to a report by the Heritage Foundation, an \norganization not known for its liberal sympathies, ``the best way to \ndefend against a state court that might seek to overturn State public \npolicy or force recognition of another state's marriage policy is to \namend the State constitution to establish a state constitutional \nmarriage policy.'' At this time, 16 States have pending constitutional \namendments to protect marriage, and at least 3 others are expected to \nintroduce such amendments soon. Colleagues who have told me of actions \ntaken in this city or that county to impose a legal definition of \nmarriage that conflicts with the prevailing view of marriage in their \nState have a far less draconian remedy at hand to correct the injustice \nthan amending the United States Constitution--it is in their state \nlegislatures. What evidence do we have that States are incapable of \nfurther exercising an authority they have exercised successfully for \nover 200 years? The actions by jurists in one court in one state do not \nrepresent the death knell to marriage. We will have to wait a little \nlonger to see if Armageddon has arrived. If the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States rejects the Defense of Marriage Act as unconstitutional; \nif State legislatures are frustrated by the decisions of jurists in \nmore states than one, and if state remedies to such judicial activism \nfail; and finally, if a large majority of Americans come to perceive \nthat their communities' values are being ignored and other standards \nconcerning marriage are being imposed on them against their will, and \nthat elections and state legislatures can provide no remedy then, and \nonly then, should we consider, quite appropriately, amending the \nConstitution of the United States.\n  I know passions run high on this issue. Americans who support the \nFederal marriage amendment do so very forcefully. They want this vote. \nBut they should also know, and we should make sure they do know that it \nwill never be adopted until many more Americans feel as strongly as \nthey do. They have every right to demand a vote, even if the outcome is \nwell-known. There are, of course, many other urgent priorities left to \naddress in this Congress, not the least of which concern the physical \nsecurity of this country, as Secretary Ridge has recently reminded us. \nBut I have in the past supported legislation I knew lacked the \nnecessary votes to prevail, and still insisted on a vote. In those \ncases, however, I had much broader public support for the legislation \nthan exists for this proposed amendment. Still, I would normally be \ninclined to support any procedural motion to allow proponents their \nvote. But a procedural vote is unlikely to succeed, as we all know. \nThat's why I supported the Democratic leader's offer of a unanimous \nconsent agreement to allow an up or down vote on Senator Allard's \namendment. I would very much like an up or down vote on the amendment. \nThat offer was rejected, and it seems at the moment that the only vote \non this issue that we're going to be allowed will be a procedural vote. \nI would not want to obscure my position on this issue by voting to \nproceed to the amendment, and then, following that vote's failure, \nhaving no further opportunity to take my stand by voting, and to be \nheld accountable by my constituents for that vote. So, I am inclined at \nthis time, if this will be our only vote in this debate, to cast a vote \nthat reflects my position on the federal marriage amendment proposed by \nSenator Allard.\n\n  I refer to Federalist Paper 45 to explain my vote, in which James \nMadison wrote ``the powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to \nthe Federal Government, are few and defined. Those which are to remain \nin the State Governments are numerous and indefinite. The former will \nbe exercised principally on external objects, as war, peace, \nnegotiation and foreign commerce; with which last the power of taxation \nwill for the most part be connected. The powers reserved to the several \nStates will extend to all the objects, which, in the ordinary course of \naffairs, concern the lives, liberties and properties of the people, and \nthe internal order, improvement and prosperity of the State.'' I stand \nwith Mr. Madison on this question, and against a Federal marriage \namendment that denies the States their traditional right and their \nclear opportunity to resolve this controversy themselves.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I oppose amending our Constitution with the \nFederal Marriage Amendment (FMA) because it interferes in a fundamental \nState matter, and, worse yet, it does so for the purpose of disfavoring \na group of Americans. We have never amended our Constitution for that \npurpose, and we should not start now. The timing of this debate \nstrongly supports my point that the FMA's supporters are concerned not \nwith preserving the sanctity of marriage, but with preserving \nRepublican politicians.\n  I am disappointed that we are debating a divisive and mean-spirited \namendment that violates the traditions of Federalism and local control \nthat the Republican party claims to cherish. We should be upholding the \ncommitment to tolerance that underlies our Constitution, not betraying \nit with a premature debate that we all know will yield nothing but \ndivision in this body and among the American people. I urge all \nSenators to honor our oath as Senators to ``support and defend the \nConstitution'' and not sacrifice it to this short-term partisan \nexercise.\n  This debate risks great harm by casting States and gay Americans into \nsecond-class status and also harms the Senate. The Republican Senate \nleadership has shown contempt for the constitutional amendment process \nby bringing this proposed constitutional amendment directly to the \nSenate without the approval--or even the consideration--of the \nJudiciary Committee or its Constitution Subcommittee.\n  The Senate and the Judiciary Committee have followed a consistent \npractice for the consideration of constitutional amendments in the \npast. Before a constitutional amendment receives floor consideration it \nis debated and voted on by both the Subcommittee on the Constitution \nand the Judiciary Committee as a whole. This is the process that the \nSenate is currently following for the amendment to ban flag \ndesecration, an amendment that has been considered by the Senate on \nnumerous occasions, and that we followed in conjunction with the crime \nvictims rights constitutional amendment. By contrast, the Federal \nMarriage Amendment, which is being considered for the first time, was \nnot debated or voted on in either the subcommittee or the full \nCommittee, yet it is before us on the floor today.\n  Past attempts to skirt Committee consideration of constitutional \namendments, in the absence of an agreement between the parties, have \ndrawn sharp condemnation. Twenty-five years ago, an amendment calling \nfor direct election of the President and Vice-President was brought to \nthe floor without Judiciary Committee approval. Senator Hatch, the \nthen-ranking Republican member on the Constitution Subcommittee, said: \n``To bypass the committee is, I think, to denigrate the committee \nprocess, especially when an amendment to the Constitution of the United \nStates of America, the most important document in the history of the \nNation, is involved.'' The late Senator Thurmond said that ``if a bill \nof this nature is not going to be referred to a committee to consider \nit, I do not know why we need Committees in the U.S. Senate.'' In 1979, \nSenator Hatch said it was ``unconscionable to bring up legislation \nunder these circumstances.'' Apparently what was ``unconscionable'' in \n1979 is applauded in 2004 so long as it is being done for partisan \nRepublican purposes.\n  I joined with all of my Democratic colleagues on the Judiciary \nCommittee in writing last month to the Chairman to request that this \namendment go through the normal channels. That request was ignored by \nthe Chairman and apparently rejected by the Senate Republican \nleadership as it chooses for its own benefit to change yet another \nlongstanding practice of the United States Senate.\n  The procedural treatment the Republican leadership is giving this \nproposed amendment to the Constitution of the United States is perhaps \nmore appropriate for a resolution commemorating\n\n[[Page S8000]]\n\nan organization's anniversary or a celebratory day, which are sometimes \ndischarged from the Judiciary Committee without debate and agreed to by \nthe full Senate. When we are dealing with a resolution designating \nsomething as universally accepted as ``National Girl Scout Week,'' it \ndoes not offend me to skip Committee consideration. But short cuts are \nnot fitting when we are talking about amending our fundamental national \ncharter.\n  Perhaps cutting corners like this and its maneuvering reveals how the \nRepublican leadership really sees this amendment. Perhaps this exercise \nis, after all, not intended as a serious effort to amend the \nConstitution--something deserving deliberate consideration and careful \nrefinement during the Committee process. It seems that this forced \nexercise is intended instead as the legislative equivalent of a \npolitical bumper sticker, suddenly appearing on the Senate floor late \nin an election year.\n  I assume that our longstanding practice was disregarded because the \nmajority did not want to risk seeing the FMA defeated in committee. Or \nperhaps their decision to press this matter into debate, in spite of \nlast week's terrorism warning, the unresolved intelligence failures and \ntorture scandal and the lack of progress on a budget and Federal \nappropriations matters, was made hastily to fit the political calendar. \nForcing a debate at this time shows they have no interest in passing an \namendment--they simply want to go through the motions to please their \nhard-right base and try to inflict political damage of those of us who \nstand up for the Constitution. The New York Times reported yesterday \nhow much pressure Republicans have been under from their extreme right \nwing to turn to this matter. This is apparently especially true now \nthat the Republican Party has decided to try to put a pretty face on \nits harmful policies at its upcoming convention by featuring its few \nmoderates. Those moderates do not set the policy for the national \nRepublican Party and oppose this amendment. However the national \nRepublican Party tries to dress itself up at its convention, the hard \ntruth is that they are choosing to foster division by pressing this \nmatter. If the Senate Republican leadership were interested in amending \nthe Constitution, they would not bring this amendment to the floor now \nand face certain defeat. Committee consideration of an amendment is not \nmerely a box to check in a procedural flowchart. Committee \nconsideration of any legislation, especially constitutional amendments, \naffords an opportunity to address problems that are not easily remedied \non the Senate floor. Committee consideration can also ensure that we \nagree on what an amendment does, even if we disagree on whether what it \ndoes is desirable. I certainly do not believe that we are at that point \nas we begin this premature debate. In that light, I would like to \ndiscuss some of the open questions raised by this amendment.\n\n  I would like to place in the Record a story from the February 14 \nWashington Post about the formation of the FMA. The basic theme of the \nreport was that even the drafters of the FMA disagree about what it \nmeans. Matt Daniels, the head of the Alliance for Marriage, a group \npromoting the FMA, was honest enough to tell the Post that the drafters \nof the amendment did not worry too much about the wording, saying, ``I \ndon't think we expected there would be this much attention paid to \nit.'' Although the language of the amendment before us has changed \nslightly from the original version, it is essentially the same as the \nsloppy patchwork version introduced last year. I think that Mr. \nDaniels' attitude speaks volumes about the respect the supporters of \nthis amendment have for the Constitution.\n  This attitude is apparently shared by President Bush, who has made \nclear his desire to use this issue for political advantage. Although \nthe President has asked Congress to amend the Constitution to ban gay \nmarriage, he has refused repeated calls to state specifically what \nlanguage he believes Congress should adopt. Like the Senate leadership, \nthe President appears happy to seek political profit by demeaning both \nthe Constitution and gay and lesbian Americans.\n  I would contrast the casual approach of the President toward the \nwords of our Constitution with the approach of Senator Byrd--the most \nsenior member of this body and a fierce defender of the Constitution--\nduring the 1997 debate over the Balanced Budget Amendment. Senator Byrd \nsaid:\n\n       I would like to remind my colleagues that law and \n     legislating is about the examination of details. We don't \n     legislate one-liners, or campaign slogans. Here, in this body \n     and in the other body, we put the force of the law behind \n     details that impact mightily upon the daily lives of our \n     people. That is a solemn responsibility. And it is more \n     important than political popularity, or winning the next \n     election or marching lockstep to the orders of one political \n     party, or another.\n       Especially in the case of amending the Constitution, that \n     responsibility weighs more heavily. For in that instance we \n     are contemplating changes in our basic, fundamental organic \n     law--changes that, when once implanted in that revered \n     document, can only be removed at great difficulty, and which \n     will impact, quite possibly, upon generations of Americans \n     who, yet unborn, must trust us to guard their birthright as \n     Americans.''\n\n  Senator Byrd was right--the words of a Constitutional amendment \nmatter deeply. This is the third version of this amendment that has \nbeen introduced in the Senate, and it may not be the last. Senator \nHatch has publicly toyed for months with introducing a different \nversion of the amendment and Senator Smith is reported to be working on \nstill another version.\n  The version of the Federal Marriage Amendment before us today reads \nas follows: ``Marriage in the United States shall consist only of the \nunion of a man and a woman. Neither this Constitution, nor the \nconstitution of any State, shall be construed to require that marriage \nor the legal incidents thereof be conferred upon any union other than \nthe union of a man and a woman.''\n  First, the amendment appears to dictate to voters what language they \ncan put in their own State Constitutions. The natural reading of the \nFMA suggests that voters in a State could not place in their State \nConstitutions any benefits for same-sex couples that could be defined \nas ``legal incidents'' of marriage. This limitation is particularly \nnoteworthy in light of the current proceedings in Massachusetts. In \nresponse to the Supreme Judicial Court's decision in Goodridge, the \nMassachusetts Legislature has approved an amendment to the \nMassachusetts Constitution that would limit marriage to heterosexual \nunions but provide many of the benefits of marriage to same-sex couples \nthrough civil unions. This amendment is supported by Governor Mitt \nRomney, who testified before the Judiciary Committee last month.\n  Yet it appears that the Massachusetts amendment might be rendered \nunenforceable if the FMA were adopted, for no court would be permitted \nto ``construe'' the Massachusetts Constitution to provide for civil \nunions, which surely provide many of the ``legal incidents'' of \nmarriage. Without judicial recognition of civil unions, the rights \ncreated for gay couples under the Massachusetts Constitution would not \nbe worth the paper they are written on, even if they were approved by a \nmajority of the State's voters.\n  Governor Romney told the Judiciary Committee that he somehow supports \nboth the Federal and Massachusetts amendment, and did not believe they \nconflicted. I do not see how he can hold that position. Neither did \nformer Representative Bob Barr, a conservative Republican from Georgia, \nwho testified before the Committee at the same hearing. Congressman \nBarr said:\n\n       Governor Romney essentially is here to ask the Congress to \n     step in and have the federal government invalidate the \n     actions of the highest state court in his state, and also to \n     strangle before its birth the proposed state constitutional \n     amendment that his own state legislature passed this year. \n     That State constitutional amendment, if passed next session \n     and ratified by his state's voters, would deny marriage \n     rights to same-sex couples, but also provide civil unions. \n     The Federal Marriage Amendment, however, would invalidate any \n     civil union provided by the Massachusetts state \n     constitution, and of course would also invalidate all \n     same-sex marriages in the state.''\n\n  Second, it is unclear from the language of the FMA whether its \nprohibition on ``construing'' a Constitution is limited to the judicial \nbranch. From the plain text of the amendment, executive branch \nofficials--from a Governor to county clerks--would similarly be \nprohibited from construing even a duly-passed State constitutional \namendment to provide for the ``legal\n\n[[Page S8001]]\n\nincidents'' of marriage, whatever those should be. This is a \npotentially breathtaking imposition on our States and their officials.\n  Third, the term ``legal incidents'' is itself extraordinarily vague. \nSince the amendment did not go through the proper channels, we have no \nCommittee report language to clarify this or any of the other vague \nelements of this amendment. We do have the thoughts of Marilyn \nMusgrave, the House sponsor of the FMA, from a memo she produced to \nexplain the meaning of the amendment. In her view, ``legal incidents'' \ninclude, among many other things, the right to bring actions for the \nwrongful death of a partner, rights and duties under adoption law, and \neven the right to hospital visitation. Her sweeping view would thus \nprevent any court anywhere from finding that any State constitutional \nprovision might protect a person's right to visit their same-sex \npartner in a hospital. And in the absence of a Committee report on the \namendment, courts would likely have little choice but to give \nsubstantial weight to her view.\n  Fourth, although some supporters of the proposed amendment state \ncategorically that the amendment leaves State legislatures free to pass \ncivil union laws, that claim is also open to serious doubt. Surely \nSenator Allard and his allies cannot mean to put the Senate through \nthis ordeal only to put the word ``marriage'' off limits to same-sex \ncouples. Should a State pass a law that provides for marriage in all \nbut name, would supporters of this amendment not mount legal challenges \nbased on the amendment's first sentence? Indeed, two of the amendment's \nintellectual godfathers--Professors Robert George of Princeton and \nGerald Bradley of Notre Dame Law School--have said they believe it \nwould forbid civil unions that were sufficiently similar to marriage.\n  Fifth, the application of the amendment is not even limited to State \nactors, but would also apparently bind the behavior of private \norganizations, including private religious organizations. The first \nsentence of the amendment purports to define marriage for all time and \nfor all purposes. In other words, no one could marry same-sex couples, \nregardless of whether that person was acting on behalf of the State. \nThis is one of the reasons why so many religious organizations oppose \nthis amendment, including the Episcopal Church, USA, the Alliance of \nBaptists, and the American Jewish Committee.\n  The only amendment that binds private parties is the Thirteenth, \nwhich forbids slavery anywhere in the United States. Given the stain of \nslavery on our nation, and its inherent evil, the Thirteenth \nAmendment's sweeping ban is obviously appropriate. To take that \nextraordinary step here and to impose a definition upon all churches \nand faiths to tell them what they must do is overreaching and \ninappropriate. Marriage is first and foremost a religious concept and \ninstitution. Respecting religion, the Federal Government ought to stay \nout of defining what a religious definition of marriage can be.\n  One thing we can say with certainty about this amendment is that if \nit is passed, it will present a field day for litigation.\n  This amendment is all the more mean-spirited because it is \nunnecessary. Unless we are planning to use the constitutional process \nto overturn a single State's marriage policy--a purpose that I doubt \nhas the support of even one-third of this body--the only possible \nrationale for the amendment is to authorize States not to recognize \nsame-sex marriages performed in other States. This rationale is already \naccomplished, however, by both the inherent right of States to \nestablish their own policies regarding marriage and by the Defense of \nMarriage Act, which Congress passed and President Clinton signed in \n1996.\n  Many proponents of this amendment have stated as fact that the \nConstitution's Full Faith and Credit Clause requires States to give the \nforce of law to marriage licenses issued by other States. This is \nsimply not the case. Lea Brilmayer, a professor at Yale Law School and \nan expert on the Full Faith and Credit clause, told the Judiciary \nCommittee in March that the Clause was designed and has been \ninterpreted to ensure that judgments entered by one State's courts are \nrespected in other States. Marriage licenses are not judgments, she \nsaid, and they have ``never received the automatic effect given to \njudicial decisions.'' Rather, ``courts have not hesitated to apply \nlocal public policy to refuse to recognize marriages entered into in \nother states.''\n  Moreover, Professor Brilmayer testified that the Full Faith and \nCredit Clause ``has never been understood to require recognition of \nmarriages entered into in other states that are contrary to local \n`public policy.' The `public policy' doctrine, which is well recognized \nin conflict of laws, frees a state from having to recognize decisions \nby other States that offend deeply held local values.''\n  Under this long-established ``public policy'' doctrine, the nearly 40 \nStates that have elected to pass their own ``Defense of Marriage'' acts \nwould be expected not to have to recognize a same-sex marriage from \nMassachusetts. Of course, the small minority of States that have not \npassed such laws are free to pass them at any time. If they do not do \nso, just maybe preventing the recognition of other States' gay \nmarriages is not a burning issue for their citizens.\n  As the Judiciary Committee has learned, the Constitution places no \nrequirement on Pennsylvania to recognize a gay marriage from \nMassachusetts. In the unlikely event that Federal courts take a \ndifferent view and alter the historic understanding of the Full Faith \nand Credit Clause, however, the Defense of Marriage Act provides an \nadditional layer of security for States that do not wish to recognize \nsame-sex marriage.\n  The federal law says that no State shall be required to give effect \nto any public act, record, or judicial proceeding of another state \nrespecting a relationship between persons of the same sex that is \ntreated as a marriage. It is the law of the land, and no court has \nfound it to be unconstitutional. It seems to me that DOMA is \npresumptively constitutional, especially since the Full Faith and \nCredit Clause itself provides Congress with the power to direct the \nClause's interpretation:\n\n       Full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the \n     public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other \n     state. And the Congress may by general laws prescribe the \n     manner in which such acts, records, and proceedings shall be \n     proved, and the effect thereof.\n\n  Some of my colleagues have suggested that we need to amend the \nConstitution now because the Supreme Court may either (a) invalidate \nDOMA and find that the Full Faith and Credit Clause requires 50-State \nrecognition of Massachusetts gay marriages; or (b) go beyond even that \nanalysis by finding a right to same-sex marriage under the Equal \nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n  My initial reaction to these predictions about the judiciary is that \nthey do not square with the Rehnquist Court I have been watching for \nthe last 17 years. It is true that the Supreme Court found last year, \nin Lawrence v. Texas, that Texas and a handful of other States could no \nlonger make it a crime for homosexual couples to engage in sexual acts \nin the privacy of their own home. And it is true that many of those who \nsupport the Federal Marriage Amendment decried this imposition on \nTexas's right to punish its gay and lesbian citizens. It is a far leap, \nhowever, from saying that gay couples should not be thrown in jail and \nsaying that they have a Constitutional right to marry. The comparisons \nthat some are making between the Lawrence and Goodridge decisions are \nvastly overblown.\n  My second reaction, however, is the one that should move the Senate \nto reject this amendment. Perhaps my colleagues' fearful predictions \nabout the activism of the Rehnquist court will come true. More likely, \nthey will not. But Congress's job is not to imagine outcomes that \nappellate courts or even the Supreme Court might conceivably reach and \npreemptively amend the Constitution to prevent them. We have had enough \ndifficulties during this Congress stemming from a preemptive war--we \nneed not add a new preemptive theory to our arsenal. When it comes to \nthe Constitution, it is simply wrong for the Senate to ``shoot first \nand ask questions later.'' Rather, it is our duty to show restraint.\n  If the Court should reverse 200-plus years of understanding of the \nFull\n\n[[Page S8002]]\n\nFaith and Credit Clause, or find that the Equal Protection Clause \nprohibits limiting marriage to heterosexual couples, a future Congress \ncan react to that decision however it sees fit. That Congress will act \nin a way consistent with the views and circumstances of their time.\n  I believe preemptive action on this matter would set a precedent that \nboth Republicans and Democrats in this body would come to regret. \nCongressman Barr, the author of the Defense of Marriage Act, \nilluminated this point when he testified last month. Congressman Barr \nsaid:\n\n       In treating the Constitution as an appropriate place to \n     impose publicly contested social policies, [the FMA] would \n     cheapen the sacrosanct nature of that document, opening the \n     door to future meddling by liberals and conservatives. . . . \n     The Founders created the Constitution with such a daunting \n     amendatory process precisely because it is only supposed to \n     be changed by overwhelming acclamation. It is so difficult to \n     revise specifically in order to guard against the fickle \n     winds of public opinion blowing counter to basic individual \n     rights like speech or religion.\n\n  Part of Congressman Barr's testimony should be of particular note to \nmy conservative colleagues. He said, ``We know that the future is \nuncertain, and our fortunes unclear. I would like to think people will \nthink like me for a long time to come, but if they do not, I fear the \nconsequences of the FMA precedent. Could liberal activists use the FMA \nargument to modify the Second Amendment? Or force income \nredistribution? Or ban tax cuts?'' This should be food for thought for \nall those--from the right or from the left--who would use the \nConstitution as a playground for their policy preferences.\n  This is a sad day for the Senate. We all take an oath to uphold the \nConstitution of the United States. But when the Republican majority \nbrings a constitutional amendment to the floor in defiance of our \nnormal procedures, and with full knowledge that it will not pass, it \ndemonstrates a fundamental disrespect for our Constitution and for this \ninstitution, the United States Senate.\n  I close by echoing the words of Senator Byrd from the debate on the \nBalanced Budget Amendment: ``What is really wanted by some in this body \nis not the amendment itself, but an issue with which to whip its \nopponents. This is simple politics, my colleagues. And it is politics \nat its most unappealing and destructive level.''\n  I will have more to say about the Federal Marriage Amendment as this \ndebate proceeds.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have no speakers tonight.\n  In the morning, it is my understanding that the majority leader is \ngoing to allow--I am quite sure this is true--we would have an hour on \neach side on this amendment. Therefore, on the Democratic side in the \nmorning, so there is no confusion, I want to make sure if any Senator \nis calling tonight, there is no more time. We have allocated all the \ntime. If people call in the morning, there is no time left.\n  I ask unanimous consent that tomorrow, if the majority leader allows \nus the 55 minutes--I think he will--we have Senator Dodd, 15 minutes; \nSenator Carper, 10 minutes; Senator Lieberman, 5 minutes; Senator \nKennedy, 5 minutes; Senator Levin, 10 minutes; Senator Leahy, 10 \nminutes; and I would hope the two leaders could close the debate \ntomorrow morning using their leader time or whatever time is agreed \nupon by the Senate.\n  I ask consent on our side, our 55 minutes be divided as I have \nindicated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I will take a moment to talk a little bit \nabout my amendment. The purpose of my amendment is to protect marriage. \nThere has been an editorial written by the Weekly Standard which I \nwould like to share with my colleagues. There are three paragraphs I \nwill recite. I ask unanimous consent to have the editorial printed in \nthe Record. This is the editorial in the Weekly Standard called \n``Cloturekampf,'' written by Terry Eastland.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Weekly Standard, July 19, 2004]\n\n                              Cloturekampf\n\n                          (By Terry Eastland)\n\n       Senate Republicans deserve credit for pushing this week for \n     a vote on a constitutional amendment that would define \n     marriage in the United States as consisting only of the union \n     of a man and a woman. Whether they will get that vote is an \n     open question. Under Senate rules, 60 votes likely will be \n     needed to cut off debate in order for a vote on the amendment \n     to occur. Those who count heads in the Senate tell us that as \n     few as two Democrats may be willing to vote for cloture, as \n     it is called, and as many as 12 Republicans may be prepared \n     to vote against it. The votes for cloture might not even \n     total 50.\n       Yet if you believe that the courts ought not to be \n     irrevocably fixing policy upon such a vital question as what \n     constitutes marriage, there is merit, especially in an \n     election year, in determining just who is and who is not \n     willing to vote on an amendment that would enable the people \n     to decide whether they want to settle the issue as they \n     choose. Which is to say, consistent with their conviction \n     that marriage is what it always has been--only the union of a \n     man and a woman.\n       As matters now stand, marriage defined as the union of any \n     two people is the policy of only one government--the \n     Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The policy was fixed by the \n     Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in a decision last \n     November that ran roughshod over the legislature's \n     constitutional authority. The federalist impulse in our shop \n     says that maybe on the question of marriage nothing at all \n     should be done--in which case a state would be allowed to go \n     to hell in a handbasket, if that should be the desire of its \n     judges, and the ruling is allowed to stand. We are reminded \n     that states also can do the right thing, from our point of \n     view, and in fact have. The people of Hawaii responded to \n     their high court's decision implying a constitutional right \n     of same-sex couples to marry by passing a constitutional \n     amendment prohibiting such marriages. And the people of \n     Alaska voted for a similar constitutional amendment in \n     response to a lower-court judge's ruling announcing a right \n     to same-sex marriage.\n       Nonetheless, it is now unlikely that the states will be \n     able simply to do as they wish on the question of marriage. \n     Under the Massachusetts Constitution, no amendment in \n     response to the supreme judicial court's decision will be \n     possible until 2006, and in the meantime there is no stopping \n     same-sex nuptials, of which there have been thousands so far, \n     including many from out of state. It is only a matter of time \n     before some same-sex couples who have returned home file \n     lawsuits pressing their states to recognize their unions.\n       A basis for their claim will be the federal Constitution's \n     requirement that states give ``full faith and credit'' to \n     other states' judicial proceedings. The federal Defense of \n     Marriage Act of 1996 offers an authoritative interpretation \n     of the ``full faith and credit'' clause designed to prevent \n     the interstate transmission of same-sex marriage. But the \n     Supreme Court has repeatedly told Congress that it lacks the \n     power to do that, and there is no reason to think that the \n     Court would change its mind.\n       The odds are strong, then, that same-sex marriage will \n     travel via the federal courts to other states. There also \n     remains a possibility that the Supreme Court itself might \n     simply strike down the traditional definition of marriage. \n     Recall that last summer in Lawrence v. Texas the Court, with \n     Justice Anthony Kennedy writing, did not merely void the \n     nation's sodomy laws. Kennedy also embraced an amorphous \n     right to sexual liberty (untethered to constitutional text or \n     history) that denies the historic right of the people to \n     enact legislation based on their moral views. The \n     Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, not incidentally, drew \n     inspiration from Kennedy's Lawrence opinion.\n       The question facing the Senate and, for that matter, the \n     House of Representatives, is whether federal judges should be \n     allowed to decide the issue in the way they are likely to--or \n     whether the American people should be given the opportunity \n     to settle it through a constitutional amendment expressing \n     their longstanding conviction about marriage. Even a failed \n     cloture vote will give the country an idea of which senators \n     understand--and which do not--that the definition of marriage \n     is now an unavoidably national issue, and that, if marriage \n     is to remain the union of a man and a woman, the issue will \n     have to be addressed through a constitutional amendment.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Also, while I am at it, I would like to add Senator Dole \nas a cosponsor to S.J. Res. 40.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, the editorial states:\n\n       Nonetheless, it is now unlikely that the states will be \n     able simply to do as they wish on the question of marriage. \n     Under the Massachusetts Constitution, no amendment in \n     response to the supreme judicial court's decision will be \n     possible until 2006, and in the meantime there is no stopping \n     same-sex nuptials, of which there have been thousands so far, \n     including many from out of state.

The Governor of Massachusetts \nrelayed that issue to us during testimony before the committee. They \njust filed that. So here is another court case that has been filed that \nis another attack on marriage. That is why I think it is so very \nimportant we move forward with this debate.\n  This is not a political debate. It is not driven by politics. It is \ndriven by the courts. Again, we have an organized effort, I believe, by \nproponents of same-sex marriage who want to undo the idea of a \ntraditional marriage.\n  Right now, we have 46 States that have same-sex couples living there \nwho have marriage licenses. I have been informed there is an organized \neffort to begin to file cases in those respective States. We have 11 \nStates that have court cases currently filed in them. I was told \nseveral days ago that within those 11 States we have about 32 cases \nthat have been filed, total.\n  We have 48 States that have passed laws protecting traditional \nmarriage. I have behind me a chart that defines marriage as a union \nbetween a man and a woman. We had a very fine statement from the \nSenator from Oklahoma who talked about the need and why he carried that \namendment that protected the definition of marriage and allowed States \ntheir basic right to defend their position as far as the definition of \nmarriage.\n  This definition has been supported by huge majorities in these States \nin their legislative bodies. I happen to disagree with my colleague \nfrom the State of Arizona. I think a large percentage of Americans are \nconcerned about changing the definition of traditional marriage. I \nthink as they begin to more fully understand, they are going to be more \nforceful in the message they are sending to the Senate, and I think \neventually the Members of this Senate will realize how very serious \nthis particular issue is which is before us today.\n  We have at least 10 States that have constitutional amendments on the \nballot, and 3 States that are still gathering petitions. This issue is \nhere before us today. It is an important issue. The people of the \nUnited States are concerned about what is happening in the courts. That \nis the reason we are here today to carry on this debate.\n  There are some profound implications, I believe, to the rearing of \nchildren. Marriage matters. I have an article entitled: ``The End of \nMarriage in Scandinavia.'' It is written by Stanley Kurtz, in the \nWeekly Standard, and dated February 2, 2004, in which he talks about \nthe impact of redefining marriage in the Scandinavian countries and on \nchildren. I ask unanimous consent that article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Weekly Standard, Feb. 2, 2004]\n\nThe End of Marriage in Scandinavia: The ``Conservative Case'' for Same-\n                         Sex Marriage Collapses\n\n                           (By Stanley Kurtz)\n\n       Marriage is slowly dying in Scandinavia. A majority of \n     children in Sweden and Norway are born out of wedlock. Sixty \n     percent of first-born children in Denmark have unmarried \n     parents. Not coincidentally, these countries have had \n     something close to full gay marriage for a decade or more. \n     Same-sex marriage has locked in and reinforced an existing \n     Scandinavian trend toward the separation of marriage and \n     parenthood. The Nordic family pattern--including gay \n     marriage--is spreading across Europe. And by looking closely \n     at it we can answer the key empirical question underlying the \n     gay marriage debate. Will same-sex marriage undermine the \n     institution of marriage? It already has.\n       More precisely, it has further undermined the institution. \n     The separation of marriage from parenthood was increasing; \n     gay marriage has widened the separation. Out-of-wedlock \n     birthrates were rising; gay marriage has added to the factors \n     pushing those rates higher. Instead of encouraging a society-\n     wide return to marriage, Scandinavian gay marriage has driven \n     home the message that marriage itself is outdated, and that \n     virtually any family form, including out-of-wedlock \n     parenthood, is acceptable.\n       This is not how the situation has been portrayed by \n     prominent gay marriage advocates journalist Andrew Sullivan \n     and Yale law professor William Eskridge Jr. Sullivan and \n     Eskridge have made much of an unpublished study of Danish \n     same-sex registered partnerships by Darren Spedale, an \n     independent researcher with an undergraduate degree who \n     visited Denmark in 1996 on a Fulbright scholarship. In 1989, \n     Denmark had legalized de facto gay marriage (Norway followed \n     in 1993 and Sweden in 1994). Drawing on Spedale, Sullivan and \n     Eskridge cite evidence that since then, marriage has \n     strengthened. Spedale reported that in the six years \n     following the establishment of registered partnerships in \n     Denmark (1990-1996), heterosexual marriage rates climbed by \n     10 percent, while heterosexual divorce rates declined by 12 \n     percent. Writing in the McGeorge Law Review, Eskridge claimed \n     that Spedale's study had exposed the ``hysteria and \n     irresponsibility'' of those who predicted gay marriage would \n     undermine marriage. Andrew Sullivan's Spedale-inspired piece \n     was subtitled, ``The case against same-sex marriage \n     crumbles.''\n       Yet the half-page statistical analysis of heterosexual \n     marriage in Darren Spedale's unpublished paper doesn't begin \n     to get at the truth about the decline of marriage in \n     Scandinavia during the nineties. Scandinavian marriage is now \n     so weak that statistics on marriage and divorce no longer \n     mean what they used to.\n       Take divorce. It's true that in Denmark, as elsewhere in \n     Scandinavia, divorce numbers looked better in the nineties. \n     But that's because the pool of married people has been \n     shrinking for some time. You can't divorce without first \n     getting married. Moreover, a closer look at Danish divorce in \n     the post-gay marriage decade reveals disturbing trends. Many \n     Danes have stopped holding off divorce until their kids are \n     grown. And Denmark in the nineties saw a 25 percent increase \n     in cohabiting couples with children. With fewer parents \n     marrying, what used to show up in statistical tables as \n     early divorce is now the unrecorded breakup of a \n     cohabiting couple with children.\n       What about Spedale's report that the Danish marriage rate \n     increased 10 percent from 1990 to 1996? Again, the news only \n     appears to be good. First, there is no trend. Eurostat's \n     just-released marriage rates for 2001 show declines in Sweden \n     and Denmark (Norway hasn't reported). Second, marriage \n     statistics in societies with very low rates (Sweden \n     registered the lowest marriage rate in recorded history in \n     1997) must be carefully parsed. In his study of the Norwegian \n     family in the nineties, for example, Christer Hyggen shows \n     that a small increase in Norway's marriage rate over the past \n     decade has more to do with the institution's decline than \n     with any renaissance. Much of the increase in Norway's \n     marriage rate is driven by older couples ``catching up.'' \n     These couples belong to the first generation that accepts \n     rearing the first born child out of wedlock. As they bear \n     second children, some finally get married. (And even this \n     tendency to marry at the birth of a second child is \n     weakening.) As for the rest of the increase in the Norwegian \n     marriage rate, it is largely attributable to remarriage among \n     the large number of divorced.\n       Spedale's report of lower divorce rates and higher marriage \n     rates in post-gay marriage Denmark is thus misleading. \n     Marriage is now so weak in Scandinavia that shifts in these \n     rates no longer mean what they would in America. In \n     Scandinavian demography, what counts is the out-of-wedlock \n     birthrate, and the family dissolution rate.\n       The family dissolution rate is different from the divorce \n     rate. Because so many Scandinavians now rear children outside \n     of marriage, divorce rates are unreliable measures of family \n     weakness. Instead, we need to\n\n[[Page S8004]]\n\n     know the rate at which parents (married or not) split up. \n     Precise statistics on family dissolution are unfortunately \n     rare. Yet the studies that have been done show that \n     throughout Scandinavia (and the West) cohabiting couples with \n     children break up at two to three times the rate of married \n     parents. So rising rates of cohabitation and out-of-wedlock \n     birth stand as proxy for rising rates of family dissolution.\n       By that measure, Scandinavian family dissolution has only \n     been worsening. Between 1990 and 2000, Norway's out-of-\n     wedlock birthrate rose from 39 to 50 percent, while Sweden's \n     rose from 47 to 55 percent. In Denmark out-of-wedlock births \n     stayed level during the nineties (beginning at 46 percent and \n     ending at 45 percent). But the leveling off seems to be a \n     function of a slight increase in fertility among older \n     couples, who marry only after multiple births (if they don't \n     break up first). That shift masks the 25 percent increase \n     during the nineties in cohabitation and unmarried parenthood \n     among Danish couples (many of them young). About 60 percent \n     of first born children in Denmark now have unmarried parents. \n     The rise of fragile families based on cohabitation and out-\n     of-wedlock childbearing means that during the nineties, the \n     total rate of family dissolution in Scandinavia significantly \n     increased.\n       Scandinavia's out-of-wedlock birthrates may have risen more \n     rapidly in the seventies, when marriage began its slide. But \n     the push of that rate past the 50 percent mark during the \n     nineties was in many ways more disturbing. Growth in the out-\n     of-wedlock birthrate is limited by the tendency of parents to \n     marry after a couple of births, and also by the persistence \n     of relatively conservative and religious districts. So as \n     out-of-wedlock childbearing pushes beyond 50 percent, it is \n     reaching the toughest areas of cultural resistance. The most \n     important trend of the post-gay marriage decade may be the \n     erosion of the tendency to marry at the birth of a second \n     child. Once even that marker disappears, the path to the \n     complete disappearance of marriage is open.\n       And now that married parenthood has become a minority \n     phenomenon, it has lost the critical mass required to have \n     socially normative force. As Danish sociologists Wehner, \n     Kambskard, and Abrahamson describe it, in the wake of the \n     changes of the nineties, ``Marriage is no longer a \n     precondition for settling a family--neither legally nor \n     normatively. . . . What defines and makes the foundation of \n     the Danish family can be said to have moved from marriage to \n     parenthood.''\n       So the highly touted half-page of analysis from an \n     unpublished paper that supposedly helps validate the \n     ``conservative case'' for gay marriage--i.e., that it will \n     encourage stable marriage for heterosexuals and homosexuals \n     alike--does no such thing. Marriage in Scandinavia is in deep \n     decline, with children shouldering the burden of rising rates \n     of family dissolution. And the mainspring of the decline--an \n     increasingly sharp separation between marriage and \n     parenthood--can be linked to gay marriage. To see this, we \n     need to understand why marriage is in trouble in Scandinavia \n     to begin with.\n       Scandinavia has long been a bellwether of family change. \n     Scholars take the Swedish experience as a prototype for \n     family developments that will, or could, spread throughout \n     the world. So let's have a look at the decline of Swedish \n     marriage.\n       In Sweden, as elsewhere, the sixties brought contraception, \n     abortion, and growing individualism. Sex was separated from \n     procreation, reducing the need for ``shotgun weddings.'' \n     These changes, along with the movement of women into the \n     workforce, enabled and encouraged people to marry at later \n     ages. With married couples putting off parenthood, early \n     divorce had fewer consequences for children. That weakened \n     the taboo against divorce. Since young couples were putting \n     off children, the next step was to dispense with marriage and \n     cohabit until children were desired. Americans have lived \n     through this transformation. The Swedes have simply drawn the \n     final conclusion: If we've come so far without marriage, why \n     marry at all? Our love is what matters, not a piece of paper. \n     Why should children change that?\n       Two things prompted the Swedes to take this extra step--the \n     welfare state and cultural attitudes. No Western economy has \n     a higher percentage of public employees, public \n     expenditures--or higher tax rates--than Sweden. The massive \n     Swedish welfare state has largely displaced the family as \n     provider. By guaranteeing jobs and income to every citizen \n     (even children), the welfare state renders each individual \n     independent. It's easier to divorce your spouse when the \n     state will support you instead.\n       The taxes necessary to support the welfare state have had \n     an enormous impact on the family. With taxes so high, women \n     must work. This reduces the time available for child rearing, \n     thus encouraging the expansion of a day-care system that \n     takes a large part in raising nearly all Swedish children \n     over age one. Here is at least a partial realization of \n     Simone de Beauvoir's dream of an enforced androgyny that \n     pushes women from the home by turning children over to the \n     state.\n       Yet the Swedish welfare state may encourage traditionalism \n     in one respect. The lone teen pregnancies common in the \n     British and American underclass are rare in Sweden, which has \n     no underclass to speak of. Even when Swedish couples bear a \n     child out of wedlock, they tend to reside together when the \n     child is born. Strong state enforcement of child support is \n     another factor discouraging single motherhood by teens. \n     Whatever the causes, the discouragement of lone motherhood is \n     a short-term effect. Ultimately, mothers and fathers can get \n     along financially alone. So children born out of wedlock \n     are raised, initially, by two cohabiting parents, many of \n     whom later break up.\n       There are also cultural-ideological causes of Swedish \n     family decline. Even more than in the United States, radical \n     feminist and socialist ideas pervade the universities and the \n     media. Many Scandinavian social scientists see marriage as a \n     barrier to full equality between the sexes, and would not be \n     sorry to see marriage replaced by unmarried cohabitation. A \n     related cultural-ideological agent of marital decline is \n     secularism. Sweden is probably the most secular country in \n     the world. Secular social scientists (most of them quite \n     radical) have largely replaced clerics as arbiters of public \n     morality. Swedes themselves link the decline of marriage to \n     secularism. And many studies confirm that, throughout the \n     West, religiosity is associated with institutionally strong \n     marriage, while heightened secularism is correlated with a \n     weakening of marriage. Scholars have long suggested that the \n     relatively thin Christianization of the Nordic countries \n     explains a lot about why the decline of marriage in \n     Scandinavia is a decade ahead of the rest of the West.\n       Are Scandinavians concerned about rising out-of-wedlock \n     births, the decline of marriage, and ever-rising rates of \n     family dissolution? No, and yes. For over 15 years, an \n     American outsider, Rutgers University sociologist David \n     Popenoe, has played Cassandra on these issues. Popenoe's 1988 \n     book, ``Disturbing the Nest,'' is still the definitive \n     treatment of Scandinavian family change and its meaning for \n     the Western world. Popenoe is no toe-the-line conservative. \n     He has praise for the Swedish welfare state, and criticizes \n     American opposition to some child welfare programs. Yet \n     Popenoe has documented the slow motion collapse of the \n     Swedish family, and emphasized the link between Swedish \n     family decline and welfare policy.\n       For years, Popenoe's was a lone voice. Yet by the end of \n     the nineties, the problem was too obvious to ignore. In 2000, \n     Danish sociologist Mai Heide Ottosen published a study, \n     ``Samboskab, Aegteskab og Foraeldrebrud'' (``Cohabitation, \n     Marriage and Parental Breakup''), which confirmed the \n     increased risk of family dissolution to children of unmarried \n     parents, and gently chided Scandinavian social scientists for \n     ignoring the ``quiet revolution'' of out-of-wedlock \n     parenting.\n       Despite the reluctance of Scandinavian social scientists to \n     study the consequences of family dissolution for children, we \n     do have an excellent study that followed the life experiences \n     of all children born in Stockholm in 1953. (Not \n     coincidentally, the research was conducted by a British \n     scholar, Duncan W.G. Timms.) That study found that regardless \n     of income or social status, parental breakup had negative \n     effects on children's mental health. Boys living with single, \n     separated, or divorced mothers had particularly high rates of \n     impairment in adolescence. An important 2003 study by Gunilla \n     Ringback Weitoft, et al. found that children of single \n     parents in Sweden have more than double the rates of \n     mortality, severe morbidity, and injury of children in two \n     parent households. This held true after controlling for a \n     wide range of demographic and socioeconomic circumstances.\n       The decline of marriage and the rise of unstable \n     cohabitation and out-of-wedlock childbirth are not confined \n     to Scandinavia. The Scandinavian welfare state aggravates \n     these problems. Yet none of the forces weakening marriage \n     there are unique to the region. Contraception, abortion, \n     women in the workforce, spreading secularism, ascendant \n     individualism, and a substantial welfare state are found in \n     every Western country. That is why the Nordic pattern is \n     spreading.\n       Yet the pattern is spreading unevenly. And scholars agree \n     that cultural tradition plays a central role in determining \n     whether a given country moves toward the Nordic family \n     system. Religion is a key variable. A 2002 study by the Max \n     Planck Institute, for example, concluded that countries with \n     the lowest rates of family dissolution and out-of-wedlock \n     births are ``strongly dominated by the Catholic confession.'' \n     The same study found that in countries with high levels of \n     family dissolution, religion in general, and Catholicism in \n     particular, had little influence.\n       British demographer Kathleen Kiernan, the acknowledged \n     authority on the spread of cohabitation and out-of-wedlock \n     births across Europe, divides the continent into three zones. \n     The Nordic countries are the leaders in cohabitation and out-\n     of-wedlock births. They are followed by a middle group that \n     includes the Netherlands, Belgium, Great Britain, and \n     Germany. Until recently, France was a member of this middle \n     group, but France's rising out-of-wedlock birthrate has moved \n     it into the Nordic category. North American rates of \n     cohabitation and out-of-wedlock birth put the United States \n     and Canada into this middle group. Most resistant to \n     cohabitation, family dissolution, and out-of-wedlock births \n     are the southern European countries of Spain, Portugal, \n     Italy, and Greece, and, until recently, Switzerland and \n     Ireland. (Ireland's rising out-of-wedlock birthrate has just \n     pushed it into the middle group.)\n       These three groupings closely track the movement for gay \n     marriage. In the early\n\n[[Page S8005]]\n\n     nineties, gay marriage came to the Nordic countries, where \n     the out-of-wedlock birthrate was already high. Ten years \n     later, out-of-wedlock birth rates have risen significantly in \n     the middle group of nations. Not coincidentally, nearly every \n     country in that middle group has recently either legalized \n     some form of gay marriage, or is seriously considering doing \n     so. Only in the group with low out-of-wedlock birthrates has \n     the gay marriage movement achieved relatively little success.\n       This suggests that gay marriage is both an effect and a \n     cause of the increasing separation between marriage and \n     parenthood. As rising out-of-wedlock birthrates disassociate \n     heterosexual marriage from parenting, gay marriage becomes \n     conceivable. If marriage is only about a relationship between \n     two people, and is not intrinsically connected to parenthood, \n     why shouldn't same-sex couples be allowed to marry? It \n     follows that once marriage is redefined to accommodate same-\n     sex couples, that change cannot help but lock in and \n     reinforce the very cultural separation between marriage and \n     parenthood that makes gay marriage conceivable to begin with.\n       We see this process at work in the radical separation of \n     marriage and parenthood that swept across Scandinavia in the \n     nineties. If Scandinavian out-of-wedlock birthrates had not \n     already been high in the late eighties, gay marriage would \n     have been far more difficult to imagine. More than a decade \n     into post-gay marriage Scandinavia, out-of-wedlock birthrates \n     have passed 50 percent, and the effective end of marriage as \n     a protective shield for children has become thinkable. Gay \n     marriage hasn't blocked the separation of marriage and \n     parenthood; it has advanced it.\n       We see this most clearly in Norway. In 1989, a couple of \n     years after Sweden broke ground by offering gay couples the \n     first domestic partnership package in Europe, Denmark \n     legalized de facto gay marriage. This kicked off a debate in \n     Norway (traditionally more conservative than either Sweden or \n     Denmark), which legalized de facto gay marriage in 1993. \n     (Sweden expanded its benefits packages into de facto gay \n     marriage in 1994.) In liberal Denmark, where out-of-wedlock \n     birthrates were already very high, the public favored \n     same-sex marriage. But in Norway, where the out-of-wedlock \n     birthrate was lower--and religion traditionally stronger--\n     gay marriage was imposed, against the public will, by the \n     political elite.\n       Norway's gay marriage debate, which ran most intensely from \n     1991 through 1993, was a culture-shifting event. And once \n     enacted, gay marriage had a decidedly unconservative impact \n     on Norway's cultural contests, weakening marriage's \n     defenders, and placing a weapon in the hands of those who \n     sought to replace marriage with cohabitation. Since its \n     adoption, gay marriage has brought division and decline to \n     Norway's Lutheran Church. Meanwhile. Norway's fast-rising \n     out-of-wedlock birthrate has shot past Denmark's. \n     Particularly in Norway--once relatively conservative--gay \n     marriage has undermined marriage's institutional standing for \n     everyone.\n       Norway's Lutheran state church has been riven by conflict \n     in the decade since the approval of de facto gay marriage, \n     with the ordination of registered partners the most divisive \n     issue. The church's agonies have been intensively covered in \n     the Norwegian media, which have taken every opportunity to \n     paint the church as hidebound and divided. The nineties began \n     with conservative churchmen in control. By the end of the \n     decade, liberals had seized the reins.\n       While the most public disputes of the nineties were over \n     homosexuality, Norway's Lutheran church was also divided over \n     the question of heterosexual cohabitation. Asked directly, \n     liberal and conservative clerks alike voice a preference for \n     marriage over cohabitation--especially for couples with \n     children. In practice, however, conservative churchmen speak \n     out against the trend toward unmarried cohabitation and \n     childbirth, while liberals acquiesce.\n       This division over heterosexual cohabitation broke into the \n     open in 2000, at the height of the church's split over gay \n     partnerships, when Prince Haakon, heir to Norway's throne, \n     began to live with his lover, a single mother. From the start \n     of the prince's controversial relationship to its eventual \n     culmination in marriage, the future head of the Norwegian \n     state church received tokens of public support or \n     understanding from the very same bishops who were leading the \n     fight to permit the ordination of homosexual partners.\n       So rather than strengthening Norwegian marriage against the \n     rise of cohabitation and out-of-wedlock birth, same-sex \n     marriage had the opposite effect. Gay marriage lessened the \n     church's authority by splitting it into warring factions and \n     providing the secular media with occasions to mock and expose \n     divisions. Gay marriage also elevated the church's openly \n     rebellious minority liberal faction to national visibility, \n     allowing Norwegians to feel that their proclivity for \n     unmarried parenthood, if not fully approved by the church, \n     was at least not strongly condemned. If the ``conservative \n     case'' for gay marriage had been valid, clergy who were \n     supportive of gay marriage would have taken a strong public \n     stand against unmarried heterosexual parenthood. This didn't \n     happen. It was the conservative clergy who criticized the \n     prince, while the liberal supporters of gay marriage \n     tolerated his decisions. The message was not lost on ordinary \n     Norwegians, who continued their flight to unmarried \n     parenthood.\n       Gay marriage is both an effect and a reinforcing cause of \n     the separation of marriage and parenthood. In states like \n     Sweden and Denmark, where out-of-wedlock birthrates were \n     already very high, and the public favored gay marriage, gay \n     unions were an effect of earlier changes. Once in place, gay \n     marriage symbolically ratified the separation of marriage and \n     parenthood. And once established, gay marriage became one of \n     several factors contributing to further increases in \n     cohabitation and out-of-wedlock birthrates, as well as to \n     early divorce. But in Norway, where out-of-wedlock \n     birthrates were lower, religion stronger, and the public \n     opposed same-sex unions, gay marriage had an even greater \n     role in precipitating marital decline.\n       Sweden's position as the world leader in family decline is \n     associated with a weak clergy, and the prominence of secular \n     and left-leaning social scientists. In the post-gay marriage \n     nineties, as Norway's once relatively low out-of-wedlock \n     birthrate was climbing to unprecedented heights, and as the \n     gay marriage controversy weakened and split the once \n     respected Lutheran state church, secular social scientists \n     took center stage.\n       Kari Moxnes, a feminist sociologist specializing in \n     divorce, is one of the most prominent of Norway's newly \n     emerging group of public social scientists. As a scholar who \n     sees both marriage and at-home motherhood as inherently \n     oppressive to women, Moxnes is a proponent of nonmarital \n     cohabitation and parenthood. In 1993, as the Norwegian \n     legislature was debating gay marriage, Moxnes published an \n     article, ``Det tomme ekteskap'' (``Empty Marriage''), in the \n     influential liberal paper Dagbladet. She argued that \n     Norwegian gay marriage was a sign of marriage's growing \n     emptiness, not its strength. Although Moxnes spoke in favor \n     of gay marriage, she treated its creation as a (welcome) \n     death knell for marriage itself. Moxnes identified \n     homosexuals--with their experience in forging relationships \n     unencumbered by children--as social pioneers in the \n     separation of marriage from parenthood. In recognizing \n     homosexual relationships, Moxnes said, society was ratifying \n     the division of marriage from parenthood that had spurred the \n     rise of out-of-wedlock births to begin with.\n       A frequent public presence, Moxnes enjoyed her big moment \n     in 1999, when she was embroiled in a dispute with Valgerd \n     Svarstad Haugland, minister of children and family affairs in \n     Norway's Christian Democrat government. Moxnes had criticized \n     Christian marriage classes for teaching children the \n     importance of wedding vows. This brought a sharp public \n     rebuke from Haugland. Responding to Haugland's criticisms, \n     Moxnes invoked homosexual families as proof that \n     ``relationships'' were now more important than institutional \n     marriage.\n       This is not what proponents of the conservative case for \n     gay marriage had in mind. In Norway, gay marriage has given \n     ammunition to those who wish to put an end to marriage. And \n     the steady rise of Norway's out-of-wedlock birthrate during \n     the nineties proves that the opponents of marriage are \n     succeeding. Nor is Kari Moxnes an isolated case.\n       Months before Moxnes clashed with Haugland, social \n     historian Kari Melby had a very public quarrel with a leader \n     of the Christian Democratic party over the conduct of \n     Norway's energy minister, Marit Arnstad. Arnstad had gotten \n     pregnant in office and had declined to name the father. Melby \n     defended Arnstad, and publicly challenged the claim that \n     children do best with both a mother and a father. In making \n     her case, Melby praised gay parenting, along with voluntary \n     single motherhood, as equally worthy alternatives to the \n     traditional family. So instead of noting that an expectant \n     mother might want to follow the example of marriage that even \n     gays were now setting, Melby invoked homosexual families as \n     proof that a child can do as well with one parent as two.\n       Finally, consider a case that made even more news in \n     Norway, that of handball star Mia Hundvin (yes, handball \n     prowess makes for celebrity in Norway). Hundvin had been in a \n     registered gay partnership with fellow handballer Camilla \n     Andersen. These days, however, having publicly announced \n     her bisexuality, Hundvin is linked with Norwegian \n     snowboarder Terje Haakonsen. Inspired by her time with \n     Haakonsen's son, Hundvin decided to have a child. The \n     father of Hundvin's child may well be Haakonsen, but \n     neither Hundvin nor Haakonsen is saying.\n       Did Hundvin divorce her registered partner before deciding \n     to become a single mother by (probably) her new boyfriend? \n     The story in Norway's premiere paper, Aftenposten, doesn't \n     bother to mention. After noting that Hundvin and Andersen \n     were registered partners, the paper simply says that the two \n     women are no longer ``romantically involved.'' Hundvin has \n     only been with Haakonsen about a year. She obviously decided \n     to become a single mother without bothering to see whether \n     she and Haakonsen might someday marry. Nor has Hundvin \n     appeared to consider that her affection for Haakonsen's child \n     (also apparently born out of wedlock) might better be \n     expressed by marrying Haakonsen and becoming his son's new \n     mother.\n       Certainly, you can chalk up more than a little of this saga \n     to celebrity culture. But celebrity culture is both a product \n     and influencer of the larger culture that gives rise to it. \n     Clearly, the idea of parenthood\n\n[[Page S8006]]\n\n     here has been radically individualized, and utterly detached \n     from marriage. Registered partnerships have reinforced \n     existing trends. The press treats gay partnerships more as \n     relationships than as marriages. The symbolic message of \n     registered partnerships--for social scientists, handball \n     players, and bishops alike-has been that most any \n     nontraditional family is just fine. Gay marriage has served \n     to validate the belief that individual choice trumps family \n     form.\n       The Scandinavian experience rebuts the so-called \n     conservative case for gay marriage in more than one way. \n     Noteworthy, too, is the lack of a movement toward marriage \n     and monogamy among gays. Take-up rates on gay marriage are \n     exceedingly small. Yale's William Eskridge acknowledged this \n     when he reported in 2000 that 2,372 couples had registered \n     after nine years of the Danish law, 674 after four years of \n     the Norwegian law, and 749 after four years of the Swedish \n     law.\n       Danish social theorist Henning Bech and Norwegian \n     sociologist Rune Halvorsen offer excellent accounts of the \n     gay marriage debates in Denmark and Norway. Despite the \n     regnant social liberalism in these countries, proposals to \n     recognize gay unions generated tremendous controversy, and \n     have reshaped the meaning of marriage in the years since. \n     Both Bech and Halvorsen stress that the conservative case for \n     gay marriage, while put forward by a few, was rejected by \n     many in the gay community. Bech, perhaps Scandinavia's most \n     prominent gay thinker, dismisses as an ``implausible'' claim \n     the idea that gay marriage promotes monogamy. He treats the \n     ``conservative case'' as something that served chiefly \n     tactical purposes during a difficult political debate. \n     According to Halvorsen, many of Norway's gays imposed self-\n     censorship during the marriage debate, so as to hide their \n     opposition to marriage itself. The goal of the gay marriage \n     movements in both Norway and Denmark, say Halvorsen and Bech, \n     was not marriage but social approval for homosexuality. \n     Halvorsen suggests that the low numbers of registered gay \n     couples may be understood as a collective protest against the \n     expectations (presumably, monogamy) embodied in marriage.\n       Since liberalizing divorce in the first decades of the \n     twentieth century, the Nordic countries have been the leading \n     edge of marital change. Drawing on the Swedish experience, \n     Kathleen Kiernan, the British demographer, uses a four-stage \n     model by which to gauge a country's movement toward Swedish \n     levels of out-of-wedlock births.\n       In stage one, cohabitation is seen as a deviant or avant-\n     garde practice, and the vast majority of the population \n     produces children within marriage. Italy is at this first \n     stage. In the second stage, cohabitation serves as a testing \n     period before marriage, and is generally a childless phase. \n     Bracketing the problem of underclass single parenthood, \n     America is largely at this second stage. In stage three, \n     cohabitation becomes increasingly acceptable, and parenting \n     is no longer automatically associated with marriage. Norway \n     was at this third stage, but with recent demographic and \n     legal changes has entered stage four. In the fourth stage \n     (Sweden and Denmark), marriage and cohabitation become \n     practically indistinguishable, with many, perhaps even most, \n     children born and raised outside of marriage. According to \n     Kiernan, these stages may vary in duration, yet once a \n     country has reached a stage, return to an earlier phase is \n     unlikely. (She offers no examples of stage reversal.) Yet \n     once a stage has been reached, earlier phases coexist.\n       The forces pushing nations toward the Nordic model are \n     almost universal. True, by preserving legal distinctions \n     between marriage and cohabitation, reining in the welfare \n     state, and preserving at least some traditional values, a \n     given country might forestall or prevent the normalization of \n     nonmarital parenthood. Yet every Western country is \n     susceptible to the pull of the Nordic model. Nor does \n     Catholicism guarantee immunity. Ireland, perhaps because of \n     its geographic, linguistic, and cultural proximity to \n     England, is now suffering from out-of-wedlock birthrates far \n     in excess of the rest of Catholic Europe. Without deeming a \n     shift inevitable, Kiernan openly wonders how long America can \n     resist the pull of stages three and four.\n       Although Sweden leads the world in family decline, the \n     United States is runner-up. Swedes marry less, and bear more \n     children out of wedlock, than any other industrialized \n     nation. But Americans lead the world in single parenthood and \n     divorce. If we bracket the crisis of single parenthood among \n     African-Americans, the picture is somewhat different. Yet \n     even among non-Hispanic whites, the American divorce rate is \n     extremely high by world standards.\n       The American mix of family traditionalism and family \n     instability is unusual. In comparison to Europe, Americans \n     are more religious and more likely to turn to the family than \n     the state for a wide array of needs--from child care, to \n     financial support, to care for the elderly. Yet America's \n     individualism cuts two ways. Our cultural libertarianism \n     protects the family as a bulwark against the state, yet it \n     also breaks individuals loose from the family. The danger we \n     face is a combination of America's divorce rate with \n     unstable, Scandinavian-style out-of-wedlock parenthood. With \n     a growing tendency for cohabiting couples to have children \n     outside of marriage, America is headed in that direction.\n       Young Americans are more likely to favor gay marriage than \n     their elders. That oft-noted fact is directly related to \n     another. Less than half of America's twentysomethings \n     consider it wrong to bear children outside marriage. There is \n     a growing tendency for even middle class cohabiting couples \n     to have children without marrying.\n       Nonetheless, although cohabiting parenthood is growing in \n     America, levels here are still far short of those in Europe. \n     America's situation is not unlike Norway's in the early \n     nineties, with religiosity relatively strong, the out-of-\n     wedlock birthrate still relatively low (yet rising), and the \n     public opposed to gay marriage. If, as in Norway, gay \n     marriage were imposed here by a socially liberal cultural \n     elite, it would likely speed us on the way toward the \n     classic Nordic pattern of less frequent marriage, more \n     frequent out-of-wedlock birth, and skyrocketing family \n     dissolution.\n       In the American context, this would be a disaster. Beyond \n     raising rates of middle class family dissolution, a further \n     separation of marriage from parenthood would reverse the \n     healthy turn away from single-parenting that we have begun to \n     see since, welfare reform. And cross-class family decline \n     would bring intense pressure for a new expansion of the \n     American welfare state.\n       All this is happening in Britain. With the Nordic pattern's \n     spread across Europe, Britain's out-of-wedlock birthrate has \n     risen to 40 percent. Most of that increase is among \n     cohabiting couples. Yet a significant number of out-of-\n     wedlock births in Britain are to lone teenage mothers. This a \n     function of Britain's class divisions. Remember that although \n     the Scandinavian welfare state encourages family dissolution \n     in the long term, in the short term, Scandinavian parents \n     giving birth out of wedlock tend to stay together. But given \n     the presence of a substantial underclass in Britain, the \n     spread of Nordic cohabitation there has sent lone teen \n     parenting rates way up. As Britain's rates of single \n     parenting and family dissolution have grown, so has pressure \n     to expand the welfare state to compensate for economic help \n     that families can no longer provide. But of course, an \n     expansion of the welfare state would only lock the weakening \n     of Britain's family system into place.\n       If America is to avoid being forced into a similar choice, \n     we'll have to resist the separation of marriage from \n     parenthood. Yet even now we are being pushed in the \n     Scandinavian direction. Stimulated by rising rates of \n     unmarried parenthood, the influential American Law Institute \n     (ALI) has proposed a series of legal reforms (``Principles of \n     Family Dissolution'') designed to equalize marriage and \n     cohabitation. Adoption of the ALI principles would be a giant \n     step toward the Scandinavian system.\n       Americans take it for granted that, despite its recent \n     troubles, marriage will always exist. This is a mistake. \n     Marriage is disappearing in Scandinavia, and the forces \n     undermining it there are active throughout the West. Perhaps \n     the most disturbing sign for the future is the collapse of \n     the Scandinavian tendency to marry after the second child. At \n     the start of the nineties, 60 percent of unmarried Norwegian \n     parents who lived together had only one child. By 2001, 56 \n     percent of unmarried, cohabiting parents in Norway had two or \n     more children. This suggests that someday, Scandinavian \n     parents might simply stop getting married altogether, no \n     matter how many children they have.\n       The death of marriage is not inevitable. In a given \n     country, public policy decisions and cultural values could \n     slow, and perhaps halt, the process of marital decline. Nor \n     are we faced with an all-or-nothing choice between the \n     marital system of, say, the 1950s and marriage's \n     disappearance. Kiernan's model posits stopping points. So \n     repealing nofault divorce, or even eliminating premarital \n     cohabitation, are not what's at issue. With nofault divorce, \n     Americans traded away some of the marital stability that \n     protects children to gain more freedom for adults. Yet we can \n     accept that trade-off, while still drawing a line against \n     descent into a Nordic-style system. And cohabitation as a \n     premarital testing phase is not the same as unmarried \n     parenting. Potentially, a line between the two can hold.\n       Developments in the last half-century have surely weakened \n     the links between American marriage and parenthood. Yet to a \n     remarkable degree, Americans still take it for granted that \n     parents should marry. Scandinavia shocks us. Still, who can \n     deny that gay marriage will accustom us to a \n     more Scandinavian-style separation of marriage and \n     parenthood? And with our underclass, the social \n     pathologies this produces in America are bound to be more \n     severe than they already are in wealthy and socially \n     homogeneous Scandinavia.\n       All of these considerations suggest that the gay marriage \n     debate in America is too important to duck. Kiernan maintains \n     that as societies progressively detach marriage from \n     parenthood, stage reversal is impossible. That makes sense. \n     The association between marriage and parenthood is partly a \n     mystique. Disenchanted mystiques cannot be restored on \n     demand.\n       What about a patchwork in which some American states have \n     gay marriage while others do not? A state-by-state patchwork \n     would practically guarantee a shift toward the Nordic family \n     system. Movies and television, which do not respect state \n     borders, would embrace gay marriage. The cultural effects \n     would be national.\n       What about Vermont-style civil unions? Would that be a \n     workable compromise?\n\n[[Page S8007]]\n\n     Clearly not. Scandinavian registered partnerships are \n     Vermont-style civil unions. They are not called marriage, yet \n     resemble marriage in almost every other respect. The key \n     differences are that registered partnerships do not permit \n     adoption or artificial insemination, and cannot be celebrated \n     in state-affiliated churches. These limitations are gradually \n     being repealed. The lesson of the Scandinavian experience is \n     that even de facto same-sex marriage undermines marriage.\n       The Scandinavian example also proves that gay marriage is \n     not interracial marriage in a new guise. The miscegenation \n     analogy was never convincing. There are plenty of reasons to \n     think that, in contrast to race, sexual orientation will have \n     profound effects on marriage. But with Scandinavia, we are \n     well beyond the realm of even educated speculation. The post-\n     gay marriage changes in the Scandinavian family are \n     significant. This is not like the fantasy about interracial \n     birth defects. There is a serious scholarly debate about the \n     spread of the Nordic family pattern. Since gay marriage is a \n     part of that pattern, it needs to be part of that debate.\n       Conservative advocates of gay marriage want to test it in a \n     few states. The implication is that, should the experiment go \n     bad, we can call it off. Yet the effects, even in a few \n     American states, will be neither containable nor revocable. \n     It took about 15 years after the change hit Sweden and \n     Denmark for Norway's out-of-wedlock birthrate to begin to \n     move from ``European'' to ``Nordic'' levels. It took another \n     15 years (and the advent of gay marriage) for Norway's out-\n     of-wedlock birthrate to shoot past even Denmark's. By the \n     time we see the effects of gay marriage in America, it will \n     be too late to do anything about it. Yet we needn't wait that \n     long. In effect, Scandinavia has run our experiment for us. \n     The results are in.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I see we have the Senator from Alabama in \nthe Chamber. I would like to give him an opportunity to address the \nSenate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Presiding Officer and Senator Allard for \nhis leadership on this issue. I am proud to cosponsor this legislation \nwith him.\n  I think a constitutional amendment is appropriate, and I believe it \nis worthy of this Senate to take time to discuss it. I believe it is \nimportant for the American people to understand the danger, the threat \nto marriage as we have known it in this culture and, indeed, as it has \nbeen known for thousands of years. It is endangered by the decisions of \nunelected judges who are not accountable to the public. As a result, it \nis their States rights that are being eroded through this kind of \nactivity.\n  The U.S. Supreme Court, as I discussed in some detail last night, \nthrough the ruling in Lawrence v. Texas has very clearly--\nphilosophically and as a matter of principle--placed marriage as we \nhave known it in jeopardy. Indeed, Justice Scalia predicted, in \ndissent, this is exactly where the Court is headed. It is exactly what \nthe Supreme Court of the United States is going to do. It is going to \nrule consistent with the Supreme Court of Massachusetts. We are on the \nverge of seeing that happen. If they do not do it next year, or even \nthe year after that, that does not mean that marriage as we know it in \nAmerica today is not under threat of a Supreme Court ruling. No one in \nthis body would assert with confidence that the Supreme Court, in light \nof their language in the Lawrence case, is not about to adopt a ruling \nsimilar to that of Massachusetts. So marriage is in jeopardy by the \nU.S. Supreme Court, jeopardy in terms of the way we have defined it \ntraditionally.\n  This is not an act of the people. It is not an act of any \nlegislature. No State or Federal legislative body that has ever sat has \nconcluded this way. None. None has voted for this kind of definition of \nmarriage.\n  I will emphasize, first of all, for those who believe that States \nhave the ability to do something by passing a constitutional amendment \nor a State statute dealing with marriage to affirm traditional \nmarriage, that would be wiped out by one ruling of the U.S. Supreme \nCourt. The U.S. Supreme Court, when it defines the equal protection \nclause of the due process clause of the U.S. Constitution, trumps any \nState law.\n  What we are doing is to protect, defend the rights of the States to \nadopt legislatively the position they have always adopted. I believe it \nis an important national issue, as has been discussed by a number of \nvery fine lawyers.\n  Jon Kyl, yesterday, in his statement--and Senator Kyl has argued \nthree cases before the U.S. Supreme Court--delineated the mess we will \nbe in when people move from State to State with children they have \nadopted. Their relationships are one in one State, another in another \nState. A national definition of marriage is healthy for the country.\n  But I tell you, I would admit, we would not be here if it were not \nfor the courts. We would not be seeking a constitutional amendment. We \nwould not be in this debate had we not been placed in a position where \nthe American people have to stand up and defend their democratic powers \nagainst an activist judiciary.\n  Let me add parenthetically, this is what the debate over judges is \nabout; it has been going on in this Congress for several years now. \nPresident Bush believes in judges who follow the law, not make the law, \njudges who do not believe it is their right and that they have the \npower to impose their personal views on people through their \n``definition'' of the Constitution of the United States.\n  For 200 years plus, we have had an equal protection clause. It is \nonly recently that some judges seem to believe that allows them to \nredefine marriage.\n  That is a stunning activist decision. It is the same kind of decision \nwe have seen on the Pledge of Allegiance, the same kind of decision we \nhave seen on many other issues coming before us today. It would be very \nappropriate that the American people, following the constitutionally \napproved process of a constitutional amendment, would answer that and \nsay what they think about marriage and how it ought to be defined. The \ntruth is that we will be better off with a fundamental definition of \nmarriage nationally. It is important that we do so because of the \naction of the courts.\n  Some say: Well, the American people don't want this. My phones are \nringing off the hook. I don't know about Senator Allard or the \nPresiding Officer. I had my people check. We have had 1,500 calls for \nthis amendment and less than 30 or 40 opposed. The American people are \nconcerned about it, and rightly they should be. Maybe, as with a lot of \nimportant issues that come before the Senate, they are not fully \ninformed of what is happening, and this debate will help them become \nbetter informed. I don't know.\n  My colleague, Senator McCain, suggested that the American people \ndon't support this constitutional amendment. I am just looking at some \nrecent survey data. Here is one from June 23-24, 2004. Do you favor or \noppose a constitutional amendment that defines marriage as a union \nbetween a man and a woman: Favor, 57 percent; opposed, 38 percent. That \nwas New Models survey.\n  Here is one, CBS News-New York Times. Would you favor or oppose an \namendment to the U.S. Constitution that would allow marriage only \nbetween a man and a woman: Favor, 59 percent; opposed, 35 percent. That \nis March of this year.\n  I don't think the American people are fully understanding of just how \nfar the courts have moved and just how much the traditional definition \nof marriage is under attack today. Members of this Congress need to \nthink about that. I don't believe it is going away after this vote. The \nissue will remain alive. The American people are going to continue to \ncontact their legislators because the matter is important. Marriage is \nimportant.\n  Senator Brownback, who does such a good job, has gone into some \ndetail today and yesterday on how we have seen in Europe and \nScandinavia that the adoption of same-sex marriages has furthered the \ndecline in respect for marriage in those countries. And after those \nacts have occurred, we have seen a substantial surge in the number of \nout-of-wedlock births in those countries and the decline of marriage. \nIt is rather dramatic.\n  Just within the last few days, six experts from Scandinavia have \nwritten a letter to other European nations and the United States, I \nsuppose, telling them that they ought to be careful when they start \ntinkering with the traditional definition of marriage. It has serious \nsociological impacts on the life and culture of those countries. It is \ntime for us to back up a little bit.\n  I would also note parenthetically that we have not adopted the \nsocialist model of Europe. Our economy is\n\n[[Page S8008]]\n\nstronger. Our unemployment is less. Our growth rate is higher. Our \neconomy is healthier than Europe. We have not followed their mentality \non national defense and we have the strongest military in the world and \nwe have the strongest capability in the world. So why would we want to \nadopt their ideas about marriage? It would be the wrong thing for us to \ndo.\n  The fact that we have resisted in those areas tells me that we are \nnot on an inevitable decline in marriage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time of the \nmajority has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to speak as \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. We need to think about those issues and consider \nseriously the direction this country intends to take on marriage. That \nis all I am saying. I urge my colleagues to realize this is a \nsignificant vote. What we say indicates what this Nation, what this \nculture thinks about marriage.\n  I am going to talk in a moment about why it is important. But I do \nbelieve it is not disputable that adopting a same-sex marriage culture \nundermines and weakens marriage.\n  We had two articulate African-American leaders speak to a group of us \na few days ago. They pointed out how hard they worked to sustain \nmarriage in their churches and in their communities, how important they \nbelieve it is that there be stable, strong families so that children \ncan be raised in that environment, and how hard they have worked at it \nand how frustrated they are that we would think about changing the \ndefinition of marriage because they are convinced that it would \nundermine the classical marriage relationship.\n  Let me just say one more thing parenthetically. I do not believe this \ndebate should be negative. I do not believe it should put down any \nperson, any group of people who have alternative lifestyles. Our Nation \nallows people to express themselves and live as they choose. I do \nbelieve, however, that it is important for us to have as the marital \nrelationship in our country the ideal relationship of a man and a \nwoman. That is what we have always done, and that is what we ought to \nproceed with now.\n  I do not believe it is appropriate for me to judge someone else's \nbehavior. That is between them and their Lord. One wise thinker talked \nabout the Scriptures. He said: The Scriptures say we should not be \ngreedy, that we should not be violent. The Scriptures say we should not \nbe angry. All of us violate all kinds of values, principles, moral \nrules of behavior that our Creator has set for us. So I am not here to \njudge anybody or condemn anybody. They must live and make their own \njudgments about how to behave. I have certain beliefs about proper \nstandards of behavior, but I am not able to say I am any better than \nanybody else who may or may not fail to act in a proper way.\n  Let's talk about why marriage is important. If we are at a point \nwhere we are convinced that this judicial change could further weaken \nthe institution of marriage, then what impact will that have on the \npeople of this country? What impact will that have on the quality of \nlife and the health and vitality of our next generation of young \npeople?\n  I had the privilege to chair a hearing recently in the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee. It was entitled ``Healthy \nMarriage: What Is It and Why Should We Promote It.'' It was a very \nexcellent hearing. I learned an awful lot.\n  We asked three questions. First, is marriage good? Is it a good \nthing? Second, if marriage is good, should the Government involve \nitself in promoting that good? And finally, significantly, can the \nGovernment make any difference in marriage in a culture?\n  After listening to a distinguished panel of witnesses, I determined \nthat the answer to each of these questions is yes. First, we know that \nmarriage is a social good. Children are more likely to be healthy in \ntwo-parent homes, and there is less government dependence when people \nare in families led by married parents.\n  Second, while government should not be involved in the decision to \nmarry--of course, that is an individual decision--once that decision is \nmade, government should be on the side of supporting marriage, \naffirming marriage, certainly doing nothing to undermine marriage or \nreduce its power, its legitimacy, and its sanctity in society.\n  Government is often on the side of promoting social good. For \nexample, government incentives exist for home ownership. Why? Because \nwe believe home ownership makes for a more stable community. It allows \nfamilies to generate wealth and create wealth and have something to \nlive in in their old age. That is a good goal and we promote it. We \nhave tax breaks for charitable giving because we want to encourage \ncharity. We have government grants, loans, and tax breaks to encourage \npeople to enhance their education. We have government incentives for \npreventive health care.\n  Finally, government can make a difference. Positive examples of \ngovernment involvement in helping marriage include the Oklahoma \nmarriage savers initiative, as former Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating \ntestified at our hearing. The marriage savers community policy is \nsomething we studied carefully. In the community that has a marriage \nsavers policy, it has strengthened marriage.\n  I thought the most dramatic testimony came from Dr. Barbara Dafoe \nWhitehead. I will talk about her testimony in a moment. We also heard \nfrom Roland Warren and Dr. Wade Horn, who testified on a number of \nissues.\n  All right. So if we continue the European model of deemphasizing the \nimportance of classical marriage, defining it down, if we follow that \ndirection and that further undermines marriage in a society, will it \nhurt our society? Will we be diminished by it?\n  Let me share with you some of the facts that have been assembled by \nBarbara Dafoe Whitehead, Ph.D., director of the National Marriage \nProject. Ten years ago, she wrote an article that was voted one of the \nmost significant articles in the second half of the 20th century. The \ntitle was, ``Dan Quayle Was Right.'' It had to do with former Vice \nPresident Dan Quayle's speech in which he questioned the blase way we \ntreat divorce in our society, and he raised aggressively the importance \nof marriage. He was roundly condemned and made fun of at that time. Dr. \nWhitehead later wrote her article. She said she took a lot of \ncriticism. She had criticism from colleges and universities about the \ndata that she had reported from various studies around the country. She \nnoted that she doesn't hear criticism today. Nobody disputes the data. \nNo one disputes that a two-parent traditional family is a healthy, \npositive force for our society. That is why it is perfectly legitimate \nfor any government to provide laws that further that. That is what we \nwant to do.\n  Government has a right to further social institutions, to affirm them \nlegally, those institutions that make their society more healthy. This \nis some of what she said in her statement to the committee:\n\n       On average, married people are happier, \n     healthier, wealthier, enjoy longer lives, and report \n     greater sexual satisfaction than single, divorced, or \n     cohabitating individuals.\n\n  Well, after that, I went home and thanked my wife for putting up with \nme all these years. That is a good affirmation of marriage. There are \nvery few matters that are not encompassed in there that are improved by \nmarriage. She went on to say:\n\n       Married people are less likely to take moral or mortal \n     risk, and are even less inclined to risk-taking when they \n     have children.\n\n  Isn't that a good thing? I think so.\n\n       They have better health habits and receive more regular \n     health care. They are less likely to attempt or to commit \n     suicide. They are more likely to enjoy close and supportive \n     relationships with their close relatives and to have a wider \n     social support network. They are better equipped to cope with \n     life crises, such as severe illness, job loss, and \n     extraordinary care needs of sick children or aging parents.\n\n  Those are things that come from a marriage. She said:\n\n       If family structure had not changed between 1960 and 1998, \n     the black child poverty rate in 1998 would have been 28 \n     percent rather than 45 percent, and the white child poverty \n     rate would have been [less, also].\n       Children experience an estimated 70 percent drop in their \n     household income in the immediate aftermath of divorce and, \n     unless\n\n[[Page S8009]]\n\n     there is a remarriage, the income is still 40 percent to 45 \n     percent lower 6 years later than for children in intact \n     families.\n\n  Mr. President, we know these are statistical numbers. We know many \nfamilies do an extraordinary job outside of the two-parent \nrelationship. Single moms are some of the most courageous people this \ncountry has today. They do a great job in many ways, but it is more \ndifficult. Statistically speaking, we know it is more difficult to be \nas effective.\n  I will add some other things.\n\n       The risk of high school dropout for children from two-\n     parent biological families is substantially less than that \n     for those from single-parent or stepfamilies. Children from \n     married-parent families also have fewer behavioral or school \n     attendance problems and higher levels of educational \n     attainment. They are better able to withstand pressures to \n     engage in early sexual activity and to avoid unwed teen \n     parenthood.\n\n  I think those are important values.\n\n       They are significantly more likely to earn four-year \n     college degrees or better, and to do better occupationally \n     than children from divorced or single-parent families.\n       On average, children reared in married-parent families are \n     less vulnerable to serious emotional illness, depression and \n     suicide than children from non-intact families.\n       Close to 4 out of 10 American children go through a \n     parental divorce.\n       Children from married-parent families have more satisfying \n     dating relationships, more positive attitudes toward future \n     marriage, and greater success in forming lasting marriages. . \n     . . [Y]oung men from married families are less likely to be \n     divorced and more likely to be married. . . . In addition, \n     young men from married-parent households have more positive \n     attitudes toward women, children, and family life than men \n     who grew up in nonintact families.\n       Poverty rates for married couples are half those of \n     cohabitating couple parents and one-third those of \n     noncohabitating single parents in households with other \n     adults.\n\n  The traditional family is a protection against poverty. The numbers \nare indisputable on it. I don't see how we can dispute it. So the \nquestion is, Do we agree that the rulings of the courts that threaten \ntraditional marriage will further a decline and disrespect for \nmarriage? Will it weaken the definition of marriage, reduce its power \nand sanctity and integrity? Is that true? I think it is. If that is so, \nthen that is not good for our culture.\n  If there are not families here to raise children, if there are not \nfamilies here to nurture them, if there are not families to educate \nthem, to hug them at night, to take them to church, or to help them \nwith their homework, or to tell them how to get over their anger and \nforgive people who have wronged them, and to go on and be happy and be \nstrong and courageous and do the right thing, who is going to do that? \nIs it going to be the government, through increased social taxes and \nwelfare, or a secular institution who, by definition, as we have \nlearned in this body, cannot say anything of a spiritual nature in \nterms of raising children? Do they have to be raised by some secular \nState? Are we going to be better off if that occurs? I don't think so.\n\n  I am not talking about partnerships by people who choose to live \ntogether. I am talking about the State definition of marriage. Is that \nimportant for America? I think it is.\n  I see the Senator from Kansas. He eloquently, as I indicated earlier, \ndelineated and explained why the redefinition of marriage guarantees \nthat continual erosion of marriage, and if we erode marriage, we erode \nthis culture, and it will hurt children. It will undermine them and it \nwill undermine our strength as a nation, something any State, any \nnation has a right to be engaged in, and it ought to be engaged in \nthrough its elected representatives, the people they elect, and the \npeople should be able to decide this.\n  I could go on with point after point from Dr. Barbara Dafoe \nWhitehead. Her scientific, indisputable evidence of the dangers we face \nif we think we can blithely go along with the idea that marriage is \nonly what makes people feel good, that marriage is only for adults and \nwhat they feel at the time and what they would like to do at the time.\n  People can do what they like to do--they really can--in this country. \nWe are not putting people in jail for that. But they do not need to \nhave a definition of marriage apply to relationships of that kind. The \nAmerican people have not voted for it. They have never voted for it. \nThey do not favor it now, and I do not believe they are going to vote \nfor it.\n  The question is, Will we allow them, through this constitutional \namendment process, to speak to the unelected judges through the proper \namendment process? Will we block it in the Senate? Or are we going to \nsend it out to the States and let the people have a chance to be heard? \nI think that is what we ought to do. I cannot imagine why we would not \nwant to do that.\n  A lot of people say: I do not believe in same-sex unions, or I \nbelieve marriage ought to be between a man and a woman. It is nice to \nsay that. Why don't you vote for it? Let's have people up here vote for \nit; otherwise, we are facing a very strong likelihood we will continue \nto see the courts erode this historic institution that is so important \nto our culture.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator from Alabama yield for a question?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will be pleased to attempt to answer the question of \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I have been away for a few hours, running around the \nHill, which we tend to do. I want to ask the Senator from Alabama or \nthe Senator from Colorado, has anyone today or in the past 3 days come \nto the floor of the Senate and announced their support for a \nredefinition of traditional marriage?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I am not aware of that.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I am not aware of anybody.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I have not read any article in a publication or heard \nany radio or seen any television show or report thereof where anyone in \nthis Chamber has said anything but that they support the definition of \ntraditional marriage.\n  Mr. President, do my colleagues have any comments?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I think the Senator from Pennsylvania is exactly \ncorrect.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Yet we have heard on the floor today, have we not, that \nthose of us who support a definition with which they agree, that \nMembers who have criticized us for offering this, are intolerant, \nhateful, and gay bashers for proposing language which they say they \nsupport; is that an accurate description of what has gone on here \ntoday?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I have not been here throughout the day. I have not \nheard all of those charges made, but it does seem close to what I have \nbeen reading and hearing; yes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, does the Senator from Colorado wish to \ncomment on Members who oppose this constitutional amendment yet support \nthe language of it, which I find to be somewhat remarkable, but they \nsupport the definition of traditional marriage and have stated so, yet \naccuse those of us who would like to put it in law, in a constitutional \namendment, as being purveyors of hate and intolerance; is that not what \nhas happened today on the floor of the Senate?\n  Mr. ALLARD. To respond to the question of the Senator from \nPennsylvania, I think there has been some attempt to try to make that \ncase today on the floor. As the lead sponsor of this particular \namendment, it does not hold any water for me because, as was reported \nin the papers, I have had individuals work for me who profess to the \nfact that they are homosexual, and despite that, I recognize publicly \nthat they have done a great job in my office. I have even presented an \naward to one of those individuals so he would have a scholarship to go \nto school and further his education.\n  So anybody who tries to make a case as far as this individual is \nconcerned of animus in their debate, somehow there is animosity, it \nwill not hold water. In fact, what this issue is about, No. 1, is any \nindividual who wants to profess a lifestyle that incorporates same-sex \nmarriage, that is their personal decision, but the debate is they \nsimply do not have a right to change the definition of marriage, and \nthat is what this debate is all about.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I would like to pick up on what the Senator from \nColorado said, which is, I know in my office, we have provisions in our \noffice manual which actually prohibit any discrimination on the basis \nof race, sex, national origin, or sexual preference. We have those \nprovisions in our office manual. And we do not discriminate in hiring.\n  I believe people can make contributions and should make contributions\n\n[[Page S8010]]\n\nand should be able to contribute to our society, particularly here on \nthe Hill. I know, as has been reported widely in the press, there are a \nlot of people in this category on both sides of the aisle who are \nhomosexuals who make great contributions to this Chamber. No one wants \nto deny them their ability to live out their dreams. But as I think the \nSenator from Colorado said, it is important for us to understand that \nthis debate is not about limiting anybody's choices, except children, \nbecause that is really what this debate is about.\n  If we change the definition of marriage, we end up limiting the \nchoices of children and having the right to have a mother or father. I \nknow this is on the time of the Senator from Alabama. I wanted to make \nsure I had not missed anything.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. No, I think the Senator made a very critical point, and \nthat is there is no room to suggest that those of us who read the \nSupreme Court opinion of the United States, who watch what is happening \nin Massachusetts, who have seen what is happening in other places \naround the country, actions that are contrary to the will of the people \nof the United States of America through their elected representatives--\nand people say--they agree with the people. People indicate they are \nsupportive of where the people are. So how can they condemn an \namendment that Senator Allard has worked on that simply affirms the \ntraditional definition of marriage that they say they support?\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, will the Senator from Alabama yield for \nanother question?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will be pleased to yield.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. If I can ask the Senator from Alabama, it seems to me \nthat we have been discussing for at least 2 years, maybe 5 years now, \nways to strengthen marriage in America. I believe the Senator supported \nthe elimination of the marriage tax penalty. We have had huge debates \nabout that marriage tax penalty, the whole issue being, how can we \nstrengthen marriage and why do we want to do that. Because it is the \nbest place to raise children and the Government has a great interest in \nit.\n  We just embarked, I believe, on a welfare debate where we were \ndebating the issue within welfare and trying to encourage marriage \namongst people on public assistance because it raises them out of \npoverty and helps children; is that correct, we have been debating \nthose two issues as ways to strengthen marriage?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The Senator is absolutely correct. Dr. Wade Horn, from \nthe Department of Health and Human Services, who testified before my \ncommittee, says that any welfare reform we pass must help strengthen \nmarriage because without marriage, poverty is increased.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Then it seems questionable to me, if we have done \nthese sort of things, we have invested billions of dollars to try to \nstrengthen marriage, we are doing away with the marriage penalty tax \nbecause we want to encourage marriage because that is good for children \nand good for America, and we are trying to encourage marriage in the \nwelfare reform bill because it is good for children and good for people \nin poverty to lift them out of poverty, and the Senator was citing \nthat, then why would we allow the courts to redefine marriage to \ninclude same-sex unions where we know in case study after case study \nthat weakens the institution of marriage, that hurts the creation of \nstrong, vital marriages, and it is defining marriage downward? Why \nwould we do something that is so counter to what we have been trying to \nchange over the past several years by making promarriage policies and \nwe would now do something that is antimarriage and against the \nchildren?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I could not agree with the Senator more. Why would we \ndo this? I think most Senators who are elected to this Senate have \ncampaigned on and heard from their constituents a growing concern and \nunease about some of the cultural trends we are seeing, particularly in \nfamily and values in the family. All of us have said we are going to do \nsomething about it. We need to strengthen family and not undermine it. \nI believe this is a step downwards.\n  I know the Senator was an admirer, as I have been, of former Senator \nDaniel Patrick Moynihan, a great scholar, a man who studied social \npolicy in depth as a professor, as a Cabinet member, and as a Senator. \nThe Senator stated the other day how important that Democratic Senator \nfrom New York felt about marriage. If the Senator recalls those words, \nit would be important for us to hear them again.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I worked with him on a number of issues, and he was a \ngreat study of culture. He actually said the central conservative truth \nis that culture is more important than government. What culture honors \nand what it does not honor, what it upholds, what it says is good, and \nwhat it says is wrong is more important than the government around it. \nHe was saying actually that the central role of government at all \nlevels should be to see that children are born and remain in intact \nfamilies. This was his comment. He was saying that because that is the \ncentral foundational character of building the institution that we \nhave. It is not government. Government is important. It provides a \nnumber of very useful functions, but it is not the central entity. It \nis that family basis that builds the strong citizenry, strong people.\n  As a cultural commentator, he saw that. As a matter of fact, he \nnearly lost his job in the 1960s by commenting about the disintegration \nof the American family in a particular ethnic group at that time, but \nhe was just saying that if that family unit is ruined, it goes downhill \nand has an effect on the children. That is why he felt so strongly \nabout it and why I feel so strongly about it. In looking at these \ncultural indicators, we need to do everything we can to help this \ninstitution that is in trouble.\n  Marriage is in trouble in America. I have a chart that I will quickly \nshare with my colleagues to show the type of trouble we are in.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I yield the floor to the Senator from \nKansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, to make this point, and I will not \nbelabor it with my colleagues who want to speak, but I want to show the \nportion of children entering broken families has more than quadrupled \nsince 1950. I think a lot of us in this room were born in the 1950s. We \ncan see on this chart the children born out of wedlock and as parents \nare divorced in 1950 is about 12 percent or so. Going to the year 2000, \nit is up to about 55 percent. The reason that is problematic is we know \nchildren operate and function best in a family with a mom and a dad and \na low-conflict union. We know that marriage is incredibly important to \nthe formation of these children for the next generation. That does not \nmean they cannot succeed in this type of setting. They can, and many \ndo. It just means the odds are tougher. It is more difficult for them.\n  Now if we take this institution of marriage that is already having \ndifficulty, already is having trouble staying together, and say to it \nbasically we are going to define it differently now than we have \nthrough 5,000 years of human existence--and the reason it has been \ndefined this way for 5,000 years of human existence is there is a \nnatural order to us. We know that marriage is between a man and a \nwoman. It is written in our hearts. We understand that. A law does not \nhave to be written on it; it is in the natural order of mankind. If we \nstart telling people by the law, and the law is a teacher, no, it is \nnot really that, it can be any sort of union one wants: It can be two \nmen, it can be two women, then it starts to further make difficult this \nsituation and it further erodes the marital union. That is the problem.\n  This is not about same-sex marriage. This is about kids. This is \nabout a 5,000-year-old institution that has served society throughout \nhistory, and it is being redefined in a way that goes against what we \nunderstand it is in our hearts. This is harmful, and we know that from \nother countries that have engaged in it.\n  This is going the wrong way, and it is against clear public policy \ntrends that we have engaged in in this body. It is even against what \neverybody in this body says. Everybody in this body says they are for \ntraditional marriage between a man and a woman. So if they are, then \nvote that way and stand up for it instead of further harming these\n\n[[Page S8011]]\n\ntrendlines of an institution that is vitally important. We should not \ndo that.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Will the Senator from Kansas yield for a question?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Yes, I would be happy to.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I have always felt that marriage was the fundamental \nbuilding block of any society, and especially if one is talking about a \ndemocracy like we have in the United States. I have always been of the \nview that as long as there is a good basis for families to function, \nthat means there would be less need for government, and there would be \nfewer programs. That has always had a particular appeal to me because I \ndo not believe we need more government; I believe we need less \ngovernment.\n  I have always felt that there is definitely a role for a mother and a \nfather and a husband and a wife, and that the culture that promotes the \nbasic fundamental unit where they teach their children about the future \nbased on their experiences in life is something that is very difficult \nto supplant as an effective unit, and I think historically over \nthousands of years that has proven true. We are on the verge of \nredefining marriage which will put this basic unit that is so \nfundamental to society at risk. Would the Senator from Kansas agree \nwith that?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I could not agree more. Since I have been in the \nSenate, I have been one who has spoken out about the cultural problems \nthat we have had and that we are in. If we take an already weakened \ninstitution--that is, the central basis by which we have values that we \npass on to the next generation the lessons learned from the prior \ngeneration, where there are people who care and are in a bonded \nrelationship that is there for life--if that is further eroded by \nteaching through the law that it can be any sort of arrangement one \nwants it to be and it is about how people care for each other, if they \nhave love for each other, and not about the next generation or building \nthat family and building children for the next generation, we really \nare moving ourselves into a terrain we have not seen in human history. \nWhat we see taking place now says it takes us in the wrong direction.\n  We know that clearly from the Netherlands and we know that from their \nscholars now who are saying they have to figure some way to try to \nagain instill traditional marriage because people are walking away from \nit. There are counties in Norway where 80 percent of the children are \nborn out of wedlock because you have defined away that marriage \ninstitution and you have said it is not a sacred institution, it is a \ncivil rights institution, and it can be any arrangement you want. It \nweakens a fundamental institution we need for this country to be strong \nin the future.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I would like to thank the Senator from Kansas for his \nleadership. He has become recognized as a strong proponent of families \nand proponent for children. I, for one, appreciate his leadership in \nthe Senate.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank my colleague and yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield for two brief questions? One is, \nas you discussed and I attempted to discuss, isn't it valid and doesn't \na government have a rational basis to affirm traditional marriage? \nIsn't there evidence, based on the data we have heard and seen, that \nthere is a rational, foundational basis for a government to affirm the \ntraditional marriage as opposed to other relationships in society?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. There is not only a rational basis as the legal \nargument would have it, there is a moral imperative to do so. If you \nwant a strong citizenry in the future, raised in a situation that is \noptimal--a mom and a dad bonded together for life, in a low-conflict \nunion--if you want an optimal setting for most of your citizenry, you \nare obligated to push this union in a setting and to say, in speaking \nto the society, this is where we need the children raised. This is the \noptimal setting. This is the place.\n  Not that everybody will achieve the optimal. They clearly will not. \nAll families in this country, mine included, have had difficulties in \nthis area. There is no question about that. But if you remove the \noptimal and say it is too hard, we can't get there, and let's give up, \nit is a sure way to pave the road down. We know that from other \ncountries' experience.\n  It is not only a rational basis, a legal argument, I would say it is \na moral imperative as a government official that you press as much as \nyou can to have children raised in this optimal setting.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I couldn't agree with you more. You stated it so well.\n  I do not want to demean or speak down about any relationship or any \npersons and the choices they make. But let's say this. Statistically \nspeaking, do fathers and mothers both make different contributions to \nthe health and development of a child?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Obviously we know that from the social data. I have \ncharts I have gone through previously that show that each contributes \ndifferently to the makeup and the nature of that child and making a \nhealthy, well-rounded child. We know that from the social data.\n  But there is another argument that I think is actually more powerful. \nWe know that in our hearts. We know that from the time we have come up \nin this society. We know that from 6,000 years of human history. That \nis one of those things that, again, is written on the heart of man, \nthat you know this is the way it is to be.\n\n  Even when you talk with people today who are raising children in a \nsingle-parent household, by and large virtually all of them wish what \nthey had was a mom and a dad here in a bonded relationship who love \neach other and care for each other, that recognize divine authority in \ntheir lives and that pass on to that next generation the hope and their \nlove and the yearning for yet a better era coming forward.\n  That is what we all want. It is not by accident or even by social \nprogramming that we want that. That is written on our hearts. All of \nour colleagues would agree with that. I think we should recognize the \ntruth of that and not say that may be written on your hearts but that \nwas programmed when you were a kid growing up in Parker, KS, and this \nis different. This is there. It is there for a reason. It is there \nbecause it is best for the kids.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, we have been hearing the point that there \nis no threat and we are being somewhat paranoid about this issue. But I \nhave a summary here of the court actions that have been brought up in \nthe various States throughout this country. I am amazed, frankly \nflabbergasted, at the number of cases that have been brought before the \nvarious State courts and in some cases the Federal court. I thought I \nwould take a moment to go through some of these cases. I think once you \nhave seen the whole litany of cases here you begin to understand there \nis an organized, concerted effort starting at the State courts and then \neventually moving into the Federal courts and hopefully, by those who \nsupport same-sex marriage, to the U.S. Supreme Court for a favored \nruling. I will start with Alabama.\n  This case has been recently dismissed as of April. They had two men \nin an Alabama State prison who sued the State for the right to marry \neach other. They said they had a Federal constitutional right to \nmarriage. As I mentioned, this case was dismissed.\n  In Alaska, there is an interesting case, a case pending currently in \nthe State supreme court. The ACLU has sued to prevent Alaska from \ngranting benefits to married couples if the State does not provide the \nsame benefits to same-sex couples. This case has been argued in the \nAlaska Supreme Court and could be decided any day.\n  In Arizona, again the State supreme court has refused to hear a case \nbrought there where two men were denied a marriage license and sued in \nState court. They lost in the district court on their first appeal and \ncuriously the gay rights groups tried to talk them out of pursuing \ntheir case because it interfered with the group's national litigation \nstrategy. Let me repeat this. Gay rights groups tried to talk them out \nof pursuing their case because it interfered with the group's national \nlitigation strategy. On May 25 of this year, the Arizona Supreme Court \nrefused to hear their appeal which should bring this particular \nlitigation to an end.\n\n  In the State of California, we have a number of pending cases. That \nis probably not a surprise to anybody here on\n\n[[Page S8012]]\n\nthe floor. There is a case pending in the State supreme court about San \nFrancisco's mayor who defied State law and began issuing marriage \nlicenses to same-sex couples in February of this year. They made a \ncourt case about it. The States refused to register the marriages and \nsame-sex couples from 46 States received licenses while San Francisco \nwas issuing licenses. Several lawsuits were filed to challenge San \nFrancisco's action. They are now consolidated in the California Supreme \nCourt. The State of California is defending its traditional marriage \nlaws and the statewide initiative that passed with 60 percent of the \nvote in 2000. Again, a decision is expected on that particular case.\n  I would like to correct the record. I think one of the colleagues \nmade the statement that there are no Federal court challenges to DOMA, \nthe Defense of Marriage Act. Actually, in Florida there is a Federal \ncourt challenge to DOMA, or the Defense of Marriage Act. A private \nattorney announced on the 11th of this month that he would soon file a \nFederal lawsuit challenging the DOMA law. The lawsuit is expected to be \nfiled as we move forward.\n  We have two separate cases pending in State trial court in Florida. \nTwo cases have been filed in the State trial court challenging \nFlorida's traditional marriage laws. Again, this first case is a class \naction filed in Broward County by a private attorney. Later it was \nfiled in Key West by the National Center for Lesbian Rights.\n  It was interesting to get the public reaction when the private \nattorney talked about filing his Federal lawsuit in Florida with the \nFederal court challenge, and the reaction from those groups supporting \nsame-sex marriage. They didn't want him to file that because they felt \nit would bring it too quickly to the U.S. Supreme Court and they would \nnot be prepared in order to make the case in front of the Supreme \nCourt. I thought that was an interesting reaction in the public media \nwhen that case was talked about being filed.\n  In Georgia, there was a case seeking recognition of a Vermont civil \nunion, which was rejected by Georgia's State court. In Burns v. Burns, \nthe parties sought to have a Vermont civil union treated as a legal \nmarriage in Georgia and the trial court and court of appeals refused to \ntreat a Vermont civil union as a marriage and the Georgia Supreme Court \ndeclined to review the case.\n  In Indiana, there is a case pending in the Indiana Court of Appeals. \nThree same-sex couples sued in Marion County Superior Court for the \nright to marry under the Constitution.\n  This case was dismissed and is now on appeal to the intermediate \nState appeals court. This case is Morrison v. Sadler.\n  In Iowa, there is a same-sex divorce case that was dismissed. Two \nwomen entered into a civil union in Vermont and later asked an Iowa \ntrial court to grant them a divorce.\n  They are coming at this from various angles.\n  In December 2003, the Iowa court initially granted the divorce, but \nafter his action was challenged because Iowa did not recognize same-sex \nmarriage in Vermont civil unions, the judge reworked the order dividing \nthe couple's property. The civil union was not recognized.\n  In Maryland, a lawsuit was filed July 7 of 2004. The ACLU filed a \nlawsuit in State court demanding the State grant marriage licenses to \nsame-sex couples.\n  In Massachusetts, activists announced on June 16, 2004, that they \nwould challenge in court the 1913 Massachusetts law that prevents same-\nsex marriage to out-of-State couples. I believe that case was filed \ntoday.\n  In Montana, there is a case pending in State supreme court. The \nMontana chapter of the ACLU sued on behalf of two lesbian employees of \nthe Montana State University system challenging that the State \ndiscriminates against gay and lesbian employees by giving spousal \nbenefits only to married couples. The trial court dismissed the case in \nNovember of 2002 and the case is now pending on appeal before the \nMontana Supreme Court. This case is called Snetsinger v. Board of \nRegents.\n  In Nebraska, there is an interesting Federal case. There is a Federal \ncase pending in Federal District Court. The ACLU has filed suit to \nchallenge a State constitutional amendment that defines marriage as man \nand woman and bars civil unions or domestic partnerships. They went \nmuch further than what my amendment provides. The ACLU argued that the \nState constitutional amendment violates the U.S. Supreme Court's \ndecision in Romer v. Evans. In a preliminary ruling, the Federal \ndistrict judge indicated sympathy with the ACLU claim and the Nebraska \nattorney general Jon Bruning told the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on \nthe Constitution that he expects Nebraska to lose the case. This is the \nconstitutional amendment in Nebraska that was passed with 70 percent of \nthe voters in Nebraska. I think this has all sorts of implications. It \nhas been filed in the district court.\n  There is a case in New Jersey pending in the State court of appeals. \nIn 2002, Lambda Legal filed a suit in State court on behalf of same-sex \ncouples seeking to marry. The State district court dismissed their case \nand Lambda has appealed to the intermediate State appeals court. The \ncase is called Lewis v. Harris. The town of New Asbury, NJ has \nannounced that it will file amicus briefs in support of the same-sex \ncouples.\n  In New Mexico, there is a case pending in State trial court. The \nSandoval County clerk issued marriage licenses to same-sex couples in \nFebruary of 2004. The New Mexico Supreme Court has agreed to hear \narguments regarding the issuing of marriage licenses to same-sex \ncouples in Sandoval County. It is unclear if the court will decide the \ncase this summer or fall, or if the decision will be delayed until \n2005.\n  In New York, there is a case pending in State trial court in March \nand April of 2004. The ACLU and Lambda Legal each filed lawsuits \narguing that to deny same-sex couples the right to marry one another \nviolates the New York Constitution.\n\n  In North Carolina, a case was withdrawn by a same-sex couple. In \nMarch 2004, they were denied a marriage license by Durham County, NC. \nSo they filed a lawsuit.\n  In Oklahoma, the State ballot initiative may be challenged. The ACLU \nis threatening to challenge a November 2004 ballot.\n  In Oregon, there is a case on appeal to the State intermediate court \nin Multnomah County, which includes Portland, which began issuing \nmarriage licenses to same-sex couples in February of 2004. More than \n3,000 marriage licenses were issued. On April 20, the State trial court \nruled the marriage licenses conducted over the past 2 months were legal \nand that Oregon must register the marriages as valid. The State court \nof appeals stayed the lower court's order requiring the State to \nrecognize the 3,022 marriage licenses of same-sex couples in the \nPortland area.\n  In Pennsylvania, a lawsuit has been threatened after a same-sex \ncouple was denied a marriage license.\n  In Rhode Island, the State attorney general stated on May 17 that he \ninterpreted Rhode Island law to require recognition of Massachusetts \nsame-sex marriages.\n  In Tennessee, the Associated Press reported a same-sex couple was \nplanning to file a lawsuit.\n  In Texas, a same-sex divorce case was dismissed there.\n  In Virginia and Washington, there are three cases pending in State \ntrial court.\n  In West Virginia, we have a case dismissed by the supreme court with \na possible review by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  This gives an overview of the amount of lawsuits that have been filed \nthroughout this country in trying to establish a case in certain venues \nthat could be appealed to a higher court.\n  This is an organized effort. I think when you look at the cases that \nhave been filed in the various courts, it is hard to say marriage \nshouldn't be protected. Marriage is under assault. That is why it is \nimportant that we move forward with this particular piece of \nlegislation because, as has been stated time and time again here on the \nfloor of the Senate, when you look at the Goodridge case and the \nLawrence v. Texas case, and then the Constitution as it applies between \nthe interaction between States and comments from members of the U.S. \nSupreme Court, there is definitely a threat to traditional marriage.\n  My hope is we can get this passed, get it through the House, and get \nit before the people of America so they can\n\n[[Page S8013]]\n\nhelp decide this issue. If they are successful, then it means the \ncourts will not have defined marriage. The American people will have \nhad an opportunity to enter into this debate. With this particular \namendment before us, through their elected representatives the American \npeople will have an opportunity to have their voice heard in the \nSenate. It was brought up in the House. As they will read it in the \npapers this fall, later on people will have an opportunity to express \ntheir views through the Members in the U.S. House of Representatives. \nThen at some point in time, if we get enough votes--a two-thirds vote \nin both the House and Senate--then it goes to the States and three-\nquarters of the States ratify it, then this means it is debated in the \nlegislatures and the American people will have an opportunity to again \nmake their views known about how they feel about protecting marriage.\n  This was put in place by our Founders because ultimately they did not \nwant to have the courts to have the final say on issues where there was \na large percentage of the population in America who felt they would \nhave an opportunity to address this issue through a constitutional \namendment.\n  This is something that has been laid out by our Founders. I think it \nis time we have this amendment before us now for debate.\n  Let me make one additional comment. In the Oregon State Court of \nAppeals, they decided this week that the State must enroll the \nmarriages, which would be to recognize marriages.\n  This issue is moving forward. I am pleased about the amount of \nsupport we have had from Members of the Senate coming forward and \nexpressing their support. I thank them for that. I thank them for the \nleadership of the Senator from Pennsylvania and the Senator from \nKansas. I thank the Senator from Alabama for his support. Without them, \nI think a good deal of the substance of this debate would have been \nmissed. I appreciate their effort and dedication to the family.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I return the thanks to the Senator from \nColorado for his willingness to step forward and introduce this \nlegislation. He has carried it with a firmness of purpose and a gentle \ntouch, which is his way, in the way of bringing this issue squarely to \nthe Senate before the American public. He is to be congratulated.\n  The leader is in the Senate. I thank him for agreeing to bring this \nbill before the Senate, to have a vote on this constitutional amendment \nin the Senate, and to have this first public debate about the \ninstitution of marriage and the attempt to redefine that institution by \nthe courts.\n  If I can, I want to start from scratch to answer the question that \nmany have offered today on the other side of the aisle, which is, Why \nare we here?\n  Some have suggested we are here because we hate certain people. Some \nsuggest we are here because we are politically motivated to try to \nrally troops before the election. Some suggest we are here because we \nwant to change the subject to something other than what we have been \ndebating for the last several months in the Senate.\n  We suggest we are here because we want to preserve an institution \nthat has served civilization well for 5,000 years. While that \ninstitution has been shaken, that institution has fissures in the \nfoundation; it is still an institution worth preserving. It is an \ninstitution worth rebuilding. It is an institution worth fixing the \ncracks in that foundation. It is an institution worth shoring up and \nstrengthening that foundation.\n  It is not an institution that we need to say, because it is broken, \nbecause the institution of marriage is not what it once was--I think \neveryone will accept in this body, those who are fighting for \ntraditional marriage, will say no, the institution of marriage is not \nwhat it once was. It certainly has been the glue that has held the \nfamily together. Every culture, every civilization known to man, has \nhad an institution of marriage of some bright, ritual symbol that has \nshown the monogamous bond between a man and a woman. Why? For the \npurpose of continuing on that civilization and a recognition that \nchildren need moms and dads and moms and dads who are in committed \nrelationships is the ideal.\n  I look at my kids. I am blessed to have seven children, six of which \nwe are raising. I know my children feel safer, feel more secure, more \nconfident, knowing their mom and dad are there and are supportive and \nloving.\n  There are lots of people in our society who were raised by single \nparents who feel that love and support from that single parent. Those \nsingle parents in many cases do extraordinary jobs. But even if you \ntalk to single parents and kids raised by single parents and you ask \nthem, wouldn't it have been better, the ideal, if mom and dad were \njoined together in a healthy marriage, raising you in a safe and secure \nand stable home? The answer is, invariably, yes.\n  What we are here to debate is not an abstract concept of what \nmarriage is or what it should be, but it is a real social benefit. I \ncannot think of anything more we can do--and the Senator from Kansas \ntalked about this--there is nothing more we have focused in on in the \nlast several years than trying to shore up and affirm marriage. Whether \nit is the marriage penalty or the marriage initiative the President put \nforward in the welfare bill, the idea from all the social science data \nis there are enormous benefits to marriage.\n\n  We had a hearing in the Finance Committee, on which I serve. The \nhearing brought forth witnesses from the left and right. We asked them \na series of questions about marriage and its benefits. There was a \nwoman representing the Democratic side of the aisle. She made the \nargument that raising children by parents in an alternative form is \njust as good as being raised by a mother and a father in a loving, \nstable relationship. That argument is over. Yes, it can happen, but it \nis not the ideal. It is not best for children across the board.\n  The children do better in school. They have less dropouts, fewer \nemotional and behavioral problems, less substance abuse, less abuse and \nneglect, less criminal activity, less early sexual activities, and \nfewer out-of-wedlock births. And more. The evidence presented was \ndumped on us overwhelming, the benefits of marriage, irrespective of \nsocial or economic condition, the benefits of having a mother and a \nfather contributing their unique nature to the nature of that child.\n  The evidence is in. The jury is in. Marriage is good. Marriage is a \npublic-policy-desirable goal. Why? Because it benefits children but it \nalso benefits mothers and fathers.\n  I read yesterday, and I will repeat today, a listing of five things \nin the sense of the purpose of marriage, what it does to benefit the \nculture.\n  No. 1, the bonding between men and women that ensures their \ncooperation for the common good.\n  By the way, this article was written by two professors in Canada, a \nwoman professor who is straight and a homosexual man. They wrote this \narticle in support of traditional marriage in opposition to a \nredefinition of traditional marriage to include same-sex couples. They \ndid so based purely on sociological data, on psychological data, on the \noverwhelming evidence of the public good of traditional marriage.\n  No. 1, I mentioned, the important bond between men and women.\n  No. 2, the birth and rearing of children, at least to the extent \nnecessary for preserving and fostering society and culturally approved \nways.\n  No. 3, bonding between men and children so men are likely to become \nactive participants in family life.\n  I will stop to focus on that for a minute. We have an initiative in \nthe President's welfare bill, the Father's Initiative, that Senator \nBayh and I have championed, responsible fatherhood. Why? Because in our \nculture today there are crosscurrents about what fatherhood means. In \ncertain subcultures, fatherhood means having children, period. What are \nthe effects in that subculture of the role of the father being simply \nbiological and nothing more?\n  When fathers are absent versus when fathers are involved: Fathers \nabsent, two times more likely to abuse drugs; fathers absent, two times \nmore likely to be abused; two times more likely to become involved in a \ncrime; fathers absent, three times more likely to fail in school; three \ntimes more likely to commit suicide; and five times more likely to be \nin poverty.\n  The evidence is in. There is a role for society to encourage fathers \nto be more\n\n[[Page S8014]]\n\nthan biological fathers, but to be involved in the rearing of that \nchild, preferably in a committed relationship with the mother. These \nnumbers all go up if you have committed, stable, low-conflict \nrelationships between the mother and the father.\n\n  So there is a role for government, as a public policy, for the \nbenefit of children and the community in which they live because these \nchildren just do not, through this activity, affect themselves, do \nthey? No, no. When they commit crimes or when they abuse drugs or when \nthey commit suicide or when they live in poverty, that does not just \nstay with them. So there is a real public policy objective in promoting \nstable marriages and fatherhood.\n  No. 4, some healthy form of masculine identity. What does that mean? \nWell, they go on--which is based on the need for at least one \ndistinctive, necessary, and publicly valued contribution to society. It \nis especially important today because two other cross-definitions of \n``manhood,'' which is the definition of manhood being ``provider'' and \n``protector,'' are no longer distinctive now that women have assumed \nthose roles in society.\n  So what are they saying here? They are saying that men have an \nidentity crisis. The traditional role of the man is no longer the \ntraditional role of the man. You say: Well, what's the big deal? \nEverybody is equal.\n  When you rob someone of a role they believe they have, as society in \nsome degree has, then you have a belief among large segments of society \nthat they have no role; they do not have to provide; they do not have \nto protect; they do not have to nurture. That is not the role anymore \nfor men in society. It simply is to pursue selfish goals, but they are \nnot needed anymore.\n  We can all go back about the genesis of this and the movement that \ncaused it, but the bottom line is, it is real, and it is reflected in \nthese numbers. So it is important for society to say to men that \nmarriage is good and expected and is healthy and is optimal, and to \nhave laws that say that dropping specimens off at a sperm bank is not \nfatherhood, but committed relationships with the mother of your \nchildren in a marriage that gives you and her and your children \nsecurity is expected.\n  Now, I know there are a lot of cultures that do not support that, \nsubcultures in America, but the legal, statutory reflection of the \nculture should be that ideal. Our laws should reflect the ideal of what \nis best for that man, for that woman, and for those children.\n  No. 5, the transformation of adolescents into sexually responsible \nadults; that is, young men and women who are ready for marriage and to \nbegin a new cycle. This relates the key contributions that men and \nwomen make to the upbringing of young men and young women.\n  As the father of boys and girls, I make different contributions as a \nfather to my girls than I do to my boys. They look at me different. I \nam different in their minds, and I represent different things that will \nhave an effect on them in their ability to have successful \nrelationships in the future. That is real.\n  Now, we can all play games that people can substitute, that it does \nnot matter whether it is two men or two women or one man or one woman \nor no women or no men or whatever, but the fact is, there is a \ndifference. We tend to try to deny that. It is politically correct to \nsay there is not a difference, but the fact is that fathers and \nmothers contribute different things to children.\n\n  So why did I go through all this? It is important to understand what \nwe are talking about here is very important, and what is being talked \nabout in the courts across America is destroying this very important \ninstitution to the American society--to any society.\n  Now, some have suggested this is not a real assault, that it is \ntrumped up for political purposes. Two of the speakers, remarkably--\nSenator Clinton and Senator Dayton--both of them said--I will quote \nSenator Clinton where she says: The Defense of Marriage Act, known as \nDOMA, has not even been challenged at the Federal level. That is a \nquote from her statement today. For the record, false. False. Senator \nDayton made a similar comment. I think others have made similar \ncomments, except I have the transcripts of these two Senators. False. I \nsubmit for the record that there are pleadings in Florida and pleadings \nin Washington State challenging the constitutionality of the Defense of \nMarriage Act.\n  So the idea that the Defense of Marriage Act is not under assault is \nnot true. The Senator from Colorado a few minutes ago laid out the \nState-by-State challenges that are going on, some with respect to the \nMassachusetts marriages, some with respect to the Oregon marriages, \nsome with respect to the New York marriages, some with respect to the \nCalifornia marriages, and we go on and on. And there will be more.\n  I think there are challenges in 46 States to traditional marriage as \nbeing unconstitutional. So to suggest that 46 States--whether it is \ncivil unions or marriages--are being challenged by same-sex couples or \nwhether it is two States where the Defense of Marriage Act is being \nchallenged, that somehow or other that is not a serious threat when one \nState has already determined that there is a constitutional basis, and \nin writing the decision referred to a U.S. Supreme Court case decided \nlast year--Lawrence v. Texas--in making the determination that you \ncould not discriminate against same-sex couples with respect to \nmarriage, and we do not believe here that this is a serious assault? \nWhat do we need? Do we need all the States and the Supreme Court to \ndecide this issue, and then we say: OK, now we decide. Well, the \nSenator from New York said her father used to refer to it as closing \nthe barn door after the horse has left.\n  By the way, this is a remarkably similar strategy to that which was \nused in the 1950s and 1960s with respect to the issue of abortion. What \nhappened in that case was a little different. Instead of the courts \nimposing abortion on the States--although that may have been done; I am \njust not aware of, maybe as well as I should be, the history--but I do \nknow certain legislatures throughout the country began changing the \nstatutes with respect to abortion, which, of course, 50, 60 years ago \nwas basically illegal in every State in the country. Over time, just a \nfew States changed their law. This created conflicts between the States \nas to how they were going to deal with this issue.\n  The same thing is happening here State by State. At a minimum, there \nwill be more States because there are certainly a lot of liberal \njustices of supreme courts in the various States around the country. \nThere will be more States that will ``find'' this constitutional right \neither within the Federal or State constitution or both.\n  There will be another State and another State that will accept a \nredefinition of marriage. And the conflicts that will result as a \nresult of that are reflective of the one case I just submitted, which \nis the Washington State case. In the Washington State case, a lesbian \ncouple married in Canada where they have such laws and came to \nWashington State and filed bankruptcy. So they wanted distribution of \nassets based on marriage. And the State of Washington just said: We \nhave to figure out whether or not this is constitutional, whether we \nhave to accept this or whether the Defense of Marriage Act bars us from \ndoing so.\n  We will get this in State after State after State, and there will be \nconflicts. There will be court decisions all over the place. The \nSupreme Court will have to come in and say: We didn't want to do this. \nWe feel our hand is forced--just like Roe v. Wade--that this is an \nissue that cannot have this kind of disparity of unequal treatment \nbetween States, and we will then settle it for everybody, which will, \nof course, mean a complete redefinition of marriage. You don't have to \nhave a crystal ball to figure this one out.\n  We can sit back. This is the great, this is the classic just sit \nback; say what you believe the public wants to hear; profess your \nallegiance to traditional values, and then let someone else do the \ndirty work for you. And it will happen. It will happen. Maybe more \ndramatically, the court may say we are going to take this on and do it \nourselves. There seems to be a majority in the court to do that. But \neven if they are not aggressive, eventually it is a done deal.\n  And everyone will come out here and profess: No, the States can deal \nwith it. The States can handle this. We are for States rights. To hear \nthe Senator\n\n[[Page S8015]]\n\nfrom Massachusetts talk about States rights, I thought maybe the \nceiling would fall. Issue after issue, time after time, Members on that \nside of the aisle vote continually to take power from the States, \ncontinually to federalize every issue.\n  But when it comes to something as irrelevant, something as \nunimportant as the family and marriage, no, no, we can't deal with \nthis. No, this is in the general State purview, as if passing major \neducation reform isn't a State issue. That is a State issue. As if \ndoing welfare isn't a State issue. State issue. Transportation, State \nissue. Health care, welfare, all of these issues which we spend most of \nour time and an increasing portion of our money on are all under the \npurview, under this Constitution, of the States, and we have no problem \ndictating to the States how to run their schools, how to run their \nhospitals, how to run their welfare departments. But not when it comes \nto protecting this fragile institution, this institution that is so out \nof favor within the popular culture.\n  Listen to the music. Do you hear affirming things about the treatment \nof women in the music in the popular culture today? Do you hear songs \nabout commitment and marriage in the popular culture today? Do you see \nmovies reaffirming the traditional role of fathers raising their \nchildren and responsible actions on the part of parents and would-be \nparents? This is an institution that is swimming against a toxic tide \nof popular culture that wants to just drown it.\n  As the justices from Massachusetts said, speaking for our culture, I \nbelieve, marriage is a stain on our laws that must be eradicated. That \nis how Hollywood views marriage. That is how the music industry views \nmarriage. That is how the media views marriage.\n\n  What are they writing about here? Are they writing about this \nmarriage debate? No, they are writing about the conflict between \nRepublicans in trying to get a vote on the floor of the Senate. Give me \na break. One AP reporter writes this story, and he is a decent man. I \nknow he can't be this uninformed.\n  What are we trying to accomplish on the floor of the Senate? We have \ntwo amendments on this side of the aisle. It has not been unknown that \nthere have been actually as many as three amendments on this side of \nthe aisle. This is not unknown to anybody. What do we want to do? Well, \nwe can't put forward both so we put forward one, the one that we \nbelieve is our best, our optimal solution. By the way, that is done \nwith frequency in the U.S. Senate, where you come forward with what you \nwant to accomplish. And if you can't get that done, what do you do? You \noffer plan B, what you think will get something accomplished but not as \nmuch as you want.\n  And so we wanted to offer plan A. And if plan A didn't work--A, \nSenator Allard's amendment--then we would offer plan B, which happened \nto be Gordon Smith's amendment.\n  That is not confusion or division. It is simply a time-tested, age-\nold strategy in every dealing that I am aware of in life, which is you \ntry to get as much as you can. And if you can't, you take plan B and \ntry to get as much as you can there. But that is not what people write. \nThey don't want to write about the substance of the marriage debate, \nwhich by and large has not really been engaged in here.\n  The substance on the other side of the aisle when it comes to this \nissue is that, No. 1, it is political. No. 2, we should be talking \nabout homeland security. I am for homeland security. But there isn't \nenough money in the world that you can spend to secure the home more \nthan marriage. You want to invest in homeland security? You invest in \nmarriage. You invest in the stability of the family. That is what this \namendment is.\n  I hear from speaker after speaker: There are more important things to \ndebate on the floor of the Senate than the family. Think about that. \nThere are more important things to debate: homeland security, spending \nmore money, which, by the way, won't be spent until October 1 of next \nyear. Spending a few billion more dollars is more important than \npreserving the traditional family in America. No, they haven't been \ndebating the substance.\n  I asked the Senator from Alabama earlier, I don't believe anybody has \ncome forward and said they are not for traditional marriage. I think I \nam wrong. I was handed Senator Kennedy's speech.\n  Senator Kennedy said: I happen to be someone that supports the court \ndecision in Massachusetts. I am proud of them. I happen to support the \ncourt decision in Massachusetts. I am proud that four justices \nredefined and forced the Massachusetts legislature to rewrite their \nlaws, and they are the only ones who are allowed to do that, forced the \nlegislature to rewrite their laws with respect to marriage. I am proud \nof them.\n  Do we hear any comment about this agenda? What is this agenda? I am \nproud that four unelected judges can usurp the authority of the \nlegislative branch and roll them and force them to do something that \nthe people of Massachusetts don't want. I am proud of them.\n  I don't think John Adams would have said the same thing. I don't \nthink Jefferson or Madison would have. One of my colleagues referred to \nMadison, that he would be with Madison. I don't think Madison would see \nit as the role of judges to rewrite the Constitution when they have a \nhankering to do so. I think Mr. Madison would have a big-time problem \nwith what he would see as an abuse of article V. Article V is an \namendment of the constitutional process. Nowhere in there do I see Mr. \nMadison talking about judges changing the Constitution when they feel \nlike it. But, you see, as the Senator from New York, Senator Clinton \nsaid, ``I am in agreement that the Constitution is a living and working \naccomplishment.''\n  My question is, who is doing the living? You see, I thought from \narticle V that the living part was those of us here in the legislature, \nthose of us across the States who would determine when it is \nappropriate to institute new rights or obligations in the Constitution. \nThat is what I thought this living, dynamic document was. But that is \nnot what those who oppose this amendment believe the Constitution is, \nno. The living that is going on is not the American public doing the \nliving. Oh, no. It is a few hand-picked judges who have the right to \nbreathe life into the Constitution. See, they are the ones who get to \nchange the Constitution, without going through this complex, sort of \nlong, drawn out, tedious, expensive process of getting two-thirds of \nthe votes here in the Senate, and two-thirds of the votes in the House, \nand three-quarters of the State legislatures.\n  By the way, in responding to an earlier comment of a colleague on \nthis side, it is not three-quarters of the United States, it is three-\nquarters of the state legislatures by a majority vote.\n  By the way, from everything I have seen, and from every poll I have \nseen across America, those votes are probably there. The problem here \nis in this great institution that is supposed to be a reflection of \nAmerican values, 99 to 1, we are all for traditional marriage. But it \nis like a mirror in this case because it is not real. You can sort of \nlook at that reflection and try to touch it, but it is not real, it is \nonly a reflection because they are not voting that way.\n  If you want to protect traditional marriage, you should vote for \ncloture and for one of these constitutional amendments that will be \noffered. The Hippocratic oath says, ``First, do no harm.'' My question \nto those who are going to vote ``no'' tomorrow is, what harm do you \nbelieve a constitutional amendment does to the institution of marriage, \nwhich you say you support? You support the definition within this \nconstitutional amendment that marriage is between one man and one \nwoman. All but one Senator said they support that. There may be more \nwho don't. I suspect maybe a lot more, but I don't know. Probably a few \nmore are right now sort of staying low, saying all the right things, \nwhat the polls indicate is popular, and have their fingers crossed and \nare thinking let this issue pass; let this issue pass by and let it \nquiet down, and then let the courts do what we want them to do. Then we \nwill get what we need.\n  But if they don't feel that way, if they are truly in support of \ntraditional marriage, which many profess they are--and I argue I would \nprobably agree most are in favor of traditional marriage--then what \nharm do we do by putting language into our Constitution\n\n[[Page S8016]]\n\nto protect that institution which everybody says they are for? What \nharm is done? Do we harm the Constitution? Do we cheapen the \nConstitution?\n\n  Someone suggested this doesn't rise to the level of a constitutional \namendment. I remind people what the last constitutional amendment was. \nIt is fun reading. It is always good to pick up the Constitution. I \nknow Senator Byrd carries one and hangs out with it all the time. I \nwill read the 27th amendment:\n\n       No law varying the compensation for the services of \n     Senators and Representatives shall take effect until an \n     election of Representatives shall have intervened.\n\n  Congress cannot get pay raises until after the election. Big deal. By \nthe way, I know one Senator said, ``I am going to stand with James \nMadison.'' That is what the Senator from Arizona said. The 27th \namendment--do you know what it is called? The Madison amendment. James \nMadison, the architect of the Constitution, had an amendment that said \nCongresses cannot receive pay raises. A big, weighty issue. The fate of \nthe country hangs in the balance. ``I will stand with James Madison.'' \nDo you know what Madison said? If you believe enough in something, you \nput it in the Constitution if that is the only way you fix the problem. \nI don't believe anyone can look at the legal state of play in this \ncountry and say there is any other real option.\n  A philosopher named Christopher Lash said: ``Every day we get up and \nwe tell ourselves lies so we can live.'' What did he mean by that? \nWell, there are certain things we have to tell ourselves so we can go \non and do what we want to do, certain truths we have to ignore so we \ncan go on and live our lives.\n  There are all these people dying and suffering in Africa from AIDS, \nand we tell ourselves there is not much I can do about that so I will \ngo on with my day. There are 1.2 million children dying from abortions \nin this country. We tell ourselves that is a tragedy, but there is \nnothing I can do, so I can go on and have my breakfast. We all do it. I \ndo it. Everybody does it. We tell ourselves little lies so we can feel \ncomfortable with the decisions we make to go on with the life we want \nto live and make the decisions that make us feel comfortable.\n  The Senate tomorrow is going to tell itself a little lie--that we \ndon't need to do this, that families will be OK without us, and the \nStates can handle the issue. Now, some will say they don't believe that \nis a little lie. They will say they disagree with that. We can all \nrationalize whatever decision we want to make. We can all make our \ncase. In the history books, when this time is written about, we will be \nable to make our case. We will be able to say, you know, had I known \nthis was going to happen, I would have voted differently. I would have \nstood with Mr. Madison and voted for that amendment. But how was I to \nknow? How was I to know this was the beginning of the end of marriage, \nand the beginning of the end of the family in America, and the \nbeginning of the end of the freedom we hold in this country so dear, \nwhere Government doesn't run and have to take care of every need \nbecause nobody else is around to do it.\n  If you look at the socialist countries that have gone in the \ndirection of destruction of the family, you only need to look at the \nimposition and heavy weight of government. Why? Because there is no one \nthere to pick up the pieces. You can say, if I had known, if I had only \nknown. Every day we get up and tell ourselves lies, so we can live. The \nproblem is this lie hurts the future lives of millions of children in \nAmerica. And they are going to have to live with the consequences of \nthe lie you tell.\n\n  We have an opportunity to do something so simple, so basic, so \nnatural: Simply affirm what this country has known for hundreds of \nyears, what the Western World has known since its inception, and simply \nput in a document that represents the best of America the ideal that \nchildren deserve moms and dads; that the glue of the family, marriage, \nis worth a special place. Do we not believe that marriage, that glue \nthat binds men and women and children together, deserves a special \nplace right next to limiting pay raises of Members of Congress? Is that \na special enough place? Is it not a special enough place for something \nthat we know is essential for the future of America?\n  We debate a lot of important issues here, but there is nothing--\nnothing--more important than the future survival of this country. That \nis what we are here for. We took that oath of office. Why? To preserve \nand protect. That is our job. We have other jobs outside this Chamber, \nbut within this Chamber our job is the preservation of these United \nStates.\n  I do not see how anyone can possibly imagine a whole nation without \nwhole families. Yet we will choose tomorrow to risk everything. Think \nabout this. We will choose tomorrow to risk everything. Why? What is \nworth this risk? What is worth this experiment in sociology heretofore \nunseen? What is worth that much?\n  I ask the silent chairs on the other side of the aisle: What is worth \nthis much not to give marriage a chance? As broken and as battered and \nas shattered as the institution is, let's use this opportunity, in a \ntime of horrible, divisive politics, to band together and say there is \none thing on which we can agree: that men and women should bind \ntogether to have children and raise them in stable families. Can we at \nleast agree on that?\n  What will the answer be? What will all of God's children say \ntomorrow? No. No. No, I can't go that far; sorry, got too many other \nthings to worry about; too political an issue; too divisive an issue; \ntoo intolerant an issue; just trying to bash people; you don't really \ncare about families; this is simply about politics. The lies we tell \nourselves every day just so we can live.\n  I come here not because I want to win an election, not because I want \nto bash anybody or hurt anybody. I come because this is good for \nAmerica. This is the foundation of everything that makes America great, \nand it is worth saving. Give it a chance. Don't snuff out this candle \nthat is just barely keeping the light on. Give it a chance. I accept \nthe fact that it is in trouble. I accept the fact that we have darn \nnear blown it, but don't use that as an excuse to do nothing. This is \nnot about hate. This is about giving our children the best chance of \nhaving a bright tomorrow.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I was definitely moved by the presentation \nthat my colleague from Pennsylvania made on this issue. I thank him for \nhis comments.\n  One thought that came to my mind as I heard his comments was that I \ndo not think James Madison--who, by the way, is a hero of mine--would \nhave envisioned the need, and his contemporaries would have envisioned \nthe need, for protecting marriage. I have no doubt in my own mind that \nif he had thought that marriage would need that protection that he and \nhis contemporaries would not have hesitated to have made that a part of \nthe Constitution.\n  As we have gone over this debate, I have been somewhat frustrated to \nhear from opponents of this amendment constant criticism and \nmisrepresentation about what this amendment is all about and what it \ndoes. Over the weekend, I received a number of indepth legal analyses \nfrom legal experts, scholars, and law professors from around America. I \nwant to point out that when we are amending the Constitution, it is \nserious business. I have spent considerable time consulting with legal \nscholars, constitutional scholars, consulting with my colleagues, and \nworking with staff in the Judiciary Committee because I wanted to get \nit right.\n  In an effort to clear up some of these ridiculous charges made \nagainst this marriage amendment, I ask unanimous consent that there be \nprinted in the Record a brilliant letter on the meaning of the \namendment by eight law professors.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            [July 12, 2004]\n\n         The Meaning of the Proposed Federal Marriage Amendment\n\n\n                              Signatories\n\n       George W.

Wilkins, Professor of Law, J. Reuben Clark Law \n     School, Brigham Young University.\n       In the context of the recent and ongoing debate over a \n     proposed marriage amendment to the United States \n     Constitution, various questions concerning the meaning and \n     interpretation of the proposed amendment have been raised by \n     opponents of the measure. As supporters and proponents of the \n     amendment, we have prepared this memorandum in an effort to \n     clarify the meaning and intent of the proposed marriage \n     amendment.\n       Introduced as Senate Joint Resolution 40 by Senator Wayne \n     Allard and 18 co-sponsors, the marriage amendment provides: \n     ``Marriage in the United States shall consist only of the \n     union of a man and a woman. Neither this Constitution, nor \n     the constitution of any State, shall be construed to require \n     that marriage or the legal incidents thereof be conferred \n     upon any union other than the union of a man and a woman.''\n\n                                Summary\n\n       We are concerned that many arguments voiced in opposition \n     to the marriage amendment are based in hypothetical \n     speculation, rather than serious constitutional analysis. The \n     FMA is a simple, two-sentence amendment which carefully \n     addresses the growing threat to marriage in the United \n     States. In doing so, the Amendment is deliberately crafted so \n     as to preserve the integrity of state regulatory authority \n     over marriage and poses no plausible threat to individual or \n     private organizational actors.\n       The first sentence of the amendment maintains a common \n     definition of marriage throughout the United States, ensuring \n     consistency in the public legal status which is deeply \n     embedded in both state and federal law. The second sentence \n     reiterates and expands upon the first sentence, ensuring that \n     questions of marriage-like benefits for unmarried couples are \n     reserved to legislative processes. The amendment would have \n     no effect on the various ways that governments might try to \n     provide benefits to couples or individuals based on something \n     other than their marital status.\n       All implausible arguments to the contrary, the proposed FMA \n     would have no effect on personal arrangements, religious \n     ceremonies or other actions by private individuals or \n     organizations. The FMA takes advantage of the U.S. \n     Constitution's provision for the people's representatives to \n     respond to their will and protects, rather than interferes \n     with the principles of federalism. It is a common-sense \n     response to a very real threat to the ability of the people \n     in this nation to protect the most basic institution of \n     society as it has been understood throughout recorded \n     history.\n\n\n                    The FMA is Clear and Unambiguous\n\n       A recent memo, circulated among members of Congress, argues \n     that the first and second sentences of the proposed amendment \n     contradict one another, in that the second sentence allegedly \n     authorizes same-sex marriage under certain circumstances. \n     Such a reading of the second sentence is unwarranted, and \n     does not comport with the clear language of the amendment.\n       There can be no contradiction found between the two \n     sentences of the amendment. At most, it could be argued that \n     the second sentence is redundant with respect to marital \n     status, repeating what has already been stated in the first \n     sentence. The first sentence of the amendment provides that \n     throughout the United States, marriage shall be the ``union \n     of a man and a woman.'' The second sentence states that no \n     state or federal constitutional provision shall be held to \n     require a different result. While this reiteration may be \n     arguably unnecessary, it is far from contradictory.\n       The second sentence also serves another purpose, however, \n     preserving decisions about legal benefits to the deliberative \n     legislative process. In this respect, the second sentence \n     goes beyond the first, protecting the autonomy of state \n     legislatures to extend benefits according to the needs and \n     desires of their constituents. Both sentences must be read as \n     part of the same policy statement: marriage is an important \n     social institution throughout the United States, and cannot \n     be redefined by judicial fiat. The people of the individual \n     states reserve authority to extend or withhold benefits to \n     same-sex couples through their elected legislative bodies.\n       It has been suggested that this plain reading of the \n     marriage amendment is merely a smokescreen for an amendment \n     which will later be used to in efforts to strike down \n     domestic partnership and other civil benefit arrangements. \n     Opponents cite litigation challenging California's domestic \n     partnership law or Philadelphia's ``life partnership'' \n     ordinance as evidence that the FMA will be used similarly. \n     Whatever the particular merits of the California and \n     Pennsylvania litigation, the outcome of such claims are based \n     upon technical provisions of state law, and will have little \n     bearing upon the interpretation of the proposed marriage \n     amendment.\n       While there are many in the United States who would prefer \n     that the Congress propose an amendment which would ban civil \n     unions, domestic partnerships, or other similar arrangements \n     at the state level, the interpretation put forward by the \n     sponsors and other supporters in Congress has been clear and \n     unambiguous: the marriage amendment is intended to define \n     marriage as the union of a husband and wife, and to reserve \n     questions of benefits for state legislative bodies.\n\n\n            The FMA Does Not Interfere with Private Actions\n\n       Certain opponents of the marriage amendment have argued \n     that the amendment will impinge upon the actions of private \n     individuals and organizations, including religious \n     organizations. To the contrary, the amendment touches only \n     the public legal status of marriage, recognized in all fifty \n     states. Private actions, whatever the source, can neither \n     create a legal marriage nor violate the text of the \n     amendment. Until recently, all fifty states have had laws \n     which recognize marriage only as the union of a man and a \n     woman, and yet private actors remain free to extend domestic \n     partner benefits, perform or engage in commitment ceremonies, \n     or even refer to themselves as spouses.\n       It is difficult even to construct a theory on which an \n     amendment dealing with marriage might be applied to private \n     actors. Certainly the absence of language limiting the \n     amendment to government actors is not in itself evidence that \n     it is intended to apply as against private individuals. \n     Neither the Second, the Fourth, the Fifth, nor the Eighth \n     Amendment to the Constitution contains any explicit reference \n     limiting the scope to state actors, yet they are clearly \n     understood as such. For instance the Second Amendment says \n     ``the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be \n     infringed'' but it would be implausible to argue that as a \n     result, an employer could not ask an employee to leave their \n     weapons at home.\n       Marriage has long been a public legal status, directly \n     conferred and regulated by law in each of the fifty states. \n     The solemnization of a marriage, even if performed by clergy \n     or other religious figure, requires state licensure and has \n     legal effect. Concern over the impact of the marriage \n     amendment on private actors appears to be rooted in a \n     misconception of marriage as a private relationship. \n     Marriage, however, is not merely a private relationship, but \n     a public legal status. As such, all constitutional reference \n     to marriage is properly understood as a reference to that \n     legal status.\n\n\n     The Amendment Process is Democratic Decisionmaking at its Apex\n\n       Opponents often claim that the FMA somehow infringes the \n     democratic process by writing something new into the \n     Constitution. Under this theory the Bill of Rights and each \n     subsequent amendment have displaced democratic \n     decisionmaking. The Constitutional amendment process ensures \n     significant popular input, both in the process of approval in \n     the Senate and House of Representatives and in the \n     ratification process where a supermajority of states have to \n     concur. Of course, after the amendment is ratified it limits \n     future conduct, but so do all Constitutional provisions. An \n     amendment that has been ratified can also be changed through \n     the democratic process as the experience of Prohibition \n     demonstrates.\n       The national consensus required for a formal amendment to \n     the Constitution is not the only way in which the meaning of \n     the Constitution is amended, however. The other process \n     (apparently favored by opponents of the FMA) involves a \n     lawsuit with handpicked plaintiffs in a sympathetic \n     jurisdiction where only arguments filtered through the \n     legal briefing process will be heard. Then, the amendment \n     is made by a majority of judges on a court who construe \n     constitutional text to require a redefinition of marriage. \n     At least the FMA would have to be ratified by three-\n     fourths of the state legislatures, not a mere handful of \n     judges who hear only arguments made by lawyers.\n       Finally, as already noted, the amendment would still allow \n     state legislatures to enact laws that provide benefits to \n     unmarried couples.\n\n\n                   The FMA is a Defense of Federalism\n\n       Some opponents of the FMA argue that it violates the \n     principle of federalism by intruding into domestic relations \n     law, an area traditionally governed by state law. This \n     argument presupposes that there is no threat to federalist \n     principles from the ongoing attempt to secure a redefinition \n     of marriage through the courts. There is reason to believe \n     that some or many courts would adopt an expansive reading of \n     the Full Faith and Credit Clause or other state or federal \n     constitutional provisions that would in effect nullify the \n     policies of states which would choose not to recognize same-\n     sex marriages. Of course, this, as much as a federal marriage \n     amendment, would create a national marriage policy and \n     eviscerate any federalist protection of marriage laws.\n       It should be noted that the question of marriage validity \n     is already a matter of at least some federal concern. The \n     right-to-marry cases all invalidated state restrictions on \n     marriage on federal grounds. See Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. \n     S. 1 (1967); Zablocki v. Redhail, 434 U.S. 374 (1978); Turner \n     v. Safley, 428 U.S. 78 (1987). As the Defense of Marriage Act \n     indicates, federal law relies on a definition of marriage in \n     extending certain benefits such as Social Security death \n     benefits, 42 U.S.C. 405. and other federal retirement \n     programs. See Hisquierdo v. Hisquierdo, 439 U.S. 572 (1979). \n     At least since the U.S. Supreme\n\n[[Page S8018]]\n\n     Court began the process of incorporating federal \n     constitutional guarantees in its Fourteenth Amendment \n     jurisprudence, a growing number of federal constitutional \n     provisions have limited the states' power.\n       As to appropriateness, it must be asked whether it is wise \n     to have fifty different marriage policies in the United \n     States. While there is obviously significant room for \n     variations in many (probably most) state policies, there is \n     some need for uniformity. This is an axiomatic presupposition \n     of a federal constitution. Many of the specific policies \n     requiring unity are specified in the national constitution. \n     The most important examples are included in the limitation on \n     state power, since they ensure state uniformity in such \n     matters as coining money or exercising a foreign policy. U.S. \n     CONST., Art. I, Sec. 10. Perhaps most obvious is the \n     Guarantee Clause which rests on the assumption that while \n     specifics of state government may vary, at a minimum ``[t]he \n     United States shall guarantee to every state in this union a \n     republican form of government.'' U.S. CONST., Art. IV, \n     Sec. 4. The FMA stands for the proposition that the basic \n     legal definition of marriage is a fundamental policy of this \n     type.\n       Finally, if \\3/4\\ of the states ratify the FMA, this would \n     signal an acceptance of a super-majority of states of any \n     minimal limitation on their power just as the ratification of \n     the 19th Amendment allowed state legislatures to acquiesce in \n     the limitation of their right to deny women the vote.\n\n\n      The FMA Does Not Unduly Constrain the Branches of Government\n\n       The memo charges that the proposed FMA would ``take the job \n     of constitutional interpretation away from all three branches \n     of government.'' While this is technically true (and is true \n     of all other Constitutional amendments that affect government \n     power), it is also somewhat misleading. In practice, the \n     judicial branch has been almost alone in construing the \n     meaning of state constitutions. Thus, the, major thrust of \n     the FMA is to curtail judicial redefinition of marriage. To \n     the extent other governmental actors want to use a reading of \n     the constitution to justify a redefinition of marriage (such \n     as when a mayor issues marriage licenses to same sex couples \n     saying the constitution made him do it), they would be \n     constrained by the FMA but such a practice is not likely to \n     be widespread. A legislature, in fact, would be able to offer \n     marital benefits without any constitutional justification for \n     doing so.\n       Additionally, the memo says that the ``federal Constitution \n     should not purport to say what state law does or does not \n     mean.'' Taken at an extreme, this would negate the U.S. \n     Supreme Court's decision invalidating bans on interracial \n     marriage or, in fact, any federal Constitutional limitation \n     on state law. At least the FMA would have to be ratified by a \n     super-majority in the states it is regulating.\n\n\n               The FMA Gives the American people a Voice\n\n       Some have argued that the proposed marriage amendment will \n     increase the role of the judiciary in determining the \n     definition of marriage and its legal incidents. To the \n     contrary, the amendment would resolve current marriage \n     disputes pending in at least 11 states, while establishing a \n     uniform rule of law which minimizes the scope of future \n     litigation.\n       In recent years, five primary fields of marriage litigation \n     have evolved: (1) constitutional claims for same-sex marriage \n     (including both state and federal claims); (2) constitutional \n     claims for marital benefits; (3) statutory claims for marital \n     benefits; (4) constitutional claims for interstate marriage \n     recognition; and (5) claims for interstate recognition based \n     on state statute and public policy. Of these five broad \n     areas, the proposed marriage amendment would eliminate (or \n     greatly reduce) the role of judges in resolving \n     constitutional claims for same-sex marriage, marital \n     benefits, or marriage recognition. Statutory claims for \n     marital benefits would likely remain unaffected, while \n     interstate recognition claims would be minimized (but not \n     eliminated, due to the possibility that states will recognize \n     alternative civil benefit statuses).\n       The creativity of attempts to make the plain meaning of the \n     FMA seem confusing and contradictory is illustrative of the \n     problem. These creative readings of constitutional provisions \n     by judges have precipitated the issue and the FMA will bring \n     a needed clarity to the matter. By confining the crucial \n     social issue of the definition of marriage to courtroom \n     battles, opponents of the FMA have left the people of this \n     nation with little choice but to amend the Constitution.\n       Without an amendment, the marriage debate will continue to \n     be waged by attorneys and legal elites, in courts of law \n     where the American people have little or no voice. The \n     amendment process, on the other hand, will produce the type \n     of public dialogue and national consensus which this \n     important issue deserves.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I will briefly reiterate an important \nfactor-- Senator Santorum has eloquently argued the legal and the \npolicy issues that are so important with regard to marriage and why \nthat institution needs to be strengthened, not weakened. Policies of \ngovernment create tendencies in the culture. The recognition of same-\nsex marriages would have a tendency to weaken marriage, and that is \nexactly the wrong direction we ought to go.\n  How did it occur that we are debating the question of the definition \nof marriage in the Senate? It occurred because of a ruling last year by \nthe U.S. Supreme Court in Lawrence v. Texas that clearly implied that \nthe Supreme Court of the United States believes that the Equal \nProtection clause of the U.S. Constitution says one cannot have \nmarriage only between a man and a woman, as has been done in every \nculture that I know of since the beginning of time and as I believe \nevery single legislature that has ever sat in the history of the \nAmerican Republic has so defined.\n  These judges in Massachusetts have now followed up on that Lawrence \ncase of the U.S. Supreme Court and taken it to its conclusion, citing \nthe Lawrence case in its opinion. They have declared that the Equal \nProtection clause of the constitution of Massachusetts--basically \nsimilar to the U.S. Constitution--says one cannot treat same-sex unions \ndifferently from traditional marriage. That is a serious stretch, in my \nview. That indicates that our courts are losing discipline; our courts \nare imposing, through interpretations of the Constitution, their \npersonal values on society. That is not correct.\n  It undermines democracy. It undermines the power of the American \npeople to decide for themselves how their culture and their society \nought to be ordered. I believe very strongly in that. So it is not \nsurprising to me that the senior Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. \nKennedy, probably the leading defender of judicial activism in this \nbody, is the only one who I have heard since we have been in this \ndebate say he agreed with that activist decision. It is a decision by a \ncourt to step out and impose through interpretation of the language of \nthe Constitution values on the American people of which they do not \napprove.\n  Indeed, it is not even the values of the people of Massachusetts, as \nwe know the Governor has roundly opposed this. The legislature has \ntaken action. Efforts are being undertaken to pass a constitutional \namendment to fix it. So even in the most liberal State in the Nation, \neven with Senator Kennedy--and his colleague, I suppose, opposing this \namendment--the people and the legislature and the Governor do not \napprove of this. So certainly the American people have a right to be \nconcerned.\n  I see the Senator from Pennsylvania. He spoke on this. I have heard \nhim speak on the issue of judges before. I would like to ask his view-- \nis this not just one more example of the divide and the difference of \nopinion that exists in this body about the role of a judge? Is this not \nindicative of what President Bush has expressed his concern about, \nwhich is activism in judges? Does not judicial activism undermine \ndemocracy when we have unelected judges setting social policy?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. That is a great question. I say to the Senator from \nAlabama that going back to Madison, Adams, and the Massachusetts \nConstitution talked about the importance of a balance of powers, a \nchecks and balances; that if one branch of the Government were to \nbecome too powerful then our Republic is in danger. Democracy itself is \nin danger.\n  I think what the Senator from Alabama is referring to is the \njudiciary over the last several years, as a result of the feeling \nwithin certainly the liberal branch of the judiciary, that they can \ntake on the role of a legislature in either passing laws in the form of \njudicial opinions or forcing the legislature to pass laws as a result \nof constitutional edict. It is getting to the point where there are \nthese three branches of Government that all sort of operate under the \nConstitution, and we are supposed to be able to oversee each other. One \nmight want to make the argument that maybe we are not doing a \nparticularly good job of oversight; that we are not doing a very good \njob of checking the judiciary in its repeated attempt now to usurp \npower away from the people's branch.\n\n  The people's branch is not the judiciary. It is not the executive. It \nis us. We are the ones who stand for election on a regular basis. We \nare the ones who are responsible to a local constituency.\n\n[[Page S8019]]\n\nWe are the ones who are in closest touch with what the people would \nlike to see done. The judiciary is probably the most removed because \nthey are completely unelected.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Could I interrupt the Senator and just follow up on \nthat?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Yes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The Senator is in part of the leadership in this Senate \non the Republican side. Is it not true, based on his experience, that \neven the House and the Senate defend amongst themselves their \nprerogatives and do not the House and the Senate defend their own power \nagainst the executive and does not the executive branch defend its own \npower against the legislative branch?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. It is one of the most disputed and argued--we have \ncommittees that argue over jurisdiction just between where bills are \nreferred. We all know this in all of our lives, when there is an area \nof authority, that area of authority is protected, not just because it \nis one's particular area of authority but one knows what they do in \ntheir job, particularly in the area of the legislature and of \ngovernment, sets a precedent for how future people will do their job. \nIf one gives up power, it is going to be hard for someone to get back \nwhen it may be necessary for them to do so.\n  So we hold our power or fight for our rights not just because we want \nto exercise that power but because it is important institutionally that \nthe power rest in the proper place.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, with regard to Madison, that father of the \nConstitution and a man I admire, he set up coequal branches and he \nexpected each one to be a check and a balance on the other. Would not \nthe Senator expect that Madison would have expected this Senate and \nthis Congress to defend its prerogative to set policies concerning \nmarriage and family and resist the encroachment of that power from the \ncourts?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The answer to that is clearly yes. In fact, the Senator \nis a much better lawyer than I ever was, and I say that to the Senator \nfrom Alabama as someone who was a prosecutor and a very accomplished \nlawyer. I made it up to a fourth year associate, so I just started on \nmy legal career and opted to do something different, and that was run \nfor Congress.\n  I recall when Madison wrote this Constitution about checks and \nbalances, I am not sure he envisioned the role of the judiciary as we \nsee it today. Marbury v. Madison sort of evolved as to what the role of \nthe courts was in interpreting the Constitution, but clearly he gave \nthe authority to change the Constitution not to the courts. He gave the \nauthority to change and create rights within the Constitution to the \nCongress and to the States, as a check on the Congress, to make sure \nthe States would go along with what we wanted to do.\n  So to change this important document, this template for the \nGovernment that we have, he wanted to create a very high bar, wanted to \nmake sure there was broad public consensus before we did something to \naffect this very important document. Now this is being used as an \nexcuse not to change it, when judges do it every day. Every day a judge \nwill attempt to expand, usually expand in some form or another, the \nmeaning by adapting it to contemporary standards or contemporary \njurisprudence.\n\n  I don't know what that means, but it basically means I am the judge, \nI am the law, and I can do what I want.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would follow up on that. I remember when I was a U.S. \nattorney in Alabama, I got a call from an educator who was looking at \ntheir school textbook and discovered it asked a question about amending \nthe Constitution. The first section stated that you amend it according \nto the way the Constitution says it should be amended. And the second \nparagraph says the Constitution is amended by the courts.\n  He asked me: You are the Federal attorney here; is that true?\n  I said: No, it is not true.\n  And he asked me to do a video.\n  But the point is that you are right, I say to my colleague, Senator \nSantorum. This judiciary believes it has the power to amend the \nConstitution by taking words such as ``equal protection'' or ``due \nprocess,'' which in the hands of a person not disciplined can be made \nto say a lot of different things. But good lawyers and good judges know \nthat can be abused and they do not do so.\n  I think we are at a point where the American Republic has its \ndemocratic heritage at risk-- if we just get to the point where we can \nnever respond, if they can make these rulings and the Congress can \nnever pass an amendment to overturn them, or set our own policy on \nbehalf of the people.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I would just say that checks and balances work as long \nas there is truly a balance. I think what we have is some people today \nin our judiciary, because of the activist judges, who are now saying we \nare all going to play by these rules, all branches of Government. Here \nis the game. Everybody comes to the poker table and we are going to \nplay the game of governing the United States of America. And in the \nmiddle of the game, the court can say: I am changing the rules to my \nfavor, so I win.\n  In a sense, if you think about it, when the Court, the Supreme Court, \nrules, they win. The only way we can change that is through this rather \ncomplex procedure laid out in article V of the Constitution, which is \nnot an easy thing to do. In a sense, the Court has figured out that the \nability for Congress to check them is very limited. As a result, they \nare feeling more and more empowered to project their will on society.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I couldn't agree more.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. That would be, first, I think, dangerous, period. But \nit worries me even more because the Supreme Court that sits right here \nin Washington, DC, is certainly not what I would call Main Street \nAmerica, certainly not what I would call a community that shares the \nvalues of this metropolitan area, that shares the values of the \nheartland of America.\n  I remember a good friend of mine telling me that postwar Germany was \nconcerned about centralizing government in its major cities, Berlin or \nBonn. So they did something rather unusual. They located their supreme \njudicial court not in their capital city or in their biggest city, they \nlocated it in the equivalent of Peoria, out in the country, where \njustices do not hobnob with the liberal elite that govern the nation. \nEither through governance-wise or governing media-wise. But they have \nto live and work with the common, ordinary people out across the great \nhills of Germany--and in our case the Great Plains of the United \nStates.\n  But we don't have that here. We have this constitutional court \nsitting right across the street in a town where the influences are not \nneutral. That is why I believe you see that every single Justice--bar a \ncouple on this Court--once they get on the Court, tend to assimilate \nwith this town and with the prevailing view in this town, which is big \ngovernment, which is government knows best, and government can do all, \nand which is, from the culture standpoint, not exactly where I would \nsay Mobile, AL, is, or Pittsburgh, PA, is. Where in Colorado?\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Sweetheart City.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Certainly not where the Sweetheart City is, in \nColorado.\n  The bottom line is that we have a court that is out of control. We \nhave courts across this country, like in Massachusetts, that are also \ndeciding, taking their lead from what is going on here in Washington, \ndeciding to assert their authority and in so doing, taking power away \nfrom the American people to decide their own fate.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania. I think he is \ncorrect.\n  I love the Federal courts. I practiced there full time for the \nbiggest part of my legal career. I have tremendous respect for Federal \njudges. But I tend to agree with the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The senior judges in the U.S. Supreme Court, many of whom are in \ntheir eighties, have become detached from America. If they follow their \nrole as the Founders considered, which is simply to be removed, to be \nindependent, to analyze the language fairly and justly without partisan \nor personal interest, that is good. But if they develop some idea that \nthey know what is good for the country better than the people do, if \nthey start drifting into that mentality, then it is very unhealthy for \nthis society.\n\n[[Page S8020]]\n\n  And it is anti-democratic. It is not democratic. Because they have \nlife-appointed positions. I have heard the Senator from Colorado speak \non this and I know he believes the jurisdiction of the courts can be \nconstrained, and he has taken a lead in that effort. He has done so in \na highly intelligent and effective way, a proper way, by presenting \nlegislation now to be discussed. But I am troubled by this trend that \ndemonstrates to me that the Supreme Court is out of control.\n  Senator Allard, in addition to the powerful need for this Senate to \nprotect marriage because of the cultural impact and the impact on \nfamilies and children that will occur if marriage continues to decline, \nI think it is important for us to defend our legislative power against \na branch of government that is encroaching on it. If we do not defend \nthis power, if the Members of this body sit by and allow the courts to \nerode our power, then shame on us. And our children will not respect \nus.\n  We defend our interests against the President. The Senate defends its \ninterests against the House when they try to encroach on the Senate's \npower. And well we should. That is what Madison and the Founders \nexpected. I think he would expect us to defend our legitimate interests \nagainst the encroachment of the courts.\n  I thank the President and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I just want to read article V and make \nclear what the Senator from Alabama is saying. When it comes to \namending the Constitution, the first two words, if we are going to \nchange the Constitution of the United States, the first two words are \n``The Congress.''\n\n       The Congress, whenever two thirds of both Houses shall deem \n     it necessary, shall propose amendments to this \n     Constitution....\n\n  Shall propose amendments. It is the role of Congress to simply \npropose amendments. So what we are doing here today is not passing. We \nare simply proposing this to the American people.\n\n       . . . shall propose Amendments to this Constitution, or, on \n     the Application of the Legislatures of two thirds of the \n     several States, shall call a Convention for proposing \n     Amendments, which, in either Case, shall be valid to all \n     Intents and Purposes, as Part of this Constitution, when \n     ratified by the Legislatures of three fourths of the several \n     States, or by Conventions in three fourths thereof, as the \n     one or the other Mode of Ratification may be proposed by the \n     Congress; Provided that no Amendment which may be made prior \n     to the Year One thousand eight hundred and eight shall in \n     any Manner affect the first and fourth Clauses in the \n     Ninth Section of the first Article; and that no State, \n     without its Consent, shall be deprived of its equal \n     Suffrage in the Senate.\n\n  What this amendment says is to change the Constitution of the United \nStates, we propose and the people dispose.\n  What is happening in Massachusetts, across this country, and in the \ncourt across the street in the Supreme Court is the Supreme Court has \ntaken this power unto itself which was clearly left to the people. That \nis what we are trying to address. We are trying to let the people \nspeak.\n  In the end, this debate simply is about letting the American people \ndecide for ourselves what this rather important institution in our \ncountry is.\n  Again, I can think of nothing more foundational in our society than \nthe building block of that society which is the family.\n  The American people have a right to make a decision. Every Member who \nhas gotten up and talked has said they want to simply leave it to the \nState courts. But let me assure you, these decisions will not \nultimately be made by the States. They will be made by the State \ncourts. We have seen it in case after case after case. The courts will \ntrump the legislatures.\n  Again, ultimately, even if some States can hold back the tide, other \nStates will not. If we have a hodgepodge or patchwork of different \nmarriage laws in this country, I will assure you the Supreme Court will \nnot stand aside and let that continue. It will be a legal nightmare. We \nwill have to find conformity. Conformity will certainly be to permit \nthis new form of marriage; thus, the end of the family as we know it.\n  I know the Senator from Kansas and many others--the Senator from \nTexas and I have even pointed out--I know some are saying, What do you \nmean the end of the family? Won't we enhance marriage by allowing more \npeople to marry? Won't marriage be enhanced if we allow more people to \nparticipate in that sacred bond? The evidence is in.\n  In the places where we have seen the introduction of civil unions and \nsame-sex marriages, marriage rates decline dramatically. Why? Because \nmarriage loses its meaning. Marriage is no longer about families. By \nthe way, what goes up? The rate of out-of-wedlock births. This is \ncommon sense, isn't it?\n  What are we doing here? If marriage is simply about affirming one's \nown self-worth or affirming one's affection toward somebody else, if \nthat is all it is, when those feelings go away, why stay married? If \nthat is all it is, if it is all about me and my happiness, when I am \nnot happy anymore, then I am not married anymore. If it is about me, \nthen obviously it is not about them, the children. They only happen to \ncome along. If marriage is simply about me, in the case of heterosexual \nmarriage, if it is about me, and that is what a lot of divorce laws as \na culture have trained us to believe marriage is about, then it is nice \nto have kids. It is a great thing to have kids--sometimes, some will \nsay. Why stay married? If I am not happy because marriage isn't about \nchildren, it is about me, we reinforce that. We put a big neon sign, \n``Marriage is about me. Marriage is about self. Marriage is about \nmaking me feel good. And if I don't feel good anymore, then I will not \nbe married anymore.'' That is all marriage is about. How can you argue \nit is about anything else? If any two people can get married whether \nthey can have children or not, why stop at two?\n\n  I mean if what we are doing, if marriage is a civil right as someone \nsuggested--not in this Chamber, but I suspect one of these days will be \nmentioned in this Chamber, that marriage is a civil right--then why \nisn't it a civil right for three, or four, or five? If it is a civil \nright, why limit it to two? If I need to express my love to three \npeople instead of one, if that is what fulfills me and makes me happy, \nthen why shouldn't I be allowed to do that?\n  This is a very slippery slope.\n  The bottom line is, as I mentioned over and over again with respect \nto the reasons for marriage, self-affirmation is fairly low on the list \nof marriage importance in society. Why do we have such a legal \ninstitution? Why do we create laws that govern marriage? Why do we do \nthat, if we didn't believe there was a societal good to be accomplished \nby it? Why do we give it elevated status?\n  You sort of have to ask this question: Is it because we go around \naffirming love between two people? Why don't we want mothers and \ndaughters to be married and give them special treatment? There are a \nlot of daughters who take care of moms who are sick, who are elderly, \nwho sacrifice a lot to take care of their parents and don't get the \nbenefits they would otherwise get if they were married to their mother. \nWhy not give them, the people who are struggling, the right to marry so \nthey can get the benefits of marriage? If they are going to argue that \nmarriage is about affirming the love of two people, why not? But \nmarriage is much more from the standpoint of society and the reason we \nhave an institution of marriage. That is a minor part of this \ndiscussion. The reason we have legal statutes for marriage is because \nit is about having and raising children and stable families and bonding \nmen and women together so they can provide for the common good. There \nare great benefits to society with marriage.\n  We know if we cheapen marriage as other countries have done, fewer \nheterosexuals will be married, more children will be born out of \nwedlock, and more government will be needed to repair the dissolution \nof the family as a result of it. Why? For what? What great positive \nimpact will change the definition of the marriage act? What great \ncontribution will be made to society? Will we be able to welcome a \nloving society? Some will suggest we will. I don't know if we will. I \nthink we are a loving, welcoming society with maybe the exception of \nthe unborn. We are not particularly welcome to one-third of the \nchildren conceived in marriage who end up being killed by abortion. But \nbeyond that, I think we are a\n\n[[Page S8021]]\n\npretty affirmative and tolerant society--not that there are not people \nwho aren't tolerant, not there are not people who do and say hurtful \nthings.\n  By and large, we have come a long way in our society. I think it is a \ngood thing we have become tolerant of people. Tolerance does not mean \nwe need to change a fundamental institution that provides healthy \nenvironments for children and destroys the chance for children to have \nthe ideal or make it a lot less likely.\n  I think if you look at Netherlands, Scandinavia, and look at numbers \nin Canada and other places, it has an impact.\n  I keep coming back to the fundamental right. The hour is late. I \napologize to all folks who had to stay here late at night. The morning \nwill come early.\n  I keep sitting here and wondering why. Why does a body of people, No. \n1, profess publicly to believe that marriage should only be a union \nbetween a man and a woman and that this body believes it \noverwhelmingly; and, No. 2, knows that at least this issue is under \ncontest and in dispute. There is no question about that. One State has \nchanged the law.\n\n  To suggest this is not a threat simply is not true. It is obviously \nunder threat. It has been changed in one rather large State.\n  There are cases in 11 other States, 2 cases challenging the Federal \nlaw, and in 46 States there are same-sex couples who are married from \nMassachusetts or one of the other States that have married people. Are \nall potential litigants.\n  Number one we believe marriage is between a man and a woman. We know \nthat institution is under assault. We know that it is a public good and \nthat we are for it. We know that it serves a useful purpose. Then why \nwon't we do something to protect it?\n  We go down this logical train and we say, yes, all those things are \ntrue, but we can wait. Why? What is the point? Why wait? What is going \nto happen? Things will get worse. Certainly that will happen. Things \nget worse and then you feel you had the public support necessary to \nvote. Is that what this is about, getting the public support necessary \nto do this? Or do we really believe the States can handle it? Are we \nwilling to take that risk? What is the risk if the courts do turn over \nmore and more? We can come back and fix it later. I know a lot of \npeople know this unspoken thing: Time is not on our side.\n  The culture of what is educating our children at our university, what \nis polluting our children's mind from Hollywood, what is coming through \nthe mainstream media is not a message in support of traditional \nmarriage.\n  Let's be honest. Does anybody question that the messages from those \nplaces where our children are getting the messages from the popular \nculture, from the educational establishment, is it all affirming of the \ntraditional definition of marriage? One only needs to look at the polls \nof young people to know that is simply not the case.\n  This is simply a timebomb. If we do not bring America's focus and \nattention on what marriage is and why it is important, and that it \nshould be sustained, we will lose.\n  Many have criticized me and Senator Frist and others for bringing \nthis up, saying it is premature, saying we are picking a fight for \npolitics or whatever. Let me assure you, if I thought it was not in the \nbest interest of protecting the American people, I would not be here. \nIf I did not think this was critical to the future of America, I would \nnot be here at 10 o'clock at night when I should be home tucking my \nkids in bed. As Members know, I try to spend time with my kids. There \nis nothing more important, nothing more important than my kids and my \nwife, my family. That is why I am here, because there is nothing more \nimportant than my family.\n  I hope tomorrow we get a big surprise. I always believe in that. I \nremember being here a few years ago and debating the issue of partial-\nbirth abortion, about this hour of the night, trying to override the \nPresident's veto in 1996 and then again in 1998. I remember staying up \nlate the night before the vote, saying we are just a couple votes \nshort; maybe if we go out and give it one last good try, we will win. \nAnd we didn't.\n\n  Do you know what I found? I say to the Senator from Colorado, nobody \nis more constant, nobody, who I would rather see in the foxhole next to \nme than the Senator from Colorado. If you looked over there, he would \nbe there. The Senator from Alabama, I say the same to him. These are \nstalwarts, folks who are not afraid to engage in cultural wars that are \nnot fun to engage in because a lot of people say a lot of bad things \nabout you.\n  What I say to these Members and anyone listening, losing the vote \ndoes not necessarily mean losing the issue. We had a lot of losses on \nthe issue of partial-birth abortion. I can say without fear of \nhesitation it was the greatest gift that God gave us, because it gave \nus an opportunity to talk to the American people about this scourge on \nour Nation. If the President signed this innocuous bill the first time \nin 1996, signed it and had a bill-signing ceremony, probably it would \nhave been filed, no one would have known, hearts and minds would not \nhave been touched.\n  I believe our plan is not necessarily the best plan. Victory can come \nfrom defeat. In this case, the victory over the last 3 days, thanks to \nthe work of these two fine Members and so many others who have come to \nthe Senate to debate this issue, is an America that is waking up to \nsomething that we have forgotten about.\n  I liken the institution of marriage to oxygen in the air. The human \nbody needs oxygen to survive. Yet we take it for granted as we just \nbreathe. And America as a society needs marriage and families to \nsurvive. Yet we take marriage and families for granted as if it will \nalways be. We do a lot to keep good, healthy oxygen to breathe. We do \nvery little to keep families protected, sheltered, and supported.\n  Just as it is with oxygen, as you climb those high altitudes in \nColorado, you find out when there is less and less oxygen, the body \ndoes not function quite as well. So it is with marriage. When there is \nless and less marriage, the body does not function quite as well. When \nyou are climbing that mountain, and many people for years did not know \nwhat it was when they went up to the altitudes that they could not \nperform as well, and, for America, we are climbing that mountain and we \nare just wondering, Why aren't we doing as well?\n  This is an opportunity to educate America as to the need for \nmarriage, the need for families, not in a hostile way, not in a \nnegative way. I don't think I have heard a negative word on the floor \nof the Senate about anybody or anything. We simply have talked about \nwhy families and marriage is necessary for America and why children \nneed moms and dads.\n  It is almost remarkable, but I suspect this is maybe the first real \ndebate about family and marriage in the Senate. I guess in the Defense \nof Marriage Act we talked, maybe not. But it is a reminder to all how \nthe things that sometimes we take most for granted are things that make \nus function as a society.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for the willingness to stay to this \nlate hour and engage in this very important debate. I hope tomorrow, \nwhatever happens, I don't know what will happen, that it turns out for \nthe best interests of America's families. I always hope that no matter \nwhat we do and how the votes come, that somehow or other it will all \nwork out for the best for America. I believe that. And I ask for the \nAmerican public to pray for that.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for \nhis leadership on this issue. We would not be where we are today if it \nwere not for his dedication and hard work. I also thank the Senator \nfrom Alabama for his help and dedication on this very important issue. \nI personally thank each of you.\n  But I think when it is all over with--whether it is this year or next \nyear or the year after that--a majority of the people in America are \ngoing to thank you for the work you have done to save the American \nfamily.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/13/senate-section/article/S8021-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8021-S8022]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. ALLARD.

It helps them attain high school diplomas and general \nequivalency degrees, and provides counseling and 15 different \nvocational training courses.\n  These programs not only teach the basic reading and mathematics \nskills that are crucial for a successful career, they also instill the \npositive work ethic and good work habits that are equally important to \nsuccess.\n  Thanks to the Sierra Nevada Job Corps, more than 20,000 men and women \nhave become productive, employed citizens. By offering an alternative \nto welfare and unemployment, the center not only provides a long-\nlasting benefit to its students, but also to the entire State of \nNevada.\n  This organization has been an inspiration to thousands of \nunderprivileged Nevadans, giving them the motivation and confidence to \npursue opportunities that would have otherwise been beyond their reach.\n  Please join me in congratulating director Kenneth C. Dugan, his staff \nand the thousands of graduates of the Sierra Nevada Job Corps on this \nprogram's 25th anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/13/senate-section/article/S8022-2", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8022]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n               Sergeant First Class Linda Tarango-Griess\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I express my sympathy over the loss of \nLinda Tarango-Griess of Sutton, NE, a Sergeant First Class in the \nNebraska Army National Guard. SFC Tarango-Griess was killed on July 11, \n2004 near the city of Samarra in Iraq when a roadside bomb exploded \nnear her convoy. She was 33 years old.\n  SFC Tarango-Griess was originally from North Platte and graduated \nfrom Kearney High School. She was a full-time soldier for 14 years in \nthe Nebraska Army National Guard and was deployed to Iraq in February \nof this year. Tarango-Griess was assigned to the 267th Ordnance Company \nbased in Lincoln and was responsible for direct support maintenance for \ncoalition forces in the region, including the installation of \nadditional armor protection on military Humvee vehicles to make them \nsafer. Tarango-Griess was one of thousands of brave American service \nwomen and men serving in Iraq.\n  SFC Tarango-Griess is survived by her parents, Augustin and Juanita \nTarango of North Platte; and husband, SSGT Douglas Griess, of Sutton. \nOur thoughts and prayers are with them at this difficult time. America \nis proud of Linda Tarango-Griess' service and mourns her loss.\n  For her service, bravery, and sacrifice, I ask my colleagues to join \nme and all Americans in honoring SFC Tarango-Griess.\n\n\n                        Sergeant Jeremy Fischer\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I express my sympathy over the loss of \nJeremy Fischer of Lincoln, NE, a Sergeant in the Nebraska Army National \nGuard. SGT Fischer was killed on July 11, 2004 near the city of Samarra \nin Iraq when a roadside bomb exploded near his convoy. He was 26 years \nold.\n  SGT Fischer will be remembered as a hard-working, positive \nindividual. He joined the Nebraska Army National Guard in 1999 and was \ndeployed to Iraq in February of this year. He was assigned to the 267th \nOrdnance Company based in Lincoln and was responsible for direct \nsupport maintenance for coalition forces in the region, including the \ninstallation of additional armor protection on military Humvee vehicles \nto make them safer. Fischer was one of thousands of brave American \nservice men and women serving in Iraq.\n  SGT Fischer is survived by his parents, James Fischer of Hastings and \nKathy Fischer of Lincoln; and wife of nearly 8 months, Sarah Fischer, \nof Lincoln. Our thoughts and prayers are with them at this difficult \ntime. America is proud of Jeremy Fischer's service and mourns his loss.\n  For his service, bravery, and sacrifice, I ask my colleagues to join \nme and all Americans in honoring SGT Jeremy Fischer.\n\n\n                    Sergeant Robert E. Colvill, Jr.\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave young man from \nAnderson, IN. Sgt. Robert E. Colvill, 31 years old, died on July 8 in \nSamarra, Iraq when the building he was in came under attack. With his \nentire life before him, Rob chose to risk everything to fight for the \nvalues Americans hold close to our hearts, in a land halfway around the \nworld.\n  Rob graduated from Madison Heights High School in 1991 and joined the \nMarines shortly thereafter, following a long family tradition of \nmilitary service. Rob dedicated 8 years of his life to active duty \nbefore retiring from the Marines. According to family and friends, it \ndid not take long for Rob to realize that civilian life was not for \nhim. After one year, he enlisted in the U.S. Army and was assigned to \nHeadquarters and Headquarters Company, 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry \nRegiment, 1st Infantry Division, Schweinfurt, Germany. This past \nspring, Rob was deployed to Iraq, where he bravely fought for 4 months \nbefore sacrificing his life for the worthy cause of freedom. Robert \nColvill Sr. told the Anderson Herald-Bulletin that his son, Rob, ``was \ndoing what he wanted to do and did his best. He was trained for this. \nIt was his calling.''\n  Rob was the thirtieth Hoosier soldier to be killed while serving his \ncountry in Operation Iraqi Freedom. This brave young soldier leaves \nbehind his father, Robert; his wife, Chris; his two sons, Travis and \nZachary; and his stepdaughter, Suzanne. May Rob's children grow up \nknowing that their father gave his life so that young Iraqis will some \nday know the freedom they enjoy.\n  Today, I join Rob's family, his friends and the entire Anderson \ncommunity in mourning his death. While we struggle to bear our sorrow \nover his death, we can also take pride in the example he set, bravely \nfighting to make the world a safer place. It is his courage and \nstrength of character that people will remember when they think of Rob, \na memory that will burn brightly during these continuing days of \nconflict and grief.\n  Rob was known for his dedicated spirit and his love of country. When \nlooking back on the life of this late student and former athlete, \nMadison Heights High School Track Coach John McCord, told the Anderson \nHerald-Bulletin, ``He was the kind of kid you liked to have on any \nteam. He always gave his best effort. He always practiced and trained \nhard and competed to the best of his abilities.'' Today and always, Rob \nwill be remembered by family members, friends and fellow Hoosiers as a \ntrue American hero and we honor the sacrifice he made while dutifully \nserving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Rob's sacrifice, I am \nreminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families of \nthe fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we cannot \nconsecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and \ndead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power \nto add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \nsay here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This statement \nis just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am certain \nthat the impact of Rob's actions will live on far longer than any \nrecord of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Robert E. Colvill in the \nofficial record of the U.S. Senate for his service to this country and \nfor his profound commitment to freedom, democracy and peace. When I \nthink about this just cause in which we are engaged, and the \nunfortunate pain that comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that \nfamilies like Rob's can find comfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah \nwho said, ``He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will \nwipe away tears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Rob.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/13/senate-section/article/S8023-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S8023]]\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I speak about the need for hate crimes \nlegislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I introduced the Local \nLaw Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would add new categories \nto current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind \nis unacceptable in our society.\n  On February 25, 2001, a transgendered man named Victor Pachas was \nbeaten, stabbed, slashed, and asphyxiated by a man who, according to \nhis own attorneys, was ``driven by revulsion and fear'' of Pachas' \nsexual orientation.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. By \npassing this legislation and changing current law, we can change hearts \nand minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/13/senate-section/article/S8023-2", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        WHAT IRAQ IS REALLY LIKE\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, as we go about our leisurely way, the \nmajority of people back home think Iraq is a mistake. The Commanding \nGeneral says we can't win, and Congress refuses to pay for the war. \nThis generation not only has to fight the war, but this generation will \nhave to pay for it, because my colleagues in the Senate want tax cuts \nso we can get the vote in November.\n  I think we all need to sober up about the realities of what is \nhappening to our young soldiers in Iraq. Joseph Galloway, of the Knight \nRidder Newspapers, wrote a column that should be mandatory reading for \nall of us. It appeared recently in The State newspaper in Columbia, and \nI ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the State (Columbia, SC), June 27, 2004]\n\n                  From Iraq: ``What It's Really Like''\n\n                        (By Joseph L. Galloway)\n\n       The Internet, which fills our inboxes with spam and scams \n     every day and keeps our delete keys shiny, occasionally \n     delivers a real keeper, such as the words below, which were \n     written by a graduate of West Point, Class of 2003, who's now \n     at war in Iraq.\n       We tracked down the author, who gave us permission to quote \n     from his letter so long as we didn't reveal his name. Old \n     soldiers in the Civil War coined a phrase for green troops \n     who survived their first taste of battle: ``He has seen the \n     elephant.'' This Army lieutenant sums up the combat \n     experience better than many a grizzled veteran:\n       ``Well, I'm here in Iraq, and I've seen it, and done it. \n     I've seen everything you've ever seen in a war movie. I've \n     seen cowardice; I've seen heroism; I've seen fear; and I've \n     seen relief. I've seen blood and brains all over the back of \n     a vehicle, and I've seen men bleed to death surrounded by \n     their comrades. I've seen people throw up when it's all over, \n     and I've seen the same shell-shocked look in 35-year-old \n     experienced sergeants as in 19-year-old privates.\n       ``I've heard the screams--Medic! Medic!' I've hauled dead \n     civilians out of cars, and I've looked down at my hands and \n     seen them covered in blood after putting some poor Iraqi \n     civilian in the wrong place at the wrong time into a \n     helicopter. I've seen kids with gunshot wounds, and I've seen \n     kids who've tried to kill me.\n       ``I've seen men tell lies to save lives: What happened to \n     Sergeant A.? The reply: C'mon man, he's all right--he's \n     wondering if you'll be OK--he said y'all will have a beer \n     together when you get to Germany. SFC A. was lying 15 feet \n     away on the other side of the bunker with two medics over him \n     desperately trying to get either a pulse or a breath. The man \n     who asked after SFC A. was himself bleeding from two gut \n     wounds and rasping as he tried to talk with a collapsed lung. \n     One of them made it; one did not.\n       ``I've run for cover as fast as I've ever run--I'll hear \n     the bass percussion thump of mortar rounds and rockets \n     exploding as long as I live. I've heard the shrapnel as it \n     shredded through the trailers my men live in and over my \n     head. I've stood, gasping for breath, as I helped drag into a \n     bunker a man so pale and badly bloodied I didn't even \n     recognize him as a soldier I've known for months. I've run \n     across open ground to find my soldiers and make sure I had \n     everyone.\n       ``I've raided houses, and shot off locks and broken in \n     windows. I've grabbed prisoners and guarded them. I've looked \n     into the faces of men who would have killed me if I'd driven \n     past their IED (improvised explosive device) an hour later. \n     I've looked at men who've killed two people I knew, and saw \n     fear.\n       ``I've seen that, sadly, that men who try to kill other men \n     aren't monsters, and most of them aren't even brave--they \n     aren't defiant to the last--they're ordinary people. Men are \n     men, and that's it. I've prayed for a man to make a move \n     toward the wire, so I could flip my weapon off safe and put \n     two rounds in his chest--if I could beat my platoon \n     sergeant's shotgun to the punch.

IED, small arms, mortars! One KIA, three WIA!' Then \n     a burst of staccato gunfire and a frantic cry: Red 1, where \n     are you?

I've cleaned up \n     blood and brains so my soldiers wouldn't see it--taken \n     pictures to document the scene, like I'm in some sort of \n     bizarre cop show on TV.\n       ``I've heard gunfire and hit the ground, heard it and \n     closed my Humvee door, and heard it and just looked and \n     figured it was too far off to worry about. I've seen men \n     stacked up outside a house, ready to enter--some as scared as \n     they could be, and some as calm as if they were picking up \n     lunch from McDonald's. I've laughed at dead men, and watched \n     a sergeant on the ground, laughing so hard he was crying, \n     because my boots were stuck in a muddy field, all the while \n     an Iraqi corpse was not five feet from him.\n       ``I've heard men worry about civilians, and I've heard men \n     shrug and sum up their viewpoint in two words--`F - - - 'em.' \n     I've seen people shoot when they shouldn't have, and I've \n     seen my soldiers take an extra second or two, think about it, \n     and spare somebody's life.\n       ``I've bought drinks from Iraqis while new units watched in \n     wonder from their trucks, pointing weapons in every \n     direction, including the Iraqis my men were buying a Pepsi \n     from.

I've laughed as other units sit terrified in traffic, \n     fingers nervously on triggers, while my soldiers and I deftly \n     whip around, drive on the wrong side of the road, and wave to \n     Iraqis as we pass. I can recognize a Sadiqqi (Arabic for \n     friend) from a Haji (Arabic word for someone who has made the \n     pilgrimage to Mecca, but our word for a bad guy); I know who \n     to point my weapons at, and who to let pass.\n       ``I've come in from my third 18-hour patrol in as many days \n     with a full beard and stared at a major in a pressed uniform \n     who hasn't left the wire since we've been here, daring him to \n     tell me to shave.

Mr. President, the bipartisan list of supporters for \nextending the Federal Assault Weapons Ban continues to grow longer and \neven more influential. This week, former Presidents Gerald Ford, Jimmy \nCarter, and Bill Clinton sent a joint letter to President Bush urging \nhim to spur Congress to act to extend this important gun safety law. \nThe former Presidents make an already impressive group of supporters \neven more remarkable.\n  The reauthorization of this law already has the support of America's \nlaw enforcement community, gun safety organizations, millions of moms \nand countless others. The message of the former Presidents is simple: \nthe assault weapons ban works. They wrote to President Bush: ``Each of \nus, along with President Reagan, worked hard in support of this vital \nlaw, and it would be a grave mistake if it were allowed to sunset.''\n\n[[Page S8024]]\n\n  In addition to banning 19 specific weapons, the existing ban makes it \nillegal to ``manufacture, transfer, or possess a semiautomatic'' \nfirearm that can accept a detachable magazine and has more than one of \nseveral specific military features, such as folding/telescoping stocks, \nprotruding pistol grips, bayonet mounts, threaded muzzles or flash \nsuppressors, barrel shrouds or grenade launchers. These weapons are \ndangerous and they should not be on America's streets.\n  The National Rifle Association has said that the ban is ineffective \nand unnecessary. The NRA asserts that guns labeled as assault weapons \nare rarely used in violent crimes. But this assertion is not supported \nby the facts. According to statistics reported by the Brady Campaign to \nPrevent Gun Violence, from 1990 to 1994, assault weapons named in the \nban constituted 4.82 percent of guns traced in criminal investigations. \nHowever, since the ban's enactment, these assault weapons have made up \nonly 1.61 percent of the crime-related guns traced.\n  In 1994, I voted for the assault weapons ban and in March of this \nyear I joined a bipartisan majority of the Senate in voting to extend \nthe assault weapons ban for 10 years. Unfortunately, despite Senate \npassage of the amendment, it appears that this important gun safety law \nwill be allowed to expire. The House Republican leadership opposes \nreauthorizing the law and President Bush, though he has said he \nsupports it, has done little to help keep the law alive.\n  I hope the letter from Presidents Ford, Carter and Clinton will \nprompt President Bush to act to promote the passage of the extension of \nthe Assault Weapons Ban.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter from former Presidents Ford, \nCarter and Clinton be printed in the Record.\n                                                    June 14, 2004.\n     President George W. Bush,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear President Bush: We are pleased that you support \n     reauthorization of the federal Assault Weapons Act, which is \n     scheduled to expire in September. Each of us, along with \n     President Reagan, worked hard in support of this vital law, \n     and it would be a grave mistake if it were allowed to sunset.\n       There continues to be strong support for this law among our \n     nation's police officers who risk their lives every day to \n     protect the public. That is because they remember the days, \n     prior to the enactment of the law in 1994, when military-\n     style, semiautomatic firearms had become the weapons of \n     choice for gangs, drug traffickers, and paramilitary \n     extremist groups. The firearm death rate soared as criminals \n     used these weapons, outfitted with 20, 50 and even hundred \n     round ammunition clips, to kill, maim, and terrorize. We \n     cannot go back to those days.\n       At a time when terrorism continues to be a serious threat, \n     it is even more imperative that we renew the Assault Weapons \n     Act and limit access to military-style weapons and high-\n     capacity ammunition clips. But with upcoming recesses, there \n     are not many legislative days left for Congress to renew the \n     law. We urge you to make reauthorization of the Assault \n     Weapons Act a top priority for your Administration and spur \n     Congress to action. If we can be of assistance to you in this \n     regard, we are ready to do so.\n       Sincerely,\n     Gerald R. Ford.\n     Bill Clinton.\n     Jimmy Carter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/13/senate-section/article/S8024-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8024-S8025]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NATIONAL VETERANS AWARENESS WEEK\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, last week I had the honor of joining with \n52 of my colleagues in introducing a resolution, S. Res. 401, \nexpressing the sense of the Senate that the week that includes \nVeterans' Day this year be designated as ``National Veterans Awareness \nWeek.'' This marks the fifth year in a row that I have introduced such \na resolution, which has been adopted unanimously by the Senate on all \nprevious occasions.\n  The purpose of National Veterans Awareness Week is to serve as a \nfocus for educational programs designed to make students in elementary \nand secondary schools aware of the contributions of veterans and their \nimportance in preserving American peace and prosperity. This goal takes \non particular importance and immediacy this year as we find ourselves \nagain with uniformed men and women in harm's way in foreign lands.\n  Why do we need such an educational effort? In a sense, this action \nhas become necessary because we are victims of our own success with \nregard to the superior performance of our armed forces. The plain fact \nis that there are just fewer people around now who have had any \nconnection with military service. For example, as a result of \ntremendous advances in military technology and the resultant \nproductivity increases, our current armed forces now operate \neffectively with a personnel roster that is one-third less in size than \njust 15 years ago. In addition, the success of the all-volunteer \ncareer-oriented force has led to much lower turnover of personnel in \ntoday's military than in previous eras when conscription was in place. \nFinally, the number of veterans who served during previous conflicts, \nsuch as World War II, when our military was many times larger than \ntoday, is inevitably declining.\n  The net result of these changes is that the percentage of the entire \npopulation that has served in the Armed Forces is dropping rapidly, a \nchange that can be seen in all segments of society. Whereas during \nWorld War II it was extremely uncommon to find a family in America that \ndid not have one of its members on active duty, now there are numerous \nfamilies that include no military veterans at all. Even though the \nIraqi war has been prominently discussed on television and in the \nnewspapers, many of our children are much more preoccupied with the \nusual concerns of young people than with keeping up with the events of \nthe day. As a consequence, many of our youth still have little or no \nconnection with or knowledge about the important historical and ongoing \nrole of men and women who have served in the military. This omission \nseems to have persisted despite ongoing educational efforts by the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs and the veterans service organizations.\n  This lack of understanding about military veterans' important role in \nour society can have potentially serious repercussions. In our country, \ncivilian control of the armed forces is the key tenet of military \ngovernance. A citizenry that is oblivious to the capabilities and \nlimitations of the armed forces, and to its critical role throughout \nour history, can make decisions that have unexpected and unwanted \nconsequences. Even more important, general recognition of the \nimportance of those individual character traits that are essential for \nmilitary success, such as patriotism, selflessness, sacrifice, and \nheroism, is vital to maintaining these key aspects of citizenship in \nthe armed forces and even throughout the population at large.\n\n  The failure of our children to understand why a military is \nimportant, why our society continues to depend on it for ultimate \nsurvival, and why a successful military requires integrity and \nsacrifice, will have predictable consequences as these youngsters \nbecome of voting age. Even though military service is a responsibility \nthat is no longer shared by a large segment of the population, as it \nhas been in the past, knowledge of the contributions of those who have \nserved in the Armed Forces is as important as it has ever been. To the \nextent that many of us will not have the opportunity to serve our \ncountry in uniform, we must still remain cognizant of our \nresponsibility as citizens to fulfill the obligations we owe, both \ntangible and intangible, to those who do serve and who do sacrifice on \nour behalf.\n  The importance of this issue was brought home to me five years ago by \nSamuel I. Cashdollar, who was then a 13-year-old seventh grader at \nLewes Middle School in Lewes, DE. Samuel won the Delaware VFW's Youth \nEssay Contest that year with a powerful presentation titled ``How \nShould We Honor America's Veterans''? Samuel's essay pointed out that \nwe have Nurses' Week, Secretaries' Week, and Teachers' Week, to rightly \nemphasize the importance of these occupations, but the contributions of \nthose in uniform tend to be overlooked. We don't want our children \ngrowing up to think that Veterans Day has simply become a synonym for \ndepartment store sale, and we don't want to become a nation where more \nhigh school seniors recognize the name Britney Spears than the name \nDwight Eisenhower.\n  National Veterans Awareness Week complements Veterans Day by focusing \non education as well as commemoration, on the contributions of the many \nin addition to the heroism and service\n\n[[Page S8025]]\n\nof the individual. National Veterans Awareness Week also presents an \nopportunity to remind ourselves of the contributions and sacrifices of \nthose who have served in peacetime as well as in conflict; both groups \nwork unending hours and spend long periods away from their families \nunder conditions of great discomfort so that we all can live in a land \nof freedom and plenty.\n  Mr. President, last year, my resolution designating National Veterans \nAwareness Week had 66 cosponsors and was approved in the Senate by \nunanimous consent. Responding to that resolution, President Bush issued \na proclamation urging our citizenry to observe National Veterans \nAwareness Week. I ask my colleagues to continue this trend of support \nfor our veterans by endorsing this resolution again this year. Our \nchildren and our children's children will need to be well informed \nabout what veterans have accomplished in order to make appropriate \ndecisions as they confront the numerous worldwide challenges that they \nare sure to face in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/13/senate-section/article/S8025-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8025]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          VICTIMS OF DRUNKEN DRIVERS MEMORIAL WALL FOUNDATION\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, in April of 2000, more than one hundred \npeople gathered to dedicate a memorial for the victims of drunk \ndriving. The memorial, created by The Victims of Drunken Drivers \nMemorial Wall Foundation, was constructed in Pacific Memorial Park in \nthe city of Anaheim. The Victims of Drunk Drivers Memorial Wall has \nhelped people remember those who were tragically lost, brought comfort \nto loved ones, educated the public and taught valuable lessons to \nstudents about this senseless crime. I salute the founders and the many \nvolunteers who helped create this memorial.\n  In 2003, 17,401 people died in alcohol-related motor vehicle crashes. \nIt is estimated that alcohol-related crashes kill someone every 30 \nminutes. The memorial reminds us that these victims are real people \nwith families and loved ones left behind.\n  The Victims of Drunken Drivers Memorial Wall Foundation has honored \nvictims and raised awareness since the year 2000. A wide range of \nindividuals contributed to the memorial and helped make the project a \nsuccess. For 4 years they contacted the thousands of families who lost \nloved ones and accepted small contributions to successfully raise \n$25,000. Law enforcement agencies have educated area children about \ndrunk driving using the memorial and have held sessions at the \nmemorial.\n  Judges also require convicted drunk drivers to visit the memorial and \nreflect on their actions.\n  I commend The Victims of Drunken Drivers Memorial Wall Foundation for \ntheir hard work. The memorial continues to reach families and serves as \na constant reminder of the consequences of drunk driving. I wish the \nfoundation continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/13/senate-section/article/S8025-2", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8025]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n         HONORING THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF MELISSA GAYLE BRIDGES\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

Mr. President, I rise today to address the \nongoing humanitarian crisis in Darfur. The facts in this case are, in \nmy view, clear. Sudanese refugees have been flooding into Chad as a \nresult of the coordinated policies of local militias and the Government \nof Sudan. The conditions that have forced the refugees to flee their \nhome and their country are beyond horrific, including systematic \nmurder, rape, torture, and abduction. Although it is impossible to know \nthe exact figures, up to 30,000 individuals have been killed and over a \nmillion have been displaced. The United States, the United Nations, and \nmany international organizations are predicting that over a million \nwill die with the change of seasons in the region, the lack of food and \nwater, and the onset of disease.\n  At a minimum, these atrocities amount to ethnic cleansing on the part \nof the local militias and the Sudanese Government. At worst, they \nconstitute genocide. In either case, the atrocities should have been \nstopped much earlier. Furthermore, they can and should be stopped now.\n  Within the last few weeks, U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell and \nU.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan have visited the region. I consider \nthis an extremely belated effort on the part of the United States and \nthe United Nations to address a series of problems that were both \npredictable and preventable. Unfortunately, the administration's \nattention and resources are so focused elsewhere that it lost sight of \na humanitarian crisis of catastrophic proportions. Sadly, Sudan is \nwhere it is today because no one at a high level felt the region and \nits people mattered enough to pay attention and do something. Sadly, \nthe administration only paid attention when Congress wrote letters in \nJune--letters that I signed--requesting that they do so.\n  These letters--one to President Bush and one to Secretary-General \nAnnan--requested that very specific steps be undertaken to stop the \ncurrent crisis, in particular committing additional human and financial \nresources to the region, identifying the individuals and governments \nresponsible for the actions, requiring a U.N. Security Council \nresolution that condemns the atrocities that have occurred, and \ndelineating a viable multilateral effort to bring them to an end.\n  Let me emphasize that at present there are 260 individuals in Sudan \nattempting to monitor the crisis, this in a region the size of the \nState of Texas. The brutality continues unabated because the collective \nwill to stop it has been nonexistent. It is time for President Bush to \nsay clearly what his intentions are. It is time to offer a clear \nstrategy. It is time for him to make this a priority. It is time to \norganize international action to bring the crisis to an end.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/13/senate-section/article/S8025-4", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8025-S8026]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MARGUERITE'S PLACE CELEBRATES ITS 10TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of a \nremarkable organization in Nashua, NH. For the past 10 years, \nMarguerite's Place, Inc. has provided safe, affordable housing for \nwomen and their children. More importantly, it has been a critical stop \non the road for those families who are fighting to rebuild their lives \nand brighten their futures.\n  Although there are many words which can be used to describe \nMarguerite's Place, the one which best captures why it is so special is \n``Hope''. During my first visit in 1997 and on countless others I have \nmade since then, I have been amazed by the overwhelming positive spirit \nfilling every room there. The women who have come to Marguerite's Place \nhave been through very difficult situations and yet they are actively \nreaching to retake control of their world. In almost all cases, they \nsucceed. Of course, the reason for this impressive track record is the \nstaff and supporters do not let them fail. Marguerite's Place gives \nthese women a warm and safe home, the needed assistance in finishing \nschool or launching a career and an energetic daycare center for their \nchildren. Most of all, these women learn they have unique abilities and \nskills which will take them far. In short, they are given the hope they \nneed to take back their lives.\n  One of my favorite spots at Marguerite's Place is the child care \ncenter.\n\n[[Page S8026]]\n\nMany of the children there have probably been homeless for a time or \nhave experienced situations no child should be forced to endure. But, \nwatching them playing together in the center and interacting with each \nother and their teachers, it is easy to sense they have found a home. \nIt is here where one can witness the fundamental impact Marguerite's \nPlace is having on the greater Nashua community. Through their programs \nand support, the staff here pass on to our youngest generation of \ncitizens the feeling they too have a wide open future.\n  The leader of Marguerite's Place, and its heart and soul, is Sister \nSharon Walsh. Her firm commitment to insuring the residents meet the \nexpectations set for them is near legendary. Yet, she is profoundly \nupbeat in her vision that people can change for the better. She is \ncontinually seeking ways they can be part of the American Dream. It is \nthis combination of optimism and determination that make Sister Sharon \nso inspirational. In turn, her enthusiasm is what makes Marguerite's \nPlace so unique and so effective. Of course, Sister Sharon is modest \nand would deflect much of the praise and credit to her staff for the \nsuccesses they have achieved. In my conversations with them, I have \nlearned they share Sister Sharon's vision and skill in bringing out the \nbest in people. Sister Elaine Fahey, for example, runs the daycare \ncenter. It is obvious the children love her and view her as a role \nmodel.\n  So, as Marguerite's Place celebrates its 10th anniversary this year, \nI want to thank Sister Sharon, her staff and all the supporters for the \nremarkable work they have done to restore dignity and self-esteem to \nthose who may have lost it. They have made Nashua a better place to \nlive. I am proud to be a supporter of Marguerite's Place and am happy \nto extend my deepest wishes for continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/13/senate-section/article/S8026-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8026]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       IN RECOGNITON OF THE MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY DEBATE TEAM\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to recognize the tremendous accomplishment of Michigan \nState University and its debate team. On April 6, 2004, Michigan State \nUniversity won the National Debate Tournament hosted by Catholic \nUniversity in Washington, DC. This date was a milestone in that it \nmarked the first National Championship awarded to the Michigan State \nSpartans in the field of debate. In addition, the Spartans demonstrated \nthe high quality of Michigan's public institutions of education, as it \nwas only the third occasion in 20 years that a public university has \nwon the title.\n  During the tournament, the Spartans defeated many of the Nations' \nmost respected academic universities. These include Harvard, Dartmouth, \nEmory, Northwestern, and finally, long-time rival UC Berkeley in the \nchampionship match. It is also worth noting that Michigan State was \nrepresented by two separate teams in the tournaments final four. \nHowever, as they were matched against one another, the higher ranked \nteam advanced while the other willingly conceded.\n  In the final round, the Spartan team consisting of Dave Strauss and \nGreta Stahl, defeated the team from Berkeley that was ranked No. 1 \noverall entering the tournament. Michigan State was declared the winner \n4-1 by the 5 judges scoring the debate. The Sigurd S. Larmon Memorial \nTrophy is awarded annually to the National Debate Tournament Champion \nand will remain in East Lansing until the 2005 tournament.\n  Michigan State University's debate team, led by head coach Will \nRepko, is now the reigning national champion. This accomplishment was \nmade possible through the hard work and dedication of all those who \nsupport Michigan State's debate program.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of my \nfellow Hoosier, Reverend Charles Williams, who lost his battle with \ncancer on Monday, July 12, 2004. Reverend Williams dedicated his life \nto serving our state of Indiana by bringing together the Hoosier \ncommunity and demanding of everyone the potential greatness that he saw \nin us all.\n  Reverend Charles Williams was born in Indianapolis in 1948. From a \nhumble upbringing in Indiana and Chicago, Reverend Williams returned to \nhis home town as an adult to become one of the city's most respected \ncivic leaders, using every life lesson and experience, including his \nbattle with cancer, to improve the quality of life for Indiana's \nAfrican-American community and for all Hoosiers across the state.\n  Reverend Charles Williams served his country first for 3 years as a \nmember of the U.S. Navy and then as the executive coordinator for the \nNational Association for the Advancement of Colored People's national \nconvention in Indianapolis. Following his work with the NAACP, he was \nappointed special assistant for then-Mayor William Hudnut. It was from \nhere that Reverend Williams received an invitation to help a struggling \nIndiana African-American association, marking the beginning of his work \nwith what would become his lasting legacy and crowning achievement, the \nIndiana Black Expo.\n  Through his work with the Indiana Black Expo, from the early 1980s \nuntil his death this summer, Reverend Williams turned the Expo into a \nfull-fledged community organization that promoted greater education, \ncooperation and opportunity for all Hoosiers. What began as a single-\nevent celebration has grown into a year-round operation, with the \nSummer Celebration described today as one of the Top 100 Events in \nNorth America. Reverend Charles Williams was tireless in his efforts to \nmake a better life for Hoosiers. Even during his 2-year battle with \ncancer, he used his experience to educate other men about the \nimportance of cancer screening.\n  The 34th annual Black Expo Summer Celebration is taking place this \nweek in Indianapolis. This year, the celebration will take on greater \nmeaning, as a celebration not only of the strong community that has \nbeen built in Indiana, but a celebration of the man who did the \nbuilding. While the sense of loss to all those who knew Reverend \nCharles Williams is tremendous, the energy and selflessness with which \nhe faced this and every challenge in his life remains as an example to \nall of us who are left behind to carry on his work.\n  It is my honor to enter the name of Reverend Charles Williams into \nthe Congressional Record.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/13/senate-section/article/S8026-3", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8026-S8027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 IN MEMORY OF REVEREND CHARLES WILLIAMS\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I pay heartfelt tribute to the \nReverend Charles Williams, a visionary Hoosier friend who passed away \nyesterday at the age of 56.\n  I have looked forward to visiting with Charles Williams for many \nyears. His dynamic leadership was best exemplified through his work \nleading the Indiana Black Expo, Inc., a not-for-profit community \nservice organization comprised of ten chapters throughout the State of \nIndiana. Since 1983, he has been an effective advocate of an expanding \nnumber of Indiana Black Expo programs.\n  His accomplishments included founding the Circle City Classic \nfootball game, an annual event that raises funds for minority college \nscholarships. Most recently, Reverend Williams has worked diligently to \ninform men, especially African-American men, on the importance of \nprostate cancer screening. Afflicted with this terrible disease, he \nshared his personal testimony on struggles with prostate cancer in an \neffort to encourage other men to consider personal healthcare more \nseriously.\n  The Indiana Black Expo was founded in 1970, while I served as Mayor \nof Indianapolis. Each year, the Indiana Black Expo hosts the Summer \nCelebration. Currently underway, this event is the longest-running \ncultural showcase of\n\n[[Page S8027]]\n\nits kind nationwide. I look forward to visiting, once again, with \nthousands of attendees in Indianapolis this weekend.\n  I am honored to have this opportunity to pay tribute to the life of \nReverend Charles Williams. At this difficult time, my thoughts and \nprayers go out to his family and friends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/13/senate-section/article/S8027-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT COLONEL HANG CHAO\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to the \nlife and work of a truly remarkable American and long-time Detroit \nresident, Hang Chao. Born in 1939 in the city of Pha Leong, XiengKhoua \nProvince, in Laos, he was among the thousands of Hmong young men who \ngave their support to the United States during the Vietnam war. By \njoining with American soldiers to fight against Lao and Viet communists \nin the jungles of Laos, these young men put their lives at risk. In the \nface of considerable personal risk, the heroism of these brave men \nsaved countless American soldiers. Hang Chao continued his strong stand \ndefending and promoting democracy throughout his life and leaves a \nlegacy of selfless dedication to helping and enriching the lives of \nothers. His family, colleagues, and many friends mourned his death in \nOctober 2003, and he will be remembered as a man of honor and goodwill, \nwhose heroism and deep faith inspired all who knew him.\n  During the Vietnam war, Hang Chao trained in the Lao Royal Army and \nrose through its ranks. He was appointed lieutenant colonel by General \nOun Latikun and Prime Minister Souvanhna of Laos. During his service, \nhe earned the respect of his peers and leaders because of his courage, \nprincipled leadership, and devotion to democracy. The Lao government in \nexile honored him in 1982 by appointing him Deputy Minister of \nInterior. Ten years later, Hang Chao was appointed Advisor to the King \nof Laos, LangXang Houng Kau, government in exile.\n  Hang Chao immigrated to the United States with his family after the \nwar. He valued learning and education and earned a Bachelor of Science \ndegree in political science while making a new life for himself and his \nfamily in Michigan. While he spoke Hmong and English fluently, he was \nalso fluent in Tao, Lao, and French. He was committed to the Hmong \ncommunity, and his active leadership helped pave the way for many Hmong \nrefugees to assimilate into American life. Hang Chao was also a devout \nChristian and was elected elder in ten Hmong churches. His faith, \nfamily, and commitment to public service guided his vision of community \ngrowth and the promotion of cultural understanding of the Hmong \nheritage. Hang Chao was a loving husband to his wife of 50 years, Mia \nLee Vang, and a nurturing father to his five children, Tou Yi, Tou \nChue, Mai, Youa, and Pang Nhia.\n  I would like to express my admiration for the life story and the \naccomplishments of Hang Chao. We can all benefit from his example of \ncourage, perseverance and leadership. He has left an indelible mark on \nhis community, and his family can be proud of his legacy. I know my \nSenate colleagues join me in paying tribute to Hang Chao.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/13/senate-section/article/S8027-2", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:28 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 4380.

A bill to recognize conservation efforts to restore the \nAmerican bison from extinction by placing the image of the American \nbison on the nickel, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, today I join with my friend and colleague \nfrom the State of Colorado to introduce the Bison Nickel Restoration \nAct of 2004 to bring the image of the American bison back to the 5-cent \ncoin.\n  The American bison is one of the most powerful symbols of the \nAmerican West. Meriwether Lewis and William Clark encountered many \nbison on their western expedition. Native Americans in the Great Plains \nStates have held the American bison as one of the most sacred animals, \nas it represents a spiritual being supplying everything necessary to \nsurvive. The bison also is an enduring symbol of the growth of the \nUnited States westward. The symbol of the bison is so powerful that the \nState of Wyoming has put its image on the State flag and the U.S. \nDepartment of the Interior uses the bison image on its official seal.\n  Many don't realize how close we came to losing this important animal. \nAt one time, the American bison population was conservatively estimated \nat 60,000,000 strong. In the early 1900's, the worldwide bison \npopulation fell below 1000 and was virtually extinct. At that time, \nless than 100 free-range bison existed and there remained only 29 bison \nunder Federal Government control, 21 in Yellowstone National Park and \neight in the National Zoo in Washington, DC.\n  However, the restoration of the bison herds is one of the most \nshining examples of conservation efforts of our Nation's history. From \nthe dwindling number of bison in the early 1900's, it is anticipated \nthat the North American bison herd will surpass half of a million in \nthe next year. In addition, the bison herd of 21 in Yellowstone \nNational Park has now grown to more than 4,000 bison. It is the largest \nfree-range bison herd in the United States.\n\n  The conservation effort of the bison began in the early 1900's. At \nthat time, the American Bison Society was formed with President Teddy \nRoosevelt as its honorary president. Soon, we will be celebrating the \ncentennial anniversary in 2008 of the signing into law by President \nRoosevelt of the creation of the National Bison Range. While Federal \nefforts to restore the bison have been beyond our expectations, a very \nlarge part of the successful restoration of the bison herd is due to \nthe private sector. Today, bison can be found in all 50 States, \nincluding Hawaii. Many anticipate that the bison population may pass 1 \nmillion by the end of the decade.\n  Today, the bison ranching sector has become a viable business for \nmany small- and medium-sized ranchers. According to a recent U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture census, Wyoming ranches raised 12,580 bison \nfor agricultural purposes during 2002. Restoring the bison to our \ncoinage is a fitting tribute, especially during this July, which is \nNational Bison Month.\n  A fitting honor for the American bison would be to restore the image \non the back of the nickel. This not only would honor the restoration of \nthe bison herd but it would be a symbol of the West. It is my hope that \nthe millions of bison nickels would inspire school children to \nrecognize the importance of our western heritage, the importance of the \nbison in Native American culture, and the importance of the public/\nprivate efforts to restore the American bison. While our Nation's \nsymbol is the bald eagle, there is little doubt that the symbol of the \nwest is the American bison.\n  The Bison Nickel Restoration Act of 2004 would restore the American \n5-Cent Coin Design Continuity Act of 2003 to its original three-year \ntime frame. Due to the late passage of this law, the U.S. Mint was \nunable to mint newly designed nickels for 2003. In addition, our bill \nwould require that one of the new images on the reverse of the nickel \nbe of an American bison. I can think of no more fitting tribute to the \nrestoration of the American bison herd than to restore the image of the \nbison on the back of the nickel.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2641\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Bison Nickel Restoration Act \n     of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the American bison is one of the most enduring symbols \n     of the expedition of Meriwether Lewis and William Clark;\n       (2) Native Americans in the Great Plains States have held \n     the American bison as one of the most sacred animals, as it \n     represents a spiritual being supplying everything necessary \n     to survive;\n       (3) the American bison continues to be a symbol of Western \n     States and the growth of the United States westward in the \n     19th century;\n       (4) the population of the American bison herd has been \n     restored from near extinction levels due to exceptional \n     conservation efforts;\n       (5) the American bison herd, which once numbered \n     approximately 60,000,000 fell below 100 for free-range bison \n     in the early 1900s;\n       (6) at the time, only 21 American bison were living in \n     Yellowstone National Park, and 8 in the National Zoo in \n     Washington, DC;\n       (7) the conservation efforts to restore the American bison \n     officially began with the efforts of President Theodore \n     Roosevelt with the American Bison Society in 1905, the first \n     United States conservation effort to restore a single species \n     from extinction;\n       (8) the centennial of the signing into law by President \n     Roosevelt of the creation of the National Bison Range in \n     Montana will take place on May 23, 2008; and\n       (9) in 2004, the bison herd in North America is anticipated \n     to surpass 500,000, and the American Bison has been restored \n     and has become a viable commercial ranching enterprise for \n     many small- and medium-sized ranchers.\n\n     SEC. 3. BISON COIN AUTHORITY EXTENSION.\n\n        Section 101 of the American 5-Cent Coin Design Continuity \n     Act of 2003 (31 U.S.C. note) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``and 2005'' each place that term appears, \n     other than in subsection (b)(2), and inserting ``, 2005, and \n     2006''; and\n       (2) in subsection (b)(2), by adding at the end the \n     following: ``If the Secretary of the Treasury elects to \n     change the reverse of the 5-cent coins issued during 2006, \n     one of the designs selected shall depict the image of an\n\n[[Page S8032]]\n\n     American bison as part of such emblematic images.''.\n\n     SEC. 4. EXTENSION OF THE AMERICAN 5-CENT COIN DESIGN \n                   CONTINUITY ACT OF 2003.\n\n       Section 5112(d)(1) of title 31, United States Code, is \n     amended in the 5th sentence, by striking ``December 31, \n     2005'' and inserting ``December 31, 2006''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN:\n  S. 2642. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to deter \nthe smuggling of tobacco products into the United States, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Smuggled Tobacco \nPrevention Act of 2004, and Representative Doggett of Texas is \nintroducing identical legislation in the House of Representatives.\n  As many of my colleagues know, I have long believed that we must do \neverything we can to help protect our children from becoming addicted \nto tobacco. Whether a child is in Bend, OR or in Bangladesh, that child \nshould be able to grow up tobacco-free.\n  Cigarettes are the world's most smuggled legal consumer product. \nTobacco smuggling contributes to the availability of cheap cigarettes \nand not only deprives governments of needed revenue, but harms the \nhealth of our citizens and of people around the world. Last month the \nU.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives reported that \nthey have more than 300 open cases of illicit cigarette trafficking, up \nfrom only a handful five years ago. Some of those cases have been \nlinked to the funding of terrorism.\n  In our country traffickers buy a large volume of cigarettes in States \nwhere the cigarette tax is low, and take them to States with higher \ntaxes and sell them at a discount without paying the higher cigarette \ntax in those States. That illegal activity deprives States and \nlocalities of funds needed for schools, policing, and roads.\n  With better labeling, tracing, and record-keeping we believe we can \nend this illegal activity. Our legislation takes those common sense \nsteps and requires that individual product packages be marked with the \ndestination and that bonds be posted until we are assured that the \ntobacco product has reached its destination. The legislation would \nrequire record keeping and making those records available for \ninspection. The Smuggled Tobacco Prevention Act also provides whistle-\nblower protection for those who help authorities in locating smuggling \nactivity.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in strengthening our laws against \ncigarette smuggling because it is good health policy, and it is sound \nfiscal policy and good leadership to do so.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2642\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; AMENDMENT OF 1986 CODE.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Smuggled \n     Tobacco Prevention Act of 2004''.\n\n          TITLE I--AMENDMENTS TO INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986\n\n     SEC. 101. AMENDMENT OF 1986 CODE.\n\n       Except as otherwise expressly provided, whenever in this \n     title an amendment or repeal is expressed in terms of an \n     amendment to, or repeal of, a section or other provision, the \n     reference shall be considered to be made to a section or \n     other provision of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n\n     SEC. 102.

A bill to provide for fire safety standards for cigarettes, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportations\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Cigarette \nFire Safety Act of 2004. Joe Moakley started his effort to require less \nfire-prone cigarettes in 1979 and championed this issue until his death \nin May of 2001. I am here to finish what he started.\n  The statistics regarding cigarette-related fires are startling. \nCigarette-ignited fires account for an estimated 140,800 fires in the \nUnited States. Such fires cause more than 900 deaths and 2,400 injuries \neach year. Annually, more than $400 million in property damage is \nreported due to a fire caused by a cigarette. According to the National \nFire Protection Association, one out of every four fire deaths in the \nUnited States are attributed to tobacco products--by far the leading \ncause of civilian deaths in fires. Overall, the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission estimates that the cost of the loss of human life and \npersonal property from not having a fire-safe cigarette standard is \napproximately $4.6 billion per year.\n  In my State of Illinois, cigarette-related fires have also caused too \nmany senseless tragedies. In 1998 alone, the most recent year for which \nwe have data, there were more than 1,700 cigarette-related fires, of \nwhich more than 900 were in people's homes. These fires led to 109 \ninjuries and 8 deaths.\n  Tobacco companies spend billions on marketing and learning how to \nmake cigarettes appealing to kids. It is not unreasonable to ask those \nsame companies to invest in safer cigarette paper to make their \nproducts less likely to burn down a house. The State of New York has \ntaken the first step, and by June 2004, all cigarettes sold in the \nState will be tested for fire safety and required to self-extinguish. \nIt is time to establish a national standard to ensure that our nation's \nchildren, elderly and families are protected.\n  The Cigarette Fire Safety Act of 2004 requires the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission to promulgate a fire safety standard, specified in \nthe legislation, for cigarettes. The CPSC would also have the authority \nto regulate the\n\n[[Page S8035]]\n\nignition propensity of cigarette paper for roll-your-own tobacco \nproducts. The Act gives the Consumer Product Safety Commission \nauthority over cigarettes only for purposes of implementing and \nenforcing compliance with this Act and with the standard promulgated \nunder the Act. It also allows states to pass more stringent fire-safety \nstandards for cigarettes.\n  When Joe Moakley set out more than two decades ago to ensure that the \ntragic cigarette-caused fire that killed five children and their \nparents in Westwood, MA was not repeated, he made a difference. He \nintroduced three bills, two of which passed. One commissioned a study \nthat concluded it was technically feasible to produce a cigarette with \na reduced propensity to start fires. The second required that the \nNational Institute of Standards and Technology develop a test method \nfor cigarette fire safety, and the last and final bill, the Fire-Safe \nCigarette Act of 1999, mandates that the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission use this knowledge to regulate cigarettes with regard to \nfire safety.\n  Today I am here to reintroduce Moakley's bill and to accomplish what \nhe set out to do. I hope that the Commerce Committee will consider this \nlegislation expeditiously and that my colleagues will join me in \nsupporting this effort. Joe waited long enough. Let's get this done for \nhim.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 2645. A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to authorize \nappropriations for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce The Public \nBroadcasting Reauthorization Act of 2004. This legislation is designed \nto reauthorize the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB or ``the \nCorporation'') through 2011 to carry forth its mission to support the \nNation's public broadcasting system. This private, non-profit \ncorporation has not been reauthorized since 1996.\n  In 1967, Congress created the Corporation, declaring, ``It is in the \npublic interest to encourage the growth and development of public radio \nand television broadcasting, including the use of such media for \ninstructional, educational and cultural purposes.'' Today, the primary \nfunction of the CPB is to receive and distribute governmental funds to \nstations, develop national programming, and maintain universal access \nto public broadcasting's educational programs and services through 356 \npublic television stations and almost 800 public radio stations.\n  In addition to authorizing the Corporation, the bill would explicitly \nprovide public broadcast stations the ability to use CPB funds to \nproduce local programming. An April 2004 General Accounting Office \n(GAO) report noted that 79 percent of the public television stations \nsurveyed found that the amount of local programming they currently \nproduce is not sufficient to meet local community needs. Eighty-five \npercent of the stations surveyed stated that they do not have adequate \nfunds for local programming or that they would produce more local \nprogramming if they could obtain additional sources of funding. The \nbill would provide the Corporation the explicit authority to award \ngrants for the production and acquisition of local programming and \nallow stations to use CPB funds supporting the digital transition to \nproduce local digital programming.\n  Furthermore, the bill would expand the definition of public \ntelecommunications services to capture the services public broadcasters \nare now providing through their web sites and through digital \nmulticasting. The bill would also allow CPB to recoup some federal \nfunds provided to a public broadcast station if the broadcaster sells \nthe station to an entity that does not offer public broadcasting \nservices.\n  Reauthorization would allow the CPB to continue carrying out its many \nresponsibilities. I look forward to working with my colleagues to \nexpeditiously move this measure through the legislative process.\n  Today the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation \nheld a hearing on public broadcasting. Mr. Ken Burns, a filmmaker, \nspoke eloquently at the hearing on the benefits public broadcasting \nprovides to local communities. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat Mr. Burns' testimony and the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2645\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

I am \n     grateful that you have given me this opportunity to express \n     my thoughts. Let me say from the outset--as a film producer \n     and as a father of two daughters increasingly concerned about \n     the sometimes dangerous landscape of our television \n     environment--that I am a passionate, life-long supporter of \n     public television and its unique role in helping to stitch \n     our exquisite, diverse, and often fragile culture together.\n       Few institutions provide such a direct, grassroots way for \n     our citizens to participate in the shared glories of their \n     common past, in the power of the priceless ideals that have \n     animated our remarkable republic and our national life for \n     more than two hundred years, and in the inspirational life of \n     the mind and the heart that an engagement with the arts \n     always provides. It is my wholehearted belief that anything \n     that threatens this institution weakens our country. It is as \n     simple as that.\n       For more than 25 years I have been producing historical \n     documentary films, celebrating the special messages American \n     history continually directs our way. The subjects of these \n     films range from the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge and \n     the Statue of Liberty to the life of the turbulent demagogue \n     Huey Long; from the graceful architecture of the Shakers to \n     the early founders of radio; from the sublime pleasures and \n     unexpected lessons of our national pastime and Jazz to the \n     searing transcendent experience of our Civil War; from Thomas \n     Jefferson and Lewis and Clark to Frank Lloyd Wright, \n     Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Mark Twain. I even made a film on \n     the history of this magnificent Capitol building and the much \n     maligned institution that is charged with conducting the \n     people's business.\n       In every instance, I consciously produced these films for \n     national public television broadcast, not the commercial \n     networks or cable.\n       As an educational filmmaker, I am grateful to play even a \n     small part in an underfunded broadcasting entity with one \n     foot tenuously in the marketplace and the other decidedly and \n     proudly out, which, among dozens of fabulously wealthy \n     networks, just happens to produce--on shoestring budgets--the \n     best news and public affairs programming on television, the \n     best science and nature programming on television, the best \n     arts on television, the best children's shows on television, \n     and, some say, the best history on television.\n       When I was working more than 15 years ago on my film about \n     the Statue of Liberty, its history and powerful symbolism, I \n     had the great good fortune to meet and interview Vartan \n     Gregorian, who was then the president of the New York Public \n     Library. After an extremely interesting and passionate \n     interview on the meaning behind the statue for an immigrant \n     like him--from Tabriz, Iran--Vartan took me on a long and \n     fascinating tour of the miles of stacks of the Library. \n     Finally, after galloping down one claustrophobic corridor \n     after another, he stopped and gestured expansively. ``This,'' \n     he said, surveying his library from its guts, ``this is the \n     DNA of our civilization.''\n       I think he was saying that that library, indeed, all \n     libraries, archives, and historical societies are the DNA of \n     our society, leaving an imprint of excellence and intention \n     for generations to come. It occurs to me this morning, as we \n     consider the rich history of service and education of PBS, \n     that we must certainly include this great institution in that \n     list of the DNA of our civilization. That public television \n     is part of the great genetic legacy of our Nation. And \n     that cannot, should not, be denied us or our posterity.\n       PBS has consistently provided, with its modest resources, \n     and over more than three tumultuous decades, quite simply an \n     antidote to the vast wasteland of television programming \n     Newton Minnow so accurately described. We do things \n     differently. We are hardly a ``disappearing niche,'' as some \n     suggest, but a vibrant, galvanic force capable of sustaining \n     this experiment well into our uncertain future.\n       Some critics say that PBS is no longer needed in this \n     multi-channel universe, that our government has no business \n     in television or the arts and humanities, that we must let \n     the marketplace alone determine everything in our cultural \n     life, that a few controversial programs prove the political \n     bias of the public television community. I feel strongly that \n     I must address those assertions.\n       First let me share a few facts that might surprise you: As \n     a result of media consolidation, public stations are \n     frequently the last and only locally owned media operations \n     in their markets. Despite the exponential growth of \n     television options, 84 million people a week watch PBS--more \n     than any cable outlet. It is the number one choice of video \n     curriculum in the classroom and its non-violent, non-\n     commercial children's programs are the number one choice of \n     parents. Indeed, as commercial television continues in its \n     race to the bottom for ratings, PBS has earned the Nation's \n     trust to deliver programs that both entertain and educate and \n     that do so in a manner that the public consistently rates as \n     balanced and objective.\n       But above and beyond these facts that demonstrate the ways \n     in which PBS is more important than ever in helping to \n     address the public's needs today, there is a larger argument \n     to be made--one that is rooted in our Nation's history.\n       Since the beginning of this country, our government has \n     been involved in supporting the arts and the diffusion of \n     knowledge, which was deemed as critical to our future as \n     roads and dams and bridges. Early on, Thomas Jefferson and \n     the other founding fathers knew that the pursuit of happiness \n     did not mean a hedonistic search for pleasure in the \n     marketplace of things, but an active involvement of the mind \n     in the higher aspects of human endeavor--namely education, \n     music, the arts, and history--a marketplace of ideas. \n     Congress supported the journey of Lewis and Clark as much to \n     explore the natural, biological, ethnographic, and cultural \n     landscape of our expanding Nation as to open up a new trading \n     route to the Pacific. Congress supported numerous \n     geographical, artistic, photographic, and biological \n     expeditions to nearly every corner of the developing West. \n     Congress funded, through the Farm Securities Administration, \n     the work of Walker Evans and Dorothea Lange and other great \n     photographers who captured for posterity the terrible human \n     cost of the Depression. At the same time, Congress funded \n     some of the most enduring writing ever produced about this \n     country's people, its monuments, buildings, and back roads in \n     the still much used and admired WPA guides. Some of our \n     greatest symphonic work, our most treasured dramatic plays, \n     and early documentary film classics came from an earlier \n     Congress' support.\n       With Congress' great insight PBS was born and grew to its \n     startlingly effective maturity echoing the same time-honored \n     sense that our Government has an interest in helping to \n     sponsor Communication, Art and Education just as it sponsors \n     Commerce. We are not talking about a 100 percent sponsorship, \n     a free ride, but a priming of the pump, a way to get the \n     juices flowing, in the spirit of President Reagan's notion of \n     a partnership between the government and the private sector. \n     The Corporation for Public Broadcasting grant I got for the \n     Civil War series attracted even more funds from General \n     Motors and several private foundations; money that would not \n     have been there had not the Corporation for Public \n     Broadcasting blessed this project with their rigorously \n     earned imprimatur.\n       But there are those who are sure that without public \n     television, the so- called ``marketplace'' would take care of \n     everything; that what won't survive in the marketplace, \n     doesn't deserve to survive. Nothing could be further from the \n     truth. Because we are not just talking about the commerce of \n     a Nation. We are not just economic beings, but spiritual and \n     intellectual beings as well, and so we are talking about the \n     creativity of a Nation. Now, some forms of creativity thrive \n     in the marketplace and that is a wonderful thing, reflected \n     in our Hollywood movies and our universally popular music. \n     But let me say that the marketplace could not have made and \n     to this day could not make my Civil War series, indeed any of \n     the films I have worked on.\n       That series was shown on public television, outside the \n     marketplace, without commercial interruption, by far the \n     single most important factor for our insuring PBS's \n     continuing existence and for understanding the Civil War \n     series' overwhelming success. All real meaning in our world \n     accrues in duration; that is to say, that which we value the \n     most--our families, our work, the things we build, our art--\n     has the stamp of our focused attention. Without that \n     attention, we do not learn, we do not remember, we do not \n     care. We are not responsible citizens. Most of the rest of \n     the television environment has ignored this critical truth. \n     For several generations now, TV has disrupted our attention \n     every eight minutes (or less) to sell us five or six \n     different things, then sent us back, our ability to digest \n     all the impressions compromised in the extreme. The \n     programming on PBS in all its splendid variety, offers the \n     rarest treat amidst the outrageous cacophony of our \n     television marketplace--it gives us back our attention and \n     our memory. And by so doing, insures that we have a future.\n       The marketplace will not, indeed cannot, produce the good \n     works of PBS. Just as the\n\n[[Page S8037]]\n\n     marketplace does not come to your house at 3:00 a.m. when it \n     is on fire or patrols the dangerous ground in Afghanistan and \n     Iraq. No, the marketplace does not and will not pay for our \n     fire departments or more important our Defense Department, \n     things essential to the safety, defense and well-being of our \n     country. It takes government involvement, eleemosynary \n     institutions, individual altruism, extra-marketplace effort \n     to get these things made and done. I also know, Mr. Chairman, \n     that PBS has nothing to do with the actual defense of our \n     country, I know that--PBS, I believe with every fiber of my \n     being, just helps make our country worth defending.\n       The meat and potatoes of public television reaches out to \n     every corner of the country and touches people in positive \n     ways the Federal Government rarely does. Recent research \n     suggests that PBS is the most trusted national institution in \n     the United States. Indeed, it would be elitist itself to \n     abolish public television, to trust to the marketplace and \n     the ``natural aristocracy'' that many have promised over the \n     last two hundred years would rise up to protect us all--and \n     hasn't. Those who labor in public television are not unlike \n     those in public service who sacrifice job security, \n     commensurate pay, and who are often misunderstood by a media \n     culture infatuated by their seemingly more glamorous \n     colleagues.\n       With regard to my own films, I have been quite lucky. The \n     Civil War series was public television's highest rated \n     program and has been described as one of the best programs in \n     the history of the medium. But that show, indeed all of my \n     films produced over the last quarter of a century, are only a \n     small part, a tiny fraction, of the legacy of PBS. If public \n     television's mission is severely hampered or curtailed, I \n     suppose I will find work, but not the kind that ensures good \n     television or speaks to the overarching theme of all my \n     films--that which we Americans all hold in common. But more \n     to the point, where will the next generation of filmmakers be \n     trained? By the difficult rigorous proposal process of CPB \n     and PBS or by the ``gotcha,'' hit and run standards of our \n     commercial brethren? I hope it will be the former.\n       The former Speaker of the House of Representatives Newt \n     Gingrich spoke eloquently and often of an American people \n     poised for the twenty-first century, endowed with a shared \n     heritage of sacrifice and honor and the highest ideals \n     mankind has yet advanced, but also armed with new \n     technologies that would enable us to go forward as one \n     people. I say to all who would listen that we have in public \n     television exactly what he envisions.\n       Unfortunately, some continue to believe that public \n     television is a hot-bed of thinking outside the mainstream. I \n     wonder, though, have they ever been to a PBS station? I doubt \n     it. PBS is the largest media enterprise in the world, \n     reaching into the most remote corners of every state in the \n     Union and enriching the lives of people of all backgrounds. \n     It is also the largest educational institution in the \n     country--because of national and local services that help \n     build school readiness, support schools, provide distance \n     learning, GED prep and essential workplace skills. Local \n     public television stations are essentially conservative \n     institutions, filled with people who share the concerns of \n     most Americans and who reflect the values of their own \n     communities. And Mr. Chairman, I know many people who \n     criticize us as too conservative, too middle of the road, too \n     safe.\n       And in a free society, the rare examples of controversy \n     that may run counter to our accepted cannon, or one group's \n     accepted cannon ought to be seen as a healthy sign that we \n     are a nation tolerant of ideas, confident--as the recent tide \n     of geo-political history has shown--that the best ideas will \n     always prevail.\n       One hundred and sixty-six years ago, in 1838, well before \n     the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln challenged us to consider the \n     real threat to the country, to consider forever the real cost \n     of our inattention: ``Whence shall we expect the approach of \n     danger?'' he wrote. ``Shall some transatlantic giant step the \n     earth and crush us at a blow? Never. All the armies of Europe \n     and Asia could not by force take a drink from the Ohio River \n     or make a track in the Blue Ridge in the trial of a thousand \n     years. No, if destruction be our lot, we must ourselves be \n     its author and finisher.'' As usual, Mr. Lincoln speaks to us \n     today with the same force he spoke to his own times.\n       The real threat always and still comes from within this \n     favored land, that the greatest enemy is, as our religious \n     teachings constantly remind us, always ourselves. Today, we \n     have become so dialectically preoccupied, stressing our \n     differences; black/white, left/right, young/old, in/out, \n     good/bad, that we have forgotten to select for the mitigating \n     wisdom that reconciles these disparities into honest \n     difference and collegiality, into a sense of belonging. And \n     we long, indeed ache, for institutions that suggest how we \n     might all be bound back to the whole. PBS is one such \n     institution.\n       The clear answer is tolerance, a discipline sustained in \n     nearly every gesture and breath of the public television I \n     know. We are a Nation that loses its way only when we define \n     ourselves by what we are against not what we are for. PBS is \n     that rare forum where more often than not we celebrate what \n     we are for; celebrate, why, against all odds, we Americans \n     still agree to cohere.\n       On the other hand, we in public television must not take \n     ourselves too seriously. Sometimes our greatest strength, our \n     earnestness and seriousness, has metastasized into our \n     greatest weakness. Usually a faithful and true companion, \n     that earnestness and seriousness is sometimes worked to \n     death. And Lord, how we sometimes like to see our mission as \n     the cure. I remember once, after giving an impassioned \n     defense of what we do at PBS, a man came up to me and said \n     simply, ``It's not brain surgery, you know.'' He was right, \n     of course, but sometimes we do effect subtler changes; help \n     in quotidian ways.\n       Not too long ago, on a perfect spring day, I was walking \n     with my oldest daughter through a park in a large American \n     city on the way to her college interview. We were taking our \n     time, enjoying the first warm day of the year, when a man of \n     about thirty, dressed in a three piece suit, approached me.\n       ``You're Ken Burns.'' he asked. I nodded. ``I need to talk \n     to you about Baseball,'' he said under his breath. ``Okay.'' \n     I hesitated. Then, he blurted out: ``My brother's daughter \n     died.'' I took a step backward, stepping in front of my \n     daughter to protect her. ``Okay,'' I said tentatively. I \n     didn't know what else to say. ``SIDS.'' he said. ``Crib \n     death. She was only one.'' ``I'm so sorry,'' I said. ``I have \n     daughters.''\n       ``I didn't know what to do,'' he said in a halting, utterly \n     sad voice. ``My brother and I are very close. Then I thought \n     of your film. I went home to our mother's house, got our \n     baseball mitts, and went to my brother's. I didn't say a \n     word. I handed him his mitt and we went out into the backyard \n     and we played catch wordlessly for an hour. Then I went home. \n     . . . I just wanted to thank you.''\n       Maybe it is brain surgery.\n       Mr. Chairman, most of us here, whether we know it or not, \n     are in the business of words. And we hope with some \n     reasonable expectations that those words will last. But alas, \n     especially today, those words often evaporate, their \n     precision blunted by neglect, their insight diminished by the \n     shear volume of their ever increasing brethren, their force \n     diluted by ancient animosities that seem to set each group \n     against the other.\n       The historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. has said that we \n     suffer today from ``too much pluribus, not enough unum.'' Few \n     things survive in these cynical days to remind us of the \n     Union from which so many of our personal as well as \n     collective blessings flow. And it is hard not to wonder, in \n     an age when the present moment overshadows all else--our \n     bright past and our unknown future-- what finally does \n     endure? What encodes and stores that genetic material of our \n     civilization, passing down to the next generation--the best \n     of us--what we hope will mutate into betterness for our \n     children and our posterity.\n       PBS holds one clear answer. It is the best thing we have in \n     our television environment that reminds us why we agree to \n     cohere as a people. And that is a fundamentally good thing.\n       Nothing in our daily life offers more of the comfort of \n     continuity, the generational connection of belonging to a \n     vast and complicated American family, the powerful sense of \n     home, and the great gift of accumulated memory than does this \n     great system which honors me by counting me a member one of \n     its own.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CHAFEE (for himself, Mr. Reed, Mr. Kerry, and Mr. \n        Kennedy):\n  S. 2646. A bill to direct the Director of the National Park Service \nto prepare a report on the sustainability of the John H. Chafee \nBlackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor and the John H. \nChafee Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Commission; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CHAFEE: Mr. President, I am joined today by Senators Reed, \nKennedy and Kerry in introducing legislation that would study the \nsustainability of the John H. Chafee Blackstone River Valley National \nHeritage Corridor.\n  Established in 1986, the Blackstone Heritage Corridor recognizes the \nnational and historical significance of the Blackstone region as the \nbirthplace of the American Industrial Revolution. At the time of its \ninception, the Blackstone Corridor represented an entirely new approach \nfor the National Park Service (NPS). Instead of designating the area as \na unit of the National Park System, the Blackstone Corridor became an \ninnovative model for how the NPS could work with States and local \ncommunities in recognizing and interpreting the history and resources \nof a region. Spanning two States and encompassing twenty communities \nand half a million people, the Corridor represents a unique partnership \nbetween the NPS, the States of Rhode Island and Massachusetts, and the \nlocal communities.\n  Charged with overseeing the Corridor, federally-appointed State and \nlocal representatives form the Blackstone Corridor Commission and work \nwith the NPS to carry out the mission of preserving and interpreting \nthe\n\n[[Page S8038]]\n\nunique resources and qualities of the Blackstone Valley. During the \nCommission's tenure, strong partnerships with local governments, \nprivate investors, and community stakeholders have been formed, \nintroducing millions of dollars in private investment for heritage-\nrelated projects into the local economy. The success of the Corridor \ncan be attributed to the dedication and hard work of the NPS and the \nCorridor Commission in bringing communities together to realize the \ncommon goals of revitalized communities, historic and economic \nrestoration, and an improved environment. All this has been \naccomplished with a relatively small amount of Federal funding that has \nbeen leveraged many times over by State, local, and private sector \ndollars.\n  On a daily basis, the NPS and Corridor Commission are working \ndirectly with community stakeholders to transform the Blackstone \nCorridor; raise its economic and environmental status; and preserve the \nhistoric mill buildings, riverfronts, and town centers of the \nBlackstone River Valley. The ongoing success of the Blackstone \nCorridor, and the Federal Government's role in the region's many \ntriumphs, underscore our interest in determining a future role for the \nCorridor Commission and NPS in the Blackstone Valley beyond the \nexisting sunset date.\n  With authority for the Corridor Commission set to expire in November \n2006, we are introducing legislation today that would authorize the NPS \nto conduct a sustainability study exploring future options for the \nBlackstone Corridor. We are asking that the agency conduct this study \nwithin a one-year timeframe, utilizing annual funds that have been \nappropriated for the Commission. The John H. Chafee Blackstone River \nValley National Heritage Corridor Sustainability Study includes the \nfollowing components: An evaluation of the progress that has been made \nin accomplishing the strategies and goals set forth in the Cultural \nHeritage and Land Management Plan for the Blackstone Corridor, \nincluding historic preservation, interpretation and education, \nenvironmental recovery, recreational development, and economic \nimprovement; an analysis of the NPS's investment in the Corridor during \nits lifetime and a determination as to how these Federal funds have \nleveraged additional State, local and private sector funding; an \nanalysis of the NPS's investment in the Corridor during its lifetime \nand a determination as to how these Federal funds have leveraged \nadditional State, local and private sector funding; an anslysis of the \nCommission form of authority and management structure for the \nBlackstone Corridor; and, an identification and evaluation of options \nfor a permanent NPS designation or a State park or regional entity as a \nsustainable framework to achieve the national interest of the \nBlackstone Valley.\n  I look forward to working closely with the cosponsors of this bill, \nas well as members of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and \nmy Senate colleagues in moving this legislation forward in the months \nahead.\n  I ask by unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord as follows:\n\n                                S. 2646\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a national ocean policy, to set forth \nthe missions of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, to \nensure effective interagency coordination, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the National \nOcean Policy and Leadership Act, which is co-sponsored by my colleagues \nSenators Stevens and Inouye. The passage of this bill would mark a \nbrand new day for our oceans and an important new chapter in Federal \nmanagement of these waters.\n  Our oceans are critical to the economic and environmental security of \nour Nation. This is why I sponsored the Oceans Act of 2000, along with \nseveral of my distinguished colleagues. The Oceans Act created a \nCommission of national experts to conduct a rigorous assessment of \nocean and coastal issues and offer their recommendations for a \ncoordinated national ocean policy. The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy, \nchaired by Admiral James Watkins, released its preliminary report in \nApril and will issue its final report later this summer.\n  The Ocean Commission strongly urged us to pay more attention to our\n\n[[Page S8039]]\n\nocean planet. Our oceans cover seven-tenths of the Earth's surface and \nare home to 80 percent of all life forms on Earth, holding incredible \npromise of new medicines, technologies, and ecological resources. \nHowever, 95 percent of the deep ocean remains unexplored and the \nFederal government spends only 3.5 percent of its research budget on \noceans. Each day, more than 3,000 people move to coastal areas and \nthese population and development pressures are resulting in degraded \ncoastal habitat, polluted estuaries, and an increased risk of damage \nfrom coastal storms. Our fish stocks are being depleted, our corals are \ndying, and the number of oxygen-starved ``dead zones'' in our coastal \nwaters have doubled in the past 15 years.\n  The Ocean Commission appropriately acknowledges the importance of the \noceans to our Nation. It champions the notion that major changes are \nneeded now if we are to preserve our marine resources for future \ngenerations. Among these urgent changes is a need to invest in ocean \nresearch and education in order to lay a foundation for the future. \nEven more importantly, the report stresses the need to improve the \nmanagement framework governing our oceans and coasts, starting with the \nstrengthening of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \n(NOAA) into the Nation's premier civilian ocean agency. These were some \nof the themes Admiral Watkins testified to at hearings on the \npreliminary report before the Committees on Commerce, Science and \nTransportation and Appropriations Committee on April 22 and 23, 2004.\n\n  The preliminary recommendations of the Ocean Commission were heard \nloud and clear in the Senate. I could not be more supportive of the \nneed to strengthen NOAA and improve Federal coordination on ocean and \ncoastal issues. That is why I am pleased to be introducing the National \nOcean Policy and Leadership Act today.\n  The National Ocean Policy and Leadership Act provides a vision to \nguide this Nation's management of the oceans. It outlines a National \nOcean Policy that articulates national oceanic and atmospheric policy \ngoals to guide all federal agency activities. These include concepts \nsuch as ecosystem-based management, integration of land-water-air \nactivities, and preservation of marine biodiversity. This vision also \nincludes preserving the role of the United States as a global leader in \nocean, atmospheric and climate-related activities.\n  The National Ocean Policy and Leadership Act also provides a NOAA \nOrganic Act to strengthen, clarify and codify NOAA's missions. \nSpecifically, it confirms that NOAA is the lead federal agency \nresponsible for oceanic, weather, and atmospheric issues. Consistent \nwith the original recommendations of the 1969 Stratton Commission, the \nbill also establishes NOAA as an independent agency, and legislatively \nestablishes a coherent and accountable line office structure headed by \nthe NOAA Administrator. As recommended by the Commission, the bill \nwould also encourage NOAA to streamline its line office structure, \nfocus on integrated approaches, and organize its regional activities \naround common eco-regional boundaries. It also gives NOAA a firm hand \nin working with other agencies to reduce programmatic overlap, conflict \nand duplication.\n  Making NOAA independent is a tall order, and has raised questions \nfrom some of my colleagues, including those who believe that NOAA \nshould one day be independent. I believe in the long term, the Nation \nwill need an agency dedicated to addressing our oceanic and atmospheric \nenvironments--whether an independent NOAA or a Department of the Oceans \nand Environment. This bill thus provides for a transition period for \nreorganization of the agency, as well as a Presidential plan for future \naction. I look forward to working with our Chairman, Senator McCain, \nand other colleagues on options for moving forward on this bill that \nwill minimize disruption for the agency, but ensure we achieve our \nshared long-term goal.\n  Strengthening NOAA is only one piece of the puzzle. More than half of \nthe Federal cabinet-level departments, plus four independent agencies, \nconduct programs or activities that affect oceans and coasts. Title III \nof the bill establishes formal mechanisms to force Federal agencies to \ncoordinate budgets and programs and work cooperatively on cross-cutting \nactivities that cannot be addressed by a single agency. It establishes \na Council on Ocean Stewardship in the White House to bring Federal \nagencies together. It also adopts the Commission's recommendation of \ncreating a non-Federal Presidential Panel of Advisors on Oceans and \nClimate to provide advice to the Council and NOAA. This title also sets \nthe stage for future improvements in Federal ocean policy by directing \nthe President to submit a plan to further strengthen NOAA, including \nelevation of the agency to departmental status and by transferring \nrelevant ocean and atmospheric programs to NOAA.\n  The National Ocean Policy and Leadership Act provides the vision and \nmanagement framework to guide Federal ocean policy well into the 21st \ncentury. The valuable work of the Ocean Commission has provided us with \nan extraordinary opportunity to re-shape federal ocean policy and meet \nthe challenges that lay before us so that future generations may enjoy \nthe same marine resources we enjoy today. It is critically important \nthat we do not delay implementation of the Commission's \nrecommendations. We can start right now with passage of this bill. I \nhope our colleagues will join us in co-sponsoring this measure.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2647\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Administrator.--The term ``Administrator'' means the \n     Administrator of NOAA.\n       (2) Coastal Region.--The term ``coastal region'' means the \n     coastal zone as defined in section 304 of the Coastal Zone \n     Management Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1453) and coastal watershed \n     areas that have significant impact on such coastal zones.\n       (3) NOAA.--The term ``NOAA'' means the National Oceanic and \n     Atmospheric Administration.\n       (4) Oceans.--The term ``ocean'' includes coastal areas, the \n     Great Lakes, the seabed, subsoil, and waters of the \n     territorial sea of the United States, the waters of the \n     exclusive economic zone of the United States; the waters of \n     the high seas; and the seabed and subsoil of and beyond the \n     Outer Continental Shelf marine environment, and the natural \n     resources therein.\n       (5) Person.--The term ``person'' has the meaning given that \n     term by section 1 of title 1, United States Code, but also \n     means any State, political subdivision of a State, or agency \n     or officer thereof.\n       (6) State.--The term ``State'' means any State of the \n     United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of \n     Puerto\n\n[[Page S8040]]\n\n     Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, or any other \n     Commonwealth, territory, or possession of the United States.\n\n                     TITLE I--NATIONAL OCEAN POLICY\n\n     SEC. 101. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Covering more than two-thirds of the Earth's surface, \n     the oceans play a critical role in the global water cycle and \n     in regulating climate, sustain a large part of Earth's \n     biodiversity, provide an important source of food and a \n     wealth of other natural products, act as a frontier for \n     scientific exploration, are critical to national and economic \n     security, and provide a vital means of transportation. The \n     coastal regions of the United States have remarkably high \n     biological productivity and contribute approximately 50 \n     percent of the gross domestic product of the United States.\n       (2) The oceans and the atmosphere are susceptible to change \n     as a direct and indirect result of human activities, and such \n     changes can significantly impact the ability of the oceans \n     and atmosphere to provide the benefits upon which the Nation \n     depends. Changes in ocean and atmospheric processes could \n     affect global climate patterns, ecosystem productivity, \n     health, and biodiversity, environmental quality, national \n     security, economic competitiveness, availability of energy, \n     vulnerability to natural hazards, and transportation safety \n     and efficiency.\n       (3) Ocean resources are not infinite, and human pressure on \n     them is increasing. One half of the Nation's population lives \n     within 50 miles of the coast. If population trends continue \n     as expected, coastal development and urbanization impacts, \n     which can be substantially greater than population impacts \n     alone, will present serious environmental, energy, and water \n     challenges and increase our vulnerability to coastal hazards.\n       (4) Emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols due to human \n     activities continue to alter the oceans and atmosphere in \n     ways that are expected to affect the climate, with adverse \n     impacts on human health and the Nation's economic and \n     environmental security. In some coastal regions, air \n     deposition contributes between 30 - 50 percent of pollutant \n     loadings to such areas. Improved understanding of such \n     factors and ideas for mitigating any adverse impacts are \n     urgently needed.\n       (5) There are enormous opportunities for science and \n     technology to uncover new sources of energy, food, and \n     pharmaceuticals from the oceans, and to increase general \n     understanding of the planet including its atmosphere and \n     climate. Realization of such benefits is jeopardized by a \n     variety of activities and practices that have reduced the \n     health and productivity of ocean and atmospheric systems, \n     including pollution, unsustainable harvesting practices, \n     increasing coastal development, and proliferation of harmful \n     and invasive marine species.\n       (6) Threats to the oceans and atmosphere are exacerbated by \n     the legal and geographic fragmentation of authority within \n     the Federal government. Over half of the existing 15 \n     departments and several independent agencies conduct \n     activities and programs relating to ocean and atmosphere, \n     including climate change activities. Efforts to understand \n     and effectively address emerging ocean and atmospheric \n     problems, including through existing coordination mechanisms, \n     have not been adequate.\n       (7) Improving and coordinating Federal governance will \n     require close partnerships with States, taking into account \n     their public trust responsibilities, economic and ecological \n     interests in ocean resources, and the role of State and local \n     governments in implementation of ocean policies, and managing \n     use of coastal lands and ocean resources.\n       (8) Effective enforcement of the laws to protect and \n     enhance the marine environment, coastal security, and the \n     Nation's natural resources, particularly through marine \n     safety, fisheries enforcement, aids to navigation, and \n     hazardous materials spill response activities is needed to \n     ensure achievement of management goals, and priority should \n     be given to increasing marine enforcement and compliance \n     through coordinated Federal and State actions.\n       (9) It is the continuing mission of the Federal Government \n     to create, foster, and maintain conditions, incentives, and \n     programs that will further and assure the sustainable and \n     effective conservation, management, and protection of the \n     oceans and atmosphere, in order to fulfill the responsibility \n     of each generation as trustee in protecting, and ensuring \n     that, such resources will be available to meet the needs of \n     future generations of Americans.\n       (10) This policy and mission can best be carried out and \n     realized by formal establishment of a strengthened and \n     expanded lead Federal civilian agency dedicated to ocean and \n     atmospheric matters, and by undertaking the functions, \n     programs, and activities of the Federal Government with \n     respect to the conservation, management, and protection of \n     the oceans and atmosphere, including monitoring, forecasting, \n     and assessment, in a coordinated manner and in accordance \n     with a national ocean policy.\n\n     SEC. 102.

A bill to strengthen programs relating to ocean science and \ntraining by providing improved advice and coordination of efforts, \ngreater interagency cooperation, ad the strengthening and expansion of \nrelated programs administered by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Ocean \nResearch Coordination and Advancement Act, which is cosponsored by my \ncolleagues Senators Stevens and Inouye.\n  The oceans remain one of the least explored and understood resources \non our planet. Our Nation needs a coordinated research and education \nprogram staffed by a skilled scientific and technical workforce to \nfurther our knowledge of the oceans and ensure their health and \nvitality well into the future. NOAA, the lead civilian Federal agency \nfor oceanic and atmospheric affairs, is the linchpin to this effort. \nHowever, this is also a job that the entire Federal Government must \ntake on, since NOAA will need the cooperation and resources of a \nvariety of other Federal agencies to achieve our common scientific and \neducational goals.\n  The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy, established by the Congress and \nPresident pursuant to the Oceans Act of 2000, issued its Preliminary \nReport in April and is set to release its final report later this \nsummer. The Preliminary Report identifies ocean research and education \nas a high priority and calls for the doubling of ocean research funding \nover five years. It also recommends formal ocean research and education \nprograms to cultivate a new generation of ocean scientists, educators, \ntechnicians and decision-makers.\n  This bill directly responds to the Ocean Commission's recommendations \nby establishing ocean research and education priorities both within \nNOAA and across the federal government.\n  First, the bill establishes a Federal Government-wide Ocean Science \nCommittee to provide advice on ocean science and education to two high-\nlevel entities: the existing National Science and Technology Council \nand the new Council on Ocean Stewardship, to be established by the \nNational Ocean Policy and Leadership Act, which I am also introducing \ntoday. A model for such a committee already exists at the NSTC, chaired \nby NOAA and NSF, and this would further define the Committee's tasks. \nThis Federal Ocean Science\n\n[[Page S8046]]\n\nCommittee would oversee implementation of many cross-cutting ocean \nscience and technology needs, including an integrated ocean and coastal \nobserving system and improved cooperation among Federal agencies.\n  The bill also calls for the development of a government-wide National \nStrategy for Ocean Science, Education and Technology, which is to \ninclude a doubling of the Federal ocean research budget. To assist in \nmeeting this goal, the bill strengthens and focuses the multi-agency \nNational Oceanographic Partnership Program, which is currently chaired \nby the NOAA Administrator, renaming it the National Ocean Partners \nProgram. The bill also recognizes the need to focus Federal priorities \nin ocean education by establishing an interagency Ocean Education \nProgram and an Ocean Science and Technology Scholarship Program to \nrecruit and prepare students for ocean-related careers with the Federal \nGovernment.\n  I am particularly pleased that the bill specifically addresses NOAA's \nresearch and education programs. It directs the NOAA Administrator to \nprepare a 20-year research plan, as well as a plan for ocean education. \nSuch a long-term vision is necessary to enable the agency to take the \nfederal lead on an effective, integrated and coordinated national ocean \nresearch, operations, and management. The Commerce Committee has \nalready taken action on important components of this research program, \nincluding S. 1218, the Oceans and Human Health Act, which passed the \nSenate unanimously earlier this year.\n  The bill also breaks new ground, placing NOAA at the head of a 10-\nyear national marine ecosystem research program patterned on the \napproach we took in creating the Global Change Research Program. We \nhave immense and critical information needs, specific questions, and \nmanagement decisions to make concerning our oceans and their resources. \nResponding to these needs will require a coordinated and focused \nFederal effort. By pulling together Federal scientific data and \nexpertise on this specific topic, and partnering with the external \nresearch community through a research grant program, we can really get \nsome results that will make a difference to Federal and State managers \nand decision-makers.\n  The bill also promotes and encourages NOAA's ocean education \nactivities, which have been conducted for many years under programs \nsuch as the National Sea Grant College Program, the National Marine \nSanctuaries Program, the Ocean Exploration Program, and the Educational \nPartnership Program. It is high time that NOAA fully and publicly take \na leadership role in this area, and the bill directs the Administrator \nto prepare a long-term ocean education plan that will help achieve this \ngoal.\n  It is critically important that we invest in improving our \nunderstanding of the oceans, as they are the lifeblood of this planet. \nNo greater resource exists on Earth or in space that has such a \ntremendous impact on our economy, weather and climate, or our \nenvironment and overall quality of life.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in sponsoring this important piece \nof legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2648\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 404\n\n       Whereas Smokey Bear's service to the United States for 60 \n     years has protected the Nation's forests above and beyond the \n     call of duty;\n       Whereas Smokey Bear has been dedicated to educating \n     Americans of all ages and particularly America's youth, the \n     future stewards of our forests, about the need for vigilance \n     concerning forest health and wildfires;\n       Whereas Smokey Bear's message of vigilance can also be \n     applied to the need (1) to remove unnatural accumulations of \n     hazardous fuels from the public forests of the United States; \n     (2) to clear defensible space around homes and escape routes \n     in the wildland-urban interface; and (3) to suppress forest \n     fires that threaten communities or valuable natural \n     resources;\n       Whereas the Smokey Bear campaign is the longest running \n     public service campaign in the history of the United States;\n       Whereas Smokey Bear was the first individual animal ever to \n     be honored on a postage stamp;\n       Whereas the Forest Service of the Department of Agriculture \n     is committed to increasing public information and awareness \n     about wildfires and forest protection;\n       Whereas the Forest Service of the Department of Agriculture \n     is devoted to changing the public's behavior concerning \n     wildfires in an effort to maintain and protect the natural \n     resources and wildlife of the United States; and\n       Whereas the Forest Service of the Department of \n     Agriculture, the National Association of State Foresters, and \n     the Advertising Council have provided extraordinary support \n     and dedication to the purpose and efforts of Smokey Bear: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates August 9, 2004, as ``Smokey Bear's 60th \n     Anniversary''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States to observe the \n     day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 124--DECLARING GENOCIDE IN DARFUR, SUDAN\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK (for Himself, Mr. Corzine, Mrs. Dole, Mr. Lieberman, \nMr. DeWine, and Mr. Fitzgerald) submitted the following concurrent \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 124\n\n       Whereas Article 1 of the 1948 United Nations Convention on \n     the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide states \n     that ``the contracting parties confirm that genocide, whether \n     committed in time of peace or in time of war, is a crime \n     under international law which they undertake to prevent and \n     to punish'';\n       Whereas Article 2 of the Convention on the Prevention and \n     Punishment of the Crime of Genocide declares that ``in the \n     present Convention, genocide means any of the following acts \n     committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a \n     national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such: (a) \n     killing members of the group; (b) causing serious bodily or \n     mental harm to members of the group; (c) deliberately \n     inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to \n     bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; (d) \n     imposing measures intended to prevent births within the \n     group; and (e) forcibly transferring children of the group to \n     another group'';\n       Whereas Article 3 of the Convention on the Prevention and \n     Punishment of the Crime of Genocide affirms that the \n     ``following acts shall be punishable: (a) genocide; (b) \n     conspiracy to commit genocide; (c) direct and public \n     incitement to commit genocide; (d) attempt to committed \n     genocide; and (e) complicity in genocide'';\n       Whereas in Darfur, Sudan, an estimated 30,000 innocent \n     civilians have been brutally murdered, more than 130,000 \n     people have been forced from their homes and have fled to \n     neighboring Chad, and more than 1,000,000 people have been \n     internally displaced;\n       Whereas Andrew Natsios, the Administrator of the United \n     States Agency for International Development, has predicted \n     that 300,000 civilians in Darfur will die within the year \n     under ``optimal conditions'' in which humanitarian assistance \n     is provided, and that as many as 1,000,000 civilians in \n     Darfur are at risk; and\n       Whereas in March 2004 the United Nations Resident \n     Humanitarian Coordinator stated:\n\n[[Page S8051]]\n\n     ``[T]he war in Darfur started off in a small way last year \n     but it has progressively gotten worse.

Mr. President, several weeks ago the New York Times ran \na story about what people all around the world do when they are \nstarving. What they do, in effect, is to try to trick themselves into \nthinking that they do have food.\n  According to the World Food Program, there are no more mukhet bushes \nnear the refugee camps in eastern Chad, where more than 200,000 \nSudanese refugees have fled. Refugees have extracted what little \nnutritional value they can from those bushes by eating the toxic \nberries that grow on them.\n  In Haitian slums, poor families eat dough made of butter, salt, \nwater, and dirt.\n  In Malawi, roadside stands sell roasted mice, and in Mozambique the \npoor eat grasshoppers when they must, calling them ``flying shrimp.''\n  In Angola in the early 1990's, a man boiled leather from a family \nchair and served his family ``lamb soup.''\n  Women in Eritrea regularly strap flat stones to their stomachs to \nlessen hunger pangs, and, in a cruel turn of the fable of stone soup we \nall learned growing up, mothers in many countries boil water with \nstones, telling children the food is almost ready and hoping they will \nfall asleep waiting.\n  The New York Times goes on to argue--rightly--that the famines these \npeople suffer through are not caused by a lack of food alone. They are \ncaused by drought, government neglect, or war.\n  The opposite, of course, is also true. Governments that make good \npolicy choices can ease suffering, even in the most brutal situations. \nThat fact underscores the wisdom of the Millennium Challenge Account. \nThe MCA, as it is commonly called, says clearly that governments who \nprove they are ready for reform and openness can count on the support \nof the people of the United States.\n  Today the Senate has confirmed the first two members of the board of \ndirectors who will oversee the MCA. We all know of Christie Todd \nWhitman and her experience. The other member whom we confirmed today is \nKen Hackett, the president of Catholic Relief Services. I am proud to \nhave nominated Ken for this important position.\n  Ken is uniquely qualified for this job for one reason. He has \ndedicated his life to fighting for the poorest of the poor--the \nfamilies who, without Ken and Catholic Relief Services, would be forced \nto eat leather, poison berries, or dirt.\n  The Millennium Challenge Account is an innovative new tool in \nfostering global development and combating poverty. By demanding \ngreater responsibility from recipient nations, we can foster reform and \ngrowth.\n  At the same time, however, the vast majority of the world's poor will \nremain prisoners to their governments' bad policies and corruption. We \ncannot redouble our efforts under the Millennium Challenge Account, \nonly to forget those who remain most in need, those whose only solace \nis a stone tied to their stomach. The MCA will be one tool--an \ninnovative, new tool--in our fight against poverty. But it is not the \nonly tool.\n  That is why I nominated Ken Hackett for this important board. Ken \nHackett will be a strong and clear voice for the poorest of the poor--a \nvoice on this board and within the U.S. Government, much the way he has \nbeen at Catholic Relief Services for the last several decades.\n  I thank my colleagues in supporting Ken's nomination for this \nimportant board. Voting for him is a vote for hope for the world's \npoor. It is a vote of confidence for the remarkable work of Catholic \nRelief Services. And it is a vote for retaining America's leadership to \nend suffering.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/13/senate-section/article/S8052-3", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8052]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
