Mr. President, this morning the Senate will be in a period \nfor morning business to allow Senators to make statements and to \nintroduce legislation. Yesterday, we began consideration of the pension \nrate reform bill but did not complete action on that measure. If \nSenators desire to speak on behalf of that legislation, I do encourage \nthem to come to the floor today during morning business.\n  As I announced yesterday, there will be no rollcall votes today. When \nwe finish our business today, the Senate will reconvene on Monday to \nresume debate on this important pension rate bill. I expect amendments \nto be offered on Monday. However, any votes on Monday will be held over \nuntil Tuesday's session. Again, no rollcall votes will occur on Monday.\n  We will finish the pension bill Tuesday or Wednesday. I very much \nwould like to complete that bill Tuesday, if at all possible, but we \nwill finish it either Tuesday or Wednesday of next week and, as always, \nSenators will be notified of rollcall votes as they are scheduled.\n  I thank everybody for their participation and cooperation during the \nomnibus debate. It was the unfinished business from the last session \nand took a lot of cooperation on both sides of the aisle. That was \ndemonstrated over the last several days, which we all very much \nappreciate.\n  The funding measure passed yesterday. As people saw from the ultimate \nvote, it was a bipartisan measure. It passed by a large bipartisan \nmargin, and I appreciate the Members' assistance as we worked through \nthe unanimous consent agreement in order to bring that bill to \nconclusion.\n  Lastly, before we finish our business for the day, we expect to be \nable to consider additional executive nominations that are on the \ncalendar. I will continue to work with the Democratic leadership to \nmove forward on those nominations that are available. I am pleased the \nSenate will be able to act on these important positions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/23/senate-section/article/S205-7", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S205]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              SENATE PAGES\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

They \nhave been spectators, as well as participants. I hope that what they \nhave witnessed and experienced will lead them to come back in other \nroles in public service in the future, whether it is at a staff level, \nan elected level, or an appointed level. Their involvement and their \nopportunities for future roles in government and public service could \nnot be greater or more appreciated.\n  We welcome them back as we bid them farewell.

Mr. President, the majority leader talked briefly about \nthe schedule. I spoke yesterday on the pension bill, and I am very \nhopeful we can complete our work on the pension bill at an early date. \nI think it is a bill that merits broad bipartisan support and, judging \nfrom the cosponsors, prominent Members on both sides of the aisle who \nhave worked to get us to this point, I have every expectation that we \nwill see completion of our work on the pension bill sometime early next \nweek.\n  We have--it is an overused word but certainly a word applicable \nhere--a crisis with regard to pensions and retirement security, both in \nmultiemployer plans as well as single-employer plans.\n  That crisis will not be satisfactorily or successfully confronted \nuntil we take several steps. This is only meant to be an interim step, \nbut it is an important step. It is a temporary step that will allow us \nsome stability and confidence that we can address this issue more \neffectively in the months and years ahead.\n  Secondly, with regard to schedule, it is important for us to \nrecognize the narrow window of opportunity we have to deal with the \nhighway bill. We have already lost valuable time. We should have done \nthis bill last year. Not only have we lost 90,000 jobs as a result of \nour failure to pass the bill last fall, we have also threatened the \ncontract season this year by our inability to move this legislation \nmore expeditiously. For all intents and purposes, the contract cycle \nhas already started in the South. It is important that we send the \nmessage that we intend to finish this bill as early as possible. It is \na jobs bill, an infrastructure bill. I cannot think of a greater \neconomic stimulus. We are told by experts that we could create 800,000 \nnew, good-paying jobs if we can move this legislation forward.\n  So it is my hope we will take this legislation up well before the \nPresident's Day recess in order to complete our work before that recess \nand send a signal to the country that we understand the importance of \nthis legislation.\n  Finally, I call attention to a front-page story in the Wall Street \nJournal this morning. The headline of the story reads, ``Halliburton \nTells the Pentagon Workers Took Iraq-Deal Kickbacks.'' The first couple \nof paragraphs begin:\n\n       Halliburton Co. has told the Pentagon that two employees \n     took kickbacks valued at up to $6 million in return for \n     awarding a Kuwaiti-based company with lucrative work \n     supplying U.S. troops in Iraq. The disclosure is the first \n     firm indication of corruption involving U.S.-funded projects \n     in Iraq and raises new questions about Halliburton's dealings \n     there. The company's work already is being scrutinized \n     because of accusations that the U.S. government was \n     overcharged for gasoline under another controversial \n     contract.\n\n  It says a little later down, referring to that second charge now \nunder investigation:\n\n       . . . the top Defense Department auditor asked the office \n     to investigate whether Halliburton subsidy Kellogg Brown & \n     Root overcharged for fuel deliveries by more than $61 \n     million.\n\n  These charges in this new report are terribly disturbing. I ask \nunanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Jan. 23, 2004]\n\n    Halliburton Tells the Pentagon Workers Took Iraq-Deal Kickbacks\n\n                          (By Neil King, Jr.)\n\n       Washington.--Halliburton Co. has told the Pentagon that two \n     employees took kickbacks valued at up to $6 million in return \n     for awarding a Kuwaiti-based company with lucrative work \n     supplying U.S. troops in Iraq.\n       The disclosure is the first firm indication of corruption \n     involving U.S.-funded projects in Iraq and raises new \n     questions about Halliburton's dealings there. The company's \n     work already is being scrutinized because of accusations that \n     the U.S. government was overcharged for gasoline under \n     another controversial contract.\n       Halliburton has strenuously defended its Iraq work as \n     fairly priced and free of taint. A discovery of kickbacks \n     could expose the company to hefty fines and other punishments \n     such as potential fraud charges. At the least, contacting \n     experts say, Halliburton will be required to reimburse the \n     money.\n       Any blow could be softened by the fact that Halliburton \n     itself disclosed the misconduct to the Pentagon inspector \n     general's office this week. That disclosure came just days \n     after the top Defense Department auditor asked the office to \n     investigate whether Halliburton subsidiary Kellogg Brown & \n     Root overcharged for fuel deliveries by more than $61 \n     million.\n       The latest revelation, though, is sure to increased the \n     already intense scrutiny Halliburton has received from \n     congressional Democrats, some of whom charge that the \n     Houston-based company benefited from political favoritism in \n     securing lucrative work in Iraq. The news also is likely to \n     further raise suspicions abroad that Iraq reconstruction work \n     is largely benefiting U.S. companies and their employees.\n       Vice President Dick Cheney, who was chairman of Halliburton \n     until he left in 2000, defended the company Wednesday in a \n     Fox Radio Network interview. ``They get unfairly maligned \n     simply because of their past association with me,'' he said.\n       Halliburton stressed that it promptly told the Pentagon of \n     the problem. ``The key issue here is self-disclosure and \n     self-reporting,'' a Halliburton spokeswoman said. \n     ``Halliburton international auditors found the irregularity, \n     which is a violation of our company's philosophy, policy and \n     our code of ethics. We found it quickly, and we immediately \n     reported it to the inspector general. We do not tolerate this \n     kind of behavior by anyone at any level in any Halliburton \n     company.'' A company statement said the payments were \n     ``detected through the company's internal control \n     procedures.''\n       The company has fired the two employees, who were based in \n     Kuwait and whose names were not disclosed. Halliburton said \n     it could not discuss specifics of the matters because of a \n     Pentagon review.\n       KBR is now repairing Iraqi oil fields and supplying \n     everything from food and laundry services to housing for U.S. \n     troops and coalition officials in Iraq under two huge \n     contracts valued at up to $16 billion. That work has so far \n     cost nearly $6 billion, well over twice what has gone into \n     all of the other 40 other U.S. contractors in Iraq, according \n     to government records.\n       In all, the U.S. has so far funded a total of about $9 \n     billion in Iraqi reconstruction costs, and expects to award \n     contracts valued at another $18.6 billion. Both the \n     congressional general accounting office and the Pentagon are \n     now completing large-scale investigations of all U.S.-funded \n     reconstruction work in Iraq.\n       The alleged kickbacks involve the same KBR contracting \n     office in Kuwait that handled the controversial gasoline \n     contact. The Pentagon inspector general's office received the \n     disclosure while conducting its own review to decide whether \n     to open a criminal investigation into the gasoline contract. \n     Pentagon officials decline to comment on the status of that \n     investigation.\n       The current accusations do not involve the gasoline \n     contract. Instead, the Kuwaiti company is said to have paid \n     kickbacks to the KBR officials after winning lucrative \n     subcontracts to help support U.S. troops in Iraq under what's \n     known as KBR's LogCap contract. U.S. officials declined to \n     provide specifics on the subcontracts involved or the\n\n[[Page S207]]\n\n     name of the company implicated in the payoffs.\n       Halliburton said in a statement that the disclosure of what \n     it called a ``potential overcharge'' was a sign of its \n     ``diligence'' in managing its Iraq contracts. ``KBR will \n     ensure that questionable charges will be credited to the \n     government and will seek recovery from the offending \n     subcontractors.''\n       Halliburton negotiated its current LogCap contract with a \n     very thin profit margin of 1% over costs. It has a maximum \n     bonus of an added 2% available if it delivers the needed \n     services in an expeditious way. But under these so-called \n     cost-plus arrangements, companies have little incentive to \n     rein in costs or to assure that they pick the most \n     competitive subcontractors, since the higher the costs, the \n     higher the profit.\n       The disclosure comes as Pentagon documents continue to \n     raise broader questions about KBR's financial controls in \n     Iraq. A previously undisclosed Jan. 13 memorandum from a \n     branch office of the Defense Control Audit Agency levels as \n     ``inadequate'' KBR's system for accurately estimating the \n     cost of ongoing work in order to justify payments. The memo \n     was sent to various Army contracting officials.\n       The Pentagon has had to reject two huge proposed bills from \n     KBR, including one for $2.7 billion, because of myriad \n     ``deficiencies,'' the memo says. ``We consider [the \n     company's] estimates in the area of subcontracts to be \n     inadequate,'' the memo says. The agency is now auditing \n     proposed KBR bills totaling $2.1 billion, the memo says.\n       Pentagon auditors last month said that KBR's Kuwaiti \n     supplier, Altanmia Commercial Marketing Co., was charging the \n     U.S. almost double the market price for gasoline. Auditors \n     said the overcharging amounted to $61 million through \n     September, and as much as $20 million a month since then.\n       The Army Corps defended the company's hiring of Altanmia in \n     a lengthy Jan. 6 report. The report said KBR had ``urgent and \n     compelling needs'' to use the Kuwaiti supplier, even at \n     significantly higher prices than other potential suppliers.\n       Still, Pentagon officials are likely to home in on the \n     circumstances under which KBR hired Altanmia. The Army Corps \n     reports says KBR picked Altanmia on May 5 after making phone \n     calls to just two other bidders. Officials say there is no \n     indication of kickbacks involving Altanmia.\n       A number of anonymous whistleblowers have come forward in \n     recent weeks with often-detailed allegations of KBR \n     wrongdoing in Kuwait, including accusations of paybacks from \n     companies that received lucrative subcontracting work from \n     KBR, according to U.S. officials and congressional sources. \n     These reports in turn have been taken up by the Pentagon's IG \n     office.\n       The Pentagon's fuel unit, the Defense Energy Support \n     Center, solicited bids yesterday for three fuel-delivery \n     contracts meant to replace the work that KBR is now \n     performing. KBR officials have said for months that they \n     wanted out of the work, which they described as dangerous and \n     not very profitable.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. As I said, it is very disturbing because there have \nalready been serious concerns raised about the lack of scrutiny, \nauditing, and transparency with regard to the billions of dollars that \nare now being committed in Iraq. The Defense Contract Audit Agency has \nnow been charged not only with taking responsibility for an audit, but \nthey have also begun consideration of a criminal investigation. \nClearly, if there is a possibility of a kickback, a criminal \ninvestigation is certainly warranted.\n  I am troubled by the lack of any expressed concern in the Congress. \nThere has been virtually no oversight in either the House or the \nSenate. When matters of this magnitude and concerns of this level are \naddressed on the front pages of some of the most prominent newspapers \nin the country, I cannot think of a more important wakeup call for us. \nOne of our primary roles as Members of Congress, of course, is \noversight, to make sure that the money we authorize and appropriate is \nnot only spent well but is spent as the American people would expect \nit.\n  I do not think we have any choice but to investigate this matter \nourselves, to ask the appropriate committees, perhaps Government \nAffairs, Armed Services, Foreign Relations, to look into these issues, \nto ask the tough questions, and to have a somber appreciation ourselves \nof what is going on, why is it that we are reading for the first time \nreports of kickbacks when we have taken so little effort to understand \nthe magnitude of the problem, the depth and scope of the issues that \nthese allegations represent.\n  I think it is also important for us to call for a halt in all further \ncontracts with Halliburton until these issues are clarified. For the \nlife of me, I cannot understand why we would reward corporations or \norganizations of any kind that face such serious allegations of fraud \nand corruption, that are under investigation for perhaps overpricing \nthe American taxpayer by $61 million, at least with regard to the \ngasoline sold. Why we would award one more contract until these matters \nhave been resolved? So I hope that on a bipartisan basis the Congress \nwill live up to its responsibility, first, through oversight and, \nsecond, with a recognition that awarding contracts under circumstances \nsuch as these makes no sense whatsoever.\n  We will have more to say as we learn more, of course. These are very \ndisturbing revelations. They merit more careful consideration. We need \nto learn more and understand what circumstances allowed the kickbacks \nin the first place. Lack of transparency above and beyond anything else \nwill generate stories and situations like this over and over again.\n  Many of us have called for a complete public accounting of these \nfunds, but here we are--no transparency, no public accounting, no \noversight on the part of Congress, and the possibility of perhaps more \ncontracts with Halliburton in the future. This is not the way to run a \ngovernment, especially if we are hopeful of improving the confidence on \nthe part of the American people that we understand the gravity of these \nissues and want very much to build their confidence that we are doing \nall we can in our efforts in Iraq to rebuild democracy, to provide for \nthe assistance required. We have said on many occasions how troubling \nit is that we are the only real financial source for the economic, \nmilitary, and public assistance provided to Iraq.\n  When the American people hear that much of that money may now be \nunder a cloud, it is all the more imperative that we act to remove that \ncloud, to provide the confidence, the transparency, the oversight, and \ncertainly the corrective actions required.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/23/senate-section/article/S207-1", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S207]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on just one more issue, quickly, the \nDemocratic leader was in the Chamber moments ago speaking of something \nI am very concerned about as well. This is the front page of the Wall \nStreet Journal today and it says: ``Halliburton Tells the Pentagon \nWorkers Took Iraq-Deal Kickbacks.''\n  Let me read from the report.\n\n       Halliburton Co. has told the Pentagon that two employees \n     took kickbacks valued at up to $6 million in return for \n     awarding a Kuwaiti-based company with lucrative work \n     supplying U.S. troops in Iraq.\n\n  That disclosure came just days after the top Defense Department \nauditor asked the office to investigate whether Halliburton subsidiary \nKellogg Brown & Root overcharged for fuel deliveries by more than $61 \nmillion.\n  This isn't the first whisper of this kind of issue. Week after week \nafter week, for months we have been hearing these charges. Do you think \nanybody in the executive branch seems very concerned about them? \nApparently the auditors in the Defense Department are. But do you see \nanybody scrambling to hold a hearing about it and do some investigation \nand some inquiry to bring somebody to account for this? It is as quiet \nas church mice around here.\n\n[[Page S208]]\n\n  In the last 6 or 8 years, every time there was a hiccup there would \nbe a Senate investigation or a congressional investigation and we would \nhire special counsel and lawyers and have people under oath. Here is an \nexample of what we ought to be investigating as well.\n  How about getting to the bottom of this issue. The U.S. taxpayers are \nbeing overcharged $200 million, perhaps, for hauling gasoline into Iraq \nby a company that is charging $1 more than anybody else is charging for \nhauling the same gasoline into Iraq. How about some accountability for \nthe American taxpayer. After all, this money comes from the American \ntaxpayer. Overcharging, kickbacks, cronyism, preferential contracts, \nnonbid contracts--this demands, this begs for an investigation. This \nCongress has a responsibility to do it.\n  I suppose the administration, this Congress, and the majority party \ncan ignore this for another week or another month. This is not going to \ngo away. Kickbacks, overcharges--this isn't going to go away. The fact \nis this company just got a new contract. This is a slap on the wrist, a \npat on the back. That is what this is all about. Let us have an \ninvestigation to find out who is doing this. Let us suspend those \ncontracts right now. If we have work to do, if we have fuel to haul, if \nwe have supplies to buy, if we have projects to finish, let us get \ncontractors to do that. Let us have contracts to haul that fuel and to \nprovide those supplies so that we are not going to have to wonder \nwhether there are kickbacks or overcharges or fraud.\n  I am sick and tired of reading this in the papers and seeing inaction \nin this Congress--none. Week after week after week we have read about \nHalliburton and its subsidiary. It is not just us. The auditors in the \nDepartment of Defense think the taxpayers have been bilked--not by a \nthousand dollars or a couple hundred thousand dollars, but by tens and \ntens and tens of millions of dollars. Auditors in the Department of \nDefense believe that and are asking these questions. Yet this place \nlooks as if it is at parade rest; won't move a muscle.\n  There needs to be an investigation by the committees and the \nleadership of this Senate. My colleague, Senator Daschle, described \nthat obligation this morning. There needs to be an investigation. I \nhope this will happen soon.\n  It was my great concern, as I expressed when the Congress passed \nnearly $20 billion for reconstruction in Iraq, that this was throwing \nmoney up in the air in a way that called for a carnival of greed. It \nlooks like hogs in the cornfield. You have all of this money--billions \nand billions of dollars for the reconstruction of Iraq--and you have \ncontractors running around trying to grab some of it. This contractor \nwas one of the first with no-bid contracts, now we see these \nallegations--and they have been going on for months--about overcharges. \nNow we see allegations of kickbacks.\n\n  The taxpayers deserve better than that. The taxpayers deserve \naccountability. This money is not some money that vanishes somewhere. \nThis is money that comes from the pockets of the American taxpayers. We \ntax the taxpayers to get their money, and then this money is spent for \nthe reconstruction of Iraq--a country, incidentally, which we did not \ndestroy. We are reconstructing facilities that we did not damage, such \nas roads, bridges, the electric grid, and dams. We didn't target them. \nWe didn't destroy them. Now we are told that we must reconstruct them \nwith American taxpayers' money--a position that I voted against, a \nposition that I think is absurd--in a country with the second largest \nreserves in the world, Iraq, next only to Saudi Arabia, which ought to \nbe able, in my judgment, to sell the oil that it produces to \nreconstruct itself.\n  For that country to rely, as the President insists it must, on \nAmerican taxpayers' funds for reconstruction is absurd. But, \nnonetheless, that is what happened. The majority of this Congress \ndecided they wanted to spend nearly $20 billion of American taxpayers' \nmoney to do that. Now we see at least part of the result of it, and \nthere will be more. But the signal this Congress ought to send is one \nof accountability and demanding through public hearings and a thorough \ninvestigation. Can we not be as aggressive as the auditors in the \nDefense Department? Can we not at least express the same concern that \nauditors in the Defense Department express about the potential of our \nbeing bilked out of hundreds of millions of dollars? That is the least \nthe American taxpayer should expect from this Congress.\n  I think this Congress has not heard the last of this. I and others \nwill be on this floor attempting to demand investigative hearings. The \ntaxpayers, in my judgment, deserve hearings on these subjects.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/23/senate-section/article/S208-1", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S208-S209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                PENSIONS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is Friday. We had a good discussion \nyesterday about this very important pension funding amendment which is \npresented to the Senate by the chairman of the Finance Committee, \nSenator Grassley, and the ranking member, Senator Baucus; they have \nshared jurisdiction on a number of pension matters with our committee, \nthe Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, chaired by \nSenator Gregg and I as the ranking minority member.\n  The two committees have worked very closely in recommending this \nlegislation. I am very grateful to all and to Leader Frist for giving \nthis a priority standing. By the early part of next week, the first \npart of the week, we will have final action. This will move very \nrapidly through the House of Representatives because it is of such \nimportance to employers and employees. It is a temporary measure to \nmeet the certain challenges of our time.\n  To review again very briefly, the defined benefit pension plans are a \nkey part of the retirement security of Americans. Americans have sort \nof a three-legged stool for retirement. They have Social Security, they \nhave their savings, and they have their pension.\n  While Social Security is certainly secure, there has been certainly a \ndrawdown on the Social Security assets as a result of the excessive tax \nreductions of this administration. It is certainly secure at the \npresent time.\n  We have also seen that many who put savings in 401(k)s, with the \nslide of the market in a number of instances, have had their savings \nsignificantly reduced. Because of a combination of different events \nthat have taken place in the economy, there is a real question about \nwhether the pensions are going to be there for many of America's \nindustries, the pension programs which have been supported both by \ntheir employer and the employee, paid into by workers with the \nguarantee that their pension would be there, would be available for \nthem in the future. In many instances, they are threatened.\n  This legislation is to provide breathing room into the current system \nto permit the system to get back on its feet and to be working again. \nWe will take action and do it quickly.\n  The defined benefit pension plans are a key part of retirement \nsecurity for millions of Americans; they are promised a monthly benefit \nstarting at retirement and continuing through their life. The combined \nplans are different from other pension plans. Only a defined benefit \nplan provides benefits backed by the Pension Benefit Guaranty \nCorporation. Workers rely on the guarantees to help in old age to pay \nfor health benefits, needed medical care, college, education, and for \ntheir homes.\n  This chart is an indication of how this whole program is established. \nThere are nearly 35 million Americans covered by single employer \ndefined benefit pension plans. And 9.7 million Americans are covered by \nmultiemployer benefit plans. For example, in the construction \nindustry--where workers move from one site to the other site--the \nprocess has been worked out through the employers, which is supported \nboth by the employers and the workers, which gives a \nmultiemployer benefit. But these are obviously workers who work hard, \nplay by the rules, and have a similar kind of interest as the other 35 \nmillion. It is only the defined benefit plan that provides a secure \nmonthly benefit backed by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.\n\n[[Page S209]]\n\n  Why this legislation is necessary is because of what has been \nreferred to earlier in the discussion and debate about a series of \ndifferent economic conditions that are threatening the defined benefit \npension plan. We call it a ``perfect storm'' of factors that is hurting \nthe defined benefit pension plan funding levels.\n  We have had a prolonged downturn of the stock market during the last \n3 years, the longest decline since the Great Depression. Then we have \nhad extremely low 30-year Treasury bond interest rates. That may be \ngood for those who are buying a new car or attempting to buy a new \nhouse, but if we are looking at how the pension plans were established \nand tie into the 30-year bond interest rates, we would see this factor, \nthe decline of the stock market, the low interest rates and the general \nweak economic conditions, which mean that companies cannot afford to \nmake additional payments and pay excise taxes imposed by our pension \nlaws. These three elements combined have put the pension system \ngenerally, for some almost 45 million Americans, in serious jeopardy.\n  We have come up with a bipartisan program. It is temporary, over a 2-\nyear period, which we believe can offer the relief to permit the \nprograms to come back and survive.\n  Late yesterday afternoon, my friend from Arizona, Senator Kyl, \noffered amendment No. 2234. Senator Kyl called this a ``hold harmless'' \namendment for the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. That \ndescription is misleading because this amendment is anything but \nharmless. In fact, it harms the workers who can lose pension benefits \nas a result of this amendment.\n  The PBGC's mission is to preserve and protect the defined benefit of \nAmerican workers. By paying premiums into the PBGC, companies and their \nworkers are buying security. They are buying a secure guarantee, that \nif for some reason a company can no longer provide the promised \nbenefit, workers receive a pension from the PBGC. This amendment \nundermines that security and strikes at the heart of the mission by \ntaking away pensions that workers have earned. It would replace \nguarantees with broken promises.\n  My colleague expressed concern that if the pension plans fail, it \nwould hurt workers. The irony is his amendment would make those workers \nin failed plans even worse off than they are under current law. It \nwould make workers pay the price for financial relief that companies \nare receiving. The companies receive the relief; the workers would pay \nthe penalty.\n  Our amendment explicitly applies to airline and steel companies. \nEmployees in those industries have already made many sacrifices to keep \ntheir companies and pension plans afloat. We should not penalize them \nby taking away pension benefits they have earned.\n\n  Finally, I am well aware of the need to preserve the PBGC's financial \nintegrity. I know my colleagues on both sides of the aisle share my \nconcern. None of us wants to put the Nation's pension system at risk. \nThat is why our substitute amendment targets the DRC relief to where we \nthink it is both needed and justified. Only companies that had well-\nfunded--well-funded--pension plans in 2000 would be provided with that \nrelief. We exclude poorly funded plans where relief would simply expose \nthe PBGC to increased deficits.\n  So PBGC deficits will not be solved by taking benefits away from \nworkers. Rather, we must seek to stabilize and expand our defined \nbenefit pension system.\n  As I say, this proposal and compromise has been carefully structured \nand carefully drafted to try to meet very special needs, and it is \nintended to do so. I believe the Kyl amendment would undermine that \nfundamental concept.\n  The results of this ``perfect storm'' have not only had an enormously \nadverse impact and effect on the pension system but they are having a \nreal adverse impact on the lives of many of our fellow Americans. I \nthink it is important that we in this Chamber begin to understand this. \nThe stock market may be going up with the profits, but what is \nhappening out on Main Street should be the concern of every one of us \nin this body.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/23/senate-section/article/S209-1", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S209-S212]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SUPPORTING AMERICAN WORKERS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am going to mention a series of events, \nmany of which have just taken place in the last day or two, which \neither were published reports, news reports, or television reports that \nindicate another side of America than is the America being described \nwith rose-tinted glasses.\n  First of all, today there are some 13 million children who are going \nhungry. Eight million Americans are unemployed. Eight million workers \nlose overtime under the Bush proposal. We have had debates and \ndiscussions on this issue. We are going to come back to it very soon, \nat the first opportunity, hopefully even as soon as next week. Seven \nmillion low-wage workers have been waiting 7 years for an increase in \nthe minimum wage. I will come back to this issue. And 3 million more \nAmericans are living in poverty since President Bush took office.\n  The final point I make is that 90,000 workers a week are losing their \nunemployment benefits--90,000 workers a week. We have the unemployment \ncompensation fund which is funded at close to $20 billion. We have \ntried to get a temporary extension for some 13 weeks. It has been \nobjected to now more than a dozen times by those on the other side of \nthe aisle. It costs about $7 billion. Nearly twenty billion dollars are \nthere.\n  These workers are paying into the fund. We are talking about workers \nwho have worked hard, paid into the fund, and the fund is out there and \nmeant to assist the workers during an economic downturn. These workers \nshould not be blamed for the economic downturn, and they are being \nblamed by denying them the extension on the unemployment insurance. As \nI say, 90,000 workers a week are losing their unemployment benefits.\n  I will mention one other chart that helps illustrate what I mean when \nI talk about 13 million children who are going hungry every night. \nHunger is increasing for the minimum-wage families. The Agriculture \nDepartment reported 300,000 more families are hungry today than when \nPresident Bush first took office--300,000 more. Twelve million American \nhouseholds are worried they will not have enough to eat. And nearly 4 \nmillion American households have someone going hungry.\n\n  This is in a country that can produce more agricultural products than \nany other country in the world, by far. We spend billions of dollars on \nland to ensure it is not going to be productive. We know how to do two \nthings, if nothing else, in this Nation: We know how to grow food, and \nwe know how to deliver it. We have the greatest agricultural lands in \nthe world. We have effectively a Federal express. They can deliver \nproducts overnight. We know how to deliver it. We do not have to feed \neveryone by Federal express, but we sure know how to get food or get \nany product to people's homes or to the needy people. I believe hunger \nin America is a national disgrace. So this is a matter of very \nconsiderable concern.\n  Last evening, when I returned home at a little after 6 o'clock, I \nturned on CNN and I was caught by a piece they did reporting on \n``Overwhelmed America.'' The broadcaster said: ``Tonight, the \noverwhelmed American worker.'' This is the report on the study called \n``Overwhelmed America.''\n\n       Wages are stagnant, productivity is soaring, which means \n     many Americans are effectively working more for less. And \n     making matters even worse, millions of American workers now \n     find themselves competing with cheaper foreign labor just to \n     hold on to their jobs.\n\n  Then it went on to Kate Bronfenbrenner, professor at Cornell \nUniversity:\n\n       The workers there are frightened because they wake up each \n     morning and they don't know whether their job is going to be \n     outsourced, downsized, contracted out, or eliminated.\n\n  Outsourced, downsized, contracted out, or eliminated.\n\n       They are overwhelmed because they feel like forces way \n     beyond their control are making the decisions that affect \n     their lives. And they are exhausted because they are working \n     harder, longer, and faster just to stand still. Americans are \n     scared of losing their jobs. They are working longer, harder, \n     and they still don't have job security.\n\n  I will include the whole piece. It is a short piece, but I will read \nanother sector:\n\n       In growing numbers workers are feeling overworked, \n     underappreciated, and burned\n\n[[Page S210]]\n\n     out. That is according to a recent study of 1,100 workers \n     that concluded ``Emotion about the current work experience is \n     extremely negative.''\n\n  And the report goes on. I listened to that last night. It was very \ninteresting. It is something that, again, restates basically what we \nhave been saying on the floor of the Senate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that that CNN piece be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Transcripted Excerpt From CNN on ``Overwhelmed America,'' January 22, \n                                  2004\n\n       Pilgrim: Tonight the overwhelmed American worker.\n       Wages are stagnant, productivity is soaring, which means \n     many Americans are effectively working more for less. And \n     making matters even worse, millions of American workers now \n     find themselves competing with cheaper foreign labor just to \n     hold on to their jobs.\n       Peter Viles has the report.\n       Peter Viles (CNN Correspondent). This is the California \n     grocery strike, but it might as well be from a time capsule, \n     because the strike, the ultimate workers' weapon, is almost \n     extinct in America.\n       In the 1950s, there were 352 major strikes per year, so far \n     this decade, 25 per year. Unions have lost membership and \n     lost clout. Real wages have been stagnant for three decades. \n     One labor scholar describes workers right now as frightened, \n     overwhelmed and exhausted.\n       Kate Bronfenbrenner (Professor, Cornell University). They \n     are frightened because they wake up each morning and they \n     don't know whether their job is going to be outsourced, \n     downsized, contracted out or eliminated. They are overwhelmed \n     because they fell like forces way beyond their control are \n     making the decisions that affect their lives. And they are \n     exhausted because they are working harder and longer and \n     faster just to stand still.\n       Viles. So why are workers not pushing back, demanding wage \n     increases or better benefits? Experts say workers just don't \n     have the leverage and are also growing discouraged about the \n     future.\n       Larry Mishel (Economic Policy Institute). Individual \n     workers are scared for their jobs. They think that any job \n     they have is going to be better than the job they are going \n     to get next. That keeps them from pushing back on employers.\n       Viles. In growing numbers, workers are feeling overworked, \n     underappreciated and burned out. That's according to a recent \n     study of 1,100 workers that concluded--quote--``Emotion about \n     the current work experience is extremely negative.''\n       Donald Lowman (Managing director, Towers Perrin). I don't \n     think workers are apathetic. I think they are very negative \n     right now. There is a big group that's quite negative right \n     now. They fear intensely, though, about their job. They would \n     really like to see things change. They have not withdrawn. \n     They are not indifferent.\n       Viles. There are signs that workplace anxiety is shaping up \n     as a major campaign issue. In Iowa, the two most important \n     issues to caucus-goers, not terrorism or Iraq, but the \n     economy and health care. The workplace anxieties fueled by \n     what some economists are now calling the worst hiring slump \n     since the Great Depression in America, a jobless recovery \n     that continues to surprise and disappoint economists, but \n     also continues to give employers the upper hand in the labor \n     market--Kitty.\n       Pilgrim. Pete, what would it take to give the employees \n     some leverage? It seems like an impossible situation.\n       Viles. It would take a lot more hiring. Until the millions \n     of people who are unemployed and the millions working part-\n     time who want full-time work get into the job market, \n     employers have the leverage. Employers don't give raises \n     because they think they should. They give raises because they \n     have to. And right now, they don't have to.\n       Pilgrim. Yes. Thanks very much, Pete Viles.\n       Viles. Sure.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. And then, lo and behold, this morning, on the front \npage--on Friday, January 23--what is the leading story in the Wall \nStreet Journal? ``The Gap in Wages Is Grow-\ning Again for U.S. Workers. Inequal-\nity Is Seen as Result of the Jobless\nRecovery. . . .''\n\n       Wage inequality--the gap between America's highest and \n     lowest earners--has started widening again, a situation with \n     election-year ramifications.\n       The trend is a reflection of the job market's exceptionally \n     weak response to the current economic recovery, as well as \n     long-term technological and economic changes that have eroded \n     the bargaining power of America's lowest-paid workers.\n       The data show that young workers--who currently have fewer \n     job prospects than a few years ago--and men, in particular, \n     are bearing the brunt.\n       The numbers continue a movement to greater wage inequality \n     that began around the time President Bush succeeded President \n     Clinton--\n\n  That is the Wall Street Journal report.\n\n       The numbers continue a movement to greater wage inequality \n     that began around the time President Bush succeeded President \n     Clinton and the economy slid into recession three years ago. \n     The trend represents a reversal from the late 1990s, when the \n     lowest unemployment rates in a generation had enabled the \n     lowest-paid workers to keep pace with those at the top.\n\n  The article goes on. I ask unanimous consent that the article in its \nentirety be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Jan. 23, 2004]\n\n           The Gap in Wages Is Growing Again for U.S. Workers\n\n\n    Inequality Is Seen as Result of the Jobless Recovery; Potential \n                             Election Theme\n\n                              (By Greg Ip)\n\n       Washington.--Wage inequality--the gap between America's \n     highest and lowest earners--has started widening again, a \n     situation with election-year ramifications.\n       The trend is a reflection of the job market's exceptionally \n     weak response to the current economic recovery, as well as \n     long-term technological and economic changes that have eroded \n     the bargaining power of America's lowest-paid workers.

Meanwhile, the salaries of the highest paid workers--\n     those who are just inside the top 10 percent--were unchanged. \n     The divergence appeared to grow in the fourth quarter as \n     higher-paid workers gained ground and lower-paid workers \n     slipped further, based on comparisons with original year-\n     earlier data that are subject to revision.\n       The numbers continue a movement to greater wage inequality \n     that began around the time President Bush succeeded President \n     Clinton and the economy slid into recession three years ago. \n     The trend represents a reversal from the late 1990s, when the \n     lowest unemployment rates in a generation had enabled the \n     lowest-paid workers to keep pace with those at the top.\n       This wage picture is likely to figure in this year's \n     unfolding election campaign. Democratic presidential \n     candidates have made the economic hardship of typical working \n     families a centerpiece of their platforms. They also say \n     President Bush's tax cuts aggravate growing inequality by \n     giving larger benefits to those in higher income brackets.\n       President Bush has pushed tax cuts for all families as well \n     as improvements in public schools as the keys to increasing \n     employment and individual prosperity. In his State of the \n     Union address this week, he proposed spending $250 million on \n     a program for community colleges to train workers for jobs in \n     growing sectors and boosting Pell Grants, which help poor \n     students pay for college. These moves will ``help more and \n     more Americans to join in the growing prosperity of our \n     country,'' Mr. Bush said.\n       Increased inequality ``is the totally predictable result of \n     relatively strong growth in tandem with relatively high \n     unemployment.'' said Jared Bernstein, an economist at the \n     liberal Economic Policy Institute in Washington. ``right now \n     we have far more job seekers than jobs [and] workers just \n     lack the bargaining power to push for a larger slice of the \n     growing pie. It's a recipe for higher inequality.''\n       The new turn may merely represent a return to a longer-term \n     trend that was only temporarily stalled. Sheldon Danziger, an \n     economist at the University of Michigan, said inequality \n     began to increase in the 1970s, and now appears to have \n     resumed after an interruption in the late 1990s. Prof. \n     Danziger, who has studied inequality extensively, attributes \n     the trend to technological change and increased trade, which \n     have placed a premium on higher-paid workers' skills while \n     displacing many lesser-skilled workers from well-paying jobs. \n     Other factors at play are the decline in unionization and the \n     stagnant minimum wage.\n       In a report released last week, the Labor Department's \n     Bureau of Labor Statistics said that, overall, the median \n     full-time worker over 16 years of age earned $625 a week in \n     the fourth quarter of last year, up 2 percent from a year \n     earlier. But adjusting for increased consumer prices that \n     represented just a 0.1 percent increase in purchasing power.\n       The median represents the midpoint: half of all workers \n     earn more, and half earn less. It is considered more \n     representative of the typical family than is the average \n     paycheck, which can be heavily influenced by movements of the \n     highest wages.\n       The widening gap seen last year between the top--typically \n     managers and other professionals--and the bottom--which \n     includes restaurant workers, security guards and other \n     service positions--were part of a movement that now appears \n     to have begun with the recession in 2001. The weekly wage of \n     the worker at the ``10th percentile'' of wages rose from $284 \n     in the fourth quarter of 2000 to $303 in the fourth quarter \n     of last year, a total increase of just 0.6 percent, after \n     inflation. (Tenth percentile means that worker's wage \n     represented the cutoff point between the 10\n\n[[Page S211]]\n\n     percent lowest paid workers and the 90 percent better-paid \n     workers.) In the same period, the weekly wage of the 90th \n     percentile worker rose from $1,299 to $1,440, an increase of \n     4.5 percent after inflation.\n       It was a different story in the late 1990s. Between late \n     1996 and late 2000, real wages for the lowest paid workers \n     rose 8 percent, not much less than the 8.8 percent gain for \n     the highest paid.\n       The latest data cover full-time salaried workers, \n     representing about 100 million workers, or about two-thirds \n     of the labor force. They don't include part-time workers, the \n     self-employed, the unemployed, those not in the work force \n     such as retirees, taxes, government payments, or investment \n     income. As such, the figures don't fully capture trends in \n     total family disposable income. The data aren't distorted by \n     pay packages to executives and others through such methods as \n     stock options which ballooned in the 1990s but have shrunken \n     some recently. That is because even at the 90th percentile, \n     the annual salary, about $75,000, is still modest compared \n     with what most senior corporate executives earn.\n       The data are broadly consistent with trends in the Census \n     Bureau's much larger annual report on household-income \n     trends, which are available through 2002.\n       Many scholars attribute widening income disparities to \n     technological change, which displaces workers whose jobs can \n     be easily done by a machine or computer program, while \n     boosting the productivity of workers who get to use the more \n     sophisticated technology.\n       Mr. Danziger notes he doesn't wait in line as much at the \n     airport because ``I can buy my ticket and print my boarding \n     pass online.'' As a result, he bypasses several traditional \n     middle-class workers, such as travel agents and the people at \n     the ticket counter. Increased trade is also a factor. \n     Routine, lower-skilled jobs are more easily shifted to lower-\n     wage workers overseas, even as trade with such countries \n     gives most Americans access to cheaper products.\n       Other scholars emphasize other factors, including a federal \n     minimum wage that hasn't risen since 1997, and the declining \n     power of unions, which traditionally bargained to raise the \n     wages of all workers, regardless of their skill or \n     experience.\n       Indeed, according to a separate Labor Department report \n     this week, the average weekly paycheck of union members grew \n     3 percent last year from 2002, before adjustment for \n     inflation, to $760, while the weekly paycheck of nonunion \n     members grew 2 percent, to $599. But the share of U.S. \n     workers who are union members continued its long-term \n     decline, falling to 12.9 percent from 13.3 percent in 2002. A \n     related trend has been manufacturing's declining share of \n     employment; factories traditionally were a source of well-\n     paying, less-skilled, often unionized jobs.\n       The latest Labor Department wage data suggest that young \n     workers and men have been hardest hit. The median paycheck of \n     workers age 16 to 24 shrank slightly, after inflation, from \n     2000 to 2003 while that of workers age 25 and over grew 0.6 \n     percent a year. In the late 1990s, young workers' wages grew \n     faster.\n       Also, the median paycheck of men grew just 0.3 percent a \n     year, much less than that of women, at 1.8 percent a year, \n     although at $704 a week, men still earn about 25 percent \n     more. There was little difference in trends for white and \n     black workers. While in recent decades the wages of better-\n     educated workers have grown faster, that wasn't the case \n     recently: College-educated workers actually did a bit worse \n     than those with just a high-school diploma in the past three \n     years.\n       On the campaign trail, Democratic Sen. John Edwards of \n     North Carolina has hammered most on the theme of income \n     disparity. Under President Bush, ``there are two Americas, \n     not one,'' he said last month. ``One America does the work, \n     while another America reaps the reward.''\n       Gen. Wesley Clark has also pushed that theme. ``We may have \n     had a good [economic-growth] number, but where it really \n     matters--whether people are getting jobs and what they're \n     earning on those jobs--people in America are still \n     struggling,'' said Jason Furman, policy director for the \n     Clark campaign.\n       But Kevin Hassett, a scholar at the American Enterprise \n     Institute, said the lesson of the late 1990s is that the best \n     way to lift lower-paid workers' wages is through strong \n     economic growth, which is what Mr. Bush's tax cuts are \n     delivering.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, an Economic Policy Institute report came \nout January 21. Here we are, on January 21, the Economic Policy \nInstitute's study of job shifting. It says:\n\n       In 48 of the 50 States, jobs in higher-paying industries \n     have given way to jobs in lower-paying industries--\n\n  The jobs that are being created in these States, as an average, are \ngoing down.\n\n     since the recession ended in November 2001. Nationwide, \n     industries that are gaining jobs relative to industries that \n     are losing jobs pay 21 percent less annually. For the 30 \n     States that have lost jobs since the recession purportedly \n     ended, this is the other shoe dropping--not only have jobs \n     been lost, but in 29 of them the losses have been \n     concentrated in higher-paying sectors. And for 19 of the 20 \n     States, they have seen some small gain in jobs since the end \n     of the recession. The jobs gained have been \n     disproportionately in lower-paying sectors.\n\n  Two States have grown 21 percent less. Nebraska and Nevada are the \ntwo States that are the exception. Here is the State of New Hampshire, \nwhich still has fewer jobs than when the recession ended, and where the \nwages in industries gaining jobs are 35 percent lower than wages in \nindustries losing jobs. For new jobs, they are getting paid 35 percent \nless in the State of New Hampshire.\n  The State of Delaware likewise has lost jobs since the recession \nended and where job-gaining industries have wages 43 percent below \nthose in the job-losing industries.\n  Colorado has lost 2 percent of its jobs since the end of the \nrecession and job-gaining industry wages are 35 percent below the wages \nin job-losing industries.\n  West Virginia has lost 1.7 percent of its jobs since the end of the \nrecession, and wages in job-gaining industries are 33 percent below \nwages in job-losing industries.\n  These are the facts. We have the Wall Street Journal, the Economic \nPolicy Institute, and the study that was quoted in Overwhelmed \nAmerica--that is just in the last 24 hours--about what is happening in \nAmerica.\n  That is a good deal different than what I heard in the State of the \nUnion Address by the President. The President said on page 4:\n\n       This economy is strong and growing stronger . . .\n       Americans took those dollars [from the tax cut] and put \n     them to work, driving this economy forward. The pace of \n     economic growth in the third quarter of 2003 was the fastest \n     in nearly 20 years. New home construction: the highest in \n     almost 20 years. Home ownership rates: the highest ever. \n     Manufacturing activity is increasing. Inflation is low. \n     Interest rates are low. Exports are growing. Productivity is \n     high, and jobs are on the rise.\n\n  These are two different Americas, Mr. President, two entirely \ndifferent Americas. It is the second America that many of us are \nfighting for here in the Senate.\n  What has been the answer by the administration? Let's take the \nminimum wage, for example. Minimum wage, unemployment compensation, \novertime--we have made the presentation that American workers are \nworking longer and harder. Not only are individuals working longer and \nharder, but families are working harder and longer. Women are working \nlonger and harder. Look at what happened. And we wonder why we are \nseeing the increasing incidence of hungry children and hunger in \nAmerica--look at what happened to the minimum wage. Now it is, without \nthe increase, down to $4.95. That is about the lowest it has been in \nyears. Seven long years without an increase. A majority of the \nmembership would vote for an increase in the minimum wage. The \nRepublican leadership and the Bush administration will not give us an \nopportunity to do so. In 7 years, we have increased our own salary six \ntimes, but we have not had an increase in the minimum wage.\n\n  We will talk about an increase in the minimum wage. Americans, I \nbelieve, think someone who works 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, \nshould not have to live in poverty in the strongest Nation in the \nworld, with the strongest economy and the strongest military. I think \nthat is a family value--being able to provide for your children, \nparents having a sense of dignity and pride in their work and work \nproduct, families being able to stay together. That is a family value. \nWe hear a lot of speeches on this floor and elsewhere about family \nvalues. That is a family value--making sure that hard-working men and \nwomen are going to be able to provide for their families. We are denied \nthat opportunity.\n  We are not taking no for an answer. That minimum wage is coming at \nthis institution and it is coming once, twice, as many times as \nnecessary. So there will be no doubt among the American people who will \nbe standing for those workers and who is against them.\n  Unemployment compensation. Ninety thousand workers who worked hard \nnow have seen their benefits expire--90,000 a week. We have heard on \nthe other side of the aisle in the last 2 days--the leaders in the \nRepublican Party--saying: Don't worry about it, Senator, we are \ncreating new jobs.\n  Well, let's have a reality check. The administration promised 300,000 \njobs\n\n[[Page S212]]\n\nand the reality is 1,000 jobs. Who are we kidding? The American people \nare getting used to the fact that there is a lot of rhetoric on the one \nhand and no followup on the other. That was true in the No Child Left \nBehind Act, and it is apparently true about our trip to Mars.\n  Did you see the rollout of the President talking about going to Mars, \nand there was no mention of it in the State of the Union Address. The \nbest estimates are it will cost a trillion dollars and they are \nallocating $5 billion. Get the political hit and then forget about it. \nThat is also what happened with No Child Left Behind. That we cannot \nget an extension on unemployment compensation, when the economy is \ncreating only 1,000 jobs, and they estimated over 300,000, makes the \npoint. Those hard-working Americans who paid into the unemployment \ncompensation fund, which is in surplus at the present time, should be \nable to get the extension of 13 weeks.\n  Third is the overtime issue. We have seen who that affects. It \naffects basically the policemen and firefighters and nurses--some 8 \nmillion Americans. And included in the recommendations, as I pointed \nout, for the first time, it will say if a veteran had certain kinds of \ntraining in the military, which may very well have been the reason he \nwent into the service--obviously, the underlying reason is because he \nor she wanted to serve their country. But the idea that you are going \nto get a skill is attractive, too. You can get education benefits, \nwhich is attractive, too. That makes a difference in recruitment. We \nhave seen it. I know about it. I am on the Armed Services Committee. We \nknow we are falling further behind and not meeting our recruiting goals \nin the National Guard by 10,000 this year. We know we are offering any \nof the soldiers over in Iraq a bonus of $10,000 if they reenlist over \nthere. So we know we have these challenges.\n  Now for the first time they are prohibiting overtime, not only for \nthose I just mentioned, but the rule, as I read into the Record, \nincludes--these are the exact words, Mr. President:\n\n       Under the Bush plan, veterans who have received training in \n     the military that is equivalent to a specialized 4-year \n     degree could be classified as exempt ``professional \n     employees'' and lose their overtime protection.\n\n  There is a whole list of training programs. Obviously, we have new \ntechnology. Our military is the best in the world. We have new \ntechnology, new training programs. People go into the military and get \nthe training. They serve our country and risk their lives to protect \nour Nation. They come back from Iraq and get a job, but no, no, you \ndon't get overtime.\n  Why did they put in that provision? It is interesting. In looking \nover the comments of different groups about overtime, there is one \nparticular company, a major defense company, which commented on the \nBush proposal saying that their company observes that many of its most \nskilled technical workers received a significant portion of their \nknowledge and training outside the university classroom, typically in a \nbranch of the military service.\n  There you go. So they add, we will include the American military \nveterans in banning them from receiving overtime. People wonder why \nworkers are discouraged, overworked, they can't get decent pay, they \ncan't get benefits. They have seen their jobs outsourced. They are \nseeing their jobs sent overseas. Their pension programs are in \njeopardy. Their security in the job place is very much threatened.\n  We ought to be thinking about what we can do for families. There are \na series of steps we can take. Certainly increasing the minimum wage, \nextending unemployment compensation, and making sure these workers \nreceive overtime is just a bare minimum.\n  I look forward to the debate on those issues. This is really a part \nof a whole concept, and that is the condition of workers in this \ncountry. We didn't even begin to get into the workers' payment of \nprescription drugs, which has been escalating out of sight. The bill \nthat passed some weeks ago, and the prohibition written into that bill, \nagain behind closed doors, prohibits Medicare from bargaining for bulk-\nrate purchasing of prescription drugs that would give some advantage \nand protection for our seniors. That has affected the quality of life \nfor working family members who retire and are on Social Security and \npay much higher prescription drug prices.\n  I didn't mention that impact and what is happening to working \nfamilies. I haven't mentioned the extraordinary escalation of the cost \nof health care. I was rolling over in my mind the answer by the \nadministration to the escalation of health care costs. The one answer \nthat was given in the State of the Union Address was malpractice \ninsurance is going to solve this problem. Come on.\n  We are at the present time spending close to 15 percent of our gross \nnational product on health care, more than $5,000 for every man, woman, \nand child. Thirty cents out of every dollar is a nonclinical dollar. \nMost industries are down 17, 18 percent. If we reduce the 30 cents to \n27 cents, we save $50 billion a year. If we reduce it to 20 cents, we \nsave $100 billion a year. We can do a lot with $100 billion. There are \nways of doing that. Do you think we can do that?\n\n  We will have an opportunity to debate those issues. I welcome the \nfact the majority leader says health care and health insurance will be \non the floor because we will have an opportunity to get a meaningful \nresult. It may not be the kind of program the pharmaceutical industry \nsupports, and it may not be the program the insurance industry \nsupports, but, by God, it will be a program the average family and the \nworking families of this country will support, and it will make a \ndifference in their lives and in their families' lives.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I do want to talk a little bit this morning \nabout the pension bill, which is the current bill we are considering. I \nam sure all of us can remember our first jobs when we came home with \nour first paycheck, anxious to spend it, and if our parents happened to \nbe around they gave some advice and suggestions for us. First, they \nprobably suggested we figure out where we were going and, secondly, \nthat we put something away. If it was\n\n[[Page S213]]\n\nbefore college, it was probably for college. If it was after college, \nit was probably a suggestion that we start thinking about when we \nretire.\n  The pension funding laws that we are considering today have that same \nobjective. We have reached a major crossroads in the private pension \nsystem that affects the retirement security of millions of American \nworkers. The funding requirements for defined benefit plans contained \nin the Employer Retirement Income Security Act--ERISA is what it is \nusually referred to--and the Internal Revenue Code are very complex. \nYet their goal is clear, and that is to make sure a plan has sufficient \nassets to pay the future benefits when workers retire.\n  I am not sure there has been much explanation on the difference \nbetween defined benefits and defined contributions. The ones we are \ntalking about are defined benefits. There is a transition happening in \nthis country. As fast as companies can, they are going to define \ncontributions. That is where they say how much they will put away for \nfuture retirement, as opposed to this crisis area which is defined \nbenefits. Defined benefits means you are guaranteed something when you \nretire; based on the length of time you have worked and maybe how much \nmoney you have made, it is a defined benefit. It is what you are going \nto receive.\n  So there can be a lot of complexities to calculating how to have \nenough money so that at the time you retire there is money in the bank \nto pay the annuity that you deserve at that point in time.\n  So we can see why there would be kind of a rush to the defined \ncontribution, which is where the company at that point in time knows \nexactly what they have to pay in each year and they are willing to do \nthat, but they are not telling you that you are going to have a \nspecific amount when you do happen to retire. There will be money \nthere, but it will not be a specific plan of receipt at that point in \ntime.\n  All we are talking about in this particular pension bill are the \ndefined benefit plans. That was set up under law so that when a company \nsays you will have these benefits, you know that the Federal Government \nis providing some oversight to make sure those benefits will be \navailable when the time for you to retire happens.\n  So companies are forced to show they have the resources on hand to \nmake these future benefit payments when they come due. Pension law must \nbe finely tuned to accurately reflect the plan's ability so that the \nappropriate funding levels can be determined.\n  Unfortunately, the current system is off key. We have had some \ndifferent things happen than we have had to worry about in this system \nfor a long time. The outdated 30-year Treasury rate, which is what is \nused to calculate a plan's current liability, has distorted the funding \nlevels. Simply put, a lower interest rate means employers have to put \nmore cash into their plans to satisfy the pension funding requirements, \nand continued use of this artificially low interest rate places the \nworker's retirement, the pension plan, and the employer's business at \nrisk. If all of the money for the retirement plans was actually being \nheld in 30-year Treasurys, then that would be an accurate calculation, \nbut it is not. It has not been for quite awhile.\n\n  We have not changed the way that it is calculated. So continued use \nof this artificially low interest rate does place the retirement plan, \nthe worker's retirement, and the business itself at risk, particularly \nif we expect them to make up differences that occur for a number of \nreasons in a very short period of time.\n  Pension plans are built over a long period of time, and it has always \nbeen the intent that they be built over a long period of time, so that \nwhen the person retires the money is there, and what we are trying to \ndo in this bill is to make sure all of those things happen. A business \nthat goes out of business no longer provides the security for the \nemployee, and too steep of a curve for putting money in there keeps \nthem from doing the business they are designed to do, which over even a \nshort period of time can eliminate that business. A bankrupt business \ndoes not provide the kind of security that is needed for the retirement \nsystem. Under the current system, with the 30-year Treasury rate, \nbusinesses will have to divert billions of dollars from development and \njob creation to satisfy the misguided funding rules of the 30-year \nTreasury. Again, if that is where all the money was--it is where very \nlittle of the money is--then that would be an accurate way to do it.\n\n  The number of defined benefit pension plans in this country is \nsteadily declining. I have given you a little bit of the reason why \nthat is, but it is due in large part to the complex and restrictive \npension laws. In 1983, there were 175,000 defined benefit pension \nplans. Today there are fewer than 35,000. Many more companies may \nchoose to freeze or discontinue their plans when faced with \nartificially inflated funding payments. We must act now to prevent \nfurther deterioration of the pension system and to protect our economic \nrecovery. But we must not act in haste to pass long-term sweeping \nchanges that might undermine the retirement security of American \nworkers.\n  A use of the obsolete 30-year Treasury rate has combined with recent \nstock market losses and economic conditions to create what we are all \nreferring to as ``the perfect storm'' for the pension fund environment. \nLast year the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation had a record $11.2 \nbillion deficit. The amendment offered today will provide temporary \nrelief to recover from this perfect storm, while Congress considers \ncomprehensive pension funding reform--comprehensive reform, but not \njust done in a hurry so it is just an overreaction.\n  The amendment provides the following temporary relief. I am very \npleased this is supported in a very bipartisan way. There were \nagreements to limit the number of amendments, to make sure the second-\ndegree amendments were germane to the main amendment, so that we can \nget this wrapped up in a hurry and get some temporary relief in place.\n  What the bill does, it replaces the 30-year Treasury bond rate with a \nconservative long-term corporate composite rate. This is done for a \nperiod of 2 years. It also defers a portion of accelerated deficit \nreduction contributions by airlines and steel companies for 2 years. \nThat is the accelerated deficit reduction, accelerated because of this \nperfect storm. That is just for a period of 2 years. It also defers the \namortization of recent investment losses by multiemployer plans for 2 \nyears, which allows these collectively bargained plans time to return \nto the bargaining table.\n  I stress this relief is temporary. It does not forgive a pension \nplan's debt. It contains the important safeguards to prevent further \ndecline in the financial health of a plan. It gives the plans time to \nrecover their footing--and this may be just as important--and gives \nCongress time to carefully consider the best way to improve the \ntroubled pension funding system.\n  It is often the case here that if something is worth reacting to, it \nis worth overreacting to. We have to be careful not to overreact to the \npension system's current funding troubles. Replacing the 30-year \nTreasury rate along with improving economic and market conditions \nshould improve the temporary funding deficiencies created by this \nperfect storm. But we have to look beneath the clouds of recent unique \ncircumstances to see the true health of the pension funding system and \nidentify where reform is needed. We must learn from the lessons of the \nperfect storm to reduce the volatility, to bring pension accounting \ncloser to reality, to increase the transparency and disclosure of \npension information to participants. They deserve to, and have to, know \nwhere their fund is at all times.\n\n  With this legislation, we give ourselves time to ensure that we make \nthe right decisions to strengthen the pension system and improve \nretirement security. These decisions will be very difficult but we have \nto make them. Anything less is unacceptable. We cannot pass the burden \nof a broken pension system on to future generations.\n  Of course, while we are doing that we need to make sure we are also \ntaking a look at Social Security, because Social Security is a defined \nbenefit plan and it is underfunded. We have a chance to fix that. The \nearlier we work on it, the better it can be fixed with the least pain. \nOf course, part of that process has to be to ensure that those who are \nentering the job market continue to pay into Social Security.\n\n[[Page S214]]\n\n  In another 25 or 30 years there will not be anybody here who is here \nnow. It will be the generation coming into the job market right now, \nthe ones who are going to discover that 15 percent of their paycheck is \ngoing into a defined benefit plan, Social Security, and that the money \nisn't going to be there when they get out, when they are ready to take \nadvantage of it because what goes in today gets paid out today, \nessentially. They could end that defined benefit system because they \nwill say we don't owe anything to those people, just ourselves.\n  I am hoping that is not the attitude in this country. But it is \nsomething we have to worry about as well. But the more immediate need, \nthe one that is having difficulties right now with the funding process, \nand unlike the Social Security system, is funded--it is funded and we \nare having a crisis with it--that is the one we want to take care of. \nBut we need the time to do it right and this bill will give us time to \ndo it right.\n  I ask people to pay careful attention to the amendments, work in a \nvery bipartisan way to get this 2-year solution, so we can come up with \nthe overall solution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the No. 1 killer of those between the age \nof 4 and 34 in this country today is auto fatalities. If you look at \nthose between the age of, say, 16 and 25, the figures are even more \nexaggerated. We all know that in this country over 42,000 Americans \nlose their lives every year. That figure stays fairly constant. The \nlast year we have figures for is 2002, and 42,815 of our fellow \ncitizens lost their lives.\n  In fact, in the next 12 minutes, to be precise, at least one person \nwill be killed in an automobile accident in this country, while nearly \nsix people will be injured in just the next 60 seconds.\n  This is a tragedy that we as a society are much too willing to \ntolerate. If a foreign enemy were doing this to us, we would not \ntolerate it. We would be up in arms. Someone said it is the equivalent \nof a 747 going down every 2 days in this country. If that were \nhappening, of course, it would be on CNN; we would be demanding an \nexplanation. Yet these auto fatalities that occur, hour by hour, day by \nday, just go on and for some reason we have become immune to it, \nhardened to it. They just continue.\n  I come to the floor this morning to discuss five bills, five bills \nthat my staff and I have been working on for about the last year, five \nbills that I will be introducing but that I hope will be incorporated \nin the highway safety bill we will be considering in the next several \nweeks. These bills are commonsense, practical ways to save lives. Each \nbill is built on solid evidence of what will, in fact, make a \ndifference.\n  They don't cost a lot. It is a commonsense, good way to make a \ndifference. I guarantee you one thing. If we pass them, they will save \na lot of lives.\n  The first bill we call ``Stars on Cars.'' It is kind of a cute name. \nIt is kind of basic stuff.\n  When you go buy a new car, we all know what the sticker looks like. \nBut what we may not know is most of the sticker is mandated by the \nFederal Government. The mileage per gallon has been on there for a \nnumber of years. The Federal Government says that your city mileage has \nto be on there and what you are going to get on the highway when you \ntake it out on the highway. It has to tell you whether it has air-\nconditioning. It has to tell you whether it has a stereo. It has to \ntell you a whole bunch of other stuff.\n  One piece of information is not on there--highway safety.\n  The funny thing is you have already paid to have the Federal \nGovernment spend millions of dollars to test that very car. The Federal \nGovernment knows information about that car. In fact, the Federal \nGovernment has put that information up on the Internet. When you go in \nto buy that car, that information is not available to you. It is not \navailable to the American consumer in the one place where it would make \na difference--where you buy the car.\n  This is a mockup. We simply show how it would work under our bill. It \nwouldn't cost the taxpayers a dime. The car companies are already \nprinting the stickers. Where are they doing the tests? All we do is put \nthe information here. Under this mockup, this is a Silverado pickup. We \nwould add what is below my hand: ``Government Safety Information.'' For \nthis particular pickup, on frontal impact crash data, this is what it \nwould show. This is true information.\n  For the driver side, here is what the Government says. Out of five \nstars, this particular vehicle got three out of five. For the passenger \nside, it got four stars out of five.\n\n  Over here on the side impact crash test, it was not tested. Over here \non the rear seat, it was not tested either.\n  On the rollover resistance test that particular vehicle was not \ntested. If it was tested, it would be there. If it was not tested, it \nwouldn't be there.\n  In the year 2000, that particular vehicle was not tested. But most of \nthe common cars you and I and the average American would buy have, in \nfact, been tested. All of that data on the frontal impact crash test, \nthe side impact crash test, and the rollover resistance test would be \nthere. We would have it based on the star. It is really easy to \nunderstand. That data would be there. It is already on the Internet. \nNow it would be available if you go look and compare. What impact would \nthis have?\n  I happen to believe the consumer is better off with more information \nthan less information on whatever we are talking about. The consumer \nought to know what the Government does. The consumer ought to know that \ntype of information. I think the consumer would make better choices. \nMost consumers care about safety. They will make better choices, and in \nall likelihood, they are going to choose more safe vehicles and more \nlives will, in fact, be saved. It just makes good common sense to do \nthis.\n  The second bill we call ``Safe Kids, Safe Cars.'' Cars kill kids at \nunbelievable rates. This is the top 10 leading cause of death in the \nUnited States for the year 2001 by age group, ranked 1 through 10 for \nthe leading cause of death.\n  In the orange is traffic crashes as a cause of death. Starting over \nhere, you see ages 1 through 3, 4 through 7, and 8 through 15. When you \nstart over here and pick up at age 4 through 7, and moving on clear \nover here to age 34, the leading cause of death is traffic crashes, \ntraffic crashes, traffic crashes, traffic crashes--all of these age \ngroups all the way from 4 through 34.\n  That is what is killing the young people--more than cancer, more than \nhomicide, more than fire, more than drowning, more than anything else. \nSo we have a problem. Anything we can do to make a car safer for our \nkids, we should be doing it.\n  We know a lot of kids and a lot of adults are killed when cars roll \nover. The Government is doing tests to see how likely a vehicle is to \nroll over. But it might come as a surprise to my colleagues and to the \npublic to know that the Government is not doing any testing today to \ndetermine what happens inside the vehicle once the car begins to roll \nover. We test to see if it is going to roll over. What we don't test to \nsee is what happens when it starts to roll over and when it does roll \nover. Our bill provides for the use of child-size dummies and the use \nof adult dummies to see what impact that rollover has on them.\n  What are you going to do if you get that information? It is going to \ntell us, I assume, how well those airbags in that particular vehicle \ndeploy, how well they protect the adult, and how well they protect the \nchild. It may be different. How well is the structure of that vehicle \nput together for a rollover? Does it crush on the side of the child or \nthe adult? How well was the structure built? We don't know. We don't \nknow it because we are not testing for it today. Our bill provides that \nwe do that.\n\n  Child-size dummies--NHTSA needs to look at its testing and ask where \nwe need to use them. My bill says they need to incorporate these child \ndummies. We are doing so to improve safety for children.\n  Another area where kids are dying in cars is power windows.\n  NHTSA started a rulemaking to require child-safe window switches in\n\n[[Page S215]]\n\n1996. That is when this Federal agency started making the rulemaking \nprocedure. That rulemaking procedure is not done yet. They have not \nfinalized the rule.\n  My bill tells NHTSA to finish the rulemaking process, and it requires \ncar makers to install switches to protect kids from getting caught in \npower windows by making switches harder to switch inadvertently. Some \ncar makers are already doing this. This can be done very cheaply. \nCompanies are doing this already. Every company needs to do it. This is \nnot an expensive proposition. There are good switches and there are bad \nswitches. Every company needs to have the good switches.\n  Twenty-five children have died that we know of in the last 10 years \nbecause they have been choked to death in cars. At least 25 we know \nabout. At least 500 people go to emergency rooms each year as a result \nof power window accidents. NHTSA tells us the power switches cost \nvirtually nothing, very little.\n  A third bill has to do with another problem; that is, dangerous road \nintersections. Every State has them. Most States, fortunately, rank \nthese roads. They keep a list of the bad ones. But, amazingly, there \nare many States that keep this information secret and don't tell the \npublic.\n  Again, consumers have a right to know this information. What would \nyou do with the information? As a parent, I might tell my 16-year-old \nnot to go that way to the movie. At least I have the right to have that \ninformation and saying go another way. It might take another 10 \nminutes, but go that way. Don't go by that intersection. Don't go on \nthat curvy road. States already have that information. The State should \nprovide that information. They already know it, they should provide it. \nPolicymakers need to know that to make decisions about how to spend \nmoney in that State, what roads to fix.\n\n  Further, States need to spend their safety money. They need to spend \ntheir safety money on safety. Our bill says they should do that and it \nrequires them to do it. Current law allows States to shortchange safety \nprograms or to do other things--highway construction. I understand \nthat, but that should not occur. Safety programs pay for new left turn \nlanes, lane markings, other improvements, lifesaving improvements, \nstraightening roads, straightening highways, doing some relatively \nsmall things that will, in fact, save lives.\n  The percentage of money earmarked, set aside for safety as it comes \nthrough the highway construction bill should be spent for those safety \nitems. We are not talking about soft safety programs; we are talking \nabout hard construction dollars. They are still construction dollars. \nThey will still be used for construction. They will still be used to \nmake things happen. They should be used for safety.\n  The fourth bill I am introducing has to do with driver education. \nThis is a neglected area. Again, look at our chart. These are the kids \nwho are dying, the new drivers. It is natural; they are the \ninexperienced drivers. We need to try to attack this in many different \nways. One way we can do it is through driver education. It is a \nproblem. I have looked at it in my home State. I have looked at it in \nother States. Driver education, at best, is mediocre in this country. \nThe Federal Government cannot run it. It is a State responsibility. But \nthe Federal Government can play a small role. My bill follows the \nNatural Transportation Safety Board's lead and recommendation and \nestablishes the National Office of Driver Training within the \nDepartment of Transportation, NHTSA. This office would work to \nestablish and maintain a set of best practices--not mandates, not \nnational standards but just best practices--for driver education and \nlicensing and also would provide assistance to States that implement \nthese best practices.\n  My bill authorizes a modest amount of money, $20 to $30 million \nannually to assist States with making their driver education and \nlicensing programs better.\n  Our bill also deals with a graduated driver's license and raises the \nbar for a Federal program to give money to States for having graduated \ndriver's licenses and laws. One of the good things we have seen in the \nlast few years is the graduated driver's licensing laws that come into \nplace in the States. Each State has done it differently. That is the \nimprovement. What we and most experts have seen is there are some laws \nthat are working and some laws that are not working. Again, the Federal \nGovernment cannot tell the States what to do in this area, but maybe \nthe Federal Government can reward those States that are at the higher \npoint, the higher bar, maybe give some encouragement in that area.\n  Our fifth bill has to do with tires. Tires do not get better with \nage. The fact is, there are tires being sold in the market today that \nwere manufactured a while ago. Tires are not like wine. They do not get \nbetter with age. We do not know for sure what the implications are of \nthe aging of a tire, a tire that was sitting on the shelf. We do know \nthat the tire that gets old does not get better.\n\n  My bill calls for the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a \nscientific study into tire aging to establish exactly when and under \nwhat conditions tire age becomes a major safety problem. We know at \nsome point it becomes a safety problem. We just do not know when and \nunder what conditions. Currently, the date code on tire sidewalls is \nextremely difficult to read or decipher. There is a date there but you \nand I could not figure it out. The average consumer could not figure it \nout.\n  What we provide is that the Department will figure out how to do \nthis. We will not tell them how to do it. But we want the consumer to \nknow when he or she buys a tire--at the point of sale--when that tire \nwas manufactured. That, coupled with the information from the \nscientific study, will give consumers some information. Again, we will \nmove forward in giving the consumer information about the age of the \ntire, knowing when it was manufactured, plus, once the study is done \nthe consumer will know the relevance of that information.\n  We have talked with the tire industry and worked with them. They want \nto know, frankly, what all the implications are for aging tires. They \nhave worked hard to make their tires as safe as possible. They have \ndone a lot in this area and improved the safety of their tires and have \nbeen cooperative in this, as well.\n  These five bills will go a long way. They are common sense. They will \nmake a difference. These bills continue my work in this area. This is \nsomething I have been interested in for many years, going back to my \ntime in the Ohio Legislature 20 years ago when I introduced the drunk \ndriving bill, and we were able to pass a tough drunk driving bill I \nwrote in the Ohio Legislature. I worked for .08. It was very \ncontroversial in the Senate, but we were able to pass .08. Senator \nLautenburg and I worked on that.\n  I support Senator Warner's bill and was a cosponsor of a bill he \nintroduced last year that was pending in Congress with regard to \nincluding a primary seatbelt law. I support that. These bills represent \na continuation of the great concern I have about highway safety. This \nissue is not a partisan issue; this is a bipartisan issue.\n  Anytime you lose 42,815 Americans every year, highway safety is \nsomething we all have to be concerned about.\n  I know the bill is not on the floor yet, but I have seen it. I have \nseen a draft of the safety bill that will be here, the highway bill. As \ncurrently written, the bill goes farther than any highway bill that has \nbeen before the Senate in regard to highway safety. All those who \nworked on the bill have put an emphasis on highway safety, and the bill \nas currently written makes a great effort to deal with highway safety. \nI congratulate the authors.\n  Our amendments which we will have when the bill comes to the floor \nwill improve on a good bill. I make that point very clear. My \namendments are not in any way critical of that bill. In fact, I hope \nthey will be complimentary and simply add to a good product that is \nalready a good product and will help to improve it.\n  I will have more to say about this as we proceed on the highway \nconstruction bill and it comes to the floor in the next few weeks.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/23/senate-section/article/S216-1", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S216]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S216]]\n          SELLING CRIME: HIGH CRIME GUN STORES FUEL CRIMINALS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, last week, Americans for Gun Safety, AGS, \npublished a report entitled ``Selling Crime: High Crime Gun Stores Fuel \nCriminals.'' This report identifies gun stores around the country that \nsell the most guns used in crimes.\n  Federal law requires gun stores to be licensed to sell firearms by \nthe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, ATF. However, \naccording to Americans for Gun Safety, until recently, the ATF had \nnever released information on the number of crime guns traced back to \ngun stores. AGS acquired all of its data via Freedom of Information Act \nrequests. The data reveals some troubling facts. According to the \nreport, 96 of the 120 dealers named in the report remain open, and only \n24 have been inspected by federal agents during the past 3\\1/2\\ years. \nWhen inspected, 18 of these 24 dealers were cited for at least one \nviolation of federal gun laws and seven high crime dealers were cited \nmore than five times.\n  The AGS study focuses attention on negligent and irresponsible gun \ndealers. However, language included in the Fiscal Year 2004 Omnibus \nAppropriations bill will make it impossible for this data on such \ndealers to be made available to the public in the future. Language \nincluded in the omnibus specifically prohibits the release of \ninformation related to tracing requests on guns used in crimes.\n  And that is not the only problem. Even more importantly, language in \nthe bill mandates that the Justice Department destroy background check \nrecords for the purchase of guns within 24 hours of the gun purchase. \nUnder current regulations, the ATF can retain the records from gun \npurchases for up to 90 days. This 90-day period gives law enforcement \nthe opportunity to review and audit gun purchase records for illegal \nactivity and problems with the background check system. The provision \nrequiring the destruction of records within 24 hours was inserted into \nthe bill without a debate or discussion of its potential impact. It is \nincomprehensible that, at a time when we are in a heightened state of \nalert to guard against terrorism, we are not providing law enforcement \nwith more than 24 hours to examine information on weapons purchases.\n  The gun provisions in the omnibus were never the subject of Senate \nhearings and are not supported by major law enforcement organizations. \nThey undermine the efforts of the ATF to meet its responsibilities, \nweaken the public's right to know, and make it more difficult for other \nlaw enforcement agencies to do their job.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/23/senate-section/article/S216-2", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S216]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n Mr. SMITH.

On May 1,2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  Leonard ``Lynn'' Vines, a cross-dresser and native of East Baltimore, \nwas attacked in front of his cousin's home and shot six times by a \ngroup of people asserting ``we don't allow no drag queen faggots in \nthis neighborhood.'' Fortunately, Vines survived the attack.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/23/senate-section/article/S216-3", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S216-S217]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                DIABETES\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, as we commence the second session \nof the 108th Congress, I want to take this opportunity to bring \nattention to a serious health problem that our Nation faces everyday. \nThis health care dilemma encompasses all ages, genders, and races in \nour Nation. I am referring to diabetes, which impacts 18.2 million \npeople in the United States, or 6.3 percent of the population. As we \nembark on this session, we need to reconfirm our commitment to \naddressing a key objective of many in Congress to fight this chronic \nhealth problem which threatens the lives of millions.\n  The American Diabetes Association, as well as the Center for Disease \nControl and Prevention or CDC, has stated that of the 18.2 million \nAmericans living with this disease, only an estimated 13 million have \nbeen diagnosed, therefore leaving 5.2 million people, or nearly one-\nthird, completely unaware that they have the disease. There are three \nmajor types of diabetes; Type 1, Type 2, and gestational diabetes. Type \n1 diabetes results in the body's failure to produce insulin. The ADA \nbelieves that 5-10 percent of Americans who are diagnosed with diabetes \nhave Type 1. Type 2 diabetes results from insulin resistance, combined \nwith relative insulin deficiency. Approximately 90-95 percent, 17 \nmillion, of Americans who are diagnosed with diabetes have this type of \ndiabetes. Gestational diabetes affects about 4 percent of all pregnant \nwomen--about 135,000 cases in the United States each year. About \n110,814 Native Americans and Alaska Natives, or 14.9 percent of the \npopulation, receiving care from Indian Health Services, IHS, have \ndiabetes.\n  Diabetes is associated with many other serious chronic health \nconditions. About 65 percent of deaths among people with this illness \nare due to heart disease and stroke. Heart disease is the leading cause \nof diabetes-related deaths, while the risk for stroke is 2 to 4 times \nhigher among people with this illness. About 73 percent of adults with \ndiabetes have high blood pressure or use prescription medications for \nhypertension. Diabetes is the leading cause of new cases of blindness \namong adults aged 20-74 years, with diabetic retinopathy causing 12,000 \nto 24,000 new cases of blindness each year. Diabetes is the leading \ncause of end-stage renal disease, accounting for 44 percent of new \ncases. Sixty to 70 percent of people with diabetes have mild to severe \nforms of nervous system damage. The results of such damage include \nimpaired sensation or pain in the feet or hands, slowed digestion of \nfood in the stomach, carpal tunnel syndrome, and other nerve problems. \nIn addition, this contributes to more than 60 percent of lower-limb \namputations each year. Gum disease is more common among people with \ndiabetes, thus placing young diabetics at twice the risk of those \nwithout this condition. Poorly controlled diabetes before conception \nand during the first trimester of pregnancy can cause major birth \ndefects in 5 percent to 10 percent of pregnancies. Poorly controlled \ndiabetes during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy can result \nin excessively large babies, posing a risk to the mother and the child. \nUncontrolled diabetes often leads to biochemical imbalances that can \ncause acute life-threatening events, such as diabetic ketoacidosis and \nhyperosmolar coma. People with diabetes are more susceptible to many \nother illnesses, and once they acquire these illnesses, often have \nworse prognoses, such as being more likely to die with pneumonia or \ninfluenza than people who do not have diabetes.\n  In 2002, 47,555 or 6.3 percent of South Dakotans, were diagnosed with \ndiabetes. And when applying the national estimate that nearly one-third \nof all diabetes cases go undiagnosed, this would add an additional \nestimated 15,693 cases. This means that the most recent number of South \nDakotans with diabetes could be an estimated 71,000 people. Also, \nimportant to South Dakota are estimates by the American Diabetes \nAssociation that Native Americans have a higher rate of diabetes, which \nmakes this group 2.2 times more likely to have diagnosed diabetes as \nnon-Hispanic whites of similar age.\n  A report showed that the indirect costs associated with diabetes were \n$40 billion in the United States in 2002, while direct medical costs \nwere approximately $92 billion, therefore bringing the overall costs in \nour country to $132 billion. It is estimated that each year there are \n1.3 million new cases of diabetes diagnosed in people aged 20 and \nolder. Increased emphasis on prevention will help reduce the incidence \nof new cases and be a step in the\n\n[[Page S217]]\n\nright direction to reduce the social, economic and human costs \nassociated with diabetes.\n  Congress has the ability to enhance Federal programs and increase \nfunding to combat this debilitating illness. I was pleased to see the \nbipartisan dedication to doubling the funding of the National \nInstitutes of Health, NIH, over a 5-year period, which was completed in \n2003. This initiative alone has helped to expand current research, \nwhich therefore improves the path toward finding treatment and cures of \nall diseases, including that of diabetes. As a member of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, I was pleased to work with my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle to request $1.6 billion for the National \nInstitute of Diabetes and Kidney Diseases for fiscal year 2004. In \naddition to NIH, we must continue to fight to secure increased funding \nfor the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC. The CDC \nprovides invaluable research on chronic diseases such as diabetes, and \nhelps fund important state program such as the South Dakota Diabetes \nPrevention and Control Program, DPCP.\n  I encourage both Congress and the President to continue to build on \nexisting efforts to address diabetes through increased funding for NIH, \nfor the Institute of Diabetes and Kidney Diseases, and for the CDC in \nthe upcoming year. I believe that we can achieve this goal in \nbipartisan fashion and provide greater assistance to the many Americans \nin all parts of our Nation that live with this chronic illness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/23/senate-section/article/S217-1", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S217]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         OMNIBUS APPROPRIATIONS\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I opposed the omnibus \nappropriations bill that the Senate voted on yesterday. It is the \nlatest example of the annual breakdown in the congressional \nappropriations process. Once again, instead of considering \nappropriations bills individually, the Senate voted on a massive \nspending bill that includes many--in this case, seven--of the annual \nappropriations bills.\n  This process just invites the kind of problems--unauthorized \nspending, special interest provisions and legislative riders that go \nagainst the will of a majority in Congress--that we see in this omnibus \nbill. Take, for example, the Bush administration's proposed sweeping \nchanges to regulations governing overtime pay for white-collar workers. \nThese proposed changes would weaken overtime protections for these \nworkers by changing the way that eligibility for overtime is \ndetermined. Both the House and the Senate are on record in favor of a \nprovision that would block these changes from going into effect. \nNonetheless, that provision was dropped in conference after the \nadministration exerted tremendous pressure on those negotiating the \nfinal bill.\n  Similarly, language that would have prevented the Federal \nCommunications Commission from moving forward with its plan to loosen \nthe national cap on television ownership was badly weakened. And, of \ncourse, there are numerous bad provisions in the bill, including one \nthat would create a voucher program in Washington, DC, public schools \nand another that would prevent country of origin labeling on many \nagricultural products.\n  I wish I could have supported this bill as there are a few worthy \nthings in it, such as funding for global AIDS programs and for the \nrural AED Act, a program I created with Senator Susan Collins to \nincrease access to defibrillators in rural areas. I am pleased that the \nbill contains language I fought for that would required Federal \nagencies to report on their purchases of foreign-made goods. As \nmanufacturing jobs continue to disappear across the country, \nparticularly in my home State of Wisconsin, the Federal Government \nshould be doing everything it can to support American manufacturers. I \nam also pleased that the bill includes a provision I fought for to \nprohibit the Department of Veterans Affairs from enforcing its policy \nof prohibiting VA employees from taking proactive steps to let veterans \nknow about the health care benefits for which they may be eligible.\n  Those provisions do not outweigh the many bad ones in this bill, \nhowever. Mr. President, this is simply no way to fund the Federal \nGovernment. I regret that this ``must-pass'' bill is being used as a \nplatform for bad funding decisions and for bad policy decisions, many \nof which override the will of a bipartisan majority of Congress. We \nneed to go back to taking up and passing appropriations bills one by \none, rather than throwing everything but the kitchen sink into a \nsingle, bloated piece of legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/23/senate-section/article/S217-2", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S217]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/23/senate-section/article/S217-3", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S217]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/23/senate-section/article/S217-4", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S217]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            SUBMISSION OF CONCURRENT AND SENATE RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following concurrent resolutions and Senate resolutions were \nread, and referred (or acted upon), as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. DORGAN (for himself, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Coleman, \n             Mr. Conrad, and Mr. Enzi):\n       S.

Mr. President, I am going to, at the conclusion of my \nremarks, offer a resolution on behalf of myself, Senators Dayton, \nColeman, and Conrad. This resolution deals with the issue of trade \nnegotiations that have been conducted with the Central American Free \nTrade Agreement countries. It also relates to my concern about the \ntrade negotiations that are underway today, this morning, in \nWashington, DC, with Australia to try to create a free trade agreement \nwith Australia.\n  I will explain the resolution. After the whereases, it says:\n\n       It is resolved that the sense of the Senate is that the \n     President should renegotiate provisions of the Central \n     American Free Trade Agreement relating to access to the \n     United States sugar markets so as to grant no greater access \n     to the U.S. sugar market than is currently enjoyed by the \n     signatories to this CAFTA agreement; 2, the President should \n     not include sugar as an element of negotiations in any \n     bilateral or regional free trade agreement.\n\n  I want to explain why we feel this way. I will also observe that this \nis bipartisan in its offering. It is very important to our region of \nthe country. First, let me explain sugar. Sugar comes from sugar beets \nand sugarcane produced by our growers. With sugar beets, it is in the \nRed River Valley between North Dakota and Minnesota. We have the \nopportunity to plant beets and process the resulting crop into sugar, \nand in this country we have a robust sugar industry with many growers \nliving out on the land and producing a crop and contributing to our \neconomy.\n  Most of the sugar internationally around the world is traded between \ncountries on a contract basis--country-to-country contracts. That is \nthe way most sugar is traded. But there is surplus sugar outside of \nthose contracts that represents dumped sugar; it is surplus dumped \nsugar, priced at a nickel a pound, or 5, 6, 7 cents a pound, and then \nthrown all over the world wherever it may rest, and it devastates local \nmarkets.\n  Let me describe with this chart what we have in this country. Our \nU.S. consumption of sugar is about 7.8 million metric tons, and we \nimport a little over a million metric tons. We are now engaged in trade \nagreements with countries that produce a massive quantity of sugar, \nmuch of it for export. This is the potential exports from countries \nwith whom we are engaged now in negotiations for free trade agreements. \nYou can see the CAFTA countries--Central American Free Trade Agreement \ncountries--which are Honduras, Guatemala, Costa Rica which has not yet \nsigned on, El Salvador, and so on. This is Australia, Thailand, the \nFree Trade Agreement of the Americas, which includes Brazil. You can \nsee this is a giant amount of sugar.\n  The proposition is this. Our trade negotiator has put sugar on the \ntable in grade negotiations on these bilateral agreements. The result \nof it is death by a thousand cuts to our domestic sugar producers. If \nwe end where I think we will end with the Central American Free Trade \nAgreement, the Free Trade Agreement of the Americas, and others, we \nwill end up as a country without a domestic sugar industry.\n  The sugar beet growers who live on the land and produce sugar beets \nwill not be there in the future because they cannot compete and should \nnot be expected to compete against dumped sugar. Yet that is where we \nare heading.\n  This ought not be a part of the trade agreements the trade ambassador \nis now negotiating. The larger question with respect to sugar trade \nought to be dealt with in the World Trade Organization, not individual \ntrade agreements, with the Central American Free Trade Agreement--the \nfree trade agreement with the Americas. That is the position we take, \nSenator Conrad, Senator Dayton, Senator Coleman, myself, and others \nhere in the Senate.\n  Let me tell you what has happened. In the Central American Free Trade \nAgreement, the U.S. Ambassador put sugar on the table and negotiated an \nagreement that was going to allow incremental sugar to come into our \ncountry. Will that quantity of sugar by itself destroy our industry? \nNo, it will not. But the precedent will. That is because that precedent \nmeans sugar will be in the Australia agreement and the FTAA agreement \nand the quantity of sugar that is going to come into this country at \ndumped prices will inevitably destroy our sugar industry. That is why \nwe must stop it.\n  Let me tell you what happened yesterday. Yesterday, in Inside U.S. \nTrade--that is the publication--and also in North Dakota newspapers was \na story: ``U.S. Withholds Sugar Offer in Australia Trade FTA \nNegotiations.''\n\n       U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick has said the U.S. \n     position is not to provide Australia with any increased \n     market access for sugar, said a U.S. trade official.\n\n  Good for them. That is exactly the right position and one I support, \none I aspire to achieve, to stop having sugar as part of these \nnegotiations.\n  Let me read to you today's news.\n\n       A U.S. trade official is being quoted as saying Bush \n     administration trade negotiators have asked Australian \n     negotiators to settle for a free trade agreement which does \n     not open the U.S. market to any more Australian sugar.\n       But the official denied U.S. trade representative Robert \n     Zoellick had told a North Dakota radio station that sugar had \n     been taken off the table.\n\n  So they are saying a representative of the trade ambassador is quoted \nas saying sugar will not be in the Australia agreement--yesterday. But \ntoday, the official, a trade official from this administration, denied \nthat Ambassador Zoellick had told a North Dakota radio station sugar \nhad been taken off the table.\n  Mixed messages, I would say. But at least today's news from the USTR \nis sugar is a part of this. It will be a part of it.\n  That is the concern we have with the Central American Free Trade \nAgreement. When you put it in that agreement, they will want to put it \nin Australia's and Brazil's agreement, and there you go, one step at a \ntime toward disaster for our growers, our farmers out there who are \ntrying to make a living. They can make a living by competing. I don't \nmind asking them to compete and they don't mind competing. But they \ncan't compete against dumped sugar that represents a world price of a \nnickel or 6 cents a pound, that has no relationship to the cost of \nproduction. All that has is a relationship to dumped price. It will \ndestroy our industry.\n  We are offering a resolution today--my two colleagues from the State \nof Minnesota, my colleague from North Dakota--a resolution that says to \nthe President: Renegotiate the provision of the Central American Free \nTrade Agreement relating to access to the sugar market, No. 1. No. 2, \ndo not include sugar as an element of negotiations in any bilateral or \nregional free trade agreement.\n  I hope the Senate will pass this sense-of-the-Senate resolution. I \nhope we can get a vote on it. I hope the Senate will express itself to \nthe trade ambassador and the President: Don't do\n\n[[Page S219]]\n\nthis. It is unfair to our growers, unfair to our farmers, unfair to an \nindustry that produces substantial numbers of jobs and economic \nopportunity.\n  The sugar beet industry in the Red River Valley of North Dakota has \n$1 to $2 billion of impact in our economy, and once again I say they \ncan compete and they will compete when asked to compete anywhere around \nthe world, but they cannot compete against unfair trade, and dumped \nsugar is unfair trade, yet that is exactly what we are connecting to in \nthese trade agreements and that is why we want to stop it right now \nbefore it goes further.\n  Australian representatives are in Washington, DC, now. The ambassador \nfor the United States who negotiates trade agreements says he wants to \nfinish this agreement by the end of January. If they finish this \nagreement with Australia, my hope is the Senate will have expressed \nitself by that time in a way that says: Do not do this with respect to \nsugar. Do not take steps that potentially destroy the sugar industry in \nthis country, that potentially destroy the opportunity of beet growers \nin the Red River Valley to make a living. That is not a step forward; \nthat is a step backward for this country.\n  I hope the trade ambassador hears this. I don't understand for the \nlife of me why we got a message yesterday saying, I am going to do the \nright thing, I won't have sugar in the negotiations with Australia, and \nthen today--and this is on ABC, incidentally, Online, you can go to the \nInternet and see it--today the United States trade official denied that \nthe trade ambassador said that. I don't understand this at all.\n  My hope is the Senate will do what it has done before on this issue \nof sugar. The Senate has taken a position on this before. The sugar \nprogram of ours works. It provides good prices, advantageous prices for \nthe American consumer, it provides assured quality of supply, and it \nprovides an opportunity, with fair trade, for our growers to make a \nliving in this country in the sugar industry, an industry that is \nimportant to our country.\n  I am going to have this resolution introduced at the conclusion of my \nremarks. My hope is my colleagues in Congress will support it. I know \nthere are many who are strong supporters of the position that it is \nfine to negotiate trade agreements but it is not fine to undercut our \ncountry's interests with trade agreements.\n  It is almost impossible for me to begin talking about trade without \ndescribing the circumstances in which we find ourselves. We have the \nlargest trade deficit in human history right now, the largest deficit \never after our trade negotiations and agreements have been put in \nplace--the largest deficits ever. We have an agreement with Canada and \ntake a modest trade deficit and turn it into a big one. We have an \nagreement with Mexico and take a trade surplus and turn it into a big \ndeficit. The trade deficit with Japan just keeps growing. The deficit \nwith China is out of sight, well over $100 billion and will probably \nreach $130 billion this year; almost a third of a billion dollars a day \nin trade deficit with just China alone. With Europe? I can't even begin \nto describe the problems we have with Europe in beef and other areas. \nThe fact is, we need to fix this.\n  Will Rogers said many years ago, the United States of America has \nnever lost a war and never won a conference. He must surely have been \nthinking of our trade negotiators. It takes them no more than a week or \ntwo to come back with a trade agreement that undercuts especially the \ninterests of American agriculture, but if you look at the trade \ndeficit, I would say undercuts this country's economic interests. It is \nnot in this country's economic interests to continue to see this trade \ndeficit grow and grow and grow.\n  That trade deficit, incidentally, is connected to the process by \nwhich jobs stream out of this country, by companies that decide they \nwant to produce elsewhere and ship into this country, by companies that \ndecide they want to move jobs offshore. ``We want to create a new \nmailbox someplace in the Bermudas or Bahamas or some other tax haven \ncountry in order not to have to pay taxes to the U.S., and at the same \ntime close our factories and ship jobs overseas.''\n  That is what this measure is, that is the consequence of this, and \nthat is why this has to change, in my judgment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming would like \nto be added as an original cosponsor of the resolution.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming. He has \nbeen an assertive and strong voice on a number of these trade issues, \nincluding specifically the sugar issue. I am proud to have him as a \ncosponsor on this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/23/senate-section/article/S219-1", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S219]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 290--TO AUTHORIZE TESTIMONY, DOCUMENT PRODUCTION AND \n     LEGAL REPRESENTATION IN STATE OF IDAHO V.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 290, which was \nsubmitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 290) to authorize testimony, document \n     production and legal representation in State of Idaho v. \n     Joseph Daniel Hooper.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this resolution concerns a request for \ntestimony and documents in a criminal action in Idaho District Court \nfor the County of Kootenai. In the case of State of Idaho v. Joseph \nDaniel Hooper, the Coeur d'Alene city attorney's office has charged the \ndefendant with misdemeanor telephone harassment arising out of calls he \nmade to Senator Craig's Coeur d'Alene office. The defendant is also \nfacing a second, separate misdemeanor action for harassing telephone \ncalls made to his Congressman's office.\n  Pursuant to subpoena issued on behalf of the city prosecutor, this \nresolution authorizes an employee in Senator Craig's Coeur d'Alene \noffice who witnessed the events giving rise to this action, and any \nother employee in the Senator's office from whom testimony may be \nrequired, to testify and produce documents at trial, with \nrepresentation by the Senate legal counsel.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating to \nthis matter be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.

Res. 290\n\n       Whereas, in the case of State of Idaho v. Joseph Daniel \n     Hooper, C. No. CRM-03-019550, pending in the District Court \n     of the first Judicial District of the Senate of Idaho, in and \n     for the County of Kootenai, testimony has been requested from \n     Michelle A. Panos, an employee in the Coeur d'Alene office of \n     Senator Larry E. Craig;\n       Whereas, pursuant to sections 703(a) and 704(a)(2) of the \n     Ethics in Government Act of 1978, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 288b(a) \n     and 288c(a)(2), the Senate may direct its counsel to \n     represent employees of the Senate with respect to any \n     subpoena, order, or request for testimony relating to their \n     official responsibilities;\n       Whereas, by the privileges of the Senate of the United \n     States and Rule XI of the Standing Rules of the Senate, no \n     evidence under the control or in the possession of the Senate \n     may, by the judicial or administrative process, be taken from \n     such control or possession but by permission of the Senate; \n     and\n       Whereas, when it appears that evidence under the control or \n     in the possession of the Senate may promote the \n     administration of justice, the Senate will take such action \n     as will promote the ends of justice consistent with the \n     privileges of the Senate: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That Michelle A.

It is the leader's intention to complete action on this \nlegislation early next week. Therefore, Members are encouraged to make \nthemselves available during Monday's session to offer their amendments. \nAny votes ordered with respect to the pension bill will be stacked to \noccur on Tuesday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if my friend will yield, I am confident the \ndistinguished acting majority leader does not have the answer to this \nquestion, but I hope we can get it soon. We would like to know, as soon \nas possible, whether those votes the leader contemplates on Tuesday \ncould come after the caucuses rather than before, or at least if they \nare not, we should know right away because some of the people who live \non the east coast have the luxury of being able to come down here later \nin the day; those of us from the West have to come, anyway, the night \nbefore. But we would appreciate it if the leader would let us know as \nquickly as possible if he contemplates that vote in the morning on \nTuesday or the afternoon.\n  Mr. DeWINE. We certainly hope to make that information available to \nthe leaders as soon as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/23/senate-section/article/S221-2", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S221]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, JANUARY 26, 2004, AT 1 P.M.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE.
