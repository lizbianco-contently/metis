Thy \nlove transcends not only time and space, but human evil in its \narrogance and cruelty, prejudice and pride. Teach us that we do not \nexist by ourselves, in ourselves and for ourselves, but only learn what \nlife means when in a true relationship with others and with Thee. Teach \nus that our context is not an accidental cosmos but a purposeful \nCreator; our destiny no cosmic accident but a love-fashioned creation, \nand Thy self-revelation, O God, the key to our knowledge of the dust \nand the divine.\n  We mortals are made in Thine image, which is certainly not dust. If \nwe deny or ignore the revelation of Thy Word, then we make the dust our \nfinal goal and our way to it paved, at best, with ephemeral success, \nor, at worst, with evil done and its sad harvest multiplied. Lord, we \nknow that this need not be so. When we acknowledge that our destiny is \nin Thee then the past can be forgiven, the present empowered and the \nfuture unchecked by death. Increase this faith in all homes whose loved \nones have died and in particular those whose beloved have been serving \nthis Nation's present and future safety. Death is pointless especially \nto those for whom life is ultimately pointless, but when any life, long \nor short, is faithfully spent for the good of others and Thou, O God, \nart its goal, then powerless death is swallowed up in the victory of \nlife eternal.\n  Grant to these Senators of this 108th Congress a daily awareness of \nthis larger context, as they use talents entrusted and opportunities \nsent. Help them to match the one with the other as they strive for this \npeoples' long-term good and the human family's gain. And upon them \nindividually and together we ask Thy blessing. Amen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/25/senate-section/article/S9925-3", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9925]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore led the Pledge of Allegiance, as follows:\n\n       I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of \n     America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation \n     under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/25/senate-section/article/S9925-4", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9925]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

But it is still the \nexpectation that Members will be available to debate the amendments.\n  Also, today it is expected that the Senate will debate the Free Trade \nAgreement relative to Chile and Singapore. Some Members have indicated \nthat they desire to speak on these agreements today, and they will have \nthat opportunity following the Energy bill.\n  Under an order from last night, the next rollcall vote will occur on \nMonday at 5 p.m. That vote will be the nomination of Earl Yeakel to be \na United States District Judge for the Western District of Texas.\n  Following the 5 p.m. vote on Monday, the Senate will also vote in \nrelation to any available amendments to the Energy bill, as well as the \nChile and Singapore trade agreements.\n  Finally, a cloture motion will be filed today on Priscilla Owen's \nnomination to the United States Circuit for the Fifth Circuit. This \nwill be the third cloture motion on this nomination. That vote will \noccur on Tuesday.\n  I thank Members for their attention.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/25/senate-section/article/S9925-7", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9925]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.

Mr. President, the reason I ask for this privilege is to \nspeak to my colleagues in the Senate about two families in Idaho who \nhave just lost their sons fighting wildfires. My sympathy to the \nfamilies of Jeff Allen of\n\n[[Page S9926]]\n\nSalmon, ID, and Shane Heath of the Treasure Valley of Idaho. These \nbrave men lost their lives while trying to save our public lands from a \ncatastrophic wildfire in the Salmon-Challis National Forest, this past \nTuesday, July 22. Both men were experienced firefighters of the \nIndianola Helitack Crew.\n\n  My heart and prayers are with the family and friends of these two \nfirefighters and the Forest Service firefighting family.\n  Jeff Allen was 23 years old and had been a firefighter since 1999. He \nstarted working on the Salmon-Challis National Forest on a thinning \ncrew on the Salmon-Cobalt District in 1998. He served successfully in \nfighting devastating fires on the Salmon-Challis National Forest during \nthe 2000 fire season. Jeff was a marketing major at Boise State \nUniversity.\n  Shane Heath was 22 years old and this was his fourth season with the \nForest Service. He served on the Helitack crew as a certified sawyer \nand was also a student at Boise State University.\n  The tragic loss of these two men will be felt throughout their \ncommunities and their selfless acts of true bravery will not be \nforgotten. I commend the men and women who risk their lives every day \nby undertaking this terribly dangerous job with courage and \nprofessionalism.\n  Thousands of young men and women are on the fire fronts of the \nwildfires that are now sweeping across the West. As we enter the middle \nof fire season, with the devastating heat that we are having in the \nGreat Basin, and the West, I hope that we do not lose another fire \nfighter to wildfire.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/25/senate-section/article/S9926-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     THANKING APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE STAFF FOR HOMELAND SECURITY \n                          APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to commend the \nhard-working members of the staff of the Appropriations Committee for \nassisting in the passage of the Homeland Security appropriations bill \nlast night.\n  For over 3 days we were on the floor debating the bill and \nconsidering amendments.

And my friend from West Virginia, the \nranking minority member of the subcommittee, and his able staff all \nworked hard to help guide this bill through the subcommittee, the full \ncommittee, and then, even though we had disagreements on a number of \nsubjects during the consideration of the bill on the floor, the Senate \nworked its will. We passed the bill, and I know we will go to \nconference with the House.\n  But those members of the subcommittee staff I particularly want to \nsingle out for praise and my expression of appreciation this morning \nare: Rebecca Davies, Carol Cribbs, James Hayes, Les Spivey, Rachelle \nSchroeder, Josh Manley, and our intern Ferriday Mansel.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 14, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 14) to enhance the energy security of the United \n     States, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Campbell amendment No. 886, to replace ``tribal consortia'' \n     with ``tribal energy resource development organizations.''\n       Durbin amendment No. 1384, to amend title 49, United States \n     Code, to improve the system for enhancing automobile fuel \n     efficiency.\n       Durbin modified amendment No. 1385, to amend the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 to provide additional tax incentives for \n     enhancing motor vehicle fuel efficiency.\n       Bond amendment No. 1386, to impose additional requirements \n     for improving automobile fuel economy and reducing vehicle \n     emissions.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, Senator Domenici, chairman of the Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee, will be here soon to manage this bill \nfor the remainder of the morning. But I want to say at the outset, we \nare now involved in a national energy policy debate that will run \nthrough the balance of next week.\n  I thank to Senator Domenici, as chairman of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, for the way he has handled this critical issue for \nour Nation. He held thorough hearings on the importance of a balanced \nnational energy policy for our country. Much of the lead was taken by \nour President when he took office over 2 years ago as he outlined this \nissue as one of the highest priorities for our country.\n  Senator Domenici then began to work with all of us on that committee, \nDemocrats and Republicans, to craft a truly bipartisan and balanced \npiece of legislation. That is S. 14, the bill we have before us, a \nnational energy policy for our country. When I say ``balanced,'' Mr. \nPresident, as you know, one of the true problems in our country today \nis the failure to keep our energy production levels up with the demands \nof a growing economy.\n  Largely through the decade of the 1990s, we lived off the surpluses \nwe had generated by increased capacity being built in the decades of \nthe 1960s and 1970s and 1980s. But that surplus ran out in the late \n1990s. We began to see the blackouts and the brownouts in California. \nWe began to see energy prices increase. Our dependency on oil from \nforeign nations progressively grew during the decade of the 1990s, from \npercentages in the low 40s to the 60s. And, of course, as the Presiding \nOfficer knows, the senior Senator from Alaska, Alaska became during \nthat period of several decades a prime producer of high-quality crude \nfor this Nation, and still has tremendous oil reserves in Alaska that \ncould be made available if the politics were allowed to let that \nhappen. But that has not happened.\n  Senator Domenici recognizes that, and in the crafting of this bill \ndid a combination of things, in cooperation with all of us, to \nrecognize the need to get this country back into the production of \nenergy while at the same time recognizing the importance of \nconservation, recognizing the importance of our environment, and that \nthe energies we produce in the decade of 2000 to 2010 and beyond be \nclean sources of energy, and also recognizing the application of \ntechnology and the development of hydrogen fuel cells and wind and \nphotovoltaic.\n  Also, the Senator from New Mexico and I have worked very closely over \nthe last nearly two decades building a case for the return of the \ncleanest, most abundant source of energy for our country: electricity \ngenerated by the nuclear generation process and nuclear reactors.\n  There has been a schism or a belief in our country that somehow this \nwas not a safe way to generate electricity, and that we could not \nmanage the waste stream produced from nuclear reactors. Quite the \nopposite is now true. Not only have we moved significantly in the \ndevelopment of a clean waste stream, but this legislation also speaks \nto what we now call Generation IV or new passive reactors this \nlegislation would authorize the design and development of for future \ngenerations. This is, without question--other than wind, solar, and \nhydro--the cleanest form of energy we have because it can produce \nenergy at high, sustained levels to meet the demand of a high-tech \neconomy and, at the same time, do it very cleanly.\n  This bill is a complete and balanced energy policy for our Nation. As \nI have said, it puts us back into the business of producing energy. It \nrecognizes conservation. It recognizes technology. Our President has \nchallenged us to develop hydrogen as a new source of transportation \nfuel for our country. This legislation deals with those issues, and I \nthink it does so in not only a comprehensive and environmentally \nsensitive way, but it clearly recognizes that this economy runs on \nenergy, period, end of statement.\n\n  Every one of us today started our day using energy. The clock that \nawakened us, the radio that turned on was turned on by energy. The cool \nroom we slept in last night was cooled by energy. Many of you probably \nbrushed your teeth with an electric toothbrush this morning fueled by \nenergy. The water that surged out of the tap in your bathroom or from \nthe nozzle of your shower\n\n[[Page S9927]]\n\nthis morning--the pressure was produced by energy. And it goes on and \non.\n  When you went into your kitchen and opened the refrigerator to get \nout a glass of orange juice, the refrigerator was cooled by energy. The \norange juice was processed by energy--and so on.\n  Did you walk here this morning? If you did, you used your own energy, \nbut it was generated by all those other sources of energy. But if you \ndrove here, then you used the standard form of energy that has kept \nthis economy so vibrant for so many decades. Without question, we are \nan energy-intensive, extensive, involved economy. Without an abundant, \navailable source of energy in all forms, this economy does not function \nwell or it becomes increasingly dependent on those nations that produce \nenergy and sell it to us.\n  Senator Domenici, myself, and others serving on the Energy Committee \nhave recognized that, I believe, in a responsible way in S. 14. Now we \nhave the opportunity to complete the debate on this legislation. There \nare hundreds of amendments that have been filed, and we will work very \nhard to get through all of them. But then all of them are not intended \never to be offered. They are merely offered as placeholders or for the \npolitical statement one of our colleagues may want to make as it \nrelates to a constituent or to his or her particular views on energy.\n  So we hope--and I think the Senator from New Mexico, who is now in \nthe Chamber hopes--we can work our way through those amendments over \nthe course of the next week as we move toward completion of this bill \nbefore the August recess.\n  This bill has already been on the floor for hours over the course of \nthe last several months, and we have had a variety of amendments \nalready. So for anyone who will stand and wring their hands and say it \ncannot be completed by next week, they are simply saying: I don't want \nto complete it by next week--for whatever political purpose that might \nserve the individual.\n  Our leader, Majority Leader Frist, says we will start early and work \nlate; and we are prepared to do just that, starting on Monday with \nvotes on this legislation and working through the remainder of the \nweek.\n  At this time I will yield the floor to the chairman of the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee and, once again, recognize him for the \nphenomenally hard work he has put into building a balanced national \nenergy policy, reflected in S. 14.\n  I hope by next Friday evening we will have finalized this bill, gone \nto final passage, and that this will be the year when we put on the \ndesk of the President of the United States a futuristic program for the \nassurance of the development of energy for generations of Americans to \ncome--that product which will fuel a vibrant economy for our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I understand we will have a number of \namendments this morning. Yesterday we had two CAFE amendments. I \nunderstand there is a third--at least a third--that will be presented \nthis morning. We are hoping that will be the extent of the CAFE \namendments and that we will eventually vote on those and the Senate \nwill work its will, as it has already in the past on CAFE standards. I \nunderstand there is a good chance there will be a number of amendments \noffered this morning.\n  There is no desire on my part to ask for votes today. Every effort \nwill be made to work out with the minority a method of stacking them \nfor Monday which would be far more accommodating to Senators.\n  While we wait to untangle some matters, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

PRYOR\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to bring my colleagues up to \nspeed on the nomination of Attorney General Bill Pryor from the State \nof Alabama for U.S. District Court for the Eleventh Circuit Court of \nAppeals.\n  Bill Pryor is an extraordinary nominee, one of the finest, most \ndecent, most intelligent, and most ethical individuals I have ever had \nthe pleasure of knowing. His reputation throughout the State of Alabama \nis extraordinary. His career as a lawyer is extraordinary. He would \nmake a magnificent judge on the court of appeals.\n  Bill grew up in Mobile, AL. He attended the Catholic school there, \nMcGill-Toolen. His father was band director there. They were active in \ntheir church. They are the kind of family we ought to emulate and lift \nup and be proud of. I have heard it said that Mr. Pryor was a John \nKennedy Democrat in the 1960s. After some of the problems we have had, \nhe probably has changed some of his views about his politics in the \nlast few days. But he is a remarkable man, and his mother and family \nare remarkable.\n  Bill went to Tulane Law School, one of America's great law schools. \nHe worked very hard. He finished at the top of his class. He was the \neditor in chief of the Tulane Law Review. The most prestigious position \na graduating law senior can have is to be the editor of the law review \nfor the law school. It is a quite an honor.\n  He clerked after that for Judge John Minor Wisdom, one of the great \njustices on the old Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. Judge Wisdom has \nbeen known as a champion of civil rights in the South. He was one of \nthose judges on the court of appeals during the time of the end of \nsegregation and the movement toward integration. It was not easy. The \ncourt was constantly in the arena, whether they wanted to be there or \nnot. Judge Wisdom has been recognized by all as being a champion in \nthat area.\n  Bill Pryor is a man of religious faith. He attends church regularly. \nHis wife and children do so. He is a Catholic, and he believes in the \ndoctrine of the church. It seems that some of those beliefs he shares \nwith millions of Americans and millions of people throughout the world \nhave caused some of the difficulties he has had.\n  He helped me. When I was attorney general of Alabama, I put him in \ncharge of appellate litigation and constitutional litigation. He wrote \nbriefs to the court of appeals. He argued those cases personally. He \nhad already been with two of Alabama's best law firms before he agreed \nto join me, giving up a very lucrative law career. The firms wanted him \nto stay. He was in a position to be partner and make a great deal of \nmoney. But he believed in public service. He and his wife talked about \nit. They agreed to come to work.\n  After I was elected to the Senate 2 years later, Governor James, then \nRepublican Governor of Alabama, appointed Bill to be my successor as \nattorney general. In that position, he has stood courageously for the \nvalues he believes in. He has done so with clarity and conviction, \nwinning the confidence and respect of people throughout the State, even \nthose who are of a different political party and race.\n  For example, when he was sworn in, he said in his inaugural address: \n``The constitution and laws of this State should have not one thing in \nthem that would discriminate against a person because of their race.'' \nWe had in our Alabama Constitution an old amendment that said \ninterracial marriages were banned. That had been declared \nunconstitutional by the Supreme Court, but Bill thought it ought not to \nbe in there. He joined with State Representative Alvin Holmes who \nworked on the team of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., during those very \ntough days of civil rights. Together they led the battle, and the \npeople of Alabama removed that amendment from the constitution.\n\n  Alvin Holmes said: No other politician in Alabama, Republican or \nDemocrat, White politician, supported me in that effort but Bill Pryor.\n  He wrote one of the most powerful, moving letters anybody would ever \nwant to see explaining the character of Bill Pryor and why he should be \na Federal judge.\n  Along that line, Mr. Joe Reed, Representative Joe Reed, Dr. Joe Reed,\n\n[[Page S9928]]\n\nwho is the vice chairman of the Alabama teachers union, the AEA, a \nmember of the Democratic National Committee, who has chaired for 30 \nyears the Alabama Democratic Conference, a powerful force in Alabama--\nthere is nobody who has run for the Democratic nomination for President \nin these United States who does not know Dr. Joe Reed. He is the first \nperson they would want to talk to as they consider how to be involved \nin winning a primary in Alabama. Dr. Reed supports him strongly.\n  Congressman Artur Davis, a Harvard Law graduate, former assistant \nU.S. attorney, African American, supports Bill Pryor.\n  The former Democratic Governor of Alabama has spoken highly of him. \nHe has that kind of reputation. His reputation is that Bill Pryor does \nwhat is right; he follows the law, whether it is popular or not.\n  One of the issues that was important politically in the State--and \neach State has issues that arise given time--was separation of church \nand state. The issue became very contentious. Our Republican Governor, \nBob James, had a very strong view about it. He played football and he \nsaid he didn't see anything wrong with a coach leading the kids in \nprayer. Frankly, I don't either. But the Supreme Court has ruled to the \ncontrary.\n  Governor James had other very strong views. He had just appointed \nBill Pryor to the attorney general office to be one of the youngest \nattorneys general in America. He had this idea about how these issues \nought to be argued in court. But under the Alabama Constitution, the \nattorney general speaks for the State of Alabama in court. So they had \na conversation or two, and Attorney General Pryor had to reluctantly \ntell the man who just appointed him, in a very hot political deal, that \nyour position will not hold up according to the law; I cannot support \nthat.\n  The Governor took a very strong position on the right of school \nofficials to speak on religious issues, and reluctantly the attorney \ngeneral had to file a brief on the subject. The attorney general filed \na brief and said flat out that the Governor's position did not state \nthe legal position of the State of Alabama. He argued the case \naccording to the precedent of the Supreme Court. He also, in that \nconfused time, wrote a legal opinion, which he sent to every school \nofficial in the State, setting forth what children could do in the free \nexercise of their religious beliefs and what schools could and could \nnot do. In fact, those rules that he sent out were adopted almost in \ntoto by the Clinton Department of Education as their directives to \npolicy concerning the separation of church and state in schools. He \nfollowed the law, even though it was very tough for him to do so.\n\n  They have expressed real reservation about Mr. Pryor. They say he has \nstrongly held views, that he is extreme in his pro-life views, that he \nis very passionate, and that he would not follow the law, basically.\n  They have criticized him for his views on abortion. He didn't \nvolunteer those views. But in the committee, one of the Senators looked \nright at him and asked him about that. He explained that he thought \nthat taking an unborn life was immoral and that Roe v. Wade has led to \nthe slaughter of millions of innocent unborn. You could have heard a \npin drop. Nobody had really been asked that squarely. He answered it \nhonestly. He said: But, Senator, I know the courts don't follow that \nview and it is not the law today, and I follow the law as it is \nwritten.\n  In fact, he had proof of it because, previously, when he was attorney \ngeneral, Alabama passed a law to ban partial abortions. That law was a \nbroad law. Under the Supreme Court rulings and other rulings, portions \nof that statute were not constitutional. Attorney General Pryor, as \nattorney general of Alabama, had to send a directive to all the \ndistrict attorneys in Alabama directing them not to enforce portions of \nthat law that violate the Constitution of the United States. So even \nthough he thought, no doubt, partial-birth abortion was wrong--because \nhe believes abortion is wrong, so he would certainly believe that \nhorrible procedure would be wrong--he was a lawyer and he spoke up and \nhe directed, as attorney general, every district attorney in the State \nto enforce that law, consistent with the Constitution. I think that \ndemonstrates clearly his ability to understand and follow the law even \nif he does not agree with it.\n  The only other thing I know he has ever done with regard to abortion \nis to make clear that if there were a protest at an abortion clinic \nthat violated the law and the right of people to attend that clinic, \nthey would be prosecuted by him. He would enforce the constitutional \nright of people to go to clinics and have abortions under the laws of \nthe United States.\n  Another issue we dealt with in the State was reapportionment. Most \nRepublicans believed strongly that reapportionment had been very \nadverse to their ability to have a representative in the State \nlegislature. As a whole, the State is a majority Republican State, with \nboth Senators, the Governor, and five of the seven Congressmen being \nRepublicans. But the legislature is about two-thirds Democrats.\n  A lawsuit was filed by the Republican groups to get the legislature \nreapportioned, hoping they would get a better shake in the numbers. It \nwas a pretty legitimate suit. It had real merit to it. They wanted Bill \nPryor to take the lead in it as attorney general. He was a Republican, \nafter all. Some lawyers had known him for years and they had worked \nwith him. Bill researched the law and said: You don't have standing, \nand this is not a legitimate lawsuit, and I cannot support it. They \nsaid: What do you mean? They called me saying I have to get Bill to \nchange his idea and help them win. But I told them then that Bill \nfollows the law. If you have the law, do it; if you don't, he will not \nhelp you. So he resisted their actions. He defended the Democratic \nposition. He defended, particularly, the African-American position. He \nactually lost the case in the court of appeals and appealed it to the \nSupreme Court of the United States and won it. He was right all along.\n  So I can give many examples of this brilliant lawyer who has stood \nfirm for what he believes is right, who gives bipartisan, biracial \nsupport to the people in Alabama, a man who would flourish as a court \nof appeals judge, a man who loves America. He has sincere and great \nreligious faith. He understands the rule of law and places all that in \nproper context. I am just proud of him. I am glad the committee has \nmoved him forward. I hope we will see him confirmed as a Federal judge.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I take a couple of minutes to speak \nabout the tragic death of Colin McMillan, who was a very outstanding \ncitizen of our State of New Mexico. He had distinguished himself as a \nbusinessman and also as a public servant in Roswell. In Santa Fe, he \nserved in the State legislature, with a leadership position, and also \nhere in Washington, where he served in the Department of Defense in the \nprevious Bush administration. He was influential and effective in all \nof the positions he held. He was extremely well respected for his \nstraight dealing and his integrity.\n  I met Colin first when I was in law practice in Santa Fe and he was \nin our State legislature. As I indicated, he had a very prominent \nposition, a leadership position, in our State legislature back in the \n1970s. Since then, our paths have crossed many times. Most recently, we \nspoke when he came to my office to discuss his nomination by President \nBush to serve as the Secretary of the Navy.\n  This is a position I strongly supported him obtaining and I told him \nI was looking forward to him being back in Washington. I know he and \nhis wife Kay were looking forward to returning to Washington. He spoke \nwith great enthusiasm about his plans in that new position.\n  His death is a loss to us in New Mexico, and it is a loss to the \ncountry. We will be deprived of his leadership.\n  I know he was a very good friend of my colleague, Senator Domenici, \nfor many years and a political ally in New Mexico for many years. His \nloss will be noted and regretted by all of us in New Mexico.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n[[Page S9929]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, last night I took a couple of minutes to \ntell the Senate that a good friend of mine, but also a great New \nMexican, was dead, Colin McMillan. My friend and colleague, Senator \nBingaman, just spoke of him.\n  It is remarkable that Senator Bingaman would speak of him with such \nglaring words when, as a matter of fact, they ran against each other in \na statewide campaign.\n  The truth is, he was a truly outstanding man. His death is rather \nunexplainable. We still do not know enough about it, but we do know \nthat he was too young to die and had succeeded at just about everything \nhe tried in his life, starting out at the University of North Carolina \nwhere he was a Phi Beta Kappa in the college of engineering and became \nan enormously successful geological engineer. He was one of those who \nwas first to grab on to the modern techniques of discerning what lies \nbelow the surface and, thus, became an expert and developed a \nsuccessful company helping others locate oil and gas. He formed his own \nexploration company and became an oil and gas entrepreneur.\n  Along with that achievement, he had a western craving to own a ranch, \nand he had a beautiful ranch. I have been there many times. It is a \ngreat place to hunt quail. His ranch is renowned for quail. My son \nPeter and I and others in New Mexico have been there with him many \ntimes. It is rather ironic that he was found dead at the ranch \nyesterday some time during the day by the ranch hands.\n  When I spoke this morning with my oldest son, he used the word \n``brutal.'' I use it today. It is truly brutal for those of us who knew \nhim. All we can say is he succeeded at almost everything he wanted to \ndo in life. Clearly, there are few in New Mexico who will achieve as \nmuch as he. He was really looking forward to becoming Secretary of the \nNavy, taking great pride in being a Marine officer for 3 years after \ncompleting his baccalaureate degree in North Carolina.\n  I and my wife Nancy clearly have had a very tough personal loss in \nhis death, and there is not much more I can say other than he will be \nmissed. We will all find out someday, perhaps in the hereafter, how all \nthis happened. In the meantime, all we can say is we will miss him \nterribly, and we wish for all of his family an understanding beyond \nnormal capacity to apprehend, that there will come upon them some \nunderstanding as to why all of this happened.\n  He had been sick. He had a recurrence of cancer that inflicted him \nsome 2 years ago. Everybody thought he was recovered and recuperating \nquite well. At least we thought so and his family thought so, when this \ntragedy occurred.\n  I thank the Senate for the time.\n  Mr. President, before we call on Senators, we are expecting closure \nof between 5 and 10 amendments, which we will present jointly this \nmorning on this Energy bill. The biggest issue everyone has asked so \nmuch about is the electricity title. It is a very complex title. We \nhave tried to put together a major bipartisan amendment. It is in the \nhands of all the Senators and, as a result, because it is so important, \nit is in the hands of hundreds of experts and lobbyists and companies \nacross this country.\n  By Monday, everybody should know what they want to do with it, to it, \nor for it. It will be offered Monday with the hope that we will begin \nserious debate on that amendment.\n  CAFE standards has been one of those issues of importance. We have \ntwo of the major CAFE standards amendments pending. They were offered \nlast night. We will work out a time for voting on them on Monday. We \nexpected another CAFE standards amendment this morning, but it has not \nmaterialized. Let's hope it does so we can get them all lined up to \ndispose of them Monday evening.\n  There are about five other major issues that are being worked on, and \nwe hope we can prove that the Senate is capable of completing this bill \nin five additional working days, besides last night and today, and the \nprevious time we spent on the bill.\n  Everyone should remember, the majority leader said we are going to \nfinish this bill. We are scheduled for our August recess next Friday, \nbut we have been told those recess days will not commence until we have \nfinished this bill. I hope everybody understands that is not said in \nany way other than in a positive way. There is plenty of time so long \nas Senators do not desire an inordinate amount of time on any subject. \nWe probably have one or two climate change amendments. We probably \nhave, as I indicated, an additional CAFE amendment and many amendments \non the electricity section. Plus, I am sure the minority leader has \nsome amendments with reference to mandating the percentage of wind \nenergy and solar energy that must be utilized by the utility companies. \nThat will be thoroughly debated and voted on. There may be a couple \nother major issues, but I think that covers most of them--and I covered \nthem last night reminding everybody to get ready. We always have the \nidea around here that we will get ready when the time is necessary.\n  People put off things until that ominous time. On Energy amendments, \nthe time has come. The electricity amendment is in our hands. It is \nmajor legislation. We are going to proceed with dispatch, at least as \nmuch dispatch as the Senate will let us, and we will try to push that \nas nicely and calmly but as rigorously as we can for the next 5 or 6 \ndays in an effort to complete this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

RES. 200\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 200 regarding the adoption of a \nconference agreement on the child tax credit; that the resolution and \nthe preamble be agreed to; and that the motion to reconsider be laid on \nthe table.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I object.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I call on Congress to pass the Lincoln \nbill which will provide immediate tax relief for 12 million children \nand our Nation's fighting men and women.\n  Millions of working American families with incomes between $10,000 \nand $26,000 will receive absolutely no benefit from the increase in the \nchild credit that was signed into law by the President several weeks \nago. Close to 200,000 military personnel have incomes in this range, \nand most will not qualify for the $1,000 child tax credit.\n  More then 300,000 military personnel are currently serving in combat \nzones around the world. In answering the call of duty, these young men \nand women were forced to leave their families behind as they headed to \nIraq and Afghanistan to serve their country and to help create new \ndemocracies. Yet this Nation's laws have failed them. Under current \nlaw, the children of these families are truly left behind.\n  The Treasury Department will begin sending checks to taxpayers \nreflecting the increase in the child credit from $600 to $1,000 for \n2003. Yet the Children's Defense Fund estimates that 1 million children \nin military families will not be eligible for the full child credit. \nThis is roughly 1 out of every 8 children of military families.\n  For active duty military families, the numbers are even more \nstaggering. Roughly 260,000 of the 1.4 million children of active duty \nmilitary personnel, or nearly 1 of every 5, will not receive the $1,000 \nchild credit.\n  Military personnel serving in combat zones in Iraq and Afghanistan \nwould be particularly hard hit. Under current law, a family must make \n$10,500 to qualify for any portion of the child credit. Because combat \nzone pay does not count toward the income required, many military \npersonnel who left their families behind to fight America's wars will \nthemselves be left behind by this Congress.\n  Congress has failed its fighting men and women. It does not matter \nhow many speeches we give thanking them for their service, and \nlionizing their courage, and acclaiming their patriotism.\n  The single mother whose husband has been deployed to the Middle East \nfor the 50th week running cares a lot more about getting her $400 check \nthan she does about hearing how much we appreciate her sacrifice.\n  Frankly, it is shameful that a body willing to send our young men and \nwomen to war would at the same time turn a blind eye and a deaf ear to \ntheir families.\n\n[[Page S9930]]\n\n  The Lincoln bill, however, changes the law to ensure those military \npersonnel fighting for our freedom will receive the child credit that \nis guaranteed to all other middle-income families. The Lincoln bill \nwill ensure that military families get the child credit checks promised \nto our Nation's families.\n  In contrast, the House bill will leave these families behind. For \nexample: Navy Petty Officer Second Class E-5, 4 years service, married \nwith two children, stationed in Iraq from December 2002 until June \n2003. He receives an annual salary of $22,842, and hazardous duty pay \nof $190 per month. Under current law, he will not see any of the \nincrease in the child credit. Under the Lincoln bill, he will get the \nfull $1,000 per child tax credit, an increase of $800, which his family \nwill receive through a check in their mailbox.\n  The Senate bill also recognizes that the latest Bush tax cut failed \nto include millions of working families, families who have jobs and \nwork hard to put food on the table for their children, and that they \ndeserve tax relief as well.\n  Unless we pass the Lincoln bill, there is no check in the mail for \nover 6.5 million working families earning between $10,500 and $26,625; \nthis means that over 12 million children will be left behind.\n  Not only do we help millions of children, but we pay for every penny \nby shutting down corporate tax loopholes.\n  For all these reasons, I call on the Senate to express its deep \ncommitment to working together for this Nation's fighting men and \nwomen, this Nation's working men and women, and all of their children, \nand ask that: 1, the committee of conference between the Senate and \nHouse of Representatives on H.R. 1308 should agree to a conference \nreport before the August recess; 2, any conference report on H.R. 1308 \nshould contain the provisions in the Senate Amendment to H.R. 1308 \nconcerning the refundability of the child tax credit; 3, any conference \nreport on H.R. 1308 should contain the provisions in the Senate \namendment to H.R. 1308 concerning the availability of the child tax \ncredit for military families; 4, any conference report on H.R. 1308 \nshould contain the provision in the Armed Forces Tax Fairness Act of \n2003; and 5, any conference report on H.R. 1308 should contain \nprovisions to fully offset its cost.\n  It is my hope that this resolution will be taken up promptly and that \nwe will emerge from conference with the House in a timely fashion so \nthat we may honor the families of our fighting men and women in a very \nreal way with more than platitudes, more than salutes, more than just \nhonors, but by including their kids and their families in the same kind \nof tax credit that other American families receive.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have been informed that the House this \nevening will pass a bill for $989 million dealing with disaster relief. \nAs my colleagues know, we received a supplemental request from the \nPresident for $1,550,000,000 for the Department of Homeland Security \nfor disaster response. It is estimated that the disaster fund probably \nhas already run out of money during this month of July. When the money \nruns out, when there are storms, tornados, whatever they have to deal \nwith, they borrow from other accounts, which means as we get towards \nthe end of this fiscal year those other accounts must come to an end. \nWe have tried to meet the President's request by sending the \nsupplemental as part of the legislative appropriations bill.\n  The House has refused to conference with us on that bill. Now they \nare going to send us a bill that is totally inadequate. If they leave \nthis city without giving us a supplemental for fires, it is going to \nleave the West burning, and it is going to bring to a halt other \nfunctions of the Federal Government which must continue through this \nperiod until September 30. I cannot believe that they would do this.\n  The supplemental the President sent to us provided $50 million for \nNASA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, to cover \nunanticipated costs of the recovery and investigation of the Space \nShuttle Columbia accident. I am informed that as far as NASA is \nconcerned, the actual costs of the Columbia accident investigation \nboard is about $150 million so far. That means NASA has to take that \nmoney out of their current accounts and the remainder of the year they, \ntoo, will be strapped and will not be doing the scientific \ninvestigations, not be doing the prevention that is necessary in order \nto get ready for another NASA shuttle flight.\n  We received the supplemental on July 8. We acted almost as quickly as \npossible. It is true, we put on that bill the money to save the program \nfor education of young people, AmeriCorps. AmeriCorps is another \nsubject, and I will get into that in a minute. But because we put \nAmeriCorps on that bill, the House refused to act.\n  We have offered a series of suggestions.\n  It is impossible to believe this message I received this morning. We \nare going to get a bill that has less than $1 billion in it, when the \nPresident asked for $1.550 billion for FEMA and he asked for NASA at \nthe same time. He had money in there for firefighting. The President \nhad $253 million for Forest Service and fire suppression. We added $36 \nmillion for the Bureau of Land Management.\n  This is a terrible fire season. I am informed Glacier Park is ready \nto be evacuated. We have to have some disaster money. When I checked on \nJuly 21, the disaster relief fund had $89 million in it. We are \ncurrently estimating an obligation rate of about $5.7 million a day on \nthe fires that existed on July 21. There is a whole new series of fires \njust this week. I cannot believe this.\n  In addition, there is an obligation to rise to $6.3 million as the \ndisaster activity in Texas ramps up due to Hurricane Claudette.\n  I hope others will also join to call on the House to give a bill that \nwill meet the needs, particularly the needs of the West. These fires \nare primarily in the West. The need for FEMA is national. The \nfirefighting conditions right now in the West could not be worse. There \nis enormous heat in the West, including my State of Alaska. Even with \nenactment of the supplemental, which we sent to the House, I am told \nthe Forest Service projects will have a deficit of $167 million by \nSeptember. That is, with all the money we provided for FEMA and for \nfirefighting, the Forest Service alone will have a deficit of $167 \nmillion based on projections of July 14th. We have increased fires, \nparticularly in the Park Service area. It is the park that is burning \nout there now. I cannot believe we cannot have a conference on the \nsupplemental before the House leaves.\n  AmeriCorps is a problem, too. The Government, by mistake, enrolled \n70,000 young people to enter school in September. The moneys that had \nbeen previously divided only covered 50,000 young people. The person \nwho made that mistake is no longer with the Government. But the young \npeople are out there now with their certificates. They are entitled to \nenter school, but the money will not be there. It is the worst \nsituation I have faced as chairman of the Appropriations Committee. We \nhave to have some action by the House before they leave tonight. If \nthey leave tonight without giving us the money we need to meet these \ndisaster needs, I think we are going to have a terrible September.\n  By the way, the House is going home tonight. They could have stayed \nanother week and we could conference the bills. The bills have been \nsent to conference. When we come back in September we have to meet with \nthe House in conference and at the same time try to pass the bills we \ncould have passed and should have passed had they sent us the bills in \ntime. They will send us a whole series of bills they are now passing as \nthey leave town. The Appropriations Committee must conference those \nbills in September and at the same time we must pass the ones they have \njust passed.\n  We cannot be two places at one time. The scheduling of appropriations \nthis\n\n[[Page S9931]]\n\nyear is abominable. Someone mentioned the word ``tirade'' yesterday. \nThis is a tirade, and it is time for a tirade. It is time to be strong \nin talking to our colleagues in the House. We must have that bill today \nthat covers the disasters the President recognized back in July. They \nare worse now than when he sent the bill to us.\n  I hope others who have the knowledge will talk about the \nfirefighting. In Alaska, we have fire conditions we have never faced \nbefore. One of the real problems is we have been unable to cut into the \nareas of the Forest Service and the Fish and Wildlife Service owned by \nthe Federal Government that have beetle kill.\n  I read just last night, two young fishermen were out and they had an \naccident. They tried to set a fire to attract the attention of small \nplanes flying in their area. The fire got out of control and burned \n40,000 acres before we could even get to it. I don't know how many \nacres that will burn. But that is the condition that exists in the West \ntoday. They built a signal fire and that signal fire is totally out of \ncontrol now.\n  We have to have funds to meet this condition this year. It is not \nsatisfactory to say they can borrow money from other accounts. When \nthey borrow money from other accounts, they shut down those activities \nthat primarily exist in the West in July, August, and early September.\n  I call on the House: Do something; react. The President asked on July \n8th. Give us the bill we need to meet the disasters that are occurring \nright now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my dismay about the \nfailure to provide the child tax credit to millions of low-income \nAmericans. In this regard, I join my colleague, Senator Johnson, and \napplaud his efforts to try today, through unanimous consent, to resolve \nthat at least we will as a Congress commit ourselves to give the \nbenefit to low-income families which many other families in America are \nabout to enjoy.\n  Yesterday, the Internal Revenue Service began mailing out the first \nbatch of advance $400 checks to middle and upper-income American \nfamilies who are receiving the child tax credit. The President was at a \nmailing facility to get a visual of these checks going out. That is \ngood news for these families. But certainly low-income Americans have \nthe same needs; in fact, one might argue even more compelling needs for \nhelp and assistance to raise their children.\n  Mr. President, 6.5 million low-income families will not receive a \ncheck today. They will be left out. Even though this body acted \nprudently to give them the opportunity, the House, in May, dropped the \nprovisions and did not respond with an appropriate bill.\n  On June 5, nearly 2 months ago, this Senate, in a bipartisan manner, \npassed legislation that would provide for the refundability of these \ntax credits and in effect give the credit to low-income families. I \ncommend all of the individual Senators who have led the way both on the \nFinance Committee and, in particular, Senator Lincoln of Arkansas, who \nhas been advocating strenuously for this very fair and very prudent \napproach.\n  The House, on the other hand, passed an expansive $82 billion tax cut \npackage surrounding this child tax care credit. As a result, they \npoliticized and essentially frustrated the obvious and the compelling \nneed to help these low-income families.\n  The President has called for the passage of this act, but frankly, \nother than appearing yesterday at a mailing facility, he has not done a \ngreat deal to force the House to pass this very simple, very necessary \nmeasure.\n  I hope we can make progress on this. This tax credit for child care \nis an important benefit for all of our families and, as I said before, \nvery important for low-income Americans. They are struggling and with \nboth parents working two jobs to make ends meet. These are the working \nAmericans who are doing difficult work and working very hard. They \ndeserve the same kind of assistance to raise their children we are \nproviding for middle and upper-income Americans.\n  This is a question of fairness, certainly. It is unfair, in my view, \nthat we would provide benefits for certain children--ironically, some \nof the most affluent children--and not provide similar benefits for \nlow-income families with children. It is just patently unfair. Also, it \nis part of an emerging pattern of indifference, and worse, towards low-\nincome Americans.\n  There is the issue of the Earned-Income Tax Credit. This has been an \nenormously successful program. It has, in my State of Rhode Island \nalone, provided $90 million to over 57,000 families in the year 2001, \ngiving them additional help based upon their work. Recall now, this is \nthe Earned-Income Tax Credit; you have to be working, you have to \nqualify by accumulating income to get the tax credit.\n  This is one of those very ingenious mechanisms which help lift \nfamilies and children out of poverty, and it has done so with \nremarkable success. It has been a tax provision supported by both sides \nof the aisle enthusiastically for several decades. But now the IRS has \nannounced its intention to require elaborate precertification for EITC \neligibility for about 45,000, as they term it, high-risk households. \nGenerally these are households in which grandparents or single fathers \nare raising children.\n  But perhaps of more concern to me is that there are plans to expand \nthis precertification process to 2 million households in the year 2004 \nand to 5 million households within 3 years. This is a move that \nPresident Bush clearly supports, because he requested $100 million in \nadditional funds for the fiscal year 2004 budget for this so-called \ncompliance initiative.\n  If we were to propose an elaborate precertification for middle-income \nand upper-income tax advantages, there would be howls of protest. We \nwould rush to this floor crying foul, accusing the IRS of overreaching \nand meddling with burdensome impacts upon taxpayers. But that is \nexactly what, in my view, is happening to low-income families in the \nbudget proposal of the President for this precertification.\n  Again, I note the President has requested $100 million for additional \nfunds to supposedly precertify families qualifying for a tax advantage \nunder the Earned-Income Tax Credit. Just yesterday we couldn't afford, \naccording to the vote, $100 million for improved transit security in \nthe United States. That suggests to me the wrong, and perverse, if you \nwill, priorities. If we are spending $100 million to try to force low-\nincome families to come up with documentation to qualify for a tax cut \nbut we can't find the money to protect the subways and the trains and \nthe buses in the United States, that suggests something askew in our \npolicies and our priorities.\n  I think what the pre-certification does, frankly, and maybe \nintentionally, will dissuade some individuals who qualify for the EITC \nfrom coming forward and applying for it. They might not understand the \nnew precertification. They might have to pay for tax advice to do it \nappropriately. And one other point: the IRS has the authority to \nrelease all this documentation to the Department of Justice and other \nFederal agencies at their discretion, which might cause some people \nconcerns about privacy.\n  This is something that, again, if we proposed it for middle- or \nupper-income Americans, you could not hear yourself think because of \nthe howls of protest in this body. Indeed, back in 1998 we passed the \nInternal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act because of \nsupposed taxpayer harassment inflicted upon middle- and upper-income \nAmericans by the IRS. It seems when it comes to low-income Americans \nwho work and who qualify for the EITC, harassment isn't a problem when \nit comes to proposals by the administration.\n\n  I am also disappointed that in line with this attack against low-\nincome Americans is the inability of this body and the other body to \npass a long-term unemployment compensation benefit that will really \ntake care of all the Americans who are suffering because of an economy \nthat is functioning poorly--and that is being polite--at this\n\n[[Page S9932]]\n\nmoment. Unemployment in June was up to 6.4 percent, and those numbers \ndon't even include the 4.5 million underemployed individuals, those who \nare working part time, looking for full-time employment but struggling \nto get by on part-time jobs. At least 1.3 million of these 4.5 million \nare in that category of looking for long-term, full-time employment but \nhaving to settle for something part-time. Yet they are excluded from \nour unemployment compensation provisions.\n  In addition, we will shortly be looking at new rules by the \nDepartment of Labor with regard to the Fair Labor Standards Act that \nrelax overtime protection. We are also encountering proposals to \nincrease the TANF requirements from 30 hours to 40 hours per week. \nHere, at a time when there are so many Americans struggling to find a \njob, struggling to find a few hours of part-time work, we are proposing \nto increase the number of work hours under the TANF Program. I think \nthis approach to TANF will be another impact on the low-income children \nof this country because it will necessarily require mothers to spend \nless time with their children. Again, this is another example of a \npolicy that is not good for the economy and it is certainly not good \nfor children.\n  Then we are looking at Head Start proposals and AmeriCorps proposals, \nas Senator Stevens just indicated, that are shortchanging so many \npeople, particularly young people in this country. Again, I hope we can \nvery quickly resolve this issue with respect to the child tax credit, \nthe underlying point of my remarks today. There are 6.5 million wage \nearners who are working, contributing to our economy, and trying with \nall their might to raise their children. Today we are ignoring the \nplight of all of those 6.5 million people. I hope our indifference will \nend very quickly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 10 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a truly \nremarkable Ohioan--a man who has covered Cincinnati Reds baseball for \nthe Dayton Daily News for the last 31 years. This weekend, Hal McCoy \nwill join many legendary baseball players and sports writers when he is \ninducted into the writers wing of the Major League Baseball Hall of \nFame. This is a fitting and well-deserved tribute to a man who reminds \nall his readers everyday about why we love baseball.\n  I am a life-long fan of the Cincinnati Reds. For the last 31 years, I \nhave counted on Hal McCoy for complete, detailed, objective coverage of \ntheir games. When I am back home in Ohio, the first thing I do when I \npick up the Dayton Daily News in the morning is read Hal's reports. \nWhen I am in Washington, I read them off the Internet.\n  For more than 3 decades, Hal McCoy has brought to life in vivid \ndetail thousands of Reds games. Through his words and insights, he has \ntaken readers, like me, onto the field and into the clubhouse. With his \nstories, we have felt the players' pride in their wins and the pain in \ntheir losses. Hal McCoy has brought readers right to the game, giving \nus a real glimpse into the highs and lows of the Reds seasons.\n  One of the things I admire most about Hal is his incredible work \nethic--unbelievable. Hal McCoy is, some people have said, almost a \nmachine. I have always been amazed by his ability to crank out so much \nmaterial and so many anecdotes and ``notes'' from the games. Nothing \nstops him.\n  You pick up the paper in the morning and you see the account of a \ngame. Sometimes you will see a column to go along with that, you will \nsee another story on the back page, and then you will see the notes of \nthe game--sometimes three, sometimes even four stories just in one \npaper by one writer. That is Hal McCoy. He works and works and works \nand has an unending, unfettered enthusiasm, after all these years, for \nthe game of baseball.\n  Hal McCoy is a very special man. I wish to take a few minutes today \nto tell my colleagues a little bit about his life and his career as a \nsports writer.\n  Hal was born and raised in Akron, OH. He played Little League \nbaseball in Summit County and later graduated from Akron East High \nSchool. He then graduated from Kent State University in 1962, with a \nBachelor of Fine Arts and a major in Journalism. Upon receiving his \ndiploma, Hal immediately put his degree to good use when he started a \njob as a Dayton Journal Herald reporter, covering the Dayton Public \nprep league.\n  Hal first covered the Cincinnati Reds for the Dayton Daily News in \n1973. No one knew at the time that Hal would be holding our Nation's \nlongest-running tenure, covering one team continuously or that he would \nbe recognized as one of the finest journalists in Ohio history, let \nalone one of the finest ever in his profession.\n  A few years ago, Hal suffered a stroke in his right optic nerve while \ncovering a Reds game in St. Louis. He lost half of his vision as a \nresult. While this would cause most people to slow down or stop, Hal \ncould not be deterred. He overcame this adversity with grace and \ncontinued his post with the Reds.\n  Then, on January 23, 2003, Hal suffered a stroke in his other eye. \nSuddenly, legally blind, Hal was faced with a seemingly insurmountable \nobstacle-- the eyes that he had been using for years to ``show'' the \ngame to his readers essentially stopped working for him. But, Hal \nwouldn't let that stop him. He persevered. He never complained. And, \nwhen faced with the choice to retire, his resolve to write his \nlegendary stories only became stronger.\n  Today, Hal continues to attend and report on Reds games using a \nspecial large-size scorebook that he designed. He says:\n\n       I tell everybody I'm going to do this until my head hits \n     the laptop, when I pass out in the press box. That's how much \n     I love this job.\n\n  And let me tell you that Hal's fans couldn't be happier! Many, many \nReds fans, like me, still can't wait to get up in the morning and read \nhis stories. That is how much we enjoy his work and what he produces \nevery day.\n  The publisher of the Dayton Daily News, Brad Tillson, has said this \nof Hal:\n\n       I've been reading Hal McCoy's coverage of Major League \n     Baseball and the Cincinnati Reds for more than 30 years, and \n     I never cease to be amazed at his insight into the game and \n     his ability to communicate it to the readers. He calls the \n     games as he sees them with candor, integrity, and authority. \n     Sometimes it's more illuminating to read Hal's account of the \n     game than it is to watch it.\n\n  I must also add that the respect of the players Hal McCoy covers is \nalso very illuminating. When Hal was faced with the loss of his sight, \nsome of the players went to him and told him: You can't quit. You need \nto keep doing what you love to do.\n  He is held in respect by the people he covers. I think that says a \nlot about Hal McCoy.\n  Of course, if you ask Hal about the secret to his success, he would \nrespond that it is ``the readers, the people.'' That connection with \nthe people is very powerful. It is not at all surprising that Hal \nhasn't missed a road series in 30 years. Hal has said:\n\n       When I sit down at my laptop, it is the readers I have in \n     mind. What would they want to know? I've tried to inform \n     them, entertain them, and tell them the truth to the best of \n     my capacities . . . I can never thank all the readers who \n     have been so supportive. You are what we are all about.\n\n  It is this humble spirit and gratitude for his readers that Hal's \nfriends and readers love most.\n  As Hal takes his destined place in the writers wing of the Baseball \nHall of Fame, I join many other proud Ohioans in saying thank you. Hal \nMccoy is a terrific writer, a magnificent storyteller, and an exemplary \nand well-respected member of his community. My family--my dad and my \nchildren--extends its warmest congratulations and sincerest thanks to \nHal for his wonderful writing and his dedication to continuing to do \nwhat he loves despite difficult challenges. We thank him for his \nservice to the Dayton community, to the Miami Valley, to Ohio, and to \nour Nation.\n  I look forward to many more Cincinnati Reds seasons that Hal will \ncover and many more great stories.\n  Thanks Hal. We appreciate the great work you do.\n\n[[Page S9933]]\n\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on the floor of the House of \nRepresentatives this morning, they are debating a supplemental \nappropriations bill that deals with some serious issues that are \nhappening under the heading of disasters across this country. The \nappropriations bill does not designate any money for firefighting in \nthe West. I have been told that right now the Forest Service currently \nhas $352 million available for wildfire suppression, but that is only \ngoing to last the next 2 weeks. The latest projections, which are \nconservative, I am told, indicate the expected expenditure for fighting \nforest fires this year is $775 million.\n  We have a certain amount of money set aside for prevention; that is--\nif we didn't have this procedure called appeals--those accounts that \nare set aside for prevention will now be moved over to \nfire suppression. We are between a rock and a hard place.\n\n  It occurs to me that with the support of the White House, a clean \nsupplemental for fire suppression, under emergency conditions, makes a \nlot of sense. We have to provide some money for fire suppression. The \nAmerican people are turning on their television sets every night, and \nevery night our forests are afire.\n  To give a rundown, they have evacuated all of Glacier National Park. \nEven some people they said would not have to evacuate--they are \ninholders in the park and have homes along Lake McDonald--they had to \nprepare their homes for fire prevention, and they left the park, for \nexample, to get their groceries. Now they will not let those people \nback in. That is a local situation, and I am sure that is going to get \nironed out.\n  That is how drastic this situation is. I call upon my friends in the \nHouse of Representatives: Do what is right to handle the emergencies we \nnow have because, if we don't, when we start running out of money, \nthen--due to this extended drought, with very hot conditions right now \nin the Rocky Mountain West--we are going to have these fires far into \nthe month of September. It is just not right.\n  These fires are threatening our national treasures. McDonald Valley, \nGlacier National Park, is now on fire on both ends. Remember the book, \n``The Perfect Storm,'' about two storms coming together at the right \ntime, and they are only 10 miles apart, that is the ``perfect storm,'' \nand we could lose that entire forest.\n  I call upon my colleagues in the House to do the right thing now \nbecause we understand they are going to pass this bill and send it to \nthe Senate. The Senate is in a vise. We either take it or we don't. If \nwe don't, it will be zero dollars and the middle of September before \nany funds will flow into these areas that desperately need the money.\n  I don't know who is giving advice on this issue. I don't know who is \ndoing the thinking on this issue. But I will tell you right now, it is \nwrong-headed to do it as the apparatus is set up to get it done now. It \nis just wrong-headed. I feel powerless to do anything, especially for \nthe forests in my State of Montana, and that is not a very good \nfeeling.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, before the Senator leaves the floor, I \nwish to make a comment.\n  First, I was present when Senator Stevens, the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, spoke, which was prior to Senator Burns. He \nheard him, he talked to him, and then he spoke.\n  I wish to talk a minute about an issue that is dear to the Senator \nand Senator Bingaman, who sits here, and myself. We continue to have \nmeetings in our Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and the \nAgriculture Committee of the Senate trying to analyze why it is we are \nunable to address the issue of thinning our forests and getting rid of \nblighted areas in large manner rather than taking so long and sitting \nby and watching the forests of America deteriorate to the point that \nthey become tinderboxes. They are so filled with overgrowth that fires \nare inevitable. And when fires happen, very big trees burn because the \nbottom is totally filled with too many trees, too much brush, too many \nof the branches and leaves that have fallen. Then thousands of acres \nare blighted and dried and nobody is doing anything about it.\n\n  Then comes a fire. Then we come along and we say: Let's put up extra \nmoney to put out these fires, so-called disaster money. Then groups \nacross America begin to run advertisements, have meetings and say: What \nis the matter with Congress? We can't get our forests thinned. We can't \nget them fixed. We cannot get the kind of reform that will get work \ndone.\n  We have arguments that break along environmental and nonenvironmental \nlines. We can solve those, perhaps, in the next month or two.\n  But let me say to the U.S. House, I submit to you the real problem we \nare having in getting any kind of real cleanup of the forests--that is, \npreventive work done on American forests, be it BLM forests that belong \nto Interior or forests that belong to the Department of Agriculture and \nthe National Forest Service--is because there isn't any money to do it.\n  The question is, why isn't there any money? We are always \nappropriating money for it. And every year there will be a bill that \ncomes through here, Interior appropriations, and you find money for \nthat, a lot of money for that. But guess what happens. Very shortly as \nthe year starts, we have to put out fires. And then what happens? There \nis no money to put out those fires.\n  The disaster money we are talking about today and that Senator \nStevens came to the floor and told the House about, the Departments of \nour Government say: Well, we have a disaster. We have to spend the \nmoney.\n  Surely, they do. What they do is, they take money from other aspects \nof the Government. What are those? Many of them are accounts which \nwould be used for major prevention on the forests. If there isn't any \nmoney for that, the year will pass. The money will have been spent on \nthe disaster, and we will be here talking about a supplemental that is \ntoo late and inadequate, and the prevention will not occur.\n  It is so desperate that in our Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources, there have been suggestions to try to set this money aside, \nto set up a new fund, a whole new way so that the prevention money is \nprevention money and nothing else. The distinguished Senator, Mr. \nBingaman, has suggested such an effort.\n  I am not sure it will work because obviously once you get a big \nforest fire going and you don't have any money to put out the fire, \nthey are going to find the money somewhere within the Department, \nunless you took it out of Interior and put it in the Army and said: You \ncan't get it because it isn't even there. They are going to have to use \nthe money they have and make it fungible, take it away from prevention \nand use it for disaster.\n  Somehow or another we have to stop that. While I am not today able to \nsay to the House what they are and aren't doing because I am not privy \nto what Chairman Stevens is, it seems to me that something like this is \noccurring early in the season in this supplemental that the House is \ntalking about. Before we even get seriously into the season, we are \nhaving more of this: Well, we are having to put out disasters. We will \nfind the money. And if we didn't put up enough, use other money. And \nyes, there will be a whole\n\n[[Page S9934]]\n\nblighted area somewhere in Alaska or northern New Mexico that is \nsupposed to get money for prevention and cleanup, and they will be out \nof money.\n\n  Essentially, this is not simple fun and games. This is serious \nbusiness. We sit around and watch the forests of America change so that \nthey no longer look like, behave like, or are like they used to be. Our \npeople know it. We know it. They are filled to the brim with too much \ngrowth, too much underbrush. They are not even the forests of old. You \ncan't take your children for a nice walk in the forest in most American \nforests because you can't even walk in them.\n  I went up into northern New Mexico to the Jemez area and surrounding \nwhere I remember, as a youngster, we used to go. There were huge \ncottonwood trees, wide open, full of pine needles. And believe it or \nnot, it was filled with beautiful growth, such as mushrooms and things \nthat are very pretty. You find you can't even walk, much less see if \nthere is any vegetation, because we haven't had any prevention. We \nhaven't had any maintenance on those forests.\n  That is minuscule, because we are minuscule in New Mexico compared to \nthe West Coast--Oregon, Washington, and Idaho. I suspect we are talking \nabout the wrong things in this bill over in the House. We are talking \nabout putting money in the wrong place and not facing up to the reality \nthat there are two very distinct needs. And you cannot continue to rob \none to pay for the other unless you quickly meet up before the year is \nout and replenish all of the money in the Departments that are \noperational, that are ongoing maintenance and operation of the BLM and \nthe Forest Service of America.\n  I urge the House to do that and be careful not to rob those accounts \nso much by not appropriating sufficient money for the disaster straight \nout and leave that other money to be used for what it is intended.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let my compliment my colleague on his \nstatement and also our colleague from Montana.\n  This is a very serious issue, one we have had many hearings on, one \nvery recently. The problem is just as Senator Domenici described it. We \nhave sort of an annual event. Annually, we find out we haven't put \nenough money in these appropriations bills to fight fires. Accordingly, \nthe agencies involved, in particular the Forest Service, understandably \nhave to go somewhere to get that money. They go into these other \naccounts. These are the funds they should be using to do the forest \nthinning and forest health and restoration work we all know is \nessential.\n  Last Saturday, I went up to Taos in our home State to see the damage \nthat was done in the Taos pueblo by the Encebado fire. That was a very \nsubstantial fire, burning close to 6,000 acres of land, right behind \nthe Taos pueblo. We got a helicopter tour with the Governor and the war \nchief and the BIA officials and others to survey all the damage that \nhad been done.\n  On our way back after we had surveyed the damage, which was \nextensive, we flew down what is called Lucero Canyon. That area was one \nthat the Governor and the war chief pointed out and said: This is an \narea which is greatly overgrown and which we need to thin. We very much \nwould like to get some Federal funds to help with this thinning \nactivity because our next forest fire we fear is going to be in this \ncanyon.\n  It is also part of the Taos pueblo land. It is clearly also in danger \nof burning. That is one area which is one of many areas in northern New \nMexico and throughout the West that could be singled out for high risk \nof being subject to some kind of catastrophic fire.\n  As Senator Domenici said, there are two separate needs. One, we have \nto have money to fight fires when fires start. But a separate and \nequally important need is that we have to be able to use the funds we \nappropriate for thinning activities and for forest restoration \nactivities. We have to be able to use that money for those purposes and \nnot have it transferred for this other purpose. So I hope we can find a \nsolution.\n  The proposal I have made is that we essentially give the Forest \nService authority to go to Treasury and borrow money so they don't have \nto take it from their other accounts. To the extent there is a need to \nfight fires, let them go to Treasury and get that money and then have \nthat money reimbursed by Congress in a supplemental later.\n  I don't think it is tenable for us to think each year, when we have \nthe fire season, we are going to pass a new supplemental appropriations \nbill. We may have to do that this year. I am not arguing against doing \nthat this year. But that is not a long-term solution to the problem. We \nneed to recognize this problem is with us. Every year we have these \nfires and every year we come up short in funds to fight them.\n  I very much hope we can solve that problem and do it in a way that \navoids the robbing of funds from the restoration accounts, which is \nwhat we have been doing each year.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my understanding is that we are on the \nEnergy bill. My colleagues are speaking of forests. I come from a State \nranked 50th among the 50 States in native forest land. So I am much \nless acquainted with the challenges of America's forests, forest fires, \nand other issues than are my two colleagues. I wanted to make a comment \nabout the Energy bill.\n  I had come to the floor to speak about trade. My understanding from \nlast evening is that we were going to be on the free trade agreement. \nMy understanding is that perhaps we may still be on that later in the \nday, after the Energy bill is off the floor. Maybe that is not the \ncase.\n  Let me just say, as a member of the Energy Committee, I feel very \nstrongly that this country needs a new energy policy, an Energy bill. I \nthink it is unlikely that we will be able to finish an Energy bill by \nthe end of next week. There are very significant issues that remain.\n  Speaking for myself, I want this Senate to pass an Energy bill. I \nwant it to be a good one, one that does all four things that are \nnecessary in a good bill: One that promotes additional production of \nthe sources of energy that we need; one that promotes increased \nconservation, which is a significant part of our energy needs; for a \nbarrel of oil conserved is about the same as a barrel of oil produced. \nSo we need production and conservation. We also need strong provisions \ndealing with efficiencies of all of the things we use day to day that \nuse energy. Fourth, we need an opportunity in this legislation to \naggressively pursue both renewable and limitless sources of energy. So \nproduction, conservation, efficiency, and renewable and limitless \nsources of energy are very important provisions.\n\n  I want to mention one point with respect to an Energy bill that would \nbe a balanced bill, including those four pieces. In addition to that, \nwe must deal with this question of consumer protection. The reason I \nsay that is, having chaired hearings in the Commerce Committee on what \nhappened in the State of California and in the entire set of Western \nStates some while ago--a year and a half or so ago--it is quite clear \nto me that having chaired those hearings, we had wholesale cheating \ngoing on, and ratepayers from the Western United States were bilked of \nbillions of dollars. I am saying this money was stolen and bilked from \nconsumers. It happened because some companies decided to collude in \nways that they were able to cheat the consumers.\n  Regarding Enron Corporation, for example, we unearthed memoranda that \ndescribed strategies by which they were going to bilk consumers--Get \nShorty, Fat Boy, Death Star. They sound like movies, but they are not; \nthey are strategies by which one company decided to cheat west coast \nconsumers. There are many other companies also.\n  The FERC, a regulatory agency, has been investigating this. They have \ncome up with some hard words, tough words, but not quite as tough a set \nof actions as I would have liked. My point is, having learned what we \ndid about what happened in the energy markets on the west coast, we \nneed strong consumer protection provisions in the bill that is voted \nout of the full Senate to go to conference with the House. I feel\n\n[[Page S9935]]\n\nstrongly that we need to pass a bill. We will head into the winter with \nsevere dislocations between supply and demand of natural gas. Natural \ngas prices will increase dramatically. They are already on the rise. \nThat is going to be exacerbated in the coming months. Coming from a \nnorthern State where natural gas is a pretty important commodity to us \nin the cold, with our hard winter climates, this will be a very \nimportant issue. We are not going to be able to fix that in the Energy \nbill in the short run. But we need to tell the American people we have \nset in place policies that help resolve these issues for the long term \nand intermediate term. I hope we are able to do that.\n  I ask the chairman, if I may, I had hoped to be able to make a \npresentation on the issue of trade. If there are others wishing to \nspeak on energy, I will defer. If not, I would like to proceed perhaps \nto make the statement on trade, understanding that if Members with \namendments are coming back to the floor, they could interrupt me, and I \nwill relinquish the floor so they can clear the amendments. If that is \nsatisfactory to the chairman, I will proceed in that manner.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How long might the Senator speak on this issue?\n  Mr. DORGAN. About 20 minutes, I would guess.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We are trying to work out about 5 or 10 amendments. If \nwe get them ready, we will call it to his attention on the bill before \nus. In the meantime, I am going to have no objection to his proceeding \nto discuss trade as in morning business.\n  I ask the Senator if he would permit the distinguished Senator from \nIdaho, Mr. Craig, to speak for a couple of minutes on the issue we have \njust been speaking on, to wit, the House action with reference to the \nsupplemental. When he yields, I will have no objection to the Senator \nfrom North Dakota following him, subject to the understanding that if \nwe need to interrupt him, of course, doing it in an appropriate way, to \nbring in the amendments, the Senator will have no objection.\n  Mr. DORGAN. That will be fine. I will relinquish the floor to my \ncolleague from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for giving me a moment \nof time to address the stopgap supplemental funding bill that has just \ncome back from the House. I come to the floor as frustrated as the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens, who spoke to \nthe issue a few moments ago. Senator Domenici spoke, as did Senator \nBurns of Montana.\n  It was 100 degrees in Idaho yesterday. For Idaho, that is hot. It has \nbeen that way for 3 weeks. We have dried up. We now have forest fires \nburning, with literally thousands of acres ablaze. We just lost two \npeople in a wildfire in the middle of the week. Idaho, Montana, Nevada, \neastern Washington, Oregon--all of us are afire at this moment.\n  The supplemental money we put in for the Forest Service and for \nwildfires, which the House took out, was to replenish last year's \naccounts from which we had borrowed to fight last year's fires. The \naccounts we borrowed from were the very accounts that would allow \npeople to go out on the ground for the purpose of rehabilitation, for \ndoing the kinds of things necessary to begin to environmentally improve \nthe land, the 7.5 million acres that burned last year in a phenomenal \nwildfire scenario.\n  We are deeply into that already this year. Fires have burned \nextensively in Arizona, and as the heat has moved up the Great Basin \nStates, along the Rocky Mountain ridge, of course, these fires now \ncontinue.\n  Why the House has done this, I am not quite sure. They say there is \nplenty of money. There is not because the money was borrowed from the \naccounts of other areas within the Forest Service. That is a standard \npractice we have done in the past. But the problem is, by doing what \nthe House did, we are not replenishing the accounts of last year that \nwe borrowed from. We have always done that on a historical basis \nbecause one cannot measure or estimate how extensive a fire season will \nbe, how many acres will burn, how many people will be employed. We have \nliterally thousands of people in Idaho right now on the fire lines, as \nis true in other States in the West, and helicopters are flying, aerial \nbombers are flying, at this moment.\n  A phenomenally large number of people are employed to stop the fires, \nprotect the environment, and try to save the habitat, the wildlife and, \nin many instances, houses, private property, homes that are built up \nand within the forests of our country, up to and within the forests of \nour country. We are obviously going to have to address this in an \nemergency environment.\n  I am extremely disappointed with what the House has done. I have \ntalked with the Deputy Secretary of Agriculture who heads up the Forest \nService, and the chief, and they are just a week away from having to \nagain start borrowing out of the accounts that have not yet been \nreplenished. So their capacity to pay back until we obviously \nappropriate is limited.\n  We will continue to fight the fires. The fires will be fought. It is \nthe rehabilitation, it is the restoration, that is funded by other \naccounts that will largely be denied.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/25/senate-section/article/S9935-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9935]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               FREE TRADE\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Turning to the Senator from North Dakota, I thank him for \nthe time he has allotted me. I think he is going to be talking about \ntrade and possibly the Singapore and the Chilean free-trade agreements. \nThe Senator and I worked cooperatively together on a lot of trade \nissues, and cochair a caucus on the Hill.\n  The Senator who is in the chair at this moment is as frustrated as I \nam about these current free-trade agreements in front of us, because \nour trade ambassador has stepped into an arena that is frankly none of \nhis business, if I can be so blunt, and that is immigration law. I \nthink the Senator from North Dakota is as frustrated by that as I am. \nThe Senator from Alabama, Mr. Sessions, has crafted a sense of the \nSenate I am looking at that will speak very boldly to the fact that if \nthe trade ambassador wants to send up other free-trade agreements--\nSenator Sessions and I serve on the Judiciary Committee, we will be \nblunt about it--we are not going to let them out.\n  This ambassador is an appointed person, not an elected person. He \ndoes not have the right to go in and write immigration law. That is not \nhis prerogative. If he has to discuss it, if he wants it to become a \npart of a trade agreement, then he must tell foreign countries he will \noffer legislation to Congress to review for the purposes of adjusting \ntrade law, if necessary, where it fits and where a majority of the \nCongress can and will support it.\n  The two trade agreements that are in front of us are very frustrating \nto this Senator because I think we have a trade ambassador who has \noverstepped his authority and I think it is time we tell him that in as \nclear language as we possibly can.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, my colleague from Idaho has described \naccurately the provision in the free-trade agreement dealing with \nimmigration.\n  But I must say, and he will agree with me, I am sure, that a sense-\nof-the-Senate resolution that says, in effect, you better watch it, is \nthe equivalent of hitting someone on the forehead with a feather.\n  The reason there has to be a sense-of-the-Senate resolution at the \nmoment, if we are to express displeasure, is because we cannot offer \nany amendments to a free-trade agreement. It is brought to the floor \nunder fast track. This Senate, in its wisdom--or in its lack of \nwisdom--said we agree to put our arms in a straitjacket so whatever the \ntrade ambassador negotiates anywhere in the world, he can bring it back \nhere and we agree to prevent ourselves from offering amendments. That \nis fast track.\n  I do not have any big issues with Chile or Singapore. The free-trade \nagreement coming to the Senate floor is not even a very big deal with \nrespect to Chile and Singapore, the two countries with whom the \nagreements are made. The big deal to me is that we have made agreement \nafter agreement in international trade. In each case, this country has \nlost, and lost big time.\n\n[[Page S9936]]\n\n  We have lost jobs. We have lost economic strength. We have massive \nproblems in previous trade agreements. None of them are being fixed. \nNone of them get solved. What gets done? Well, new trade agreements \nseem to emerge on the Senate floor. Rather than fixing old trade \nagreements and beginning to support this country's interests, what we \nwant to do, according to the trade ambassador, is bring new trade \nagreements so we can debate and vote on those.\n  What I want to do this morning is talk a little bit about some of \nthose old trade agreements and talk about what ought to be done rather \nthan debating new trade agreements at this point.\n  First, it is worth noting what our trade deficit is at this point. \nThis is an article from the Washington Post. It shows the trade deficit \nthe end of last year. It is the highest trade deficit in history. The \ntrade deficit soared to $435 billion on an annual basis in 2002, and it \nis worse now, of course.\n\n       Nearly one-fourth of the year's deficit in goods trade was \n     with China, which sold $103 billion more goods to the United \n     States than it bought here.\n\n  I will talk about China. It is a story in itself. They ship us all \ntheir trinkets, trousers, shirts, and shoes, and they come into our K-\nMarts and our WalMarts and our grocery stores and we buy all of these \nthings from China. Guess what. China's market is not very open to the \nproducts our employees and our businesses produce. They are not buying \nvery much from us.\n  What does it mean to us? It means we do not have jobs. It means we \nhave people today looking for work who cannot find a job in this \ncountry.\n  Now, it is interesting, there was a story recently about this being a \njobless recovery. Of course, we do not have much of a recovery. It is \npretty anemic at this point. We have very slow economic growth. So this \neconomy is just sort of bumping along, just hiccuping from day to day, \nweek to week, and month to month without much strength at all. So they \nsay, this is a recovery that is jobless.\n\n  Well, they miss the point on that. Oh, there are jobs created by \nAmerican enterprise. There are jobs created by ingenuity that comes \nfrom U.S. firms. It is just that the jobs that are being created are \nnot being created in this country. This is a recovery, all right, an \nanemic recovery with jobs, but the jobs are not here. The jobs are \noverseas. More and more, we see jobs in factories that are moved \noverseas that used to be good American jobs.\n  So if in fact this is a jobless recovery, it is jobless only to the \nextent that it is jobless in the United States. We have millions of \nAmericans who desperately want a job, they want to go to work, but \nthere are not enough jobs available. Two-and-a-half million people who \nwere working a couple of years ago now are not working because this \neconomy is not producing the jobs here. Too many American corporations \nare producing the jobs in Asia and elsewhere. I want to talk a little \nabout that.\n  Ambassador Zoellick is a perfectly nice person. He is our U.S. trade \nambassador. Most people would not recognize his name from a cord of \nwood, but he serves in a pretty important role. He is the trade \nambassador. He goes overseas with his staff and they negotiate trade \nagreements. These are the agreements by which we trade with other \ncountries. They negotiate behind closed doors. We are not there. Our \nconstituents are not there. These are trade negotiations behind closed \ndoors in which they decide what kind of trade relationship we will have \nin the future. Then they come back to us with a trade agreement and \nthey say, here is our agreement between our country and China, our \ncountry and Japan, our country and European countries.\n  Then they say to the Congress, because the Congress previously \nagreed: you cannot change the agreement. We negotiated it in secret, \nbut you have a responsibility to vote on it, up or down, yes or no, \nwith no changes, no amendments. And the Congress was foolish enough to \nagree.\n  Here we are. This morning we are talking about a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution to say to the trade ambassador: Better watch it. Why? \nBecause he went off to Singapore and negotiated a free-trade agreement \nwith Singapore that said: By the way, in this free-trade agreement \nhaving nothing to do with trade, we will insist that a provision will \nallow 5,400 immigrants from Singapore into the United States under 1-\nyear visas that will be renewed indefinitely.\n  What are they going to come here for? To work. Will they come to see \nmovies, drive around on Sundays? No, they are coming here for a job, to \nwork. We have millions and millions of Americans who need a job, who \nare out of work, who are struggling every single day. And this trade \nagreement says: What we would like to do, in addition to creating the \ntrade circumstances that exist by this agreement with us and with \nSingapore, we agree 5,400 people from Singapore will come here to work.\n  Usually, if one disagrees with that--and I certainly do--we would \noffer an amendment to strip this from the trade agreement. But we \ncannot in this instance, because of the fast track authority we handed \nto the executive branch.\n  If ever you want a description of why it is ``dumb'' for the Congress \nto decide to put itself in a straitjacket, this is it. We are going to \nvote, probably Monday or Tuesday, on a free-trade agreement with \nSingapore. That free-trade agreement has a provision in it that will \nhave 5,400 people from Singapore coming to this country to take jobs in \nthis country, when we have 8 to 10 million Americans out of work; and \nwe cannot do a thing about it--not a thing.\n  Frustrated? Sure, as I am sure are many others. Can you do anything? \nNo, what we can do is say to Mr. Zoellick, the ambassador, with the \nsense-of-a-senate resolution: You better watch it.\n  I will vote for it, but it is like beating someone over the head with \na feather. It does not mean anything.\n  Let me talk about what they should be doing instead of creating new \nfast-track agreements. Instead of rushing off to create new trade \nagreements, let me make a couple of suggestions.\n  I will vote against these trade agreements because we ought to be \nfixing old problems before we create new ones. That is not a judgment \nabout Singapore or Chile. It is a judgment about what I think the \nobligation of our trade ambassador is. Under Republican and Democrat \nadministrations, they have systematically failed in the obligation to \ncorrect trade problems. Let me mention a couple.\n  Japan has a very large trade surplus with us. We have a very large \ntrade deficit with Japan. Each year, we have a $50, $60, $70 billion \ntrade deficit. One of the products that we would like to export more of \nto Japan is beef. Fifteen years ago we reached a new beef agreement \nwith Japan. We had negotiators over there negotiating, and they finally \nreached an agreement. It was front-page headlines in the American \nnewspapers. You would have thought they won the Olympics. They were \ncelebrating and rejoicing and feasting. Big beef agreement with Japan.\n  It is 15 years later. Where are we 15 years after a beef agreement \nwith Japan, a country with whom we have a very large deficit? Every \nsingle pound of American beef going to Japan has a 38.5 percent tariff \non it 15 years after the agreement. And that is set to snap back to a \n50-percent tariff on every single pound of beef we send to Japan.\n\n  Does Japan need more T-bones? Of course. More hamburger? Of course. \nBut every single pound has this extraordinary tariff on it. Why? \nBecause the Japanese are trying to keep it out. They do not want as \nmuch as we should be sending at a time when we have a huge trade \ndeficit with Japan.\n  It is unforgivable. Do you hear complaints from our country about it? \nNo, no one is talking much about it. It is fine with most people around \nhere to run a huge yearly trade deficit with Japan. It is not fine with \nme. The trade ambassador, it is fine with him. They are so busy \nnegotiating new agreements with new countries that they cannot seem to \nresolve these issues. A country with whom we have a $60 to $70 billion \ntrade deficit ought not apply 38.5 percent tariffs on the products our \nranchers want to send to the dinner table in Tokyo.\n  What about wheat with China? We just did a trade agreement with the \ncountry of China, in order for China to join the WTO. China has a $103 \nbillion trade deficit with us. They send us everything. They send us \ntheir trousers, trinkets, shirts, and shoes. They send us everything. \nOur marketplace absorbs it all. But the fact is, their marketplace is \nnot open to us. What does\n\n[[Page S9937]]\n\nthat mean? It means jobs move from this country to China. People here \nare unemployed, out of work, and we are running up this huge trade \ndeficit with China.\n  Let me mention the agricultural side of trade with China because I \ncare a lot about that. I come from a wheat-producing State. And our \ntrade officials dealing in agriculture on our side recently stated that \nChina has failed miserably to live up to the promises it made when it \njoined the WTO in 2001. In fact, before he resigned, the top U.S. trade \nofficial dealing with agriculture in China said we should file a trade \ncomplaint against China, but we are not doing so. Despite a \nrecommendation that we should, we are not doing so for foreign policy \nreasons. We do not want to upset the Chinese. God forbid we should \nupset the Chinese.\n  So we have a $103 billion trade deficit with China and our jobs are \nevaporating in this country, moving to China for lower wages. And we do \nnot want to upset them. We do not want to demand their market be open \nto our products.\n  Instead of having a trade ambassador working on that problem, we have \nnew trade agreements. I do not understand that at all.\n  Automobiles and China has always been interesting. Our trade \nnegotiators, a couple years ago, went to China regarding the bilateral \ntrade agreement under a Democratic administration--all the Democrats \nand Republicans in the White House have the same trade view. But let me \ngive you a description of the bilateral trade agreement on automobiles. \nChina is a country of 1.3 billion people who want substantial \nadditional growth. Our trade negotiators said we agree, after a phase-\nin, China can have a 25-percent tariff on any automobiles we send into \nChina, and we will have a 2.5 percent tariff on any Chinese automobiles \nsent to our marketplace. Our negotiators said they agree to a tariff \nthat is 10 times higher on U.S. cars being shipped to China than we \nwould impose on a Chinese car coming to the United States.\n  Why on Earth, on a bilateral agreement in this sector, would our \nnegotiators ever agree to something like that with a country with which \nwe have a $100 billion trade deficit? I don't have the foggiest idea.\n  This is a 1.3 billion person country that will need automobiles at \nsome point in the future, and we say: We will give you a deal. You have \na huge surplus with us, or we have a big deficit with you. We will give \nyou a deal. On automobile trade, we will agree you can have a tariff 10 \ntimes higher than ours to keep our cars out.\n  Unforgivably incompetent, I must say. I am not talking about people, \nI am talking about the policy.\n  Something also of interest to me--again, I mention China, but I will \nget to a couple of other countries--is movies. Our country is pretty \ngood at making movies, the best in the world. Do you know that before \nChina entered the WTO, China allowed 10 movies into the Chinese \nmarketplace a year--just 10? Not 11, not 12--but 10. That was the \nlimit.\n\n  But when they joined the WTO in 2001 there was this giant \nliberalization of trade by China. Do you know what they do now? They \nallow 20 movies into the Chinese marketplace. I guess that is all right \nwith us. In fact, I had people in that industry say we have really made \nprogress here, big advantages, double the movies into China--10 to 20. \nWe have such low expectations of our trading partners it is \nincomprehensible to me.\n  Let me talk about beef with Europe, turning to Europe for just a \nmoment. The occasions in which I have traveled to Europe and opened the \npages of the European newspapers, I hear the concerns of the Europeans \nabout growth hormones in American beef. Here is the way they picture \nAmerican beef: Two-headed cow. Right? Growth hormones, God forbid you \nraise two-headed cows and you can't eat them because it will ruin your \nhealth.\n  Of course, none of that is true. But nonetheless they have \neffectively kept U.S. beef out of Europe.\n  So we filed a trade complaint and our trade complaint on European \nbeef was upheld. And Europe is supposed to let our beef in. But they \nhave not.\n  So we said: All right, Europe, you are not letting our beef into your \nmarketplace and you should, the WTO says you must, we won the case, and \nsince you are not going to abide by the decision, we will play \nhardball.\n  Do you know what we did? We said: All right, we are really going to \nwhip you into shape, we are going to take tough, no-nonsense \nenforcement against you. We said: We are going to impose tariffs on \nyour truffles, goose liver, and Roquefort cheese. That will scare the \ndevil out of a country, won't it? Take action against truffles, goose \nliver, and Roquefort cheese. Is there a reason people think we are \nwimps in international trade? I think so. It is bizarre.\n  When the Europeans want to get tough with us, they pick sectors like \nsteel and textiles. That sounds robust, doesn't it? But we are going to \ngo at them on goose liver.\n  Shame on us. We ought as a country to decide we are going to protect \nour marketplace, not against competition, but against unfair \ncompetition, that we are going to demand of other countries, if our \nmarketplace is open to them, their marketplace be open to us. I am not \na protectionist. I don't believe we ought to put walls around our \ncountry. I believe our consumers are advantaged by expanded trade. But \nby the same token I believe very strongly that trade ought to be fair.\n  It is not fair trade with respect to the Chinese and the \ncircumstances I mentioned. Let me mention Korea, just for a moment. I \ntalked about China and Europe. Let me talk about automobiles in Korea.\n  Do you know in the last year we sent automobiles to Korea, about \n680,000 Korean automobiles came into this country--Daiwoos, Hyundais--\nKorean automobiles. They are probably wonderful cars. I don't know, I \nhave not driven them. But 680,000 Korean cars came into the United \nStates.\n  Do you know how many U.S. cars we got to Korea? We sold 2,800 cars to \nKorea. They shipped us 680,000; we sent them 2,800. Do you know why? \nBecause Korea doesn't want American cars in its marketplace and they \nput up barriers and impediments to keep them out.\n  What are we doing about that? Nothing. We don't do anything about \nanything. All we do is go negotiate a new agreement and bring it to the \nSenate and say, Oh, by the way, we have stuck some extraneous things in \nand if you don't like it, tough luck, because you can't offer \namendments.\n  Does anyone care about the imbalance in Korean automobile trade? They \nsent us 680,000 cars and we only get 2,800 to Korea. Does anybody care \nabout that?\n  There is an interesting example about the Dodge Dakota pickup, just \nrecently. In February of this year, DaimlerChrysler started to sell the \nDodge Dakota pickup in Korea. The pickup is made in Detroit, by the \nway. Korea doesn't manufacture pickups like the Dakota, so \nDaimlerChrysler thought it had pretty good potential in Korea and the \ncompany started marketing to small business owners. It was initially \nquite successful. It got orders for 60 pickup trucks in February and \nanother 60 in March.\n  Guess what happened? In March an official with the Korean Ministry of \nConstruction and Transportation decided Dodge Dakota pickup trucks \nrepresented a hazard. He said some people were even putting optional \ncargo covers on the vehicle and that might be dangerous if passengers \nrode in the back, so he announced that cargo covers on pickups on Dodge \nDakotas were illegal, and drivers of the pickups would be fined if they \nput on a cargo cover. And the Korean newspapers had huge headlines: \n``Government Ministry Finds Dodge Dakota Covers Illegal.'' Guess what \nhappened. Korean consumers got the message. They canceled 55 out of the \n60 orders they had placed for March.\n  The Korean Government has done this time and time and time again, to \nshut down our exports of automobiles to Korea.\n  On the subject of trade with Korea, I could tell you if you try to \nsend potato flakes to Korea from this country you will find there is a \n300 percent tariff on potato flakes used to make confection food.\n  I could go on for some length at the barriers we face sending \nAmerica's products overseas into markets that ought to be open to us \nbecause our\n\n[[Page S9938]]\n\nmarkets are open to them. But we as a country don't seem to think too \nmuch about that, we are so busy doing new agreements.\n  I have a chart here that shows where we are with trade deficits. With \nalmost every country in the world, we have very significant trade \ndeficits. And ironically, the U.S. trade ambassador has been \nnegotiating with the very few countries with which we have surpluses, \nlike Singapore and Australia. I expect those will soon turn to \ndeficits, given our proclivity to negotiate trade agreements that don't \nwork for our country.\n  Let me talk just for a moment about Canada. We face wheat coming into \nthis country from Canada, sold by an entity that would be illegal in \nthis country, called the Canadian Wheat Board. It is a state-controlled \nmonopoly that would be illegal in the United States. Yet every day we \nhave Canadian wheat shipped into our country at what we allege are \nprices below the cost of acquisition, dumping in our country. It is \nunfair trade. It has been going on for a decade and you can't stop it. \nYou just can't stop it. It is enormously frustrating for our farmers \nbecause it takes money right out of their pockets.\n  One day some while ago I went to the Canadian border with a man named \nEarl in a 12-year-old orange truck.\n  He and I went to the Canadian border with about 200 bushels of durum \nwheat. All the way to the Canadian border we met 18-wheel semi-trucks \nloaded with Canadian wheat being shipped into this country. When we got \nto the Canadian border, we couldn't take a small amount of durum wheat \nin a 12-year-old orange truck into Canada. They stopped us cold. We \ncouldn't move. At the same time, we had all of these semi-trucks coming \ninto this country loaded with wheat. Unfair? You are darned right it \nis. In fact, Canadian wheat is dumped into our country below the cost \nof production. Yet we are not able to get satisfaction.\n  Regrettably, the same is true in almost every circumstance. Instead \nof trying to resolve these issues for our producers, for our employers, \nand for our employees in this country, we have this free trade fever to \nnegotiate all of these new agreements, and we are correcting none of \nthe problems in previous agreements.\n  Those who speak as I do, we are often referred to as \n``protectionists.'' The papers will not print op-ed pieces by someone \nlike me on this subject. They will print reams extolling the virtues of \nthis trade policy that comes from Republican and Democratic \nadministrations, but they will never print an op-ed piece by someone \nwho speaks as I do about the need to enforce trade laws.\n  The view of most around here is that there is a globalization going \non and that there are some of us don't get it; we are the xenophobic, \nisolationist stooges who simply can't see over the horizon; that they \nknow better; and, if we understood all of this, we wouldn't be critical \nof it.\n  But the question that is fundamental to me is this, Should we not \nrequire that trade be fair?\n  Let me give an example of what I mean by ``fair.''\n  Our trade relations are unfair in so many different ways. Is it fair, \nfor example, for a worker in a manufacturing plant in the State of \nGeorgia to compete against a 14-year-old young man or a 14-year-old \nyoung woman working 14 hours a day, being paid 14 cents an hour in a \nmanufacturing plant in Bangladesh or Indonesia to produce a product \nthat is then sent to our marketplace to sit on a store shelf in a small \ntown in Georgia? Is that fair competition for the company in Georgia \nthat makes the same product, that pays the minimum wage, that prevents \nthe dumping of chemicals and sewage into the water and air, that makes \nsure they have a safe workplace because they understand those are \nrequirements in this country, because there are prohibitions against \nchild labor and prohibitions against working people 100 hours a week?\n  Is it fair competition to allow into that store and onto that store \nshelf for the consumer a product made by somebody who works 14 hours a \nday and is being paid 14 cents an hour?\n  This is a true story. A worker in Bangladesh is paid 1.6 cents for \nevery baseball cap she sews, which is then sent to a store in this \ncountry to sit on the shelf and is sold for $17.\n  Is there a company in this country that can compete with that? I \ndon't think so. Is it fair trade?\n  Let me give you an example, if I might. The story is entitled \n``Worked Till They Drop.'' It tells of a woman named Li Chunmei. \nUnfortunately, it is not a very unusual story.\n  Li Chunmei was 19 years old. She worked in a toy factory in China. \nThey made stuffed animals for the U.S. marketplace. Let me read from \nthe article.\n\n       On the night she died, Li Chunmei must have been exhausted. \n     Co-workers said she had been on her feet for nearly 16 hours, \n     running back and forth inside the Bainan Toy Factory, \n     carrying toy parts from machine to machine.\n       Long hours were mandatory, and at least two months had \n     passed since Li and the other workers had enjoyed even a \n     Sunday off.\n\n  It had been two months since she and other workers had a Sunday off.\n\n       The factory food was so bad, she said, she felt as if she \n     had not eaten at all.\n       ``I want to quit,'' one of her roommates, Huang Jiaqun, \n     remembered her saying. ``I want to go home.''\n       Her roommates had already fallen asleep when Li started \n     coughing up blood. They found her in the bathroom a few hours \n     later, curled up on the floor, moaning softly in the dark, \n     bleeding from her nose and mouth. Someone called an \n     ambulance, but she died before it arrived.\n       The exact cause of Li's death remains unknown. But what \n     happened to her last November in this industrial town in \n     southeastern Guangdong province is described by family, \n     friends and co-workers as an example of what China's more \n     daring newspapers call guolaosi.\n       The phrase means ``over-work death,'' and usually applies \n     to young workers who saddenly collapse and die after working \n     exceedingly long hours, day after day.\n\n  Li worked for 16 hours, running back and forth on the factory floor, \nand had not had a Sunday off for 2 months--not even a Sunday off. I \ndon't know the wages Li made, but I can tell you that I have gone to \nsome of those places in the world. There are circumstances in which 12-\nyear-old kids are working 16 hours a day and are being paid 14 cents an \nhour. It is not, in my judgment, fair trade. If they take the product \nof their work, send it to our store shelves, and tell American workers \nand businesses, Compete with this, it is not a standard with which we \nought to aspire to compete.\n  We ought not be racing to the bottom on the question of workers' \nstandards, on the question of child labor, and on the question of basic \nfairness and wages. We ought not be racing to the bottom. Yet that is \nwhat we are being set up to do with some of these trade agreements.\n  Let me say again that this trade ambassador and others have a \nresponsibility to be solving trade problems created by past trade \nagreements and not presenting us with new trade problems in new \nagreements.\n  My main interest today is not Chile or Singapore. My interest is that \nthis country has the largest trade deficit in human history, and this \ncountry is suffering a mass exodus of jobs that used to be held by \nAmericans, which are now moved to plants and factories where they can \npay pennies on the dollar for an hour's wages. My concern is that the \nrules of trade have not kept up with the galloping globalization of \ntrade.\n  The winners are not, as some would have us believe, poor people in \nother countries who now have jobs. There are plenty of studies and \nevidence showing that in the last 20 years of globalization, the poor \nhave not improved their lot in life.\n  These trade agreements are about raw profits. These profits have \nincreased because those who produce those toys--in this case, from a \ntoy factory in China--don't have to pay a decent wage. But it has not \nimproved the lot and life of those who work 16 hours a day--teenage \nkids--and don't have a Sunday off for 2 months.\n  My question is very simple to this trade ambassador and others: Why \nwill you not begin to solve some problems, demanding on behalf of the \nworkers of this country and demanding on behalf of the businesses of \nthis country--yes, from Japan, from China, from Korea, from Europe, and \nothers--demanding fair trade rules and understanding there is an \nadmission price to the American marketplace?\n  This marketplace of ours we fought for, for 100 years. When I say \n``fought\n\n[[Page S9939]]\n\nfor,'' there were men and women who died in the streets of this country \nfighting for the right to organize as workers. We have had major \nbattles in this Chamber on the issue of child labor, on the issue of \nminimum wage, and on the issue of safe workplaces and polluting streams \nand the air shed. We fought those battles, and this country has come to \ngrips with the understanding that you shouldn't put 12-year-old kids in \nfactories and work them 16 hours a day and pay them 12 cents an hour. \nWe don't do that because it is not right. It is not right either to ask \nAmerican workers to compete with unfair trade practices.\n  Unless this country starts to stand up for its interests, we will not \nsoon have a manufacturing base left and we will not have family farmers \navailable in the future.\n  I know when I speak this way, there are those who take a look at it \nand say: Oh, again, another protectionist.\n  Again, I believe expanding trade is beneficial to this country, but \nonly if it is done under circumstances in which the rules are fair to \nthose of us in this country.\n  We ought never, ever be concerned about standing up for our \ninterests. If we have trade agreements, trade ought to be mutually \nbeneficial. Too often in the past our trade agreements, with country \nafter country after country, have not been mutually beneficial.\n  We had a trade surplus with Mexico; did an agreement with Mexico, and \nturned it into a big deficit. We had a modest deficit with Canada; did \nan agreement with Canada, and turned it into a huge deficit. It has \nbeen the same with Europe, the same with the GATT legislation. All of \nit has been a colossal failure, in my judgment. The biggest trade \ndeficit in human history: $1.5 billion every single day, 7 days a week. \nThat is what we purchase from abroad more than we ship abroad. And it \nmeans we are moving America's jobs overseas at an accelerated rate.\n  The question is, who will be the consumers in the future? If \nAmericans do not have access to good jobs, who will be the consumers in \nthe future for these cheap imports into this country?\n  We better come to grips with these trade issues, and soon. I am going \nto come to the Chamber on Monday and speak more about trade when we \nhave the vote on the Free Trade Agreement.\n  But let me again say, as I conclude, the reason we are having this \nvote this way is because this Congress, imprudently, in my judgment, \ndecided to tie its hands with something called fast track. It says: Oh, \nyes, let's offer up our hands, put handcuffs on them so we cannot offer \nany amendments.\n  So now Ambassador Zoellick brings us the Singapore Free Trade \nAgreement, which says we will allow 5,400 citizens from Singapore to \ncome to this country to take jobs. We have some folks who don't like \nthat, so they are going to do a sense of the Senate resolution. Oh, my \nGod, that is going to make Ambassador Zoellick shake in his boots. It \nis like hitting him in the forehead with a feather. Sense of Senate: \nYou better not do that again.\n  The fact is, nobody in this Chamber can do a thing about it because \nthis Chamber decided long ago it would not allow itself to offer an \namendment. It is fundamentally at odds with our constitutional \nresponsibilities, in my judgment. But enough Members of this Senate \ndecided to embrace that foolishness and we are now stuck with a \ncircumstance where this agreement will say 5,400 folks from Singapore \ncan come here and take 5,400 American jobs, at a time when we have 8 to \n10 million people who are looking for work. Boy, that doesn't add up, \nwhere I come from.\n  I intend to speak at greater length on Monday and try to get some of \nthis trade frustration off of my chest, at least, and see if we can't \ntry to push people--if not pull them--into beginning to stand up for \nthis country's economic interests. No, we don't want an advantage, we \njust want to stand up for our economic interests and demand fair trade \non behalf of American workers and American businesses.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/25/senate-section/article/S9939-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9939-S9941]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   URGENT SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I join with my colleague, Senator \nStevens, and other colleagues from the West to protest what the House \nis about to do in the urgent supplemental bill.\n  Mr. President and colleagues, and all Americans who are listening, \nyou have to understand what is happening. The Senate passed an urgent \nsupplemental bill to deal with shortfalls in funding where America is \nfacing disasters.\n  No. 1, our Federal Emergency Management account, which responds to \ndisasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and other natural disasters, \nand even a terrorist attack, is in danger of running out of funds \nwithin a matter of days. As of July, they were down to $89 million, and \nwe acted swiftly to send a bill to the House that would include $1.6 \nbillion to replenish the account.\n  Also, the West is enduring wildfires of unbelievable magnitude \nbecause of a combination of fire and drought. Again, as fellow \nAmericans, we joined with our western Senators to put money in the \nFederal checkbook to deal with these wildfires.\n  We also included funds to deal with the shortfall in the committee \nthat is investigating what went wrong in the Columbia disaster.\n  Guess what. We also added $100 million to deal with the shortfall in \nAmeriCorps that occurred because of bureaucratic mismanagement, so that \nvolunteers would not be penalized and they could come into our school-\nbased programs.\n  Well, guess what is happening now in the House. This very minute they \nare debating a rule that, No. 1, limits debate and prohibits \namendments. If the rule passes, the House will take up a bill that will \nessentially strip-mine the urgent supplemental the Senate passed. The \nHouse only wants to pass almost half of what the President says he \nneeds for FEMA, and take out all of the other programs.\n  My message to the House is: Don't do it. Don't pass that rule. It is \nan embarrassment to you and to the people in desperate need. If you \npass the rule, for gosh sakes, don't pass the bill.\n  I cannot believe the House of Representatives will pass us a take-it-\nor-leave-it supplemental that takes out help for FEMA, takes out help \nfor wildfires, will not let the NASA commission go on, and essentially \npokes AmeriCorps volunteers in the eye, when we are ready to harvest \ntheir idealism and put them to work in Teach America and other \neducation programs.\n  House of Representatives: Don't go out for a 5-week break without \nhelping these desperate situations.\n  What is an urgent supplemental? An urgent supplemental says when the \nFederal Government runs out of funds in key programs, because of \nunintended consequences, we, somewhere in the spring, pass legislation \nto deal with that. That is what we are supposed to be dealing with now. \nIt is urgent, it is supplemental, and it is desperately needed.\n  I express my disappointment that the House of Representatives has \nblocked emergency funding for disaster assistance for wildfire \nassistance, for AmeriCorps volunteers.\n  We saw this coming. Who spotted it? Our very able chairman of the \nHomeland Security Subcommittee on Appropriations, Senator Cochran, and \nSenator Byrd saw this emergency disaster coming. In April of this year, \nSenator Cochran and Senator Byrd asked President Bush to help with \nemergency funding for FEMA disaster relief. They rightly calculated \nFEMA would be down to $89 million at the end of July, just when we are \nheading into high hurricane season, and there would be the possibility \nof other natural disasters. And God forbid we have to have the money if \nthere is another attack on the United States of America.\n  They asked for the money in April. Silence from the White House. \nSilence from the White House. Silence from OMB. Silence--where the \nclock was ticking, as the money dwindled down.\n  The President did send Congress a request on July 7. He did say FEMA \nwould run out of money. So the Senate acted very quickly with the \nPresident's request, led by Senator Stevens and Senator Byrd, the \nchairman and ranking member of the Appropriations\n\n[[Page S9940]]\n\nCommittee. Expeditiously, within 48 hours of the President's request, \nthe Appropriations Committee in the Senate acted. We approved money for \ndisaster assistance. We approved $1.6 billion for disaster relief. We \napproved money to help with the Space Station Columbia. We approved \nmoney to help with the wildfires facing our Western States and possibly \neven Alaska itself, and much-needed help in mountain counties of West \nVirginia.\n  We helped with AmeriCorps. We did it. And I was a proud sponsor of \nadding $100 million for AmeriCorps. There were Senators who had \ndisputes on this, so we had a separate vote on AmeriCorps, kind of the \nAmerican way. I thought: majority ruled. I would have been disappointed \nif the Senate had defeated my amendment, but we followed usual and \ncustomary procedures, and the Senate sustained the AmeriCorps funding \nby a vote of 71-21.\n  Then we passed the urgent supplemental as part of the legislative \nbranch appropriations 85 to 7. Again, majority ruled.\n  The Senate quickly appointed conferees. Remember, the Senate moved \nvery quickly. The President made a request on the 7th. We went to \ncommittee on the 9th; to the Senate floor on the 11th. Isn't that just \nterrific. We knew we had to move fast because it is an urgent \nsupplemental. Then we went to conference. Well, guess what. There was \nno conference. The House has delayed, delayed, delayed, delayed. And so \nnow at the very last minute they want to leave town for a recess. They \nwant to leave 1 week before we are. Well, they don't have to go this \nweek. There is nothing that says the House has to evacuate Washington. \nThey could stay another couple of days.\n  But all of last week, ever since we passed this bill on July 11--and \nit is now the July 25--for 14 days I have been waiting to go to \nconference to work on this supplemental. I was ready to go during the \nday. I was ready to go during the night. I was ready to go on weekends. \nI would have come here on my birthday. I was ready to stand up for \nAmerica and to stand up for this supplemental assistance. But, no, now \nthey are going to wait for the last minute, pull kind of a \nparliamentary shenanigan, take it or leave it.\n  What are they sending over? What an embarrassment. They are sending \nover $984 million for FEMA assistance, and that is it.\n  Not only are they taking out AmeriCorps, wildfire money, and NASA \nmoney to complete the investigation of what went wrong, they are \nreducing the FEMA account requested by the Senate by $700 million. We \nhave never let FEMA fall to such a low level. I am sorry that the House \nis falling to such a low level as well.\n  We don't need low levels at FEMA. We don't need low levels from the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  I am concerned that the FEMA account is nearly bankrupt. It is \nunconscionable and irresponsible for we on the Atlantic and gulf coasts \nwho are at the height of the hurricane season, and they know it.\n  When it comes to looking at the whole issue of wildfires, they know \nwhat the West is facing. It is not a TV item. It is brave people \nwilling to put themselves on the line. States are at a financial \ncrisis, and now they are facing the fire crisis. As an east coast \nSenator, my heart goes out to those in the West.\n  Then when we look at NASA--we went to the memorial. We said: A \ngrateful nation will never forget. We are going to get to the bottom of \nthis. We are going to fly again.\n  I hope we do. Hats off and salutes to the commission being led by \nAdmiral Gayman. It is thorough, it is rigorous, it is leaving no stone \nunturned. We are going to get great results. But they need the money to \nfinish the commission. And where will they get the money? Go back to \nNASA, take it out of the shuttle? Take it out of space science? It is a \nslap in the face for the families of those astronauts we promised we \nwould get to the bottom of this. We have a great commission with an \noutstanding leader, and we should put the money in the Federal \ncheckbook.\n  Then when we talk about AmeriCorps, 20,000 volunteers will lose their \nslots within a matter of days. Why? Because the mismanagement at \nheadquarters overenrolled by 20,000 volunteers. We have discussed this. \nWhy punish the volunteers and the community for headquarters? \nHeadquarters is not going to lose their jobs, though I did call for new \nleadership, and the President has responded. Senator Bond is the one \nwho has been a champion of fiscal reform. He has stood sentry over the \nissues related to AmeriCorps. The House was silent on it. And the \nuncovering of the debacle occurred in the Senate under Senator Bond's \nleadership with my assistance. The reform effort was led by Senator \nBond for fiscal accountability and greater transparency, again with our \nassistance, on a bipartisan basis.\n\n  When we put $100 million in the committee, there was a vote on the \nSenate floor to take it out. Seventy-one Senators voted to keep it in. \nWe have been working in such a bipartisan way. I am so agitated about \nwhat is going on in the House. We have had bipartisan cooperation to \ndeal with the urgent supplemental. We have had bipartisan support to \ndeal with the issues. We have conducted ourselves in a way that I \nthought was civilized and constructive.\n  I recall the evening where the junior Senator from Alabama rose and \nsaid he was going to oppose the $100 million. He had a markup on \nasbestos. We accommodated each other so the Senator could offer his \ndebate; I could offer my rebuttal. The Senator wanted to return to the \nasbestos markup. We were crisp. We were cogent. We were civilized. We \nwere collegial. We each had our day. Then the Senate, the next day, had \na vote.\n  How unlike the House. They can't even offer an amendment. Then they \ndidn't even have the backbone to face us in conference.\n  I don't know how they are going to go back and face their \nconstituents with the fact that they have short-funded FEMA. They have \ntaken out the wildfire money, which I cannot understand. Why punish the \nWest that has been hit by drought, hit by wildfires, and hit by a \nbudget crisis? I don't think Americans should do this to other \nAmericans.\n  I have spoken about the NASA commission. When it comes to the \nAmeriCorps volunteers, let me tell you what is going to happen if we \ndon't do this. On August 1, Wendy Kopp, one of the true leaders of \nAmerica, is going to tell several thousand volunteers ready to go into \nclassrooms: The U.S. Congress didn't think you were important enough or \nvalued enough to put in the grant funds for you to go into those \nclassrooms, authorize the working in PAL programs, literacy programs, \nall of the education stuff that needs to start in September. We didn't \nthink it was urgent enough. We wanted to have a temper tantrum over a \nbureaucratic snafu, so we are not going to punish the bureaucrats. We \nare going to punish the volunteers. We are going to punish the programs \nthat help on education, and we are going to punish our children.\n  I know one volunteer in education who came to Baltimore. And he went \ninto a very tough school under Teach America. When he came in, the \nreading levels were 23 percent. When he walked out, after he had \nfinished his AmeriCorps commitment, those kids were reading in the 71st \npercentile, a 50-percent improvement. That young man changed those \nkids' lives, but those kids changed that young man's life. He is now a \nregular teacher in the Baltimore City school system. This is what this \nis all about. This isn't rich kids singing ``Kumbaya.'' These are kids \ntrying to earn a voucher to pay for the high cost of tuition, give \npractical experience to America. They help our communities, and then in \nturn the communities have a great impact on them. It is a modest public \ninvestment.\n  There was a bureaucratic snafu. It has been corrected thanks to the \nleadership of Senator Bond, with the cooperation of this side of the \naisle. Why should we punish 20,000 volunteers who are already to go in \nSeptember and won't be able to go because of what the House is going to \ndo this afternoon? Shame on you, House leadership, for not at least \ngiving them the vote. Shame on you for not voting sooner and bringing \nthis to conference.\n  I am very disappointed. I thought in America the majority ruled. \nThere is a very small minority that is blocking this urgent \nsupplemental, blocking following the rules of procedure of the Senate. \nThis isn't about rules. This is\n\n[[Page S9941]]\n\nabout people. It is about people who could be hit by a hurricane, \npeople who are already hit by a wildfire, volunteers who are ready to \nroll into our classrooms. ``Ready to roll,'' I use those words \ndeliberately.\n  A promise made should be a promise kept for the families who lost \ntheir loved ones in the Columbia disaster. I really object to their \nsending back a conference report without these items in it. When this \nis raised, if this comes back under this draconian circumstance, I will \nobject to it being brought up. I think we ought to send back to the \nHouse the Senate bill, which we agreed upon with an overwhelming \nmajority of 80 to 20.\n  I thank the Chair for his very kind attention. I thank Senator \nStevens very much for his leadership on this issue, and the leadership \nprovided by Senator Byrd, and for the collegiality in which we \nparticipated in our debate. My heart goes out to the Western Senators \nwho are about to be nailed by this, and to the AmeriCorps volunteers. I \nthink we need to stand up for America, and we ought to stand up for \nthis urgent supplemental.\n  I yield the floor, but I will not yield my perspective on this \nsupplemental.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/25/senate-section/article/S9941-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9941-S9943]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ENERGY POLICY ACT OF 2003--Continued\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 1390 Through 1395, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, I come to the floor to make some \ncomments on the Singapore and Chile trade agreements. Let me begin by \nsaying I think it is really a shame that an otherwise good trade \nagreement with both Singapore and Chile, which I would otherwise \nsupport, I cannot support because immigration provisions were added to \nthe bill, I believe contrary to the plenary powers of this Congress.\n  But before I discuss the trade agreement, I would like to say at the \noutset that, as I see it, the fast-track process is a real problem. \nUnder fast-track rules, there is limited debate, expedited procedures, \ndeadlines, and no amendments. Congress can only vote up or down.\n  While the fast-track procedures provide for consultations with \nCongress, there is really no guarantee that the President or the U.S. \nTrade Representative will ultimately respect the opinions and advice of \nSenators and House Members. In other words, we lose all ability to \ninfluence the content of a trade agreement negotiated under the fast-\ntrack procedures.\n  For me, from California, a place that has 36 million people and is \neither the fifth or sixth largest economic engine on Earth, trade \nagreements have major implications.\n  I have always had a relationship with the USTR that apparently I do \nnot have with this USTR, because of the size of California \neconomically, and the interests internationally, that at least I be \nconsulted in a meaningful way. In this case, consultation, as I \nunderstand it, constituted staff briefings.\n  I wish to say, my staff does not cast a vote. I cast the vote. So if \nanyone is going to consult with the senior Senator from California, it \nought to be with the senior Senator from California. None of those \nconsultations took place.\n  Not only that, I have sat on the Immigration Subcommittee for 10 \nyears now and you, Mr. President, are the new chair of that \nsubcommittee. To the best of my knowledge, that subcommittee as a \nwhole--maybe individual members have been able to have an impact, but \nas a whole, the subcommittee has not been able to have an impact. So \nany hearing we might have is de minimis in impact because the decision \nis already made. I am told by my staff that by the time any meaningful \nbriefing took place, the agreement had been signed and sent over here. \nThat is not the way to do business with somebody like me, who has 36 \nmillion people, a huge economy, and all kinds of issues in virtually \nany trade agreement.\n  Fast track really provides a disadvantage for the people of \nCalifornia. When I was lobbied to vote yes on fast track, I said to \nvirtually every industry in California: Do you realize that if a \nPresident or a USTR negotiates an agreement, they can negotiate an \nagreement and let California suffer all kinds of repercussions and \nthere is nothing your elected representative can do about it? That is \nfast track. When you have the fifth or sixth largest economy on Earth, \nit means a great deal.\n  But, having said that, let me go to the immigration provisions of \nthis free-trade agreement. The administration again insists it has had \na number of discussions on these. Perhaps, again, they have with \ncertain Members. They certainly have not with me. But immigration \npolicy has long been well within the purview of Congress, and I believe \nit should stay there. Indeed, the Constitution gives Congress this \npower, and I do not think it is wise to give up that power to another \nbranch of Government in this trade agreement or in any other.\n\n  These agreements, as I read them, would create sweeping and permanent \nnew categories of visas, regardless of whether Congress would deem \nthese new entries valid or beneficial to our Nation's economy and \nwelfare. Even more important, regardless of whether Congress might want \nto change these new categories at some later date, we cannot do it.\n  Specifically, I oppose these agreements because they would create \nentirely new categories of nonimmigrant visas for free-trade \nprofessionals, thus permitting the admission of up to 5,400 \nprofessionals from Singapore and up to 1,400 professionals from Chile \neach year.\n  They would permit an indefinite extension of these visas.\n  They would require the entry of spouses and children accompanying or \nfollowing to join these professionals without limitation. So any number \nof family members can come in.\n  They would require, without numerical limit, the entry of business \npersons under categories that parallel three other current visa \ncategories. In other words, require their entry under other categories, \nthe B-1 business visitor visa, the E-1 treaty trader or investor visa, \nand the L-1 intracompany transfer visa.\n  These agreements would permit but not require the United States to \ndeny the entry of a free-trade professional if his or her entry would \nadversely affect the settlement of a labor dispute.\n  They would require that the United States submit disputes about \nwhether it should grant certain individuals entry to an international \ntribunal. So if there was a pattern in our entry practice, we would \nhave to submit that to an international tribunal, and a international \ntribunal would decide a sovereign right of the United States of \nAmerica. That, to me, is unacceptable.\n  These agreements are troubling in their permanence, their \ninflexibility, and their lack of congressional participation or \noversight. The fact is, current law already permits foreign nationals \nto do all the things specified under the trade agreement. In fact, \nseveral thousand nationals from Chile and Singapore enter the United \nStates each year. To the extent that changes need to be made, Congress \ncan choose to make them.\n  So this raises the question, Why, then, do these provisions need to \nbe in a trade agreement? Perhaps the answer can be found by taking a \ncloser look at these trade agreements, and more specifically at how \nexactly the agreements differ from current law.\n  There are no numerical limits for any of the visa categories except \nthe new H-1B(1) visa. There are no labor certifications under this \nbill. This is very significant. The United States can impose no prior \napproval procedures, petitions, labor certification tests, or other \nprocedures of similar effect.\n  Under the visitor visa provisions:\n\n       A party shall normally accept an oral declaration as to the \n     principal place of business and the actual place of accrual \n     of profits.\n\n  Where the party requires further proof, a letter from the employer \nattesting to these matters would serve as sufficient proof.\n  These are all contained in the trade agreements. Thus, the facts \nspeak for themselves.\n  But behind the abstraction, the theories, and the statistics of the \nfree-trade agreements we are considering today, there is one \ninescapable factor, and that is the working men and women of this \ncountry and what is going to happen to them.\n\n[[Page S9944]]\n\n  As I said in the Judiciary Committee, I am not the Senator from Chile \nor Singapore. I am the Senator from California. The people of my State \nare working in produce-rich fields. They are building new technologies \nfor tomorrow. They are fiber optic engineers, computer programers, and \nphysical therapists tending to the needs of others, all of whom are \ngoing to be affected by the immigration provisions of this bill.\n  I know of engineers who have been out of work for more than a year \nwho have sent out hundreds of resumes and are still looking for a job--\nmachinists, carpenters, and engineers by the tens of thousands looking \nfor work in my State. Let me give you a couple of cases.\n  Jenlih Hsieh is a 50-year-old U.S. citizen from Taiwan with a \nmaster's degree and more than 12 years of experience in Unix systems \nadministration, filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity \nCommission, the U.S. Department of Justice and in Santa Clara County \nSuperior Court. Hsieh alleges that SwitchOn Networks of Milpitas fired \nhim after 6 months and replaced him with an H-1B worker. According to \nthe complaint, the H-1B worker was earning $30,000 less a year, had \nonly a bachelor's degree and much less experience.\n  Why is this important? It is important because this bill provides \nthat the Labor Department cannot do an investigation to see if the \ncomplaint is correct. The Labor Department cannot make a certification \nthat there is no replacement of an American worker. If the \nadministration chose to add this, the message it should send to each \nand every one of us is the administration fully contemplates that \nAmerican workers are going to be replaced by the immigration provisions \nof this treaty and does not want their Department of Labor to be able \nto check that out and keep records to see if these are, in fact, \nsustainable complaints.\n  Bob Simoni, 39, lost his consulting job at Toshiba American \nElectronics Components in Irvine in March 2002. Simoni, who has an MBA \nfrom the University of California-Los Angeles, had worked at Toshiba as \na contract engineer for 2 years installing software. He came to work in \nFebruary to find everyone packing their boxes. Toshiba was outsourcing \nthe division to an India-based technology services company, Infosys, \nwhich employs H-1B workers in the United States. Simoni said Toshiba \nasked him to stay for 3 weeks to do ``knowledge transfer'' with Infosys \nemployee Rakesh Gollapalli, who told him he had an H-1B visa. It hurt \nto be training someone who for all practical purposes was replacing \nhim, and it felt wrong, Simoni said.\n  You and I, Mr. President, are allowing this to happen with the H-1B \nvisa being so extensively used in the United States, and we need to \nchange that.\n  The Boston Globe published an article June 3, 2003 that also reveals \nthe fear many American workers have of losing their positions to H-1B \nand L-1 temporary workers. The story of John Malloy illustrates the \nexperience of many Americans in the fields of technology, information, \nand engineering:\n\n       Unix system administrator John Malloy used to work for \n     NASA, but hasn't had a steady job in over 2 years. ``I'm 40 \n     years old, and my life is ruined,'' he said. Malloy said his \n     last job was at a local healthcare company, where he helped \n     train two workers from India. He said the Indian workers are \n     still on the job, but he was laid off. Mallory told the \n     reporter: ``I'm an open, fair-minded world citizen who loves \n     everybody . . . but I'm really starting to get frustrated.''\n\n  This trend prompted The San Francisco Chronicle to publish articles \non the topic on both May 25 and June 2, 2003. The articles describe the \nconfusion surrounding the use of L-1 visas, citing confusion among \ncompanies, labor lawyers, and government agencies as to what type of \nuse of the visas is legal. They also show increasing hostility from \nAmerican high-tech workers surrounding L-1 visas.\n\n       One example is the case of the dozen computer programmers \n     who were laid off from Siemens Information and Communication \n     Networks in Lake Mary FL, and replaced with foreign workers \n     using the L-1 program. Michael Emmons left Siemens last fall \n     just before his job there was to end. Emmons had worked as a \n     contract computer programmer for the company for 6 years, \n     first in San Jose, CA, and then in Florida. He said, ``This \n     is what they call outsourcing. I call it in-sourcing. Import \n     foreign workers, mandate your American workers to train them, \n     they lay off your Americans.''\n\n  This is what we are allowing to happen. My view is that it is not a \nproblem during boom time because there are enough jobs for all. But \nwhat happens when we have these rich programs is that when tough times \ncome, employers succumb to the lure of being able to save $30,000 or \n$40,000 a worker. We are passing this treaty in the middle of huge \nunemployment in our country. We are creating a sinecure for these \nworkers from other countries. I think that is a mistaken priority.\n  Last week, I joined with my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, \nSenators Sessions of Alabama and Graham of South Carolina, urging the \nPresident and the U.S. Trade Representative to withdraw the legislation \nimplementing the Free Trade Agreements with Chile and Singapore.\n  We also asked that the administration renegotiate or reconfigure the \ntrade agreements without the immigration provisions and re-transmit a \nnew version of the implementing legislation to Congress.\n  I am extremely trouble that despite these concerns, which were \nexpressed by several members of both chambers of Congress, the \nPresident sent Congress implementing legislation that would effectively \nexpand the temporary admissions program without the express consent to \ndo so.\n  Let me say this: I very much doubt that the USTR is any kind of an \nexpert on immigration. I must tell you that I have heard rumors that \nthis was to be the precedent for some 50 other treaties to come after \nit. I think if this Senate and the House were to allow this to happen, \nwe don't deserve to hold these jobs.\n  I don't believe that this Senate should relinquish its plenary power \nover immigration to any administration nor to any country that is party \nto a trade agreement. Trade agreements are simply not the appropriate \nvehicle for enacting immigration law. Such agreements are meant to have \na permanent impact. They cannot be amended or modified by subsequent \nlegislation should Congress need to alter these provisions. I am not \nsaying we should capriciously alter these provisions. I am saying that \nif the economic conditions change, the United States needs to respond \nto those economic changes rather than to be frozen into a pattern of \ndozens of agreements which freeze for all time certain things that may \nbe proved to be inimical to our national interests.\n  A recent commentary by Paul Magnusson in BusinessWeek asked the \nquestion I think we should all ask ourselves: ``Is a stealth \nimmigration policy smart?'' Magnusson wrote:\n\n       Complex trade agreements, which increasingly affect the \n     entire U.S. economy and require changes in U.S. laws and \n     social policies, should not be considered in secret, or in \n     isolation from all other legislation.\n\n  That is exactly what happened with this agreement. The result of this \nkind of process is going to be an unwieldy patchwork of conflicting \npermanent law that will encumber an already overburdened immigration \nsystem, while exacerbating the growing backlogs of people already \nseeking to enter the United States.\n  Such legislation will ultimately tie our hands when the national \ninterest demands an alteration in the immigration provisions on which \nwe are about to vote. Establishing separate policies and laws for \ndifferent countries makes the day-to-day implementation more \ncomplicated and susceptible to error and abuse. And that is exactly \nwhat this does. Every country will have its own set of immigration \nlaws, which can last forever under the terms of the treaty. How can any \nINS ever administer that?\n  I have other concerns with the Trade Representative's decision to \ninclude so prescriptively the immigration provisions at hand. The \nOffice of the U.S. Trade Representative has not demonstrated the need \nfor negotiating these temporary entry provisions, nor does the office \nprovide any evidence that current immigration law would be a barrier to \nmeeting the United States obligation in furthering trade and goods and \nservices. In fact, current law is sufficient to accommodate these \nobligations, as evidenced by the millions of temporary workers who \nenter the United States each year.\n  Just listen to the numbers: In just 2002, 4,376,935 foreign nationals \nentered\n\n[[Page S9945]]\n\nunder the B-1 temporary business visitor visa; 171,368 entered under \nthe E treaty-trader visa; and another 313,699 entered under the L \nintracompany transfer visa; and an additional 370,490 entered the \nUnited States under the H-1B professional visa.\n  If you add all of these up, we have over 5 million people just last \nyear coming in under these temporary visas, of which probably half \nbecome permanent. And that is in addition to the regular immigration \nprogram.\n  In all, the United States admitted a total of 5,232,492 foreign \nnationals under the current temporary visa categories. Of these \nnumbers, 40,461 temporary business professionals entered from Chile and \n29,458 entered from Singapore.\n  What is my point? My point is, there already is enough room to absorb \nunder present visa categories. Over 40,000 from Chile and 30,000 from \nSingapore came in last year alone under these visa categories. Yet the \nUSTR saw fit to say: It isn't enough, Senate and House. We are going to \nimpose another permanent program.\n  Free-trade visas should not be indefinitely renewable, and I am not \ngoing to vote for one that is. Under the trade agreements, the visas \nfor temporary businesspersons entering under all the categories in the \nagreement are indefinitely renewable. So this is what transforms what, \non paper, is a temporary visa-entry program into a permanent visa-entry \nprogram.\n  While the trade agreements require temporary professionals to come in \nunder the overall cap imposed on the H-1B visa, each visa holder would \nbe permitted to remain in the United States for an indefinite period of \ntime. That means permanent. Thus, employers could renew their \nemployees' visas each and every year under the agreement with no \nlimits, while also bringing in new entrants to fill up the annual \nnumerical limits for new visas. So the thing spirals and expands \nexponentially. This effectively would obliterate Congress' ability to \nlimit the duration of such visas even when it is in the national \ninterest to do so.\n\n  Thirdly, the agreement provides insufficient protection for workers, \nboth domestic and foreign. Today, in our country, 15.3 million people \nare unemployed or underemployed in part-time jobs out of economic \nnecessity or they have given up looking for work. Of that number, 9.4 \nmillion are considered officially unemployed.\n  These unemployment figures are the highest in a decade, and yet we \nare doing this program now. In California, 1.17 million people are out \nof work. In the San Francisco Bay area, the technology boom and \nsubsequent bust has created a huge pool of unemployed skilled labor. In \nSan Jose alone, 47,160 people--or nearly 10 percent of the population--\nare looking for jobs.\n  More and more out-of-work technology workers are filing complaints \nwith the Government or going to court to protest perceived abuses of \ntemporary visa programs. And yet the administration has seen fit to \npush through a free-trade agreement with immigration provisions of \nwhich very few of us could predict the consequences.\n  Although employers are, by and large, good actors, the provisions in \nthe implementing legislation would expose many more workers--and don't \nforget this--to displacement, to wage exploitation, and to other forms \nof abuse. These provisions, as drafted in the trade agreement, would \nincrease the number of temporary foreign workers exposed to \nexploitation and leave more to face an uncertain future. By making the \nvisas indefinitely extendable, albeit 1 year at a time, these workers \nwill remain in limbo with year-to-year extensions of their stay.\n  Despite these concerns, the USTR has seen fit to push through a free-\ntrade agreement with immigration provisions that significantly weaken \nthe U.S. and temporary foreign worker protections under current \nimmigration law in several ways.\n  First, the provisions would expand the types of occupations currently \ncovered under H-1B to include: management consultants, disaster relief \nclaims adjusters, physical therapists, and agricultural managers--\nprofessions that do not require a bachelor's degree. Nor would \nemployers be required to demonstrate a shortage of workers in these \nprofessions before hiring foreign nationals under the agreement. This \nopens the door to the inclusion of new occupations in the trade \nagreement that are not currently included in the H-1B program.\n  In a sense, what this means is, it is a special program through which \nyou can replace an American worker, pay less for that worker, and keep \nthat worker so that worker isn't going to complain because if he or she \ndoes, the visa is not going to get renewed the next year. And if that \nworker succumbs to any kind of exploitation, his family comes over, her \nfamily comes over, and they have a lifetime sinecure, not only with the \ncompany but within the United States. No American worker has that.\n\n  The current H-1B program defines a specialty occupation as one that \nrequires the application--and this is important--of a body of highly \nspecialized knowledge. That is there for one reason, to ensure \nemployers don't abuse the program to undercut American workers in \noccupations where there is no skill shortage. What this agreement does \nis delete the word ``highly.'' So that would lower the standard for \nadmission by broadening the definition of specialty occupation to \ninclude any job that requires the application ``of a body of \nspecialized knowledge.''\n  It is a significant weakening to allow less specialized workers to \ncome in and, I believe, to replace American workers at less money.\n  Neither the free-trade agreement nor the implementing legislation \nrequire the employer to attest and the Department of Labor to certify \nthat the employer has not laid off a U.S. worker either 90 days before \nor after hiring the foreign worker before the foreign national is \npermitted to enter the United States.\n  Why do you suppose that is in there? That is in there so any American \nemployer that wants to can keep an American worker until they can \nreplace them with a foreign worker at less money and then do so. \nBecause those simple precautions that made this more difficult to do \nare gone. Nobody should believe, when they vote for this legislation, \nthat it is not a foreign-worker replacement program. I have just given \nthe documentation that indicates exactly how it is going to be done.\n  Once you eliminate the labor certification, you eliminate the \nrequirement that the Department of Labor makes an investigation to \nverify the employer's attestation is accurate and truthful before \npermitting the entry of a foreign national. Labor certifications are \nexpressly prohibited under this trade agreement. Again, it is the \nforeign worker employment program in the United States displacing \nAmerican workers, and this is how to do it.\n  Moreover, the implementing provisions limit the authority of the \nLabor Department by providing that it may review attestations only for \ncompleteness and only for inaccuracies. So the screw is being tightened \non the Labor Department. You can't investigate, you can't certify, and \nyou can only review the application to see whether it is complete and \naccurate. To add insult to injury, you have to provide the \ncertification mandatorily within 7 days. So neither the trade agreement \nnor the implementing language provides the Department of Labor \nauthority to initiate investigations or conduct spot checks at \nworksites to uncover instances of U.S. worker displacement and other \nlabor violations pertaining to the entry of foreign workers. It is \nreally bad.\n  This is troublesome, given that in the last 2 fiscal years the \nDepartment of Labor investigated 166 businesses with H-1B violations. \nAs a result of those investigations, H-1B employers were required to \npay more than $5 million in back pay awards to 678 H-1B workers. That \nis proof of what is going on. There is proof that companies do this. \nThis is not new thought. I am not reaching to find a reason. This is \nhappening. And in a tough economy, it is going to happen more. Those of \nus who are elected by workers to protect them fail in our obligation to \ndo so.\n  While the administration has included a cap on the number of \nprofessionals entering under the H-1B(1) category, there are no such \nlimitations on the number of temporary workers entering on other visa \ncategories, including the B-1 visitor visa, the E-treaty/investor visa, \nand the L-1 intracompany visa.\n\n[[Page S9946]]\n\n  None of these categories are numerically limited under the agreement. \nOnce enacted, Congress may not subsequently impose caps on these \ncategories for nationals entering pursuant to this agreement.\n  The trade agreement expressly prohibits the imposition of labor \ncertification tests or other similar conditions on temporary workers \nentering from Chile and Singapore. I am amazed the Governments of Chile \nand Singapore want this. I am amazed they want their people to come in \nand face exploitation in the United States.\n  While Congress could certainly correct some aspects of the law \nimplementing the trade agreements, it would be limited in what it could \ndo by the underlying trade agreement itself. For example, if Congress \ndecided to better protect U.S. businesses and workers by amending the \nlaws governing the L-1 visa category to require a labor certification \nor a numerical limit before a foreign worker from Chile or Singapore \ncould enter the United States, it would not be able to do so. Both are \nplausible options for dealing with perceived abuses in the visa \ncategory. However, both trade agreements provide ``neither party may, \nA, as a condition for temporary entry under paragraph 1, require labor \ncertifications or other procedures of similar effect; or, B, impose or \nmaintain any numerical restriction relating to temporary entry under \nparagraph 1.''\n  Again, there is something a little insidious in this, in the \nformulation of a new program with these specific specifications in view \nof the fact of the more than 50,000 Chilean and Singaporean workers \ncoming in in our other business visitor visa categories. So the \nsignificance of this is creating a new program and making it permanent \nand taking out any meaningful labor certification. I figure every one \nof these people can replace an American worker for less money. \nOtherwise, why do this?\n  These provisions significantly limit congressional authority, A, to \nestablish labor protections when warranted and, B, to limit the number \nof visas that could be issued to nationals in Chile and Singapore, \nshould we deem it is in the national interest.\n  I don't think we should relinquish this constitutional authority. It \nis really for this reason, on behalf of the millions of Americans who \nare unemployed and underemployed and particularly in these exact \ncategories, I cannot tell you the workers trained with graduate degrees \nbeing replaced, with families. And they can't find jobs. And we fall \nright into the trap and produce an agreement that is going to say: \nLabor Department, the only thing you can check is the accuracy of an \napplication for name, address, and phone number, and whether it is all \nfilled in, and then you must certify it within 7 days. And John Smith, \nwho has worked in the company for 10 years, has a graduate degree, gets \nto train this worker, who is paid $30,000 less--and I gave you actual \ncases where this is happening--and the worker goes home to a mortgage \non a home and a car and three kids in school.\n\n  Is this what we are elected to do? I am not going to do it. If I \ncould filibuster, I would filibuster it. I am really angry about it \nbecause it is sleight of hand. There was no meaningful consultation. \nMr. Zoellick never picked up the phone and called me--or his No. 2, 3, \n4, or 5--and said: This is what we are thinking of doing. I know you in \nCalifornia have the highest unemployment in 10 years and there has been \na high-tech bubble burst. I know a lot of your professionals are out on \nthe street. What do you think of this? I would say: No way, Jose.\n  So I am mad and I hope every working man and woman in this country is \nmad, too. I am mad because--Mr. President, you know, as you were in \ncommittee--we asked to send it back. We were refused. And there is no \ndelay. Bingo, it is out on the floor. It is going to be ramrodded \nthrough this body.\n  Well, one thing I have learned is that the working men and women of \nthis country are not stupid. Of all these visitor visas, we have 5 \nmillion granted in just a year. People are going to catch on. The word \nis going to get around. I very much regret that the administration \nwon't eliminate the immigration section. This would be a perfectly good \ntreaty without them. Five million people came in last year under the H-\n1B visas--5 million. Plenty of room. We don't need to create a new \npermanent program, tighten the housing supply, tighten the school \nsupply, bring in all these families, and not be able to take care of \nour own.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I will spend a few minutes expressing my \nconcerns about a serious public health crisis that this country faces \ndue to mercury pollution.\n  Perhaps some of you have heard of the small fishing community of \nMinamata Bay in Japan. If you know this village, you know also that it \nwas nearly devastated by mercury pollution.\n  Over 70 years ago, a chemical plant began dumping mercury waste into \nthat bay. For the next 30 years, local citizens who depended heavily on \nthe bay for commerce and daily sustenance saw strange and debilitating \nhealth problems emerge.\n  At first, those eating fish out of the bay began experiencing \nheadaches, numbness, tremors, blurred vision, hearing loss, speech \nproblems, spasms, and loss of consciousness. As fish consumption \ncontinued, more people became sick.\n  Plus, pets started becoming violent and birds fell from the sky. \nNaturally, the public's panic grew.\n  Then, a generation of children was born with shriveled limbs and \nsevere physical deformities. The woman in this photograph is one of the \nsurvivors of what was called Minamata Disease.\n  In all, over nine hundred people died and thousands more were \ncrippled by the poisoning. The Japanese government, which discovered \nthe cause of these illnesses as early as 1956, hid the truth from the \nailing public and refused to halt the industrial pollution. The dumping \neventually stopped in 1968.\n  In other words, knowing this mercury pollution was deadly, the \nJapanese government allowed it to continue for another 12 years.\n  Surely such abandonment of the public's well-being would not happen \ntoday in our great country.\n  Surely our government would never delay protections from mercury \npollution for a decade, while allowing industry to neglect its \nresponsibilities.\n  Sadly, I am afraid this is exactly what is happening in our country \ntoday--over half a century after the lessons of Minamata Bay.\n  Fortunately, we are not faced with the same concentration of mercury \npollution as that Japanese fishing village\n\n[[Page S9947]]\n\nso many years ago, where an estimated 27 tons of mercury compounds were \ndumped into the Bay. Although U.S. power plants emit almost twice that \namount into the air each year, it is dispersed broadly, resulting in \nlower concentrations in any one place.\n  Some estimates show that almost 100 additional tons of this poison \nare emitted from other U.S. sources every year, bringing our air \nemissions total to almost 150 tons of mercury pollution annually.\n  Furthermore, the principal route of human and wildlife exposure, \nnamely, the consumption of poisoned fish, is the same in this country \nas it was in Minamata. It is occurring at often dangerous levels.\n  Power plants are the largest unregulated source of mercury in the \ncountry, emitting almost 50 tons each year into our air. To put this \namount into perspective, just one-seventieth of a teaspoon of annual \nmercury deposition can make fish in a 25 acre lake unsafe to eat. \nUtilities, amazingly, are releasing enough mercury into our air every \nyear to contaminate 45 million lakes.\n  Medical and solid waste incinerators are also major mercury \npolluters, but they are regulated under the Clean Air Act. Because of \nthese regulations, incinerators have reduced emissions by 95 percent in \nthe last decade. Impressive. The act also requires any residual risk \nposed by these sources to be reduced with further emissions cuts.\n  When utilities burn coal, they release much of its mercury content \ninto the air. This mercury falls with the rain into lakes, streams, and \nthe ocean. It then transforms into a toxic compound called methyl \nmercury that does not break down easily, as this chart shows.\n  This toxic mercury is eaten by fish, and increases in concentration \nup the fish food chain as smaller fish are consumed by larger fish. \nEventually, humans and other animals eat the fish, and the mercury too. \nClearly, our consumption of larger fish can expose us to greater \nconcentrations of mercury contamination than eating smaller fish. This \ncycle is depicted in the chart beside me.\n  The EPA estimates that although some atmospheric deposition of \nmercury in the United States is due to non-U.S. sources, 60 percent of \nwhat falls to Earth in our country is due to our own emissions.\n  We should take responsibility for the fact that most of our mercury \ndeposition comes from our own country. And, for those sources abroad \nthat affect our Nation's environment, I urge the administration to \nnegotiate a treaty quickly to control non-U.S. emissions.\n  Mercury contamination of fish in the United States has very harmful \nimpacts on our wildlife and our health. In waterfowl such ass loons, it \ninterferes with vision and muscle coordination. It is toxic to their \ndeveloping embryos and hinders reproduction. As a result, loon \npopulations are declining, especially in the Adirondacks.\n  Other fish-eating wildlife like mink and otters are at risk as well.\n  In humans, once mercury is ingested it has the ability to enter our \nblood stream and cross the blood-brain barrier. Pregnant and nursing \nwomen then can pass the mercury on to developing fetuses and infants, \nwho are at greatest risk for serious health problems.\n  The National Academy of Sciences has confirmed that prenatal mercury \nexposure is linked to the following: impaired memory and concentration; \nthe inability to process and recall information; impaired visual and \nmotor function; attention and language deficits; cerebral palsy; mental \nretardation; and other developmental effects.\n  These health effects are similar to those caused by lead poisoning. \nIndeed, mercury is very likely the next lead. We were able to find an \neffective solution to the lead problem relatively quickly. However, we \ncan and should address mercury pollution even more swiftly and \neffectively. We have advanced technology that makes it possible and \nfeasible now.\n  In 2003, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 1 \nin 12 women of childbearing age has mercury levels above EPA's safe \nhealth threshold, due primarily to consumption of poisoned fish. This \ntotals almost 5 million women, and results in almost 300,000 newborns \nwith increased risk of nervous system damage from exposure in the womb.\n  EPA recommends that pregnant women, or women who may become pregnant, \neat only one serving of fish each week, and adhere to any State \nadvisories that may call for further prohibitions.\n  What many Americans may not realize is that all other healthy \nchildren and adults are also at risk if they consume a large amount of \nfish. This group includes recreational anglers like this boy here, some \nNative American tribes, Asian Americans, and the poor. A United Nations \nEnvironment Programme report has linked mercury exposure to heart, \nthyroid, and digestive problems in adults.\n  This is truly a widespread health crisis. Yet, despite the fact that \nthese at-risk groups can face mercury exposures two to five times \nhigher than the general population, they are often the least informed \nabout the dangers of mercury consumption.\n  Today we rely on a hodge podge of State advisories to protect \ncitizens from eating too much poisoned fish. Currently, 43 States have \nadvisories in effect.\n  These advisories cover over 12 million acres of lakes, 450,000 miles \nof river, 15,000 miles of coast, and more.\n  Multi-state water bodies are often covered by inconsistent warnings, \nleading to confusion for anglers and consumers alike. Many States do \nnot even monitor their own rivers and lakes.\n  Some State advisories are based on EPA's safety threshold, which has \nbeen deemed scientifically justifiable by the National Academy of \nSciences. However, others are based on the EPA's weaker standard. EPA \nitself does not issue advisories, but it offers guidance to States.\n  The FDA is responsible for warning consumers about mercury \ncontamination of commercially available fish. However, FDA advisories \nare rarely posted where fish consumers can see them, at the grocery \nstores or fish markets. In fact, only this year did one State, \nCalifornia, require that stores begin posting warnings like this one.\n  This advisory says:\n\n       Warning--Pregnant and nursing women, women who may become \n     pregnant, and young children should not eat the following \n     fish: swordfish, shark, king mackerel, and tilefish. They \n     should also limit their consumption of other fish, including \n     fresh or frozen tuna.\n\n  Shamefully, the FDA does not make public the information it has \ncollected from fish safety testing. Plus, in 1998, it ceased its \nmercury monitoring program for shark, swordfish, and tuna, and now does \nonly limited testing.\n  Does this seem like an adequate way to inform the public about the \nrisks of fish consumption? The FDA must act now to better protect \nAmericans.\n  The good news is that the Clean Air Act is designed to protect us \nfrom some sources of mercury pollution. The bad news is that this \nadministration seems determined to reverse or weaken such protections.\n  The Clean Air Act amendments of 1990, which I was proud to work on \nwith the first President Bush, called on EPA to study the health and \nenvironmental impacts of mercury emissions from utilities by 1993.\n  Unfortunately, this vital study was not completed until the end of \n1997.\n  The amendments also ordered EPA to explore available technologies for \ntheir emission reduction potential, and to regulate mercury and other \nair toxics, if deemed appropriate and necessary by the administrator.\n  Such a determination should have been made soon after release of the \nstudy, during the Clinton administration. However, the Clinton EPA did \nnot issue such a finding until December 2000.\n  EPA Administrator Carol Browner found that mercury regulation was, in \nfact, appropriate and necessary, given the results of the prior EPA's \nstudy. This kicked off the drafting of maximum achievable control \ntechnology--or MACT--standards for mercury.\n  However, because EPA missed deadlines in the Act to make that \ndetermination, environmentalists sued and obtained a settlement \ncreating a schedule for the development of MACT standards.\n  Now, the second Bush EPA must propose mercury emission standards for \nutilities by this December, and finalize them by next December. These \nstandards must be met by the end of 2007 at each unit.\n  EPA could expedite finalization of the standard to give industry more\n\n[[Page S9948]]\n\ntime to comply, but instead the Agency has opted for delays. I would \nalso note that EPA is currently violating the Clean Air Act's schedule \nfor air toxics controls for many other sources, sending millions more \npounds of dangerous emissions into the air we breathe.\n  Mr. President, industry information shows that the technology exists \ntoday to reduce utility mercury emissions by 90 percent or more--down \nto about 5 tons per year. Under MACT, the EPA should set its standard \nto match the capability of the best utility performers.\n  Not coincidentally, a 90 percent cut in utility mercury emissions is \nguaranteed in my bill, the Clean Power Act of 2003.\n  However, the current Bush administration has proposed to derail EPA's \nmercury standard--in essence, to violate the intent of the Clean Air \nAct.\n  This administration's multi-pollutant plan, called Clear Skies, does \naway with the Clean Air Act's technology standard for mercury. In its \nplace, Clear Skies calls for weaker standards and a 10-year delay in \ntheir achievement.\n  Plus, EPA is prevented from using its existing authority to require \nfurther reductions if residual risk from utility air toxics remains a \nproblem.\n  Could it be that the administration is more interested in giving \npolluters a free ride than in protecting public health?\n  This harmful bias towards irresponsible industry is something we saw \n50 years ago in Minamata Bay--and we should have learned a lesson about \nits ill effects.\n  The Clear Skies polluter payoff does not aim for this five ton goal \nby 2008, but for 15 tons in 2018 and on--for eternity. As this chart \nshows, compared to a strict interpretation of what the Clean Air Act \ncould do for our health, this rollback totals 520 percent more toxic \nmercury in our environment and on our dinner tables before 2018, and \n300 percent more mercury after 2018.\n  Why would we pass this risk on to our children? I have to believe \nthat no compassionate parent- or grandparent-to-be would knowingly do \nthat.\n  EPA has thoroughly studied the mercury threat and devised an adequate \nhealth threshold--which has been supported by the NAS. The agency must \nfollow through with the law of the land and cut mercury emissions from \nutilities now. In fact, this administration does not have the authority \nto do any less. We in Congress must not and cannot in good conscience \ngive them that authority through the Clear Skies rollback.\n  If any of my colleagues doubt the potential benefits of the current \nClean Air Act, I suggest they ask this administration for its long \noverdue economic analysis of today's best technologies--what the Act \nwould require utilities to install.\n  My colleagues should know that they won't get an honest, fair, or \ntimely response, because that response would show that, by comparison, \nClear Skies is just a license to keep sending uncontrolled mercury into \nour air.\n  It is hard for me to grasp why any administration would want to keep \nCongress and the public in the dark about the real benefits of the \nClean Air Act. Could it be that the administration wants to distort the \nperceived benefits of any proposed changes.?\n  To make matters worse, in a recent hearing in the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, an official from the Council of Economic \nAdvisors suggested that the administration now wants Congress to modify \nthe mercury cap in their air pollution giveaway to make it even less \nprotective.\n  Instead of capping mercury at twenty-six tons in 2010, the \nadministration would like us to consider a cap as high as 46 tons.\n  This is an outrage. Utilities today emit about 48 tons of toxic \nmercury every year. So the modified Clear Skies cap would mean only \nmore inaction.\n  Candidate George W. Bush started with a four-pollutant bill, then \ndropped carbon in 2001 to get to three pollutants. Now, his \nadministration is more or less admitting they support merely a 2-\npollutant bill. Is that what they consider progress?\n  Why on earth would we allow them to go forward with this plan?\n  The scientific evidence about the dangers of mercury exposure mounts \nannually. The technologies exist today to dramatically reduce emissions \nand the associated risk. To do otherwise abdicates the administration's \nand our responsibility to protect public health.\n  We have a vital choice to make in Congress this year. Either we \nuphold the law as written in the Clean Air Act or we shut our eyes \nwhile the pollution and damage to our health and environment goes on.\n  The delays and distortion must stop. This in not the 1950s, as much \nas the administration would like it to be. I have no doubt there will \nbe misguided efforts to stall the mercury standards, which are already \nlate. I promise that I will keep a watchful eye. But I urge all mothers \nand fathers to pay heed as well--your children's and grandchildren's \nhealth hangs in the balance.\n  I have my own health advisory to post on the walls of Congress today: \nThe administration appears less interested in protecting mothers and \nchildren from mercury poisoning, and more interested in protecting the \npolluters' bottom line. This may explain why they are trying to replace \ncurrent law with Clear Skies.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent my remarks be as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/25/senate-section/article/S9948-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9948-S9951]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOMINATION OF WILLIAM PRYOR\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of \nWilliam Pryor to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. Mr. Pryor was \nNo. 1 in his class at Tulane University Law School. He is a magna cum \nlaude of Tulane University School of Law where he was editor and chief \nof the Tulane Law Review, something that very few lawyers have the \nprivilege of saying. He then clerked for Judge John Minor Wisdom for \nthe Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, a civil rights legend who \nhelped implement desegregation in the South.\n  While working at two of Alabama's top private law firms, he was the \nadjunct professor of law at Samford University Cumberland School of \nLaw. In 1995, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, current Senator from \nAlabama, hired him as Deputy Attorney General, and in 1997 he was \nappointed to serve out Senator Sessions' term.\n  In 1998, Alabamians elected General Pryor to this position. He was \nreelected in 2002 with the remarkable 59 percent of the vote.\n  Let me share some of the letters that prominent Democrats have \nwritten about General Pryor. Joe Reed, chairman of the Alabama \nDemocratic Conference, which is the State's African-American caucus, \nwrites that General Pryor ``will uphold the law without fear or favor. \nI believe all races and colors will get a fair shake when their cases \ncome before him . . . I am a member of the Democratic National \nCommittee and, of course, General Pryor is a Republican, but these are \nonly party labels. I am persuaded that in General Pryor's eyes, Justice \nhas only one label--Justice!''\n  Judge Sue Bell Cobb, who sits on the Alabama Court of Criminal \nAppeals, stated:\n\n       I write, not only as the only statewide Democrat to be \n     elected in 2000, not only as a member of the Court which \n     reviews the greatest portion of General Pryor's work, but \n     also as a child advocate who has labored shoulder to shoulder \n     with General Pryor in the political arena on behalf of \n     Alabama's children. It is for these reasons and more that I \n     am indeed honored to recommend General Pryor for nomination \n     to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\n  And Congressman Artur Davis encouraged President Bush to nominate \nGeneral Pryor, declaring his belief that ``Alabama will be proud of his \nservice.''\n  I will submit copies of these letters for the Record, along with \ncopies of the other many letters from Democrats and Republicans, men \nand women, and members of Africa-American, Jewish, and Christian \ncommunities who support Bill Pryor's nomination.\n  It is fundamental that a State attorney general has the obligation to \nrepresent and defend the laws and interests of this State. General \nPryor has fulfilled this responsibility admirably by repeatedly \ndefending the public first and the laws and policies enacted by the \nAlabama legislature. But one of the reasons for the broad spectrum of \nsupport for General Pryor is his demonstrated ability to set aside his \npersonal views and follow the law. As you will undoubtedly hear during \nthe\n\n[[Page S9949]]\n\ncourse of the debate on his nomination, General Pryor is no shrinking \nviolet. He has been open and honest about his personal beliefs, which \nis what voters expect from the persons whom they elect to represent \nthem. Yet General Pryor has shown again and again that when the law \nconflicts with his personal and political beliefs, he follows the law.\n  For example, in 1997, the Alabama legislature enacted a ban on \npartial birth abortion that could have been interpreted to prohibit \nabortions before viability. General Pryor is avowedly pro-life, and has \nstrongly criticized Roe v. Wade, so one might very well have expected \nGeneral Pryor to vigorously enforce the statute. Instead, he instructed \nlaw enforcement officials to enforce the law only insofar as it was \nconsistent with the Supreme Court's precedents of Casey and Stenberg v. \nCarhart--despite pressure from many Republicans to enforce broader \nlanguage in the act.\n  Here's another example: I am sure that we will hear General Pryor's \ncall for modification or repeal of section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, \nwhich requires Department of Justice preclearance. By the way, General \nPryor is not alone in his opinion of section 5; the Democratic Attorney \nGeneral of Georgia, Thurbert Baker, has called section 5 an \n``extraordinary transgression of the normal prerogatives of the \nstates.'' Despite his opinion that section 5 is flawed, General Pryor \nsuccessfully defended before the Supreme Court several majority-\nminority voting districts approved under section 5 from a challenge by \na group of white Alabama voters. He also issued an opinion that the use \nof stickers to replace one candidate's name with another on a ballot \nrequired preclearance under section 5. In other words, he upheld a law \nthat he thinks is legally flawed and politically flawed. In other \nwords, this man will abide by the law in spite of his personal beliefs.\n  Yet another example involves General Pryor's interpretation of the \nFirst Amendment's Establishment Clause. In an effort to defeat \nchallenges to school prayer and the display of the Ten Commandments in \nthe Alabama Supreme Court, both the Governor and the Chief Justice \nurged General Pryor to argue that the Bill of Rights does not apply to \nthe States. General Pryor refused, despite his own deeply held Catholic \nfaith and personal support for both of these issues.\n  And here's my final example: General Pryor supported the right of \nteachers to serve as state legislators, despite intense pressure from \nhis own party, because he believed that the Alabama Constitution \nallowed them to do so. This man follows the law, regardless of his \npersonal beliefs. That is all you can ask of a judicial official and of \nsomebody who is nominated to a Circuit Court of Appeals in this \ncountry.\n  These examples, and I can give others, aptly illustrate why General \nPryor's nomination enjoys broad bipartisan support from persons like \nformer Democratic Alabama Attorney General Bill Baxley. He observed of \nGeneral Pryor:\n\n       In every difficult decision he has made, his actions were \n     supported by his interpretation of the law, without race, \n     gender, age, political power, wealth, community standing, or \n     any other competing interest affecting judgment.\n\n  That is pretty high praise coming from a Leading Democrat, one of his \npredecessors.\n  Mr. Baxley continued,\n\n       I often disagree, politically, with Bill Pryor. This does \n     not prevent me from making this recommendation because we \n     need fair minded, intelligent, industrious men and women, \n     possessed of impreccable integrity on the Eleventh Circuit. \n     Bill Pryor has these qualities in abundance. . . . There is \n     no better choice for this vacancy.\n\n  During the course of this debate, we will hear many things about Bill \nPryor. We will hear many one-sided half-truths perpetuated by the usual \nliberal interest groups who will stop at nothing to defeat President \nBush's judicial nominees. I want to make sure that this debate is about \nfairness, and about telling the full story of Bill Pryor's record.\n  We will hear that General Pryor is devout pro life Catholic who has \ncriticized Roe v. Wade, but the rest of the story is that many \nprominent prochoice Democrats, such as Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, \nArchibold Cox and former Stanford Dean John Hart Ely have also \ncriticized roe without anyone questioning their recognition of it as \nbinding Supreme Court precedent.\n  We will hear claims that General Pryor is against the disabled and \nelderly, but the real story is that General Pryor has done his duty as \nAttorney General to defend his State's budget from costly lawsuits. \nOther state attorneys general, including respected Democrats like Bob \nButterworth of Florida and now Senator Mark Pryor of Arkansas, have \ntaken the same positions as General Pryor in dfending their States. \nWhile the Supreme Court agreed with the attorneys general in these \ncases that the Eleventh Amendment protects States from monetary damages \nin Federal court, these rulings did not affect--and General Pryor did \nnot seek to weaken--other important methods of redressing \ndiscrimination, like actions for monetary damages under state law, \ninjunctive relief, or back pay.\n\n  We will hear claims that General Pryor's criticisms of Section 5 of \nthe Voting Rights Act indicate a lack of commitment to civil rights. \nThat is pure and simple, unmitigated bunk. But the real story is that \nGeneral Pryor has a solid record of commitment to civil rights, which \nincludes defending majority-minority voting districts, leading the \nbattle to abolish the Alabama Constitution's prohibition on interracial \nmarriage, and working with the Clinton Administration's Justice \nDepartment to prosecute the former Ku Klux Klansmen who perpetrated the \nbombing of Birmingham's 16th Street Baptist Church, which resulted in \nthe deaths of four little girls in 1963.\n  We will no doubt hear other claims during the course of this debate \ndistorting General Pryor's record or presenting only partial truths. I \nurge my colleagues to judge this nominee on his record, not on the \ndistortions we too often hear about President Bush's nominees. He will \nmake a fine addition to the Eleventh Circuit.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letters to which I have referred be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    William H.

I take this unusual opportunity to urge you to \n     appoint him.\n       Attorney General Pryor will make a first-class Judge \n     because he is a first-class lawyer and is a first-class \n     public official. He is a person, in my opinion, who will \n     uphold the law without fear or favor. I believe all races and \n     colors will get a fair shake when their cases come before \n     him. As Attorney General for Alabama during the past six (6) \n     years, he has been fair to all people.\n       For your information, I am a member of the Democratic \n     National Committee and, of course, Mr. Pryor is Republican, \n     but these are only party labels. I am persuaded that in Mr. \n     Pryor's eyes, Justice has only one label--Justice.\n       I am satisfied that if you appoint Mr. Pryor to the Bench, \n     and he is confirmed by the Senate, he will be a credit to the \n     Judiciary and will be a guardian for justice. I urge you to \n     appoint Mr. Pryor to this important court.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Joe L.

George W. Bush,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: I have had the good fortune to \n     recommend a variety of people for a variety of positions. \n     Never have I been more honored or confident about a \n     recommendation than I am as I write on behalf of my dear \n     friend and Alabama Attorney General, Bill Pryor.\n       In November of 2000, both you and I were on the ballot. As \n     I stood for reelection for my second term on the Alabama \n     Court of Criminal Appeals, I became the only statewide \n     Democrat to survive the 2000 election. Hence, I write, not \n     only as the only statewide Democrat to be elected in 2000, \n     not only as a member of the Court which reviews the greatest \n     portion of General Pryor's work, but also as a child advocate \n     who has labored\n\n[[Page S9950]]\n\n     shoulder to shoulder with General Pryor in the political \n     arena on behalf of Alabama's children. It is for these \n     reasons and more that I am indeed honored to recommend \n     General Pryor for nomination to the 11th Circuit Court of \n     Appeals.\n       Bill Pryor is an outstanding attorney general and is one of \n     the most righteous elected officials in this state. He \n     possesses two of the most important attributes of a judge; \n     unquestionable integrity and a strong internal moral compass. \n     Whether he is reviewing hundreds of appellate briefs to \n     ensure the quality of the work his assistants submit to this \n     court, whether he is preparing to argue one of my cases to \n     the United States Supreme Court. Whether he is using his \n     considerable influence to encourage Alabama legislators to \n     make children a top priority, or whether he is in his weekly \n     tutoring session with an ``at-risk'' child, Bill Pryor is \n     proving that he is a true public servant.\n       Bill Pryor is exceedingly bright, and a lawyer's lawyer. He \n     is as dedicated to the ``Rule of Law'' as anyone I know. I \n     have never known another attorney general who loved being the \n     ``people's lawyer'' more than Bill Pryor. Though we may \n     disagree on an issue, I am always confident that his position \n     is the product of complete intellectual honesty. He loves the \n     mental challenge presented by a complex case, yet he never \n     fails to remember that each case impacts people's lives.\n       A sportscaster once said about a former Atlanta Braves \n     player, Terry Pendleton, ``[H]e does the right thing, because \n     it is the right thing to do.'' That, Mr. President, perfectly \n     describes Bill Pryor. Hence, it is my profound honor to urge \n     you to nominate a great Alabamian, General Bill Pryor, to the \n     11th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n       I would be honored to assist you in any way in making \n     General Pryor's nomination and confirmation a reality. With \n     best regards, I remain,\n           Most Sincerely,\n                                                    Sue Bell Cobb,\n     Judge.\n                                  ____\n\n                                    Congress of the United States,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 10, 2003.\n     Hon. Jeff Sessions,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sessions: Thank you for all of your kindness \n     during the transition period. You and the rest of the Alabama \n     Delegation have made me feel very welcome\n       As you know, several pending vacancies on the Alabama \n     federal bench are attracting attention back home. I \n     understand that the President may be considering Attorney \n     General Bill Pryor for a seat on the Eleventh Circuit. I have \n     the utmost respect for my friend Attorney General Pryor and I \n     believe if he is selected, Alabama will be proud of his \n     service.\n       In the near future, as openings occur on the District \n     Court, I encourage you to view this as an opportunity to \n     diversify the federal bench. Unfortunately only two African \n     Americans have ever served as federal district judges in \n     Alabama. I believe that a review of the most qualified \n     judicial candidates will inevitably lead to the inclusion of \n     black attorneys. I strongly encourage you to consider \n     recommending for nomination several outstanding black \n     attorneys who have distinguished themselves. I know you would \n     agree that Alabama deserves a federal bench that looks like \n     Alabama.\n       Thank you very much for your attention to this matter. I \n     look forward to working together over the coming months and \n     years.\n           Best wishes,\n                                                      Artur Davis,\n     Member of Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n                                        Baxley, Dillard, Dauphin &\n\n\n                                   McKnight, Attorneys at Law,\n\n                                    Birmingham, AL, April 8, 2003.\n     Hon. Jeff Sessions,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sessions: Media reports confirm that Alabama's \n     Attorney General, Bill Pryor, has been nominated to fill the \n     vacancy which now exists on the Eleventh Circuit.\n       As you well know, I too am a former Attorney General of our \n     great state. I therefore feel comfortable assessing Bill \n     Pryor's service in that elected office, as well as his \n     fitness to serve the United States as a Circuit Judge. As a \n     Democrat, I am certain I have a more unbiased frame of \n     reference than many. As a lawyer with a diverse practice in \n     Alabama--one which has seen me aligned with him on some \n     occasions and against him on others--I have a better basis \n     than most for gauging his character, fitness and ability.\n       Bill Pryor is a completely independent man of unwavering \n     convictions. He courageously takes positions dictated by his \n     conscience and does so based upon a truly intellectual sense \n     of right and wrong. In this regard, his willingness to be \n     guided by pure interpretations of the law superbly qualifies \n     him for the federal bench. He has never, to my knowledge, \n     bowed to any pressure from constituents or special interest \n     groups. In every difficult decision he has made, his actions \n     were supported by his interpretation of the law, without \n     race, gender, age, political power, wealth, community \n     standing, or any other competing interest affecting his \n     judgment. This is a rare accomplishment, and the core reason \n     for this, my highest and best recommendation.\n       I often disagree, politically, with Bill Pryor. This does \n     not prevent me from making this recommendation because we \n     need fair minded, intelligent, industrious men and women, \n     possessed of impeccable integrity, on the Eleventh Circuit. \n     Bill Pryor has these qualities in abundance. I am certain he \n     will be guided completely by his conscience and afford a \n     balanced analysis to every case before him, without unfair \n     advantage to any litigant. There is no better choice for this \n     vacancy.\n           Respectfully yours,\n     William J. Baxley.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                Department of Law,\n\n\n                                             State of Georgia,\n\n                                                   March 31, 2003.\n     Hon. Richard Shelby,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jeff Sessions,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: I have had the great pleasure of knowing and \n     working with Bill Pryor over the past five years. Through the \n     National Association of Attorneys General, Bill and I have \n     worked together on matters of mutual concern to Georgia and \n     Alabama. During that time, Bill has distinguished himself \n     time and again with the legal acumen that he brings to issues \n     of national or regional concern as well as with his \n     commitment to furthering the prospects of good and responsive \n     government.\n       During is tenure as Attorney General, Bill has made \n     combating white-collar crime and public corruption one of the \n     centerpieces of his service to the people of Alabama. He \n     joined the efforts of Attorneys General around the country in \n     fighting the rising tide of identity theft, pushing through \n     legislation in the Alabama legislature making identity theft \n     a felony in Alabama. Bill has fought to keep law enforcement \n     in Alabama armed with appropriate laws to protect Alabama's \n     citizens, pushing for tough money laundering provisions and \n     stiff penalties for trafficking in date rape drugs.\n       Time and again as Attorney General, Bill has taken on \n     public corruption cases in Alabama, regardless of how well-\n     connected the defendant many be, to ensure that the public \n     trust is upheld and the public's confidence in government is \n     well-founded. He has worked with industry groups and the \n     Better Business Bureau to crack down on unscrupulous \n     contractors who victimized many of Alabama's more vulnerable \n     citizens.\n       From the time that he clerked with the late Judge Wisdom of \n     the 5th Circuit to the present, though, the most critical \n     asset that Bill Pryor has brought to the practice of law is \n     his zeal to do what he thinks is right. He has always done \n     what he thought was best for the people of Alabama. \n     Recognizing a wrong that had gone on far too long, he took \n     the opportunity of his inaugural address to call on an end to \n     the ban on inter-racial marriages in Alabama law. Concerned \n     about at-risk kids in Alabama schools, he formed Mentor \n     Alabama, a program designed to pair volunteer mentors with \n     students who needed a role model and an attentive ear to the \n     problems facing them on a daily basis.\n       These are just a few of the qualities that I believe will \n     make Bill Pryor an excellent candidate for a slot on the 11th \n     Circuit Court of Appeals. My only regret is that I will no \n     longer have Bill as a fellow Attorney General fighting for \n     what is right, but I know that his work on the bench will \n     continue to serve as an example of how the public trust \n     should be upheld.\n           Sincerely,\n     Thurbert E.

Leahy,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Sirs: Please accept this as my full support and \n     endorsement of Alabama's Attorney General Bill Pryor to the \n     United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit.\n       I am a black member of the Alabama House of Representatives \n     having served for 28 years. During my time of service in the \n     Alabama House of Representatives I have led most of the \n     fights for civil rights of blacks, women, lesbians and gays \n     and other minorities.\n       Consider Bill Pryor as a moderate on the race issue:\n       1. From 1998 to 2000, Bill Pryor sided with the NAACP \n     against a white Republican lawsuit that challenged the \n     districts for the Legislature. Pryor fought the case all the \n     way to the U.S. Supreme Court and won a unanimous ruling in \n     Sinkfield v. Kelley, 531 U.S. 28 (2000). The lawsuit was \n     filed by Attorney Mark Montiel, a white Republican, and the \n     3-judge district court ruled 2 to 1 in favor of Montiel. Two \n     Republicans (Cox and Albritton) ruled in favor of Montiel \n     while Judge Myron Thompson (a black Democrat) agreed with \n     Pryor that Montiel's white clients had no standing to \n     challenge black districts in which the whites did not live.\n\n[[Page S9951]]\n\n       2. In 2001 and 2002, Bill Pryor sided with the Legislature \n     when it redrew districts for Congress, the Legislature, and \n     State Board of Education. Mark Montiel filed lawsuits in \n     federal court (Montiel v. Davis) challenging the black \n     districts as racial gerrymanders. Pryor won every lawsuit. \n     Pryor came under heavy pressure from other white Republicans \n     in Alabama for fighting to protect black Legislative seats.\n       3. Bill Pryor worked with U.S. Attorney Doug Jones to \n     prosecute KKK murderers Blanton and Cherry for the September \n     14, 1963, bombing of Sixteenth Street Baptist Church that \n     killed four little girls. Bill Pryor personally argued to \n     uphold Blanton's conviction before the Alabama Court of \n     Criminal Appeals on May 20, 2003.\n       4. Bill Pryor drafted the law (Ala. Code Sec. 12-25-\n     2(a)(2)) that created the Alabama Sentencing Commission with \n     the stated purpose of ending racial disparities in criminal \n     punishments.\n       5. In 2000, Bill Pryor started Mentor Alabama--a program to \n     recruit positive adult role models for thousands of at-risk \n     youth which were 99% black. For the last three years, Bill \n     Pryor has worked every week as a reading tutor for black \n     children in a Montgomery public school.\n       6. In 2002, I introduced a bill in the Alabama Legislature \n     to amend the Alabama Constitution repealing Alabama's racist \n     ban on interracial marriage. Every prominent white political \n     leader in Alabama (both Republican and Democrat) opposed my \n     bill or remained silent except Bill Pryor who openly and \n     publicly asked the white and black citizens of Alabama to \n     vote and repeal such racist law. It was passed with a slim \n     majority among the voters and Bill Pryor later successfully \n     defended that repeal when the leader of a racist group called \n     the ``Confederate Heritage'' sued the State to challenge it.\n       7. I sponsored HB534 this Legislative Session establishing \n     cross burning as a felony. Said bill passed the Alabama House \n     of Representatives on May 15th 2003. That bill was written by \n     Bill Pryor and he was the only white leader in Alabama that \n     openly and publicly supported it.\n       Finally, as one of the key civil rights leaders in Alabama \n     who has participated in basically every major civil rights \n     demonstration in America, who has been arrested for civil \n     rights causes on many occasions, as one who was a field staff \n     member of Dr. Martin Luther King's SCLC, as one who has been \n     brutally beaten by vicious police officers for participating \n     in civil rights marches and demonstrations, as one who has \n     had crosses burned in his front yard by the KKK and other \n     hate groups, as one who has lived under constant threats day \n     in and day out because of his stand fighting for the rights \n     of blacks and other minorities, I request your swift \n     confirmation of Bill Pryor to the 11th Circuit because of his \n     constant efforts to help the causes of blacks in Alabama.\n       Thanks for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Alvin Holmes,\n     State Representative.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  Herc Levine,\n\n                                     Birmingham, AL, June 5, 2003.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Hatch: As an active and proud member of the \n     Birmingham Jewish Community, I was disappointed by the \n     decision of the National Council of Jewish Women and the \n     Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism to oppose the \n     nomination of Attorney General Bill Pryor to the 11th Circuit \n     Court of Appeals bench. While I doubt that these groups have \n     taken the time to sit down and talk with Attorney General \n     Pryor, I am proud to say that he has my support and the \n     support of many in the Alabama Jewish Community because of \n     his personal integrity and commitment to insure that all of \n     our citizens are treated fairly and receive equal justice \n     under the law. He has been a true friend to the Alabama \n     Jewish Community on many important issues.\n       Attorney General Pryor has a distinguished career as a \n     public servant, practicing attorney and law professor, and is \n     highly qualified to serve on the Federal bench. He has a well \n     deserved reputation for fairness and competency that cuts \n     across party lines and which has resulted in overwhelming \n     support from Alabamians of all political parties and segments \n     of our society. His distinguished record as Attorney General \n     affirms my belief that he will serve with great distinction \n     as a Federal judge.\n           Very truly yours,\n     Herc Levine.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/25/senate-section/article/S9951-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9951-S9953]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         FAIRNESS IN THE CONSIDERATION OF JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, on Wednesday the Judiciary Committee \nfavorably reported to the full Senate the nomination of Alabama \nAttorney General William Pryor for the Eleventh Circuit Court of \nAppeals. It has been more than 6 weeks since General Pryor's \nconfirmation hearing, and I am pleased that the full Senate will now \nhave the opportunity to consider his nomination.\n  Nevertheless, we will no doubt hear over the course of this debate \nmany allegations from some of our Democratic colleagues as to why they \nbelieve that Bill Pryor's nomination does not deserve an up or down \nvote by the full Senate. I want to make perfectly clear right now that \nthere is no valid reason to delay this body's consideration of the \nPryor nomination.\n  All we ask is that there be an up-or-down vote. Vote against him if \nyou don't like the man personally--although there is little room to \nvote against him because of his record.\n  Despite these efforts by committee Democrats to erect a procedural \nroadblock to voting on the Pryor nomination in spite of fact that I had \nset five markups, I finally was able to have a markup on his \nnomination. They wanted to revive a debate over the interpretation of \ncommittee rule IV. This rule, entitled ``Bringing a Matter to a Vote'', \nwas clearly intended to serve as a tool by which a determined majority \nof the committee could force a recalcitrant chairman to bring a matter \nto vote. In fact, the rule provides, ``The Chairman shall entertain a \nnon-debatable motion to bring a matter before the Committee to a \nvote.''\n  Clearly, it was a rule by which you could force a chairman to have a \nvote. All you had to do was get a majority of the Senators on the \ncommittee with one from the minority side and you could force a \nchairman to call for a vote.\n  On Wednesday there was no motion to bring the matter before the \ncommittee to a vote. In fact, there was an objection to voting, which I \noverruled. Thus, on its face, rule IV was inapplicable to the Pryor \nnomination.\n  Despite claims to the contrary, there has been no inconsistency in my \ninterpretation of this rule. First of all, I have checked with two \nParliamentarians, and both said I could interpret the rule. I believe I \nhave interpreted it correctly.\n  During the Clinton administration, in an effort to prevent the defeat \nin committee of a controversial Justice Department nominee, I was \nchairman and I wanted to bring the nomination to a vote. We had enough \nvotes to defeat the nominee in committee. It would have been a 9-9 tie, \nand the nominee would have gone down to defeat. The Democrats then \nstarted to filibuster their own nominee. In deference to them, I chose \nnot to exercise the inherent powers I and all committee chairmen have \nto bring a matter to a vote.\n  I have been condemned for that ever since as though I acknowledged \nthat you should just have filibusters in the committee any time you \nwant to. President Clinton ultimately made a recess appointment of \ntheir nominee. In retrospect, my reliance on rule IV to accomplish this \nwas admittedly not the best course of action. I was wrong to say they \ncould filibuster. But I was trying to be gracious to my colleagues on \nthe other side who clearly did not want to vote on the record defeating \ntheir nominee. Since I respected and liked the nominee himself, but not \nfor the particular position he was nominated for, I would have \nsupported him for any other position. And I had good reason to be \nagainst him for this position. I agreed to allow their filibuster to \ncause me to pull down his nomination rather than to have a vote that \nwould have been embarrassing to him and to the Democrats. And that is \nwhy they were filibustering their own nominee. Now they cite that as \nthe reason why I am wrong here. But there is no reason for that.\n\n  I nevertheless believed then, and I do now, that I had the power to \nbring that matter to a vote, and that I used the discretion of the \nchairman to decide not to do so. It was a matter of showing decency and \nkindness to my colleagues on the other side and to the nominee so he \nwould not have a vote that defeated him in committee.\n  The fact of the matter is I don't believe there should be filibusters \nin the Judiciary Committee. We have had at least two instances now \nwhere my colleagues on the other side have tried to filibuster. In \naddition, the Democrats now complain they weren't given enough time to \ndo an investigation. We have given them all kinds of time to do an \ninvestigation. Since their investigation was proving to be fruitless \nbecause they couldn't find one thing to criticize Attorney General \nPryor on, they wanted to have a fishing expedition to do further \ninvestigation.\n\n[[Page S9952]]\n\n  I want to make clear that at no time did I agree to modify my \ninterpretation of rule IV in connection with the Cook, Roberts, or \nSutton nominations, which is the last context in which this debate \narose. I did agree to bring Roberts back in to the committee and have \none more day of hearing. I did not agree to bring Cook back or Sutton \nback. But at no time did I agree my interpretation of rule IV which I \nmade at that time was in error. It certainly was not.\n  I can't imagine any committee chairman agreeing to give up his or her \nright to call for a vote in committee after there has been a sufficient \ndebate. No chairman is going to give up that right because that means \nthe minority could control the committee any time they wanted to. The \nargument which they make on this is ridiculous.\n  But, be that as may, at no time did I agree to modify my \ninterpretation of rule IV in connection with the Cook, Roberts, or \nSutton nominations, which is the last context in which this debate \narose. To have adopted the interpretation my Democratic colleagues \nadvanced both then and now would have constituted an unprecedented \ncurtailment of the chairman's inherent authority to bring a matter to \nvote, and would have given the authority to control the committee to \nthe minority. I don't think they would want that when they are in the \nmajority, and I certainly don't want it now that we are in the \nmajority. No other chairman I know of who has any brains at all would \nhave allowed that type of interpretation. Yet you hear all of the \nscreaming and shouting that they were mistreated.\n  In short, there was no violation of committee rules or process in \nbringing the Pryor nomination to a vote on Wednesday, and any argument \nto the contrary is merely a last-ditch effort to prevent the full \nSenate from considering that nomination.\n  Another complaint we will hear is there was an open investigation \ninto General Pryor's activities on behalf of the Republican Attorneys \nGeneral Association at the time of the vote. Here are the facts:\n  When our Democratic colleagues brought to our attention documents \nthey obtained pertaining to RAGA, we joined with them to conduct a \nbipartisan investigation to determine the authenticity of the \ndocuments, whether they reflected any wrongdoing on the part of General \nPryor. Committee staff interviewed several witnesses in connection with \nthis investigation, with two notable exceptions. First, the Democrats' \nsource of these documents has not answered key questions about when the \ndocuments were drafted, who drafted them, and who has had access to \nthem. Second, Democratic staff asked General Pryor no questions about \nthe documents, despite his willingness to answer whatever questions \nthey may have had.\n  Nevertheless, our Democratic colleagues have insisted on pressing \nforward with an investigation, over Republican objection, based on \nunauthenticated and unreliable documents provided to them by a source \nwho refuses to talk to Republican staff, whose former employer stated \nunder oath that she stole the documents, and who has yet to disclose \nthe details of when and how she first provided the documents to \nDemocratic staff.\n  Some on our side wanted the committee to conduct an investigation of \nDemocratic staff. I am certainly not going to do that. Frankly, \nDemocratic staff, I think, have an obligation if they get documents to \nlook at them and to present them to us. However, these documents \nweren't presented to us until the last minute.\n  Frankly, it is just another pattern of practice of delaying as long \nas they can and making it miserable for people like Bill Pryor to get a \nvote up or down. All we want is a vote up and down.\n  Democratic staffers have interviewed 20 persons but have found \nnothing inconsistent with General Pryor's testimony. There is simply \nnothing to indicate General Pryor was anything less than truthful about \nthe material facts of his participation in the Republican Attorneys \nGeneral Association. What is going on here is a classic game of \n``beltway gotcha.'' That is no reason to delay consideration of General \nPryor's nomination.\n  We even had members say we want to have another hearing for General \nPryor after all that we have had. His was one of the longest hearings I \ncan recall having in my 27 years on the Judiciary Committee. It was a \nvery difficult hearing with a lot of moaning and groaning and screaming \nand shouting. Frankly, it was one in which I don't think he was treated \nas fairly as he should have been treated, nor do I think he has been \ntreated fairly since. I think there are reasons for that. One of them \nis he is so forthright about his testimony and that he has conservative \nbeliefs that I think some on the other side are afraid that even though \nhis whole record is one of following the law, he might not follow the \nlaw if he gets on the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals--even though he \nis an honest man and said he will follow the law regardless of his \npersonal viewpoint.\n  That is all you can ask of these people. When you have a person of \nthe integrity and the ability and the capacity of William Pryor who \nsays he will follow the law, you had better believe it, in my opinion. \nIf we get to the point where we have to second-guess people who have an \nimpeccably honest reputation around here, it is going to get to where \nnobody who has any views is going to be able to serve on the Federal \ncourts of this land. That is wrong.\n  I felt like I needed to come here today and say some of these things, \nbecause in all honesty I think we have had too many of these type of \nridiculous battles in the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  I am trying to bring some decency to the committee. I have tried to \nwork as closely with my colleagues who differ with us on our side as I \npossibly can, and I am going to continue to do that, and try to work in \na decent, honorable, good way with my colleagues. But I do personally \nresent some of the accusations that have been made, some of the \nmischaracterizations that have been made, some of the things that have \nbeen done to besmirch some of these excellent people whom the President \nof the United States has nominated, and a continuation of filibustering \non the floor of the Senate.\n  Having said that, I am going to conclude with these remarks: Never in \nthe history of the Senate--before Miguel Estrada, Priscilla Owen; and \nnow there is some indication there is going to be a filibuster of \nWilliam Pryor, the attorney general of the State of Alabama--never has \nthere been a filibuster, a true filibuster against anyone.\n  Now, I thought--and I have said it on the floor--I thought there was \na filibuster of the Fortas nomination, but I was corrected by none \nother than the Senator who led the fight against Fortas--and that was \nRobert Griffin of Michigan--in a Republican policy meeting, where he \nsaid: I only need to correct Senator Hatch on one statement that he \nmade; and that is, that having led the fight against Fortas--for a \nvariety of what he believed were appropriate reasons; and apparently a \nmajority of the Senate did--he said: We were never filibustering Abe \nFortas. And the reason we were not is because we had the votes to \ndefeat him up and down.\n  But the Democrats called for a cloture vote, which was narrowly won \nby Fortas, with 12 Members absent at the time, many of whom would have \nvoted against Abe Fortas.\n  So never in the history of this body has there been a filibuster \nagainst any Federal judicial nominees until this year. And now we have \ntwo--and a potential of three. And I hope they are not going to \nfilibuster Kuhl. And I hope they are not going to filibuster Holmes. \nAnd I hope they are not going to filibuster Judge Pickering when he \ncomes out of the committee, and others.\n  It is a dangerous thing to do. It is a wrong thing to do. It flies in \nthe face of senatorial history. In the end, this body is going to be \nvery saddened if that is the way all of these nominations wind up, \nwithout an up-and-down vote on the floor of the Senate.\n  What is wrong with having up-and-down votes on the floor of the \nSenate for these nominees? Whether it is a Democrat President or a \nRepublican President, once they are brought to the Senate floor, they \ndeserve an up-and-down vote. That is all we are asking for.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I am not going to speak at any great \nlength regarding the statement made by my\n\n[[Page S9953]]\n\nfriend, the distinguished senior Senator from Utah, regarding this \nparticular judge, Judge Pryor. I don't know much about him, but I am \nsure in the near future we will learn more about him because, as \nindicated by my distinguished friend from Utah, the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, the nomination, at the time of the hearing, was \nvery disputed and it took a long time. So I am sure I will learn more \nabout this man.\n  But the one statement I want to comment on, made by my friend from \nUtah, is that the Democrats are looking for ways to oppose President \nBush's judicial appointments.\n  Madam President, there is an order in effect that on Monday night we \nwill vote on two judges, a man by the name of Earl Leroy Yeakel of \nTexas and a woman by the name of Kathleen Cardone of Texas, both to be \nFederal District Judges for the United States. Both of those judges \nwill be approved by large margins.\n  These 2 judges will bring the total to 140 judges who will have been \napproved by this Senate during the administration of this President--\n140. How many have we turned down? How many have the Democrats--who, as \nmy friend indicated, are looking for ways to oppose President Bush's \njudicial nominees--turned down? We have turned down two. The count on \nMonday night will be 140 to 2.\n  Does it mean that it has to be every judge he gives us? I think not. \nAny reasonable person, looking at these numbers, would acknowledge \nthere has been no witch hunt by the Democrats. Madam President, 140 to \n2 is a pretty good average.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/25/senate-section/article/S9953-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9953]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, today, this afternoon, here in the Senate, \nI stand, for lack of a better description, with a sad heart. I am \nsorrowful.\n  Almost every day we see news reports about casualties sustained by \nour brave men and women in Iraq. In the last 2 days we have lost five \nsoldiers. These reports are always troubling, but when they involve \nanother young person from my State, they really hit home.\n  Josh Byers of Sparks, NV, was the kind of young man any of us would \nbe proud to call son. He graduated from Reed High School in Sparks/\nReno, NV. Kids come from both Sparks and Reno to go to Reed High \nSchool.\n  For many years, the Nevada congressional delegation has been holding \nan event that was first started by Senator Hecht, who was a Senator \nfrom Nevada. And this Senator--we started holding what we call Academy \nNight where we have a meeting in Reno and one in Las Vegas. We bring \nyoung men and young women from Nevada who are now in the academies back \nto Nevada. We have music, and we have presentations made by all the \nacademies, including the Merchant Marine Academy, about what there is \nat the academies for these high school students.\n  They draw large crowds. Hundreds and hundreds of people come to these \nevents in Reno and Las Vegas. And now Senator Hecht and I don't do it \nalone; now the entire congressional delegation joins us: Senator Ensign \nand I, Congressman Gibbons, Congressman Porter, and Congresswoman \nBerkley. These are wonderful occasions.\n  Josh Byers of Sparks, NV, came more than 1 year. He loved Academy \nNight. He wanted to go to one of our military academies. He worked \nhard. He was student body president at Reed High School. He was \nnominated to the Naval Academy by me. He was nominated to the U.S. \nMilitary Academy at West Point by Senator Bryan.\n  Josh's best friend, Beau Elsfelder, in being interviewed by the press \nlast night, referred to Josh as ``The Man.'' That is how he referred to \nhim. He was an A student. As I indicated, he was president of the \nstudent body. They had a military cadet unit there. He was the leader \nof that unit.\n  He always told his friends he wanted to be an officer in the Army or \nthe Navy. The entire Nevada delegation was supportive of this dream.\n  As I indicated, I nominated him to the Naval Academy. Senator Bryan \nnominated him to West Point where he graduated. He went on to become a \ncompany commander in the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment. This past April \nhe was shipped off to Iraq to defend our country and our interests in \nthat part of the world. A little more than 24 hours ago he was riding \nin a vehicle. Two men hiding beside the road triggered an explosive \ndevice, killing him and injuring seven other comrades of Josh's.\n  Tragically, Josh's mother, on this same date he was killed, was \nobserving her birthday. But mothers, as they are, seem to know. Even \nbefore the tragic news about her son she had worried about him a lot, \nwas extremely worried this day. His parents are wonderful people. His \nfather came to Nevada to set up a church. They left northern Nevada and \nwent back to South Carolina to set up a church. His parents just \narrived back in this country on the day he was killed, coming back from \nGuam where they are missionaries.\n  To show you the outstanding young man Josh was, you only need to look \nat what his high school counselor Bob White said. He said:\n\n       He's the second one we have lost in Iraq.\n\n  White, who kept a picture of Josh on his office bulletin board, \nremembered his second day on the job at Reed High School as a new \ncounselor, during the 1990-91 school year when he met a junior who \nwanted to attend a military academy. It was Josh Byers. White said:\n\n       He came into the office and introduced himself. He said, \n     ``My goal is to go to an academy. I'm a junior. I need your \n     help.''\n\n  White said Josh Byers, as a senior, was accepted into all three major \nmilitary academies, Army, Navy, and Air Force. I don't know who \nnominated him to the Air Force. Back then it could have been Senator \nEnsign when he was in the House. I really don't know who it was. We \nknow who nominated him to the Army and Navy.\n  White said Josh Byers selected West Point because he thought its \nrules of conduct were the strictest. White said:\n\n       He said, ``Even though I want to go into the Navy, I'm \n     going into the Army. Their honor code is better.''\n\n  Before he left to go to Iraq and after he was there, Josh tried to \ncomfort his mother by telling her the worst fighting was over and it \nwould be finished by the time he got to Iraq. But as she learned, as we \nlearn almost every day from the news, the worst is not over. In fact, \nJosh kept saying:\n\n       Mom, the worst will be over when I get there. We will be \n     doing peacekeeping, setting up the government and providing \n     aid to the people of Iraq.\n\n  Our young men and women in Iraq are still dying almost every day. My \noffice spoke to Mrs. Byers today. I called and the phone was tied up. I \nwas not able to do that. I wanted to give these remarks prior to the \nSenate recessing. I left a message for the parents saying I was going \nto give a speech on the Senate floor today. There is nothing I can do, \nthat we can do, to erase the loss of the parents, but the one thing we \ncan do is never forget the sacrifice made by Josh Byers. I know \neveryone in the Senate family, whether it is our Chaplain or the \nindividual Senators, offers our condolences for Josh's widow, his \nparents, and the entire family.\n  I know we all join in hoping for the safe return of the other 150,000 \nmen and women from America who serve in Iraq today. We wish their safe \nreturn, and offer our condolences once again to the Byers family.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The third is on its \nway, maybe fourth, fifth, and sixth. Stopping, through a filibuster, \nanybody, even one judge, is unacceptable. It has never been done \nbefore, especially judges for the circuit court of appeals. But it has \nnever been done even for district court judges and certainly not for \nSupreme Court judges.\n  All we want is an up-or-down vote on these people. That is all we \nwant. If they are defeated, we can live with it. If they pass, I hope \nthe other side can live with that. But I don't think it is too much to \nask for the President's nominees who are brought to the floor of the \nSenate to have an up-or-down vote. I don't think that is too much to \nask, and I don't think the American people believe that is too much to \nask.\n\n[[Page S9954]]\n\nEven the filibuster of one nominee is unacceptable because that means \nyou are not allowing the President to have an up-or-down vote if \nsomebody is brought to the floor of the Senate.\n  I am concerned that we will soon see the number of judges who are \ndenied an up-or-down vote escalate from two to three to four to five to \nsix, maybe more. Is that an acceptable number of judges who do not \ndeserve an up-or-down vote? Of course not. Not one should be denied an \nup-or-down vote, once they are brought to the floor of the Senate. I \nbelieve that is true.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/25/senate-section/article/S9954-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9954]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

Mr. President, April 10, 2003, brought a new educational \nmilestone to my State.\n  On that date, Alaska students from one of the most rural school \ndistricts in our Nation were the first Alaskans to take part in a live \nhook-up with astronauts in space.\n  Using distance learning technology, youngsters from my States \nSouthwest Region School District spoke to the three-member crew of the \nInternational Space Station as astronauts orbited the Earth.\n  These students were participating in NASA's Teaching From Space \nProgram, which includes science, mat, and geography instruction, and \nfeatures a live video question-and-answer session with the astronauts \naboard the space station.\n  This session complemented a 6 week educational program, developed by \nour Challenger Learning Center in Kenai, which was included in the \ncurriculum of the Southwest Region School District.\n  While the Teaching From Space Program has provided unique and \nmotivating educational experiences to students across our country for \nmany years, only recently were Alaska schools able to take advantage of \nthe NASA program.\n  Until a few short months ago, no schools in rural Alaska had \ntechnology to allow teachers and students to communicate via video with \nothers outside their villages.\n  Now that is changing, as some schools use distance learning \ntechnology to virtually bring new teachers and subjects into their \nclassrooms.\n  The Southwest Region School District, one of the first in Alaska to \ninstall distance learning technology, is located on the southern coast \nof the Bering Sea, 350 miles southwest of Anchorage.\n  Eight villages are served by this school district, only one of which \nis accessible by road. The others are up to 120 miles from the school \ndistrict's headquarters in Dillingham and may only be reached by air in \nwinter. Some are accessible by river during summer months when, of \ncourse, our schools are closed.\n  The 779 students in the school district are primarily Yu'pik Eskimos. \nMost non-Native villagers in this region are employed as teachers.\n  During their 20-minute conversation with the International Space \nStation crew, students at Manokotak school asked questions about \ngeography and space on behalf of their fellow students throughout the \ndistrict. They watched as U.S. astronauts Ken Bowersox and Don Pettit \nand Russian cosmonaut Nikolai Budarin, floating inside the space \nstation, answered their questions.\n  There was a special surprise, when the students learned that Alaska's \nown NASA astronaut, Bill Oefelein, who hails from Anchorage, flew from \nHouston to Manokotak to be with the students on their special day.\n  Many individuals and organizations contributed to the success of this \neducational achievement. This was a collaborative effort achievement. \nThis was a collaborative effort of NASA, the Southwest Region School \nDistrict, the Challenger Learning Center, and GCI.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all the individuals names \nbe printed in the Record following my remarks.\n\n       Sean O'Keefe, NASA Administrator.\n       Lieutenant William Oefelein, USN, NASA astronaut: flew to \n     Manokotak to be on-site with the students.\n       Gwendolyn Brown, NASA: coordinated public affairs for the \n     event.\n       Cindy McArthur, NASA: guided Manokotak teachers through the \n     Teaching from Space program.\n       Kelly McCormick, NASA: guided Manokotak teachers through \n     the Teaching from Space program.\n       Scott Anderson, NASA: guided Manokotak teachers through the \n     Teaching from Space program.\n       Robin Hart, NASA: guided Manokotak teachers through the \n     Teaching from Space program.\n       Randy Cash, NASA: managed the audio portion of the program.\n       Glenn Peterson, NASA: Mission Control Specialist.\n       Superintendent Mark Hiratsuka, Southwest Region School \n     District: secured approvals for the program.\n       Tim Whaling, Southwest Region School District: coordinated \n     the educational curriculum for the program.\n       Karen Swenson, Southwest Region School District: secured \n     approvals for the program.\n       Steve Noonkesser, Southwest Region School District: managed \n     the school district's technology and coordination with GCI.\n       David Piazza, Southwest Region School District: managed the \n     school district's technology.\n       Principal David Legg, Manokotak School: secured facilities \n     and staff for the program.\n       Kirk Kofford, Manokotak School: prepared students for the \n     NASA link up and taught the NASA distance learning \n     curriculum.\n       Dana Bartman, Manokotak School: prepared students for the \n     link-up.\n       Nate Preston, Manokotak School: coordinated photography and \n     publishing for the program.\n       Steve Horn, Challenger Learning Center of Alaska: secured \n     educational curriculum for the school district.\n       Jamie Meyers, Challenger Learning Center of Alaska: \n     coordinated curriculum between the center and the school \n     district.\n       Martin Cary, GCI: secured telecommunications resources and \n     personnel to link NASA and the school district.\n       Greg Dutton, GCI-SchoolAccess: managed GCI's participation.\n       David Morris, GCI: managed public affairs for the program.\n       Anna Sattler, GCI: coordinated communication between \n     participants.\n       Tom Elmore, GCI: coordinated the video teleconference \n     connection with school district sites.\n       Chad Parker, GCI: coordinated technology needs.\n       Brian Lichner, GCI: managed the NASA TV downlink in \n     Anchorage.\n       Rob Knorr, GCI: managed the NASA TV downlink in Juneau.\n       Greg Farmer, GCI: managed the NASA TV feed in Juneau.\n       Doug Keil, GCI: connected the NASA TV feed in Anchorage to \n     GCI-SchoolAccess.\n       Mark Dinneen, GCI: managed government relations for the \n     program.\n       John Raffetto, Infotech Strategies: managed communication \n     between all participants.\n       Nicole Angarella, Infotech Strategies: coordinated \n     logistics and on-site materials.\n       Tracy Krughoff, Infotech Strategies: assisted school \n     district with applications.\n       Angela Mathwig, Infotech Strategies: coordinated logistics \n     and on-site materials.\n       Christopher Capps: coordinated astronaut participation.\n       Mike Donovan Hausler: managed design and production of \n     graphic art.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/25/senate-section/article/S9954-3", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9954-S9955]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to add my thoughts to the debate \non the Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill for fiscal \nyear 2004.\n  First, I want to take this opportunity to thank the distinguished \nchairman and distinguished ranking member of the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Homeland Security for working so diligently on this \nbill before us. These leaders had the difficult job of allocating a \nvery limited amount of money for one of the Nation's most pressing \nneeds and they have done an admirable job.\n  I also thank this Nation's first responders. They are the ones who \nare on the front lines of this fight against terrorism. They are the \nones who will be the first to react to any future attack upon our \nNation. These brave men and women must, at a moment's notice, be ready \nto respond to a host of possible horrifying scenarios, including those \ninvolving nuclear, radiological, biological, and chemical devices.\n  Congress has been working hard to support our first responders, \nincluding providing almost $3.9 billion in this appropriations bill. I \nam particularly pleased that the committee chose to maintain the \nsuccessful firefighter assistance grants and fund them at $750\n\n[[Page S9955]]\n\nmillion rather than the President's requested $500 million. I thank the \ncommittee for their wisdom in this matter.\n  Although this bill does a lot to help our first responders, it does \nnot do enough. As my colleagues know, the Council on Foreign Relations \nrecently released the report of an independent task force chaired by \nformer Senator Warren B. Rudman. The title of this report says it all: \n``Emergency Responders: Drastically Underfunded, Dangerously \nUnprepared.'' I supported Senator Byrd and others in trying to address \nthe drastic underfunding of our first responders pointed out in the \nRudman Report and am disappointed that we in the Senate were unable to \ndo more.\n  I point out to my colleagues that I do not take lightly my decision \nto vote in favor of spending more money. Fiscal responsibility is one \nof my highest priorities and I constantly look for ways to limit \ngovernment spending. I am honored that the Concord Coalition and others \nhave recognized me for my efforts in this regard. Although fiscal \nresponsibility remains one of my highest priorities, the fight against \nterrorism is also a high priority. I regret that the Republican budget \nresolution did not provide adequate funding for homeland security, \nchoosing instead to place tax cuts as its highest priority. I agree \nwith the distinguished Senators from Connecticut and Michigan that we \nought to pay for increased funding in this bill by reviewing tax breaks \nfor those making over a million dollars. This is a reasonable way to \napproach the current underfunding of this top priority.\n  I would like to draw attention to the fact that local first \nresponders, emergency preparedness professional associations, and \nothers have responded to the tragic events of 9/11 by re-examining \nemergency response procedures, compiling lessons learned, and \ndeveloping new and innovative practices to best deal with possible \nterrorist attacks. Unfortunately, the Rudman Report found that ``(T)he \ntask Force found insufficient national coordination of efforts to \nsystematically capture and disseminate best practices for emergency \nresponders.'' First responders in Wisconsin back up this finding.\n  The Department of Homeland Security is supposed to be gathering and \ndisseminating first responder best practices to all relevant parties. I \nam concerned that they are not adequately fulfilling their \nresponsibility in this area. I understand that the newly formed \nDepartment of Homeland Security has many important responsibilities and \nis being pulled in many different directions. I am concerned, however, \nthat the Department is wasting an important opportunity to increase the \nefficiency of our first responders. The Rudman Report recommends \nestablishing a national institute to collect and disseminate best \npractices for first responders. This would ``allow all emergency \nresponders to learn from past experiences and improve the quality of \ntheir efforts, thereby assuring taxpayers the maximum return on their \ninvestment in homeland security.''\n  I offered an amendment directing the Department to report on its \nefforts to assess and disseminate best practices and its plans for \nimproving the coordination and sharing of such information. This \namendment was designed to prompt the Department into action so that all \nof us can reap the benefits of shared best practices. I am pleased that \nthe Senate adopted this amendment.\n  I am also concerned that in our hasty efforts to protect the homeland \nwe may be sacrificing some of our civil liberties. One item of \nparticular concern to me is the use of data-mining by the Department of \nHomeland Security. Such programs give the Government the ability to \npeer into virtually every facet of an individual's life, including \ncredit card use, bank statements, health records, and on and on. \nCongress must make sure that civil liberties are being protected and so \nmust carefully monitor Government entities that may try to use data-\nmining technology. I am pleased that the Senate adopted my amendment \nrequiring the Comptroller General to conduct a review and report to \nCongress on the development and use of data-mining by the Department of \nHomeland Security.\n  I will vote for this bill. This legislation includes many good \nelements, such as the funds available for first responders. However, I \nmust also express my disappointment that funding for homeland security, \none of our highest priorities, is being forced to play second fiddle to \ntax cuts. This is unacceptable and I hope we in Congress will soon \nrectify this situation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/25/senate-section/article/S9955-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9955]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HONORING CLAY SELL\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to honor a remarkable and \ntalented young man who will be sorely missed as he moves to the \nadministration to become the special assistant on energy to the \nPresident of the United States. Clay Sell has been working for me as \nchief clerk for the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and \nWater Development for the past 4 years and while I am extremely proud \nof his accomplishments, I am sad to see him go.\n  When Clay first came to the Senate, he impressed us all with his \nquick uptake of his new position and we were pleasantly surprised with \nhis negotiation skills. It has been said of Clay that even when he \nnegotiated a victory for his position, all parties involved left the \nnegotiation table happy. His keen understanding of people and his \ngenuine attitude are just a few of the great personality traits that \nClay possesses.\n  Clay's hard work and dedication began at an early age. Growing up in \ngreater West Texas, he learned the value of hard work and perseverance. \nThe Sell family settled in Petersburg, TX in the early 1900's, a small \nfarming community that has changed very little over the past century. \nClay's father George grew up to become the first person in the family \nto receive a college degree. The hard work that drove George to succeed \nwas prevalent in his son Clay.\n  Clay graduated from Tascosa High in Amarillo, TX where after he went \non to receive his undergraduate degree in finance from Texas Tech \nUniversity at Lubbock. Immediately following his graduation from \ncollege, Clay moved to Austin to attend the University of Texas Law \nSchool where he met and married his lovely wife Alisa.\n  After a short stint in Amarillo, Clay and Alisa moved to Washington, \nDC, where Clay began his political career working as a legislative \nassistant for a newly elected Representative from Texas, Mac \nThornberry. While working in the House of Representatives, Clay spent a \ngreat deal of time working with energy policy. He worked in all aspects \nof energy legislation and played a key role in formulating and drafting \nthe legislation which set up the National Nuclear Security Agency, \nNNSA. This experience made Clay a prime candidate for the position he \nwould eventually assume upon his move to the Senate. Clay's work in the \nHouse of Representatives prepared him a great deal for his new job, but \nhis new position required a greater understanding of national energy \npolicy.\n  Over the past 4 years, I have gotten to know Clay and his wonderful \nfamily very well. Alisa and their two sons, Jack and Robert, have been \nClay's stabilizing force. With another child on the way, that force \nwill no doubt grow even stronger.\n  It has been my privilege to know and work with Mr. Clay Sell, but my \nwords today are bittersweet. I do not feel that words alone can \nproperly show my admiration for all that Clay has done for me, but I am \nconfident that he understands how greatly he will be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/25/senate-section/article/S9955-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9955]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. DAYTON.

Mr. President, it is with a tremendous amount of pride \nthat I take to the floor today to discuss the accomplishments of one of \nAlabama's native sons, 2LT Martin Bailey Pierce. This remarkable young\n\n[[Page S9956]]\n\nman has achieved a truly auspicious honor: he has been named the \nvaledictorian of West Point's class of 2003. In both word and deed, \nthis is a young man who truly has lived up to the Army's challenge to \n``be all that you can be.''\n  When the selection committee I have established to review potential \nservice academy nominations forwarded Martin Pierce's name to me, I \nknew that he had the potential to be a fine selection. After all, he \nhad been the 1999 valedictorian at UMS-Wright, formerly known as \nUniversity Military School, which is a prestigious school in Mobile, \nAL. Additionally, he had the full support of his two loving parents, \nBailey and Susann, who had obviously instilled a sense of duty, honor \nand commitment in their son. There was little doubt in my mind that the \ntraits 2LT Pierce had exhibited up to that point in time would serve \nhim well at West Point.\n  However, the same could be said of most of the 846 cadets who \ngraduated alongside Martin in the class of 2003. The service academy's \nattract a special kind of applicant, and those that are accepted tend \nto be individuals of great capabilities. Therefore when someone \nachieves the kind of academic success that 2LT Pierce has, there is a \nspecial satisfaction that he has done so while placed among the best \nand brightest.\n  I would like to take a few moments to place Mr. Pierce's West Point \nrecord in perspective. He become valedictorian by posting a GPA of \n4.086 in the field of electrical/chemical engineering, and he was a \ndean's list member throughout his time at the academy. He also was one \nof only 144 recipients of the Gold Star and Wreath. This honor required \nMartin to achieve distinguished cadet status and to also become a \nSuperintendent's Individual Award winner. In order to qualify for the \nGod Star, Martin had to not only maintain a GPA of 3.67 or greater, but \nhe also had to excel in West Point's academic, military and physical \nprograms.\n  And excel in these programs he did. In addition to his exceptional \nwork in the classroom, 2LT Pierce was a 4 year member of the Army's \nBlack Knights football team, where he lettered as an outside \nlinebacker. HIs accomplishments on the field and in the classroom also \nled him to be recognized nationally when he was awarded the Home Depot \nScholar Athlete Award during the December 7, 2002 telecast of the Army/\nNavy game.\n  If these achievements, weren't enough, Martin saved his best for \nlast. On June 1, 2LT Pierce married the former Michelle Ann Czyz in a \nceremony in West Point, NY. Who knows? Perhaps this union foreshadows \nanother valedictorian in a future West Point class.\n  And so 2LT Martin Bailey Pierce has left a mark upon the U.S. \nMilitary Academy as indelible as the mark the service academy has left \non him. In doing so, he has come to exemplify the West Point's mission \n``to educate, train, and inspire the Corps of Cadets so that each \ngraduate is a commissioned leader of character committed to the values \nof Duty, Honor, Country; professional growth throughout a career as an \nofficer in the United States Army; and a lifetime of selfless service \nto the nation.'' I am proud he is an Alabamian, and proud to know that \nhe will continue and add to our State's remarkable record of producing \noutstanding cadets and soldiers. I congratulate 2LT Pierce for his \naccomplishments, and look forward to what I am sure will be a career \nthat will make all members of the long gray line proud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/25/senate-section/article/S9956-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9956]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      LAO-HMONG DAY OF RECOGNITION\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today on National Lao-Hmong \nRecognition Day to commemorate those who served alongside the United \nStates to protect democracy in Southeast Asia. Since 1995, the day of \nJuly 22nd has been celebrated as the Nation's official day recognizing \nthe commitment and sacrifice of the Lao-Hmong people.\n  Beginning in the 1960s the United States recruited thousands of the \nLao-Hmong citizens to fight against the Communist North Vietnamese \nArmy. The United States relied heavily on support from the Lao-Hmong \nunits to engage in direct combat with the adversary from 1960 to 1975. \nAlthough heavily outnumbered, the Lao-Hmong courageously battled to \ndisrupt supply flows which ran along the Ho Chi Minh Trail.\n  In the name of democracy, the Lao-Hmong protected U.S. personnel, \ndefended U.S. Air Force radar installations, collected critical \nintelligence about enemy operations, and undertook rescue missions to \nsave the lives of downed U.S. pilots. In doing so, the Lao-Hmong lost \nmore than 35,000 lives and many more were seriously injured and \ndisabled.\n  Decades of war separated the Lao-Hmong from their native land. Now \nthe Lao-Hmong in these United States can call America their home. The \ngreat State of Wisconsin has over many years become a population center \nfor the Lao-Hmong community. Now citizens of the United States, the \nLao-Hmong contribute richly to our Wisconsin communities.\n  On July 22, 1995, the first National Lao-Hmong Recognition Day was \ncelebrated in Denver, CO. This year, in my home State of Wisconsin, the \ncity of Milwaukee has been chosen to host the 2003 celebration. The \npurpose of celebrating this historic day is to memorialize the departed \nand to honor the living for their valor in defense of freedom and \ndemocracy. While acknowledging and respecting the commitment the Lao-\nHmong people gave the United States during the Vietnam War, we are \nhonored to celebrate their lives today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/25/senate-section/article/S9956-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9956]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n Mr. SMITH.

On September 21, 2001, Abdo Ali Ahmed was killed after receiving a \ndeath threat and a hate note deriding his ethnicity. Ahmed was a 51-\nyear-old Yemeni shopkeeper and father of eight. Before his murder, \nAhmed had lived in California for 35 years.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/25/senate-section/article/S9956-3", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9956-S9957]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  HONORING THE OWYHEE CATTLEMEN'S ASSOCIATION ON ITS 125TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. CRAPO.

From the original Owyhee Cattle and Horse Growers \nAssociation, which formed in 1878 to protect livestock from rustlers \nand Indians, to the association's present influential position on \nproperty rights, water rights, and grazing matters, it has been an \neffectively involved force in Idaho.\n  The Owyhee Cattlemen's Association has benefited from a long line of \ntop-notch leaders, and it continues to be instrumental in representing \nthe cattle industry in a variety of issue areas including rangeland \nmonitoring, species issues, and environmental concerns. These are all \nfar different from cattle rustling activities, but perhaps similar in \neconomic effects on the cattle industry.\n  The association has also played a leading and pioneering role in \nnegotiating agreements and initiatives that work towards the future \nviability and profitability of the entire grazing community. I \nparticularly appreciate that it has recognized the strength of \ncollaborative efforts in dealing with the multiple interest groups that \nare becoming stakeholders and hopefully partners in public land \nstewardship.\n  The past strength and resolve of the Owyhee Cattleman's Association \nhas served the cattle industry well, and will continue to ensure its \nplace at the\n\n[[Page S9957]]\n\ndiscussions of future issues, as we advance into the next 100 years of \npublic land grazing.\n  Once again, my congratulations to the Owyhee Cattlemen's Association \nand its members as it marks a milestone anniversary. It has an \nunprecedented history of accomplishments in the cattle industry. I send \nmy very best wishes for its continued success in serving the Owyhee \nCounty constituent base and the entire Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/25/senate-section/article/S9957-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9957]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:30 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2210.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Hawaii \n     relative to Title IX; to the Committee on Health, Education, \n     Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 31\n\n       Whereas, Title IX, recently renamed the Patsy Takemoto Mink \n     Equal Opportunity in Education Act, was adopted in 1972 to \n     prohibit gender discrimination in programs that receive \n     federal funds; and\n       Whereas, Title IX's impact on athletics has led to a vast \n     increase in girls' participation in high school athletics, \n     college athletics, and women's professional athletics; and\n       Whereas, in 1972, fewer than thirty-two thousand women \n     competed in intercollegiate athletics, women received only \n     two percent of schools' athletic budgets, and athletic \n     scholarships for women were nonexistent; and\n       Whereas, today, thanks to the doors opened by Title IX, \n     high school female sports participation has increased eight \n     hundred percent, from three hundred thousand in 1971 to \n     2,800,000 in 2002; and\n       Whereas, the number of college women participating in \n     competitive athletics is nearly five times as great as it was \n     before Title IX; and\n       Whereas, while sports are the most visible benefit of Title \n     IX, women's gains in college-level academics have been \n     substantial; and\n       Whereas, Title IX's antidiscrimination provisions apply to \n     every single aspect of education, including admissions and \n     recruitment, comparable facilities, access to course \n     offerings, access to schools of vocational education, \n     counseling and counseling materials, financial assistance, \n     student health and insurance benefits and services, housing, \n     marital and parental status of students, physical education \n     and athletics, education programs and activities, and \n     employment, providing a fair and equal benefit for a \n     generation of women; and\n       Whereas, girls and women who attended schools prior to \n     Title IX experienced sex-segregated classes, denial of \n     admissions to certain vocational education classes, lack of \n     access to advanced mathematics and science courses, and overt \n     discrimination in medical schools and other predominantly \n     male institutions; and\n       Whereas, after Title IX women in post-secondary education \n     shot up dramatically, rising from forty-four percent of all \n     undergraduates in 1972 to fifty-six percent of all \n     undergraduates today; and\n       Whereas, since the inception of Title IX, the amount of \n     scholarship money for women has increased from $100,000 in \n     1972 to $179 million in 1997; and\n       Whereas, women made significant jumps in areas \n     traditionally thought of as male, such as engineering, \n     medicine, and law: in 1970 women earned 0.7 percent of \n     bachelor's degrees in engineering while today women earn 20 \n     percent of these degrees; and in 1972, women received only 9 \n     percent of all medical degrees and 7 percent of all law \n     degrees, whereas in 1996, women received 41 percent of all \n     medical degrees and 44 percent of all law degrees, and\n       Whereas, Title IX has also benefited men and boys by \n     eliminating the barriers and stereotypes that limit the \n     opportunities and choices of both sexes; and\n       Whereas, the Bush administration has convened a Commission \n     on Opportunity in Athletics to consider changes to Title IX; \n     and\n       Whereas, this controversial commission has made \n     recommendations that would seriously dilute the power of \n     Title IX; and\n       Whereas, proponents of Title IX charge that the commission \n     is an attempt to weaken the law after repeated court \n     challenges over the past thirty years have failed; and\n       Whereas, Title IX is an Act of Congress and should not be \n     subject to modification by an executive branch commission; \n     and\n       Whereas, the people of Hawaii have experienced the great \n     benefits of Title IX, the Patsy Takemoto Mink Equal \n     Opportunity in Education Act, and strongly support its full \n     implementation: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-\n     second Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of \n     2003, the Senate concurring, That the State of Hawaii urges \n     Congress to maintain Title IX, the Patsy Takemoto Mink Equal \n     Opportunity in Education Act, in its original form and to \n     take a firm stand opposing any recommendations that would \n     weaken it; and be it further\n       Resolved, That certified copies of this Concurrent \n     Resolution be transmitted to the President of the United \n     States, the Secretary of Education of the United States, \n     President of the Senate of the United States Congress, the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives of the United States \n     Congress, and the members of Hawaii's congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-243. A joint resolution adopted by the General Assembly \n     of the Commonwealth of Kentucky relative to a constitutional \n     amendment allowing the exercise of religion in public places; \n     to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                            Joint Resolution\n\n       Whereas, the Ten Commandments appear over the bench where \n     the United States Supreme Court Justices sit, thus showing \n     the source from whence our laws and the government power of \n     the state are derived; and\n       Whereas, America's colonial governments adopted the Ten \n     Commandments not as an object of worship or an icon, but as \n     the basis for their civil and criminal law, as illustrated on \n     April 3, 1644, when the New Haven Colony Charter was adopted \n     establishing that: ``the judicial laws of God, as they were \n     delivered to Moses be a rule to all courts in this \n     jurisdiction''; and\n       Whereas, when signing the Declaration of Independence on \n     August 2, 1776, Samuel Adams, the ``Father of the \n     Revolution'' emphasized its Biblical presuppositions: ``We \n     have this day restored the Sovereign to whom all men ought to \n     be obedient. He reigns in heaven and from the rising to the \n     setting of the sun, let His kingdom come''; and\n       Whereas, on August 20, 1789, Congressman Fisher Ames from \n     Massachusetts proposed the wording of the First Amendment \n     which was adopted by the House of Representatives in the \n     first session of the Congress of the United States; and his \n     writings clearly demonstrate that the Framers never intended \n     the First Amendment to be so interpreted as to remove the \n     Bible from the public buildings: ``We are spending less time \n     in the classroom on the Bible which should be the principal \n     text in our schools . . .''; and\n       Whereas, in a letter dated August 18, 1790, President \n     George Washington wrote to the Hebrew Congregation in \n     Newport, Rhode Island, ``All possess alike liberty if \n     conscience and immunities of citizenship . . . May the \n     children of the stock of Abraham, who dwell in this land, \n     continue to merit and enjoy the good will of the other \n     inhabitants; while every one shall sit in safety under his \n     own vine and fig tree, and there shall be none to make him \n     afraid''; and\n       Whereas, in his ``Farewell Address of September 19, 1796, \n     George Washington pointed out the connection between the \n     faith of the Nation and its political prosperity when he \n     declared. ``Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to \n     political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable \n     supports . . .'', and\n       Whereas, acknowledging the Bible as an integral part of the \n     fabric of our society on September 11, 1777, the Continental \n     Congress adopted a resolution to import 20,000 Bibles from \n     Holland and Scotland, as the colonies were at war with \n     England; and\n       Whereas, On May 29, 1845, the day before his death, \n     President Andrew Jackson stated: ``My lamp of life is nearly \n     out, and the last glimmer has come. I am ready to depart when \n     called. The Bible is true. The principles and statutes of the \n     Holy Book have been the rule of my life, and I have tried to \n     conform to its spirit as nearly as possible. Upon that scared \n     volume I rest my hope for eternal salvation through the \n     merits and blood of our blessed Lord and Savior Jesus \n     Christ''; and\n       Whereas, President John Quincy Adams, the sixth President \n     of the United States, wrote concerning the civil function of \n     the Mosaic law. ``The law given from Sinai was a civil and \n     municipal as well as a moral and religious code: It contained \n     many statutes . . . of universal application--laws essential \n     to the existence of men in society and most of which have \n     been enacted by every nation which ever professed any code of \n     laws''; and\n       Whereas, in a June, 1778 letter to her son, John Quincy \n     Adams, Abigail Adams reinforced noble values and a sense of \n     ultimate\n\n[[Page S9958]]\n\n     accountability to God which she believed to be the foundation \n     of true greatness: ``Great learning and superior abilities, \n     should you ever possess them, will be of little value and \n     small estimation, unless virtue, honor, truth, and integrity \n     are added to them. Adhere to those religious sentiments and \n     principles which were early instilled into your mind, and \n     remember that you are accountable to your Maker for all your \n     words and actions''; and\n       Whereas, on February 29, 1892, the United States Supreme \n     Court, in a unanimous decision, which has never been \n     overruled, cited sixty-six organic authorities which show the \n     Bible's singular influence on America: ``There is no \n     dissonance in these declarations. There is a universal \n     language pervading them all having one meaning: they affirm \n     and reaffirm that this is a religious nation. These are not \n     individual sayings, declarations of private persons; they are \n     organic utterances; they speak the voice of the entire group. \n     These authorities were collected to support the historical \n     conclusion that `no purpose of action against religion can be \n     imputed to any legislation, state or nation, because this is \n     a religious people. This is historically true. From the \n     discovery of this continent to the present hour, there is a \n     single voice making this affirmation . . . we find everywhere \n     a clear recognition of the same truth . . . this is a \n     Christian nation'''; and\n       Whereas, on May 7, 1911, President Woodrow Wilson, \n     addressing the Tercentenary Celebration of the Translation of \n     the Bible into the English language, stated, ``Moreover, the \n     Bible does what is so invaluable in human life--it classifies \n     moral values. It apprises us that men are not judged \n     according to their wits, but according to their characters--\n     that the last of every man's reputation is his truthfulness, \n     his squaring his conduct with the standards that he knew to \n     be the standards of purity and rectitude. How many a man we \n     appraise, ladies and gentlemen, as great today whom we do not \n     admire as noble! A man may have great power and small \n     character''; and ``The bible has had a critical impact upon \n     the development of Western civilization. Western literature, \n     art and music are filled with images and ideas that can be \n     traced to its pages. More important, our moral tradition has \n     been shaped by the laws and teachings it contains. It was a \n     biblical view of man--one affirming the dignity and worth of \n     the human person, made in the image of our Creator--that \n     inspired the principles upon which the United States is \n     founded. President Jackson called the Bible `the rock on \n     which our republic rests' because he knew that it shaped the \n     Founding Fathers' concept of individual liberty and their \n     vision of a free and just society. The Bible has not only \n     influenced the development of our Nation's values and \n     institutions, but also enriched the daily lives of \n     millions of men and women who have looked to it for \n     comfort, hope and guidance. On the American frontier, the \n     Bible was often the only book a family owned. For those \n     pioneers living far from any church or school, it served \n     both as a source of religious instruction and as the \n     primary text from which children learned to read. The \n     historical speeches of Abraham Lincoln and Dr. Martin \n     Luther King, Jr., provide compelling evidence of the role \n     Scripture played in shaping the struggle against slavery \n     and discrimination. Today the Bible continues to give \n     courage and direction to those who seek truth and \n     righteousness. In recognizing its enduring value, we \n     recall the words of the prophet Isaiah, who declared `The \n     grass withereth, the flower fadeth; but the word of our \n     God shall stand forever.' Containing revelations of God's \n     intervention in human history, the Bible offers moving \n     testimony to His love for mankind. Treasuring the Bible as \n     a source of knowledge and inspiration, President Abraham \n     Lincoln called this Great Book `the best gift God has \n     given to man.' President Lincoln believed that the Bible \n     not only reveals the infinite goodness of our Creator, but \n     also reminds us of our worth as individuals and our \n     responsibilities toward one another''; and\n       Whereas, the First Amendment in the Bill of Rights states, \n     ``Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of \n     religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or \n     abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the \n     right of the people peacefully to assemble, and to petition \n     the Government for a redress of grievances''; and\n       Whereas, recent court rulings have prevented the displaying \n     of the Ten Commandments and have been the cause of the \n     removal of these documents from public buildings; and\n       Whereas, eighty percent of the people are in favor of \n     displaying the Ten Commandments in public places; and\n       Whereas, the General Assembly finds the Ten Commandments to \n     be the precedent legal code of the Commonwealth which has \n     provided the foundation for many of the civil and criminal \n     statutes enacted into law throughout the history of the \n     Commonwealth; and\n       Whereas, under Article V of the Constitution of the United \n     States, Amendments to said Constitution may be proposed by \n     the United States Congress whenever two-thirds of both \n     chambers deem it necessary: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of \n     Kentucky:\n       Section 1. The General Assembly of the Commonwealth of \n     Kentucky, a majority of all members of the chambers voting \n     separately to concur herein, hereby petitions the United \n     States Congress to propose an Amendment to the Constitution \n     of the United States, for submission to the several States \n     for ratification, to allow the people of the United States \n     and the several States the freedom to exercise their religion \n     in public places.\n       Section 2. The text of the proposed Amendment to the \n     Constitution of the United States should read substantially \n     as follows:\n       ``Nothing in the Constitution shall be construed to \n     prohibit or otherwise limit the practice of individual or \n     group prayer, the reading of the posting of the Ten \n     Commandments, the recital of the Pledge of Allegiance, and \n     the display of the motto `In God We Trust' or similar phrases \n     from historical documents referencing God in any public \n     place, including a school; nor shall it require any person to \n     join in prayer or other religious activity.''\n       Section 3.

A bill to regulate international marriage broker activity in \nthe United States, to provide for certain protections for individuals \nwho utilize services of international marriage brokers, and for other \nservices; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I rise today to introduce the International Marriage \nBroker Regulation Act of 2003. This legislation will provide much \nneeded protections for the thousands of foreign women who meet their \nAmerican husbands through for-profit Internet sites and catalogs.\n  While mail order bride catalogs may seem like a relic from the past, \nthe use of marriage broker services has exploded in recent years with \nthe growth of the Internet. While many of these matches result in \nhappy, long unions, there is a growing epidemic of domestic abuse among \ncouples who meet via international marriage brokers. Immigrant and \nwomen's advocacy groups across the country report seeing an increase in \nthe number of these wives seeking to escape a physically abusive \nhusband they met through an IMB. In several cases, the abuse has \nprogressed to murder.\n  A 1999 study found there were over 200 Internet sites marketing \nforeign women primarily from Eastern Europe and Asia seeking American \nhusbands. Recent studies suggest that there are now as many as 400 \ncurrently operating in this country. These sites feature pictures of \nhundreds of women who, according to the Web sites, are looking to meet \nand marry an American man. The international marriage brokers operating \nthese sites promise a wife with ``traditional values,'' who will honor \nher husband.\n  Unfortunately, women meeting their husbands in this manner frequently \nhave little opportunity to get to know their prospective spouses or \nassess their potential for violence. They also have little knowledge of \ntheir rights as victims of domestic violence in our country even if \nthey are not yet citizens or permanent residents.\n  In my State of Washington alone there have been three cases of \nserious domestic violence including two murders of women who met their \nhusbands through an Internet-based international marriage broker. \nSusanna Blackwell met her husband through an IMB and, in 1994, left her \nnative Philippines to move to Washington to marry him. During their \nshort marriage, Timothy Blackwell physically abused his wife regularly. \nWithin a few months, she had left him and begun divorce proceedings. \nThe Blackwells had been separated for more than a year when Timothy \nBlackwell learned Susanna was eight months pregnant with another man's \nchild. On the last day of the divorce proceedings, Timothy Blackwell \nshot and killed Susanna, her unborn child, and two friends who were \nwaiting outside of the Seattle courtroom.\n  In 1999, 18-year-old Anastasia Solovyova married Indle King, a man \nshe met through an IMB. Entries from Anastasia's diary detail the abuse \nshe suffered and the fear she had of her husband who threatened her \nwith death if she were to leave him. In December 2000, Anastasia was \nfound strangled to death and buried in a shallow grave in Washington. \nKing's accomplice later told police that he strangled Anastasia with a \nnecktie while King lay on her chest to keep her from moving. At trial, \nit was discovered that Indle King had previously married another woman \nhe met through an internet IMB, who later got a domestic violence \nprotection order against him before divorcing him in 1997. It was also \ndiscovered that he was seeking his third wife through an IMB when he \nand his accomplice developed the plot to kill Anastasia.\n  Unfortunately, there are similar examples across the country of women \nwho have met their American spouses through an Internet IMB only to be \nseriously injured or killed by an American spouse with a preexisting \nhistory of violence against women.\n  My legislation is modeled on a groundbreaking Washington State law, \nthe first State effort to regulate the international matchmaking \nindustry. The Washington Legislature took action on this important \nissue after the Blackwell and King cases, and multiple States are \ncurrently looking at enacting similar legislation.\n  The primary goal of my legislation is to better inform women entering \nthis country as fiancees and prospective spouses about the past history \nof their prospective spouse and to better inform them of their rights \nas residents of the United States if they become victims of domestic \nviolence.\n  The bill would first of all halt the current practice of allowing \nAmericans to simultaneously seek visas for multiple fiancees, by \nrequiring that only one fiancee visa may be sought per applicant each \nyear. Currently, multiple request for fiancee visas can be \nsimultaneously filed with the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration, \nand the American requesting the visa will simply choose to marry the \nfirst woman who is approved.\n  Second, my bill would require that, before an IMB may release the \ncontact information of a foreign national client, it must first obtain \nher consent to the release of that information and second, provide her \nwith information on the rights of victims of domestic violence in this \ncountry in her own language.\n  Third, the IMB would be required to ask American clients to provide \ninformation on any previous arrest, conviction or court-ordered \nrestriction relating to crimes of violence along with their previous \nmarital history. This information would also be made available to the \nforeign national.\n  Finally, it would require a U.S. citizen seeking a foreign fiancee \nvisa to undergo a criminal background check, a check that is already \nperformed for the fiancees entering the country\n\n[[Page S9961]]\n\nthemselves. Information on convictions and civil orders would be \nrelayed to the visa applicant by the consular official along with \ninformation on their legal rights should they find themselves in an \nabusive relationship.\n  Currently, an American seeking to marry someone through an IMB holds \nall of the cards. The American client has the benefit of a complete \nbackground check on his future wife, a requirement of the immigration \nprocess. In addition, the IMBs provide clients extensive information \nabout the women they offer, everything from their favorite movies and \nhobbies to whether they are sexually promiscuous.\n\n  Conversely, the foreign fiancee' only gets whatever information her \nfuture spouse wants to share. These women have no way of confirming \nwhat they are told about previous marriages or relationships or the \nAmerican client's criminal history.\n  Researchers describe the typical American client as Caucasian, \neducated, professional, and financially secure. More than half have \nbeen married once already and express a desire to find a bride with \nmore ``traditional values,'' attitudes they feel are not held by many \nAmerican women today.\n  Most of the foreign brides advertised by the IMBs come from countries \nwhere women are oppressed, have a few educational or professional \nopportunities, and where violence against women is condoned, if not \nencouraged. Because of the cultural differences, researchers say there \nis an inherent imbalance of power in these relationships between \nAmerican men and foreign women.\n  The men who seek these more traditional wives typically control the \nhousehold finances and make basic decisons like whether the wife will \nhave a driver's license, get a job or spend time with friends. Because \nthese women often immigrate alone, they have no family or other support \nnetwork and rely on their husbands for everything. Such dependency can \nmake it difficult for a wife to report abuse without worrying that \ndoing so is a surefire ticket to deportation. Researchers agree that \nisolation and dependency put these women at greater risk of domestic \nabuse.\n  Documenting the extent of this problem has been quite difficult. \nMarriages arranged by IMBs are not tracked separately from other \nimmigrant marriages. However, experts agree that abuse is more likely \nin such an arranged marriages and that abuse in these relationships is \nlikely underreported since the women are likely to be more afraid of \ndeportation than the abuse they suffer at home.\n  Attempting to get a handle on the problem, the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service commissioned a study of the industry in 1999. \nThe INS study estimated that there are more than 200 IMBs operating \naround the globe, arranging between 4,000 and 6,000 marriages between \nAmerican men and foreign women every year. Experts today put the number \nof IMBs at nearly 500 worldwide. And based on the 1999 statistics, \nthere are between 20,000 and 30,000 women who have entered the U.S. \nusing an IMB in the past 5 years. While there are a few IMBs aimed at \nfemale clients, the overwhelming majority of people who seek IMB \nservices are men.\n  IMBs also are being used as a cover for those seeking servants. That \nis what happened to Helen Clemente, a Filipina brought to the U.S. by \nretired Seattle-area police officer Eldon Doty and his wife, Sally. \nEldon and Sally Doty had divorced to allow Eldon to marry Helen \nClemente. However, Eldon and Sally Doty continued to live as man and \nwife, forcing Helene Clemente to work as their servant. After 3 years, \nHelen ran way. The Dotys have worked with INS in exchange for de facto \nimmunity, while Helen Clemente continues to fight deportation.\n  It is critical for legal immigrants to know that they don't have to \nsuffer abuse or work without pay to remain in this country. The \nViolence Against Women Act provided some safeguards for these female \nimmigrants, ensuring that in cases of abuse a woman's immigration \npetition may proceed without the sponsorship of her abuser. That \nimportant legislation provided protections for women who come here and \nfind themselves in abusive relationships; however, more can and should \nbe done.\n  My legislation would give foreign financees critical information they \nneed to make an informed decision about the person they are going to \nmarry. It puts these foreign brides on more equal footing with their \nAmerican grooms.\n  My legislation enjoys support from more than 80 organizations and \nadvocacy groups across the country, including religious coalitions, \nlaws firms, women's rights and social justice groups. I hope my \ncolleagues in the Senate will support it as well.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1455\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for reform of management of Indian trust \nfunds and assets under the jurisdiction of the Department of the \nInterior, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to serve \nas the basis for much needed reforms to the Federal Government's \nmanagement of Indian trust funds and trust assets within the U.S. \nDepartment of the Interior. I am joined by my colleagues, Senators \nDaschle and Johnson, in this effort, as well as by Representatives Mark \nUdall and Nick Rahall whom are sponsoring a companion measure in the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  This legislation is a reflection of a continuing effort by my \ncolleagues and myself to develop a trust reform proposal that will not \nonly serve to improve the Federal Government's administration and \nmanagement of Indian trust funds and trust assets but it will also \ninstitute a role for Indian tribes to participate in developing \nadditional needed reforms and enhance the principles of tribal self-\ndetermination.\n  Earlier this year, Senators Daschle, Johnson, and myself introduced \nsimilar trust reform legislation and received substantive feedback from \nIndian country on the bill. This feedback helped us in developing this \nnew legislative proposal, which will serve as the framework for \ninstituting broader reforms necessary for long-term management of \ntribal trust resources and enhancing Federal Indian policy. I thank the \ntribes and tribal organizations such as the Inter Tribal Monitoring \nAssociation, the Native American Rights Fund, and the National Congress \nof American Indians, which worked with our offices and helped to \nformulate the concepts embodied in this proposal. We are encouraged by \ntheir efforts and support to seek a legislative remedy to these \ndifficult problems.\n  The basic elements of this bill focus on three primary areas: the \nmanagement of trust funds and trust assets will be elevated in the \noverall Department by designating a Deputy Secretary of Indian Affairs \nto assume the current responsibilities of the Assistant Secretary of \nIndian Affairs and the Special Trustee. Second, as determined by the \ncourt and the administration, it is Congress' duty to affirm fiduciary \nstandards for proper management of these trust funds and trust assets, \nand this bill includes such standards. And, third, the role of the \ntribes is enhanced through affirmation of the authority of tribes to \nutilize self-determination laws to manage their own funds and assets. \nTribes will also be engaged in determining additional necessary reforms \nthrough participation in an established congressional commission.\n  The mismanagement of Indian trust funds is a long and disgraceful \nchapter in the history of this Nation. The 1994 American Indian Trust \nFund Management Reform Act was enacted to take measures to reconcile \nthese accounts and return the money to the Native American \nbeneficiaries. Unfortunately, as continuing management problems persist \nand Native Americans are left out of the decision-making process about \nthe management of their resources, it is time for Congress to step up \nand take decisive action to once again require significant reform with \nthe active participation of the tribes.\n  I am pleased that Senators Daschle and Johnson are committed to \nworking with me once again on this legislation, and I am also \nencouraged by the interest of our House counterparts to jointly \nintroduce this bill with us. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues and the tribes to advance this legislation. We are willing \nto consider additional review and comments and expect to further refine \nthis bill as it moves through the legislative process.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1459\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I once again join with Senators \nJohn McCain and Tim Johnson in introducing legislation that addresses \nthe longstanding problem of mismanagement of assets held by the United \nStates in trust for federally recognized Indian tribes and individual \nAmerican Indians.\n  Indian country has faced many challenges over the years. Few, \nhowever, have had more far-ranging ramifications on the lives of \nindividual Native Americans, or been more vexing, than that of \nrestoring integrity to trust fund management.\n  For over 100 years, the Department of the Interior has administered a \ntrust fund containing the proceeds of leasing of oil, gas, land and \nmineral rights on Indian land for the benefit of Indian people. Today, \nthat trust fund may owe as much as $10 billion to as many as 500,000 \nIndians.\n  To provide some perspective, the 16 tribes of the Great Plains in \nSouth Dakota, North Dakota, and Nebraska hold 10 million acres of trust \nlands representing over one-third of the tribal trust assets. Many \nenrolled members of the nine South Dakota tribes have individual trust \naccounts.\n  There is little disagreement that current government administration \nof the trust fund is a failure. However, there is no consensus on how \nto reform it.\n  Senators McCain, Johnson, and I believe that Congress should be more \nassertive in promoting a solution to the trust management problem and \nin ensuring that tribes and individual Indian account holders have a \ntrue voice in shaping that solution. That is why we have proposed \nlegislation that would redesign the trust management process.\n  Today, Senators McCain, Johnson, and I are introducing a revised \nversion of S. 175, a trust reform proposal we introduced earlier this \nyear. This bill incorporates feedback we received from interested \nstakeholders and responds to developments that have occurred since S. \n175 was introduced.\n  We are joined in this effort by Representatives Mark Udall and Nick \nRahall who are introducing a companion measure in the House. I commend \nthem for their commitment to correcting the trust management problem \nand value their leadership on this issue.\n  This legislation lays out legislative standards that form the \ncornerstone of the United States of America's trust responsibility to \nIndian nations. It directs the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a \nhistorical accounting for all trust accounts, regardless of amount, and \nauthorizes an Indian tribe to manage Indian trust funds or trust assets \nthrough contracts or compacts. The trust responsibility of the \nSecretary or the trust status of funds and assets is not terminated but \na voluntary option of cobeneficiary management is allowed if a tribe \nchooses that option.\n  A clear line of authority for trust management is established by \nelevating the Assistant Secretary of Indian Affairs to Deputy Secretary \nof Indian Affairs status. The special trustee's responsibilities are \ntransferred to the Deputy Secretary, and the special trustee is \nterminated as intended in the 1994 act.\n  Finally, a temporary congressional commission is created to review \ntrust funds management by the Department of the Interior. Comprised of \n12 members, it will review and assess Federal management of trust funds \nand provide recommendations relating to the administrative and \nmanagement duties of the Department.\n  It is our hope that this proposal will encourage more constructive \ndialog among the Congress, the Interior Department, and Indian country \non the\n\n[[Page S9968]]\n\ntrust management problem and lead to a true consensus solution. With \nthat goal in mind, the bill has been reviewed by representatives of the \nGreat Plains tribes, the Native American Rights Fund, the National \nCongress of American Indians, the InterTribal Monitoring Association, \nand the tribes of Arizona.\n  With respect to the Great Plains tribes, I would like to note that \nMike Jandreau, chairman of the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe, has been a \nparticularly eloquent advocate and effective champion of trust reform. \nMike and Cheyenne River Sioux tribal chairman, Harold Frazier, led very \nproductive working sessions with tribal leaders from South Dakota, \nNorth Dakota, and Nebraska that both raised awareness of the importance \nof this issue and built support for the bill that is being introduced \ntoday.\n  I commend the commitment and contribution of the participating Great \nPlains tribal leaders who have been an integral part of a public \nprocess that will not stop until the trust management problem is \nsolved. The McCain-Daschle-Johnson bill is intended to contribute to \nthis result.\n  It should also be noted and understood that we are not addressing the \nCobell litigation or settlement issues in this bill. Our focus is the \nbroader trust responsibility of the Department of the Interior.\n  The issues of trust reform and reorganization within the Bureau of \nIndian Affairs are nothing new to us here on Capitol Hill or in Indian \ncountry. Collectively, we have endured many efforts--some well \nintentioned and some clearly not--to fix, reform, adjust, improve, \nstreamline, downsize, and even terminate the Bureau of Indian Affairs \nand its trust activities.\n  These efforts have been pursued under both Republican and Democratic \nadministrations. Unfortunately, they have rarely included meaningful \ninvolvement of tribal leadership or respected the Federal Government's \ntreaty obligation to tribes.\n  Restoring accountability and efficiency to trust management is a \nmatter of fundamental justice. Nowhere do the principles of self-\ndetermination and tribal sovereignty come more into play than in the \nmanagement and distribution of trust funds and assets.\n  I am deeply disappointed that this problem has not been solved to the \nsatisfaction of tribal leaders by now. That fight is not over.\n  An effective long-term solution to the trust problem must be based on \ngovernment-to-government dialog. The McCain-Daschle-Johnson bill will \nnot only provide the catalyst for meaningful tribal involvement in the \nsearch for solutions, it can also form the basis for true trust reform. \nI look forward to participating with tribal leaders, administration \nofficials, and my congressional colleagues in pursuit of this essential \nobjective.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Reed, and Mr. \n        Bingaman):\n  S. 1460. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \npreserve the effectiveness of medically important antibiotics used in \nthe treatment of human and animal diseases; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator Snowe, \nSenator Reed, and Senator Bingaman in introducing The Preservation of \nAntibiotics for Medical Treatment Act.\n  Our legislation is both important and timely because we face \nunprecedented challenges to our health and safety from deadly diseases. \nAs we have seen from SARS, new diseases can arise naturally and spread \nrapidly around the world. As we have seen from the anthrax attack, \ndiseases can also be spread by terrorists.\n  We rely heavily on miracle drugs and vaccines to protect us against \nboth of these threats. In fact, antibiotics are our strongest weapon in \ncombating deadly bacterial diseases. But we have failed for too long to \ndeal with a related and increasingly serous aspect of the problem the \nindiscriminate use of antibiotics for livestock and poultry which is \nreducing the effectiveness of these indispensable drugs that have \nbecome the crown jewels of modern medicine.\n  Every year, literally tons of antibiotics are routinely added to \nanimal feed to enhance growth, fatten animals, and fatten profits too. \nMounting scientific evidence, though, shows that nontherapeutic use of \nantibiotics in agricultural animals can lead to the development of \nantibiotic-resistant bacteria. These resistant bacteria are easily \ntransferred to people by tainted food, making it very difficult or \nimpossible to treat deadly infections.\n  The use of antibiotics in medicines began in the 1940s, and in the \nlast 60 years, many different antibiotics have been discovered and \nwidely used in treating patients. But the race has accelerated between \npatients and bacteria. Miracle drugs have saved countless lives but, \ninevitably, as their use in medicine increased, bacteria have developed \nresistance as well. Already, some older antibiotics have become useless \nin medicine.\n  There have also been cases of infections resistant even to some of \nthe newest and most powerful antibiotics. According to the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention, thousands of Americans die each year \nfrom antibiotic-resistant diseases. The widespread use of antibiotics \nin agriculture was clearly contributing to this serious problem. In \n1997, the World Health Organization recommended that antibiotics should \nnot be used to promote animal growth, although they could still be used \nto treat sick animals. Last month, McDonald's Corporation took a major \nstep in dealing with this problem. It announced a directive to its meat \nsuppliers to stop or reduce the use of antibiotics for growth promotion \nof livestock.\n  The legislation we propose will phase out nontherapeutic uses of \nmedically important antibiotics in livestock and poultry production, \nunless their manufacturers can demonstrate that they are no danger to \npublic health.\n  The bill applies the same strict standard to applications for \napproval of new animal antibiotics. It does not restrict the use of \nantibiotics to treat sick animals or to treat pets and other animals \nnot used for food.\n  There may well be certain circumstances in which the use of \nantibiotics briefly to prevent the spread of a specific disease in a \nlimited area is legitimate. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues as we move ahead on this legislation to ensure that we \nproperly distinguish the different uses of antibiotics for disease \nprevention.\n  The bill also recognizes that FDA is conducting needed studies to \nanalyze the risks of using specific antibiotics in raising animals. The \nagency's current risk analysis focuses on the antibiotic known as \nvirginiamycin. Our legislation allows such studies to be conducted in \ndetermining whether antibiotics can be used with a reasonable certainty \nof no harm, and we welcome FDA's scientific analysis of the use of \nthese products.\n  In addition, the bill authorizes Federal payments to small family \nfarms to defray the cost of compliance, and also authorizes research \nand demonstration projects to reduce the use of antibiotics in raising \nfood-producing animals. Finally, the bill provides a needed mechanism \nfor collecting data to monitor the use of antibiotics in animals, so \nthat we can stay ahead of the growing public health threat of \nantibiotic-resistant bacteria.\n  The American Medical Association and 300 other organizations support \nour legislation. At a time when the nation is relying heavily on \nantibiotics to protect our security from bioterrorism, we can't afford \nto squander these essential defenses. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis legislation, and I look forward to its enactment.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kennedy, in introducing legislation addressing \nthe critical issue of bacterial resistance to antibiotics arising from \noveruse of these valuable drugs in humans and animals.\n  Alexander Fleming's discovery of the antibacterial effects of \npenicillin in 1929 represented the dawning of a new era in medicine. In \nthe decades after its discovery, penicillin became a miracle drug--\nallowing physicians to cure diseases that previously would have been \nuntreatable--and literally saved millions of lives.\n  Antibiotics are crucial in curing a variety of common diseases that \ncould result in severe illness or even death if left untreated. The \nanthrax attacks\n\n[[Page S9969]]\n\nafter September 11 showed us another need for antibiotics that sadly is \na continuing threat in our global community--bioterrorism. Many of us \nin the Capitol relied on the effective treatment of antibiotics to \ncounteract exposure to the anthrax spores and maintain our health \nduring those weeks and months when our Nation was grieving the horrible \nimpact of terrorism in our homeland.\n  Unfortunately, decades after the discovery of penicillin and other \nantibiotics, diseases of bacterial origin remain a real and increasing \nthreat to public health. Overuse of medically important antibiotics in \nhumans and animals promotes resistance in bacteria. Infections caused \nby resistant bacteria cannot be treated with traditional antibiotics. \nIf left unchecked, the problem of bacterial resistance represents an \nimpending public health crisis.\n  Recogizing the public health threat, Congress already took steps to \ncurb antibiotic overuse in humans by amending the Public Health Service \nAct and the Public Health Threats and Emergencies Act. Unfortunately, \nthe issue of antibiotic overuse in animals has not been addressed in \nFederal law.\n  We recognize the value of antibiotics in treating disease in humans \nand animals. Unfortunately, it is common practice to put antibiotics, \nwhich are similar or identical to those used in human medicine, in the \nfood or water of healthy animals intended for human consumption to \npromote these animals' growth and compensate for their unsanitary \nconditions. This practice poses an environmental threat and jeopardizes \nthe effectiveness of these drugs in treating ill people and animals. \nOur legislation provides for the phased elimination of nontherapeutic \nuse of medically important antibiotics in food animals unless such \nusage is deemed safe through rigorous scientific evaluation.\n  Foodborne illness affects millions of Americans each year and is \nestimated to cost the economy up to $35 billion annually in medical \nexpenses and lost productivity alone. Tragically, the worst foodborne \nillnesses cause thousands of deaths and disproportionally target the \nvery young and the elderly each year in the United States. The impact \nof foodborne illness in developing countries is even more severe. By \nitself, the magnitude of this public health hazard necessitates action \nto ensure the safety of our food supply. I hope the improved data \ncollection and monitoring of antibiotics used in food animals included \nin our legislation will help provide a more complete picture of the \ncontributing factors to these devastating illnesses.\n  Our legislation provides for research and demonstration grants to \ncolleges and universities to exploit advances in biotechnology and \nanimal science to discover new, safer methods of inexpensive, \nresponsible agricultural productivity. We appreciate the good \nintentions of the many farmers across our Nation, and our legislation \nestablishes transition funds to help these families and businesses \nimplement changes that will benefit us all.\n  I have received numerous letters from groups and individuals in Maine \nwho were concerned that the overuse of antibiotics in animal \nagriculture was not being actively addressed by Congress. I appreciate \nall who took the time to voice their concerns to me. I extend my \npersonal thanks to all who have invested so much time and energy in \neducating Members of Congress as well as the public on this critical \nissue.\n  I am pleased to join Senator Kennedy in introducing legislation today \nthat will address this crucial issue. I applaud the steps that some \nbusinesses have taken voluntarily to discourage use of antibiotics in \nhealthy animals. It is my hope that our legislation as well as the \nvoluntary efforts by businesses across the Nation will help to ensure \nthat we have drugs available that are effective in treating diseases \nfor many years to come.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 1461. A bill to establish two new categories of nonimmigrant \nworkers, and for other purposes; to the committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, in the aftermath of the September 11 \nattacks, our Nation awoke to the realization that we are not as safe as \nwe once believed. Soon after, we began critical efforts to improve our \nhomeland security. Those efforts remain ongoing today. As we work to \nimprove the security of our homeland, securing our borders remains one \nof the most difficult and important challenges facing our Nation today. \nThe simple fact is, our borders are not secure, and no amount of money, \nequipment, or manpower alone will not ensure the safety of our Nation.\n  Over the past several years, I have supported many efforts to improve \nborder security and address the repercussions of poor enforcement and \nfailed immigration policies. It is imperative that we not shirk from \nwhat are Federal responsibilities. We must address the many unfunded \nmandates born by States and local communities because control of \nimmigration is principally the responsibility of the Federal \nGovernment. We must continue efforts designed to improve infrastructure \nand technology at and between our ports of entry as well as enhance \ncoordination between Federal, State and local law enforcement \npersonnel. However, without comprehensive immigration reform, all of \nthese efforts will be ineffective and meaningless.\n  In order to address these concerns and to balance the need to secure \nour borders while addressing the inconsistencies and contradictions of \nour Nation's immigration policy, I am introducing the Border Security \nand Immigration Improvement Act. This bill is the first comprehensive \nimmigration reform package introduced this Congress, and I hope that it \nwill serve to initiate an important and necessary dialog so that we may \naddress the security needs of our country and reform our failed \nimmigration system.\n  The Border Security and Immigration Improvement Act establishes two \nnew visa programs. One addresses individuals wishing to enter the \nUnited States to work on a short-term basis while the other will be \navailable for the undocumented immigrants currently residing in the \nU.S.\n  Fully cognizant of the failures and abuses of previous temporary \nworker programs, I am committed to ensuring that this new program \nprevents abuse and protects the rights of workers. Important \nprotections are built into the new visa program. Complete portability \nacross all sectors will allow workers the freedom to leave abusive \nemployers and seek work elsewhere. This program would allow employers \nto immediately apply for permanent resident status on behalf of the \nemployee, but unlike previous programs, this bill would allow workers \nself-petition after 3 years so that no employer could use residency \nstatus to manipulate and abuse any worker. Additionally, all U.S. labor \nlaws are applicable to ensure full worker protection.\n  In another departure from previous visa programs, this legislation \ndoes not put a finite number on the available visas, rather it is \ndesigned to allow the market to dictate the need for workers. Through \nthe establishment of a job registry system, U.S. employers in need of \nworkers can post available jobs on this registry. To ensure that U.S. \nworkers do not lose out on valuable job opportunities, each job posted \non the registry must be available to U.S. workers for a minimum of 14 \ndays before it is open to a foreign worker. Additionally, to ensure \nthat we do not incentivize employers to look abroad for labor that is \nless expensive than the domestic workforce, all employers will be \ncharged a fee for the worker's visa.\n  The second visa program included in this bill addresses the estimated \n6 to 10 million people currently residing in the United States. Today, \nundocumented immigrants live in constant fear, in a shadowy underground \nthat affords them limited opportunities and frequently leads to both \nexploitation and abuse. Establishing a process by which this population \ncan voluntarily come forward and seek legal status is a necessary \ncomponent to comprehensive immigration reform and ensuring the safety \nof our Nation.\n  Under this bill, every undocumented individual currently residing in \nthe U.S. will have the opportunity to obtain a visa authorizing them to \nremain in the United States and work for 3 years, after which time they \nmay apply for the temporary worker visa program which has a built in \npath to permanent legal residency.\n  Every year, millions of people enter this country legally, in a \nmonitored\n\n[[Page S9970]]\n\nand controlled manner. Although a majority enter legally, an increasing \nnumber of people risk their lives to cross our borders illegally. \nAccording to the U.S. Border Patrol apprehension statistics, it is \nestimated that almost 4 million people crossed our borders illegally in \n2002. The majority of these people are seeking the American dream, \nlooking for a good paying job that will enable them to provide a better \nlife for themselves and their families. We must recognize that as long \nas there are jobs available and employers in need of workers, people \nwill continue to migrate. Our Nation was built by immigrants, and like \nthose who came hundreds of years ago, this population represents a \nsignificant portion of our workforce.\n  In recent years, improved security and enhanced infrastructure in \nCalifornia and Texas have created a funneling effect through the \nSonoran desert, which straddles Arizona and the Mexican State of \nSonora. This is easily the most treacherous portion of the southern \nborder, and in recent years, it has become more dangerous. Last fiscal \nyear, an estimated 320 people died crossing the southern border into \nthis country, 145 of those deaths were in the Arizona desert. Since \nlast October, over 200 people have died, 113 along the Arizona border. \nThe Arizona Republic found that undocumented immigrants are seven times \nas likely to die crossing the Arizona-Mexico border now than they were \n5 years ago.\n  Many people desperate to cross the border pay large sums of money to \nhuman smugglers who guarantee their entrance into the U.S. Our Nation \nwitnessed the extreme danger of human smugglers first hand in May when \n100 people were found packed into a tractor trailer truck at a truck \nstop in Victoria, TX. These people, abandoned by their smugglers, were \ntrapped for hours in the extreme desert heat. Nineteen people died as a \nresult.\n  These are not merely numbers, these figures represent men, women, and \nchildren. This unnecessary loss of human life deserves our Nation's \nattention and should compel all of us to action. Our current border and \nimmigration policies create a contradictory situation whereby we \nattempt to keep people from crossing our borders illegally but reward \nthose who survive the dangerous journey with bountiful employment \nopportunities. This system is not sustainable.\n  In addition to the human tragedy, this mass migration also represents \na threat to our national security. Although over 99 percent of the \npeople crossing our borders do not intend to harm Americans, we must be \ncognizant of the fact that a small number do. As long as we are unable \nto control and monitor who enters our country and what they bring in, \nAmericans will not be safe. We must establish a system by which to \nallow people seeking work to enter the country in a safe manner, \nthrough controlled ports of entry--freeing up Federal agents to monitor \nthe border and focus their efforts on the individuals who do pose a \npotential threat to our national security.\n  We can no longer afford to bury our heads in the sand and expect this \nproblem to go away. Anyone who has visited the border and seen the \nchallenges we face first hand or who hears of the number of unnecessary \ndeaths, must recognize that we can no longer ignore this problem. It is \ntime we dispense with partisan politics and put human lives and our \nnational security above special interest groups. I hold no illusions. \nReforming our Nation's immigration laws will not be an easy task. This \nwill be a long and arduous process, however we must not let the \ndifficulty dissuade us from trying, and this legislation represents a \nmeaningful first step. I am committed to this issue and to working \ntowards a balanced solution to this crisis.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1461\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to adjust the boundary of the Cumberland Island \nWilderness, to authorize tours of the Cumberland Island National \nSeashore, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nCumberland Island National Seashore Wilderness Boundary Act. With the \nintroduction of this important legislation, we will be able to better \npreserve and manage one of Georgia's unique islands. The purpose of \nthis bill is to allow for more efficient management of the Cumberland \nIsland National Seashore and to preserve the historical and ecological \nsignificance of the island.\n  As one of Georgia's Golden Isles, Cumberland Island is truly a \nhistorical and ecological masterpiece encompassing 36,415 acres. The \nisland contains a 5000-year history of human habitation that is \ninscribed into the natural landscape of the island. This history can be \nseen by visiting the early Indian burial grounds to the vast \nplantations that were once home to abundant corn, cotton, and rice \nfields, as well as the workers who tended the land. And we cannot \nforget about the rich ecological environment found on Cumberland \nIsland. It is one that many sea turtles, marsh microorganisms, and \nabundant shore birds call home amongst the numerous dune fields, salt \nmarshes, and maritime forest areas. These historic and natural \nresources are important elements of Cumberland Island's past, present, \nand future.\n  As many of you know, I am an avid outdoorsman and conservationist. I \nam a supporter of sound wildlife management and the preservation of our \nNation's unique and complex history. Another key point that I wish to \nmake is that this history has been preserved for all of us to see and \nexperience. Under the enactment of Public Law 97-250, 96 Stat. 709, in \n1982, Congress designated approximately 8,840 acres of Cumberland \nIsland as wilderness under the national wilderness preservation system \nand authorized an additional 11,718 acres to be designated as potential \nwilderness. Currently, the main road on the island passes through the \ndesignated wilderness area. Due to the location of the designated \nwilderness area, access to historic settlements such as: Plum Orchard \nMansion and Dungeness, both former homes of Andrew Carnegie \ndescendants; the First African Baptist Church established in 1893 and \nrebuilt in the 1930s; as well as the High Point/Half Moon Bluff \nhistoric district, is severely restricted.\n\n[[Page S9974]]\n\nSuch restrictions make it extremely difficult for visitors to \nexperience this unique collection of Georgia's history and diverse \necology. I believe that history and nature can best be appreciated when \none is given the opportunity to experience it first hand. It is vitally \nimportant for the unique history and ecology of Cumberland Island to be \nproperly managed and protected so that many generations to come will be \nable to experience this beautiful treasure found in the State of \nGeorgia.\n  The nature and history of Cumberland Island needs to be preserved and \nmanaged in such a manner that will allow many generations to experience \nthis golden treasure of Georgia. The Cumberland Island National \nSeashore Wilderness Boundary of 2003 will do just that. This bill will \nallow for greater access to key areas of the island by removing the \nMain Road, the Spur Road to Plum Orchard, as well as the North Cut Road \nfrom the previously designated wilderness area. Further, the bill \nallows for the addition of 210 acres to the wilderness area upon \nacquisition by the National Park Service. I should clarify and stress \nthat this bill does not suggest that we open this land to the public \nfor further habitation and degradation of the area's natural history \nand ecological habitats. The purpose of this bill is very simple--I \nwant to improve the management and preservation of Cumberland Island's \nhistory and diverse ecosystem so that others in the future will be able \nto experience and learn about the treasures of the Golden Isles and all \nthat they represent.\n  It is crucial that Cumberland Island's history and unique ecosystem \nis properly managed and protected. We want to ensure that these \ntreasures are available to all of our Nation's citizens to experience \nand enjoy. This bill allows Congress to address this issue and to make \nthe necessary changes so that Cumberland Island can remain as one of \nGeorgia's treasured Golden Isles for many years to come.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HAGEL (for himself and Mr. Dorgan):\n  S. 1464.

Wilma showed \nthe world that hard work and determination could overcome nearly \nanything.\n  Wilma was inducted into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame in \n1973 and received the Humanitarian of the Year Award of the Special \nOlympics in 1985. She was the first woman to ever receive the National \nCollegiate Athletic Association's Silver Anniversary Award in 1987. And \nin 1989 earned the Jackie Robinson Image Award of the National \nAssociation for the Advancement of Colored People. Wilma remains the \nonly woman ever to have received the National Sports Award, which she \nwas granted in 1993.\n  Wilma Rudolph is an inspiration to all Tennesseans and is eminently \ndeserving of the Congressional Gold Medal.\n  I urge my colleagues to confer this well earned honor.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1465\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to facilitate the transfer of land in the State of \nAlaska, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the Alaska Land Transfer Acceleration \nAct of 2003 will transfer millions of acres of land to Alaska Natives, \nthe State of Alaska and to Native Corporations by 2009. The Federal \nagencies in Alaska have management jurisdiction of over 63 percent of \nthe State. It is time to transfer these public lands from Federal \nGovernment control to private ownership. This legislation creates a \nstrategic plan for the Bureau of Land Management to finally resolve \nlong-standing land survey, land entitlement issues and land claims \nissues, some of which date back to 1906. Since 1906 Congress has \nenacted other legislation that requires the BLM to transfer public \nlands to Alaska Natives, the State of Alaska and to Alaska Native \nCorporations.\n  The land conveyance program is the largest and most complex of any in \nUnited States history. For many years, BLM's primary goal was to convey \ntitle to unsurveyed lands to the State and Native Corporations by \ntentative approval and interim conveyance, respectively. This \nmanagement practice allowed the State and Native Corporations to manage \ntheir lands, subject only to the survey of the final boundary.\n  This legislation will accelerate release of lands for conveyance to \nNative coporations and the State of Alaska. It will complete land \npatterns to allow land owners to more efficiently manage their land. It \nwill clarify that certain minerals can be transferred to Native \nlandowners. And frankly, split estates can be minimized. The University \nwill be given the opportunity to select the remaining Federal interests \nin lands the University already owns, that will likely produce economic \nopportunities not presently available under this land lock.\n  The complexity of land patterns and uses in Alaska is evident in the \npresence of federal mining claims that are within lands owned or \nselected by the State of Alaska. Our legislation would clarify miners' \nright to convert from Federal to State claims without jeopardizing \nongoing mining operations. At the same time, BLM would be allowed to \nexpedite conveyances to the State. Properly maintained Federal claims \nwill continue to be excluded from conveyance. Entitlements to the State \nwill remain secure. The miner will decide when or whether to convert \nhis claims to State claims.\n  For too many years, individuals, Native corporations and the State \nhave been patiently waiting to receive title to their land. In 1958 the \nState of Alaska was promised 104 million acres of land, and has to date \nreceived final title to only 42 million acres; less than half of what \nis due. Of the 44 million acres of land that the Native Corporations \nare entitled to, only about a third has been conveyed or about 15 \nmillion acres. Worse, yet, are the 2,500 parcels pending title to \nNative individuals out of 16,000 parcels. Almost 14,000 parcels are \nstill awaiting basic adjudication to even make a determination of land \ntransfer. Too much land is hanging in the balance that must be surveyed \nand patented to rightful owners. Between now and the sunset of this \nbill in 2009, more than 89 million acres must be surveyed on State and \nNative Corporation lands. The lands that are awaiting survey do not \ninclude lands that will eventually be titled to Native individuals; \nthese lands too must first be surveyed.\n  While some Native allotments have been conveyed, issues have arisen \nto challenge final conveyance to the land. Such challenges have \nincluded whether actual use of land occurred; the location of the \nparcel; or even who should receive title to the land. Sadly, some of \nthe original Native allotment applicants have died waiting to receive \ntitle or have disputes resolved. Oftentimes, the death of an applicant \ncan present\n\n[[Page S9976]]\n\nthe agency with chain of title questions to determine who the rightful \nheir is, causing further delays to getting the lands transferred.\n  Some disputes have been easier to handle than others, resulting in \nsettlement through an administrative appeals process. The Federal \nagencies have been hampered by many administrative and legal obstacles. \nThere have been court decisions and lawsuit settlements, new \nlegislation creating new rights of changing rules midstream. Old cases \nhave been reopened that have created new land patterns for adjudication \nand survey. The administrative appeals process was designed to be \nefficient, and immediately accessible to individuals who believe they \nhave been adversely impacted by actions taken by the BLM. It too many \ninstances this process has resulted in long delays that hinder the BLM \nfrom finalizing its work. In the meantime, the applicant suffers at the \nhands of a process that generally takes years just for a case to be \nreviewed for resolution.\n  This legislation will provide the BLM with broader authority for \nsolving many of the problems associated with land claims affecting all \ndisputes that occur in Alaska. When disputes arise over the \nadjudication of land claims, BLM needs to have full authority to work \nin a more collaborative environment with its clientele.\n  This legislation will provide the BLM the opportunity to caucus with \nits clients. It will allow for a process of negotiation to gain \nconsensus on final resolution of land applications. What has been \nmissing all these years is the flexibility for the Federal agencies to \nwork in such a cooperative fashion. This new process is intended to be \nfree of complicated rules that have plagued the agency to finding \nsolutions. Resolution and closure must come quicker.\n\n  Mr. President, I give great credit to the management and the \nemployees of the BLM Alaska for their efforts over the years to \ntransfer the land. They have proven to be dedicated and committed \npublic servants. I believe they have tried to do the right thing; they \njust need the tools and the resources. They want to close the books on \nthe Alaska conveyance program once and for all, and this bill will help \nthem achieve that goal by 2009.\n  In 1973 the Alaska Native Claims Appeal Board was established. The \nBoard had jurisdiction over decisions made under the Alaska Native \nClaims Settlement Act. The Board consisted of four judges, and was able \nto decide a case within 3 to 6 months of the close of briefing. It \nusually had a small backlog. While the Board was able to act in a \nfairly responsive manner, there was criticism the Board did not \ncorrectly apply general Federal land law precedent and that some of \ntheir rulings were inconsistent with policy of the Department of the \nInterior. The Board was dissolved in 1981. The backlog of cases was not \nnecessarily attributed to Native Corporation cases; most of the backlog \nrelated to all other matters. This legislation will create a hearings \nand appeals process located in Alaska. Presently, there are almost 100 \nappeals of Alaska decisions pending before the Interior Board of Land \nAppeals. It usually takes this Board several years to rule on a case, \nsometimes as long as 3 to 5 years. The present process is broken. There \nshould never be a process that controls the fate of someone's \nlivelihood. Matters requiring resolution must not sit and languish for \nyears without resolution. This practice is unacceptable and \nunreasonable.\n  Additionally, more than 20 cases are pending before Administrative \nLaw judges at various Office of Hearings Appeals offices--Virginia, \nMinnesota and Utah. The cases currently in their hands are Native \nallotments and mining claims. Substantial delays have resulted from the \nslow pace of scheduling hearings in Alaska. Establishing an Alaska \nhearings unit to handle all Alaska appeals would significantly speed up \nthe current process. Such a new process would be able to routinely \nissue decisions within 3 to 6 months of the close of briefing.\n  Challenges likely to emerge on land actions requiring judicial review \nwill be handled by judges located in Alaska. Moreover, having judges \nlocated in Alaska, conducting Alaska business, would ensure an \nunderstanding of the special laws that are applicable to Alaska. In \naddition, this process would include all land transfer matters, not \njust claims under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act.\n  To achieve the acceleration of land conveyances, we must be able to \ncount on a consistent level of funding. We do not want any aspect of \nthe acceleration plan to be hampered. As I pointed out earlier, almost \n90 million acres must be surveyed between now and 2009. The BLM is the \nsingle agency of the Federal Government that is charged with the \nauthority and responsibility for surveys and land title record keeping. \nOfficial survey plats are the Government's record of the boundaries of \nan area and the description of such surveyed land is known as the legal \nland description. Land title or patents are based on such plats of \nsurvey. And, until the land is surveyed, the Alaska Natives, the State \nof Alaska and the Native Corporations will still be waiting way off \ninto the future for this work to be finalized.\n  The Alaska Land Transfer Acceleration Act of 2003 imposes very strict \nprovisions on the agency to complete land conveyances by 2009 to Alaska \nNatives, the State of Alaska and to the Native Corporations. Some might \nview this plan as ambitious. I view it as being long overdue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/25/senate-section/article/S9976-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9976]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 200--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT CONGRESS \nSHOULD ADOPT A CONFERENCE AGREEMENT ON THE CHILD TAX CREDIT AND ON TAX \n                     RELIEF FOR MILITARY PERSONNEL\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Baucus, Mr. \nKennedy, Mr. Graham of Florida, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Corzine, and Mr. \nLeahy) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the \nCommittee on Finance:\n\n                              S.

Con. Res. 61\n\n       Whereas Constantino Brumidi, born in Rome, Italy, on July \n     26, 1805, landed at New York Harbor on September 18, 1852, as \n     a political exile, making his flight from Italy to the United \n     States because of his love for liberty;\n       Whereas Constantino Brumidi's love for his adopted country \n     led him to seek citizenship 2 years after his arrival;\n       Whereas in 1855, Constantino Brumidi began his artistic \n     work in the Capitol, and spent more than 25 years of his life \n     painting, decorating, and beautifying the corridors, \n     committee rooms, and Rotunda of the Capitol;\n       Whereas Constantino Brumidi created many magnificent \n     paintings and decorations, depicting the history, inventions, \n     values, and ideals of the United States, thus enhancing the \n     dignity and beauty of the Capitol and inspiring millions of \n     visitors;\n       Whereas in 1865, Constantino Brumidi painted, in just 11 \n     months, his masterpiece ``The Apotheosis of Washington'' in \n     the canopy of the eye of the Capitol dome;\n       Whereas in 1871, Constantino Brumidi created the first \n     tribute to an African-American in the Capitol when he placed \n     the figure of Crispus Attucks at the center of his painting \n     of the Boston Massacre;\n       Whereas in 1877, at the age of 72, Constantino Brumidi \n     began his last work, the fresco frieze encircling the top of \n     the Rotunda, and 3 years later fell from a slipped \n     scaffolding and was never able to return to work;\n       Whereas Constantino Brumidi died as a result of this \n     experience 3 months later in February 1880;\n       Whereas Constantino Brumidi has been called ``the \n     Michelangelo of the Capitol'' by historians; and\n       Whereas the year 2005 marks the 200th anniversary of the \n     birth of Constantino Brumidi, as well as the 150th \n     anniversary of the beginning of his artistic career in the \n     Capitol and the 125th anniversary of his death: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the President is authorized and requested \n     to issue a proclamation commemorating the 200th anniversary \n     of the birth of Constantino Brumidi and calling upon the \n     people of the United States, State and local governments, and \n     interested organizations to commemorate this anniversary with \n     appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, Saturday, July 26, marks the 198th \nanniversary of the birth of Constantino Brumidi, the great artist who \nhas been called the Michelangelo of the Capitol. When, in 2 years, the \n200th anniversary of Brumidi's birth is at hand, I believe the \nPresident should issue a proclamation commemorating Brumidi's life. \nToday, I am introducing a resolution authorizing such a proclamation.\n  Constantino Brumidi was born in Rome in 1805 and immigrated to \nAmerica in 1852. He began his artistic work in the Capitol in 1855 and, \nfor the next 25 years, he labored to produce some of the most bold and \nmoving frescoes and murals the world has ever seen. His paintings and \ndecorations depict the history, inventions, values and ideals of the \nUnited States immeasurably enhancing the dignity and beauty of the \nCapitol. He designed and decorated on House and Senate committee rooms \nin the Capitol, as well as the Senate Reception Room, the Office of the \nVice President and the President's Room. In 1856, Brumidi began \ncreating designs for Senate corridors based on a loggia by Raphael in \nthe Vatican, carefully integrating American motifs into a classical \nframework.\n  He was very proud of becoming an American citizen and is reported to \nhave said: ``I no longer wish for fame and fortune.

(a) Congress finds that--\n       (1) emergency responders are the first line of defense in \n     protecting our Nation against terrorist attacks;\n       (2) the Department of Homeland Security uses population as \n     a factor when allocating grant funding to States and local \n     governments for emergency responders;\n       (3) population plays an important role in both formula and \n     discretionary grants, which are administered by the \n     Department of Homeland Security;\n       (4) the number of people in a city or State often differs \n     from estimates by the Census Bureau;\n       (5) large groups of tourists regularly visit many American \n     cities and States, but are not included in the resident \n     population of these cities and States; and\n       (6) the monetary needs of emergency responders are directly \n     related to the amount of people they are responsible to \n     protect.\n       (b) It is the sense of the Senate that the Secretary of \n     Homeland Security should take into account tourist population \n     as a factor when determining resource needs and potential \n     vulnerabilities for the purpose of allocating funds for \n     discretionary and formula grants.\n       Sec. 621. Not later than 30 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Under Secretary for Emergency \n     Preparedness and Response shall--\n       (1) review the damage survey reports and project worksheets \n     relating to the damages and costs incurred by the University \n     of North Dakota as a result of the April 1997 flooding in \n     North Dakota, which is classified by Emergency Preparedness \n     and Response as DR-1174-ND; and\n       (2) submit a report on the efforts of the Directorate of \n     Emergency Preparedness and Response to resolve any \n     outstanding claims by the University of North Dakota relating \n     to the reports described in paragraph (1) to the Committees \n     on Appropriations of the Senate and House of Representatives.\n       Sec. 622.

Davidson;\n       Whereas, also in 1903, Harley and the Davidson brothers \n     completed 2 additional motorcycles in a makeshift ``factory'' \n     shed in the Davidson family's backyard at the corner of 38th \n     Street and Highland Boulevard in Milwaukee, Wisconsin;\n       Whereas the design features and construction quality of the \n     early Harley-Davidson motorcycles proved significantly more \n     innovative and durable than most other motorcycles of the \n     era, giving Harley-Davidson a distinct competitive advantage;\n       Whereas in 1905, Walter Davidson won the first of many \n     motorcycle competition events, giving rise to a strong \n     tradition of victory in motorcycle racing that continues \n     today;\n       Whereas in 1906, Harley-Davidson Motor Company constructed \n     its first building, financed by the Davidsons' uncle James \n     McClay, on the site of the Company's current world \n     headquarters one block north of the Davidson home site, and \n     manufactured 50 motorcycles that year;\n       Whereas in 1907, Harley-Davidson Motor Company was \n     incorporated and its 18 employees purchased shares;\n       Whereas in 1908, the first motorcycle for police duty was \n     delivered to the Detroit Police Department, beginning Harley-\n     Davidson's long and close relationship with law enforcement \n     agencies;\n       Whereas in 1909, to enhance power and performance, Harley-\n     Davidson added a second cylinder to its motorcycle, giving \n     birth to its hallmark 45-degree V-Twin configuration and the \n     legendary Harley-Davidson sound;\n       Whereas during the years 1907 through 1913, manufacturing \n     space at least doubled every year, reaching nearly 300,000 \n     square feet by 1914;\n       Whereas Arthur Davidson, during Harley-Davidson's formative \n     years, set up a worldwide dealer network that would serve as \n     the focal point of the company's ``close to the customer'' \n     philosophy;\n       Whereas Harley-Davidson early in its history began \n     marketing motorcycles as a sport and leisure pursuit, thus \n     laying the groundwork for long-term prosperity;\n       Whereas in 1916, Harley-Davidson launched ``The \n     Enthusiast'' magazine, which today is the longest running \n     continuously published motorcycle magazine in the world;\n       Whereas also in 1916, Harley-Davidson motorcycles saw their \n     first military duty in skirmishes in border disputes along \n     the United States border with Mexico;\n       Whereas in World War I, Harley-Davidson supplied 17,000 \n     motorcycles for dispatch and scouting use by the Allied armed \n     forces, and whereas the first Allied soldier to enter Germany \n     after the signing of the Armistice was riding a Harley-\n     Davidson motorcycle;\n       Whereas by 1920, Harley-Davidson was the world's largest \n     motorcycle manufacturer, both in terms of floor space and \n     production, with continual engineering and design innovation;\n       Whereas during the Great Depression of the 1930s, the \n     company survived when all but 1 other domestic motorcycle \n     manufacturer failed, on the strength of its product quality, \n     the loyalty of its employees, dealers, and customers, steady \n     police and commercial business, and a growing international \n     presence;\n       Whereas in 1936, Harley-Davidson demonstrated foresight, \n     resolve, and faith in the future by introducing the company's \n     first overhead valve engine, the ``Knucklehead'' as it would \n     come to be known, on its Model EL motorcycle, thus \n     establishing the widely recognized classic Harley Davidson \n     look and the company's reputation for styling;\n       Whereas Harley-Davidson workers in 1937 elected to be \n     represented by the United Auto Workers of America, thus \n     launching a proud tradition of working with Harley-Davidson \n     to further build the company through advocacy and the \n     development of effective programs and policies;\n       Whereas William H. Davidson, son of the late founder \n     William A. Davidson, became president of Harley-Davidson in \n     1942 and would lead the company until 1971;\n       Whereas Harley-Davidson built more than 90,000 motorcycles \n     for United States and Allied armed forces use during World \n     War II, earning 4 Army-Navy ``E'' Awards for excellence in \n     wartime production;\n       Whereas Harley-Davidson, during the 1950s and 1960s, \n     recharged its sales and popularity with new models, including \n     the Sportster and the Electra Glide, new engines, and other \n     technological advances;\n       Whereas the Company developed the concept of the ``factory \n     custom'' motorcycle with the 1971 introduction of the Super \n     Glide and the 1977 Low Rider, under the design leadership of \n     William ``Willie G'' Davidson, vice president of Styling and \n     grandson of company founder William A. Davidson;\n       Whereas since 1980, as a national corporate sponsor of the \n     Muscular Dystrophy Association, Harley-Davidson has raised \n     more than $40,000,000 through company, dealer, customer, and \n     supplier contributions, to fund research and health services;\n       Whereas in 1981, a group of 13 Harley-Davidson executives, \n     led by chairman and CEO Vaughn Beals purchased Harley-\n     Davidson from its then corporate parent AMF Incorporated;\n       Whereas by 1986, Harley-Davidson, against incredible odds, \n     restored the company's reputation for quality and innovation \n     and returned the company to vitality, thus ensuring a highly \n     successful initial public stock offering;\n       Whereas throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Harley-Davidson \n     became a national role model for positive labor-management \n     relations, product innovation, manufacturing quality and \n     efficiency, and phenomenal growth;\n       Whereas President Ronald Reagan, President William J. \n     Clinton, and President George W. Bush all have visited \n     Harley-Davidson manufacturing facilities and extolled the \n     example set by Harley Davidson through its practices;\n       Whereas the Harley Owners Group, with more than 800,000 \n     members and 1,200 chapters worldwide, is celebrating its 20th \n     anniversary year in 2003 as a driving force in the company's \n     heralded ``close to the customer'' operating philosophy; and\n       Whereas Harley-Davidson Motor Company is today the world's \n     leading seller of large displacement (651 cc plus) \n     motorcycles, with annual revenues in excess of \n     $4,000,000,000, annual motorcycle shipments in excess of \n     290,000 units, strong international sales, and 17 consecutive \n     years of annual revenue and earnings growth since becoming a \n     publicly held company: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the achievements of Harley-Davidson Motor \n     Company, widely regarded as a tremendous American business \n     success story and one of the top performing companies in \n     America, as its employees, retirees, suppliers, dealers, \n     customers, motorcycle enthusiasts, and friends worldwide \n     commemorate and celebrate its 100th anniversary milestone;\n       (2) recognizes the great impact that Harley-Davidson has \n     had on the business, social, and cultural landscape and lives \n     of Americans and citizens of all nations, as a quintessential \n     icon of Americana; and\n       (3) congratulates the Harley-Davidson Motor Company for \n     this achievement and trusts that Harley-Davidson will have an \n     even greater impact in the 21st century and beyond as a \n     leading force for innovative business practices and products \n     that will continue to provide enjoyment, transportation, and \n     delight for generations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/25/senate-section/article/S9987-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9987]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 NATIONAL PURPLE HEART RECOGNITION DAY\n\n  A concurrent resolution (S.

Mr. President, for more than a century now, national \ncommentators of one type or another have stereotyped, mocked, and \nridiculed the people of Appalachia.\n  They continued to do so even as the region and its people were \nsavaged by Northeast industrialists, and as economic forces beyond \ntheir control resulted in massive gaps of poverty in the region. When I \nsay ``their control,'' I refer to its being beyond the control of the \npeople of Appalachia. The stereotyping of the Appalachian people as \ndim-witted, barefooted hillbillies who thrive on incest and moonshine \nallowed the Nation to laugh at and turn its back on the plight of a \npeople who were being robbed of their land and its resources. It \nprompted the Nation to perceive and to dismiss Appalachians as the \ninstigators rather the victims of their plight.\n  Television has certainly been a part of this Appalachian bashing. \n``Green Acres'' featured farming mountain folks conversing with a \ntalking pig. The ``Dukes of Hazzard'' featured stereotypical mountain \nfolk jumping into and out of cars, without bothering to open doors, and \na car horn that played Dixie.\n  Even ``The Waltons,''--remember the Waltons?--a series with numerous \nmorally uplifting episodes and storylines that promoted hard work, love \nof family, honesty, patriotism, and spirituality, can be faulted for \nits beautifully romanticized version of poverty. It portrayed poverty \nas a way of life that nurtures, rather than inhibits, that builds \ncharacter rather than denies opportunity.\n  I have seen poverty. I am one of poverty's children. I have known \npoverty, and poverty has known me. I can tell you that poverty is \nbeautiful only if you are not poor.\n  In this day and age of political correctness, Appalachians may be the \nlast remaining ethnic group that it is still socially acceptable to \nscorn, demean, stereotype, and joke about. If Jay Leno told such cruel, \nbigoted, and slanderous ethnic humor about any number of minority \ngroups that he does Appalachians, he would have more than the ratings \nof David Letterman about which to be concerned.\n  Incredibly, the Columbia Broadcasting System, CBS, is planning to air \na new program, ``The Real Beverly Hillbillies.'' For this program, the \nbrainchild of the CEO Leslie Moonves, CBS plans to pluck a poor, rural \nfamily from the hills of Appalachia and plop them down in a mansion in \nBeverly Hills so the Nation can laugh at them as they try to adjust to \nbig city life. I have read that CBS is already conducting so-called \n``hick-hunts'' in which they are searching for the perfect stereotype \nAppalachian family to amuse a national audience.\n  The insensitivity and mean spiritedness of this plan has already \naroused protests and criticisms from many segments of American society \nincluding Appalachian social action groups, labor unions, and various \nState and national legislators.\n  The United Mine Workers of America, the Steel Workers Union, and \nCommunication Workers have all protested the network's intent to \nridicule good people and make fun of their lifestyles. Forty-three \nMembers of the House of Representatives objected to the proposed \nprogram, saying it would be ``an insult to the millions of people \nliving in Appalachia.''\n  While I am outraged, I am even more curious about just what kind of \nbrain power went into proposing this show. I cannot help but chuckle \nwhen I picture these highly paid, supposedly educated television \ncorporate executives sitting around in a plush, ornate boardroom and \nthinking of such a stupid program. I am sure most of these fellows earn \nat least a six-figure income. Some of them probably went to Ivy League \nschools. And this is what they come up with?\n  It is not even original. It is a plagiarization of an old program, \nonly going a step further and using real people rather than actors.\n  Highly paid, highly educated television executives sitting around in \nan ornate boardroom and thinking of low-grade garbage such as this. If \nthis were my staff, I can tell you that I would be looking for some new \nstaffers.\n  But these CBS executives think it will be funny for city folk to sit \nback and watch country bumpkins try to blend into the culture of the \n``beautiful people'' of Rodeo Drive. Their anticipation is that \nAmericans will tune in and watch and just howl and howl as they watch a \npoor family from Appalachia adjust to the glitz and glamour of Beverly \nHills, to modern appliances, Gucci shoes, and Rolex watches. Boy, I can \nhardly hold back my laughter, being one of those people from \nAppalachia, being one of those country bumpkins.\n  One CBS executive remarked: ``Imagine the episode where they have to \ninterview maids.'' Boy, I am sure that episode will be a real knee \nslapper.\n  I have to ask, Is this the best they can do? Is this the best \ntelevision has to offer? Unfortunately, it is.\n\n  Just when you think the television standards can get no lower, they \ndo. Just when you start thinking these bottom feeders have cleansed the \nbottom and might try to move up the food chain, they find more garbage \nat the bottom to keep them there.\n  This is an Appalachian speaking to an Appalachian who sits in the \nchair today and presides over this great body with such dignity and \naplomb.\n  Television has become more than the ``vast wasteland'' FCC chairman \nNewton Minnow labeled it 42 years ago, it has become a waste.\n  This is the industry that brings us ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' \n``Fear Factor,'' and ``Jerry Springer.''\n  Fox Network has featured those unforgettable, morally uplifting hits, \n``Temptation Island,'' ``Joe Millionaire,'' and now the latest, ``Mr. \nPersonality,'' which features the show's hostess, the talented Monica \nLewinsky.\n  (Disturbance in the Visitors' Galleries.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Warner.) If the distinguished leader would \nindulge the Presiding Officer to give the usual admonishment to those \nprivileged to sit in the gallery of the Senate, they are not to enter \ninto vocal expressions or disaffections.\n  Mr. BYRD. I congratulate the Chair on upholding the rules of the \nSenate.\n\n[[Page S9990]]\n\n  Let them laugh. I am laughing, too.\n  If these executives are looking for new ideas for television reality \nshows, may I suggest a few. We could take highly paid, well-groomed \ntelevision network executives and relocate them to the sticks, where \nthey'd have to try to find a job with health care and pension benefits \nand enough pay to support a family, and adjust to everyday life in \nrural America. Now that would be funny! And, as the president of the \nUMWA, Cecil Roberts, has suggested, we could put them to work digging \ncoal from a 30-inch seam in a non-union coal mine. That too would be \nfunny!\n  I could suggest a program where Americans could watch television \nanchormen trying to get to work on time each day while driving on \nhilly, winding two-lane roads behind huge coal trucks going 5 miles an \nhour up steep hills. We would watch their frustration build and build \nand could take bets on when they would blow their tempers. We could \nwatch them get their $2,500 made-to-measure suits dirty as they are \nforced to change tires flattened by huge potholes created by those coal \ntrucks. We could watch them pull their cars into garages and get the \nestimates for repairs to the damage those potholes have done. Then we \ncould laugh hysterically as they present ``fleecing of America'' awards \nto Senators who try to get those highways improved.\n  Or we could watch nightly news programs featuring episodes of \njournalists embedded with a Marine battalion comprised of the sons and \ndaughters of Bush administration officials as they are being shot at in \nIraq and Afghanistan.\n  That, of course, would not be funny, but it would make an important \npoint that war is a lot more glamorous and macho when it is someone \nelse's kid you are sending into combat.\n  Television could be such a positive tool in our society and culture. \nIt could be doing so much good. It could be a powerful instrument to \nbring out the best in us, rather than appeal to our meanest and darker \nsides. It could be a creative instrument in elevating the standards and \nvalues of the American people rather than lowering them. I strongly \nurge the executives at CBS to reconsider their plans for the ``Real \nBeverly Hillbillies'' in favor a program that is enlightening, \neducational, and beneficial.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I should not take advantage of my two friends because \nI have been included in the order. I was given 20 minutes. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. If the Senator from West Virginia would like to make \nadditional remarks, I would suggest that Senator McCain had quick \nremarks he would like to make and I will be glad to have him go ahead \nof me.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD.

Mr. President, in April of this year, Senator Cochran, as \nchairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security, and \nI, as ranking member, recognized a looming shortfall in the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency, FEMA, disaster relief accounts. We urged \nthe President to release monies that he was holding up and also that he \nrequest funds to shore up the looming shortfall. Following severe \nfloods in 19 West Virginia counties, I wrote to the administration \nagain, this time pointing out that the Disaster Relief account would \nlikely be empty by the end of July. At the time that I wrote that \nletter, the disaster relief fund has a balance of $181 million. The \nbalance now, four weeks later, is a mere $89 million, and is expected \nto be completely exhausted by August 8th.\n  On July 7th, the President finally sent up an emergency supplemental \nrequest. After months of delay, the administration requested the \nadditional funds to assist recovery efforts in West Virginia and over \n300 other areas in every State of the Nation that have been hit hard by \nsevere rains, floods, and tornadoes. These funds will help citizens to \nget back on their feet. The communication from the White House \nrequested fiscal year 2003 emergency supplemental appropriations in the \namount of $1.9 billion for the Department of Homeland Security, \nAgriculture, Interior, and the National Aeronautics and Space \nAdministration, NASA.\n  The principal item in this request was $1.55 billion requested for \nthe Department of Homeland Security for FEMA to provide support for \n``ongoing disaster efforts and to ensure the capacity to respond to \nfuture disasters and emergencies.'' In a communication from Homeland \nSecurity Secretary Tom Ridge, dated July 24, 2003, the Department now \nestimates that it will exhaust existing funds by August 8th and that it \nhas no authority to provide assistance in the absence of \nappropriations.\n\n  The supplemental request also included an amount of $253 million for \nfighting wildfires. As some of my colleagues may recall, 42 major \nfires, which have consumed over 400,000 acres, are raging in 12 western \nStates. Officials at the Forest Service have told the Appropriations \nCommittee that their fire suppression budget is already $420 million \nshort of what they anticipate needing between now and the end of the \nfiscal year. Also included in the Administration's request is $50 \nmillion for unanticipated costs associated with the recovery and \ninvestigation of the Space Shuttle Columbia accident.\n  In order to expedite the processing of this supplemental, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Ted \nStevens, and I, as ranking member, worked together to assure the \nearliest availability of this emergency supplemental request by \nincorporating it into the fiscal year 2004 Legislative Branch \nappropriations bill. On July 9th, only 2 days after receiving the \nPresident's supplemental request, the Appropriations Committee ordered \nreported the Legislative Branch appropriations bill, which included the \nfull amount for disaster relief, emergency firefighting, and emergency \nNASA needs sought by the President in his July 7th communication, as \nwell as $100 million for a shortfall in AmeriCorps, a program which we \nwere told the administration supports. The AmeriCorps amendment was \nvoted on separately on the Senate floor and the funding was sustained \nby an overwhelming 71 to 21 vote. Susequently, the Legislative Branch \nappropriations bill, including the supplemental, was approved on July \n11th by the full Senate by a vote of 85 to 7, and conferees were \nappointed.\n  So what is the situation? The administration was slow in sending up \nthe emergency supplemental budget request. The Senate Appropriations \nCommittee, under the leadership of Senator Ted Stevens, responded \nquickly, acting within 2 days of receiving the request. And, within 2 \nadditional days, on July 11th, the measure was approved by the full \nSenate. We have been waiting for the other body ever since. It has been \n2 weeks since we acted on this bill in the Senate. We are advised that \nthe other body plans to depart for the August recess tonight.\n  What are we to do to cover the costs of recovering from disasters and \nfire emergencies for the remainder of the current fiscal year? FEMA has \nalready stopped making payments to States for $400 million of \ninfrastructure repairs in the 300 communities with outstanding natural \ndisasters. Communities have already been forced to put projects for \nrepairing damage from past disasters on hold.\n  In addition, if the Disaster Relief Fund is depleted by the end of \nJuly, which is just around the corner, that leaves 2 full months with \nno means of providing assistance to communities that may be hit hard by \nhurricanes, tornadoes, and other disasters or emergencies occurring in \nAugust and September. The Forest Service budget request of $253 million \nfor fighting 42 major fires in 12 western States is needed now.\n  Furthermore, twenty thousand AmeriCorps volunteers will lose their \npositions if supplemental funding is not approved. AmeriCorps \nvolunteers work in our schools teaching our children reading and math. \nThey provide\n\n[[Page S9991]]\n\ncare to our senior citizens, they help clean up our parks, they teach \nthe Nation's children and adults to read, and they provide other \nvaluable volunteer services to our communities. If we fail to provide \nthe necessary funds for AmeriCorps, we will unnecessarily be punishing \nthe volunteers, the communities that they serve and the children, \nelderly and the poor who benefit from the skills and energy of the \nvolunteers.\n\n  Some 2 weeks ago, the Senate responded positively and in a timely \nmanner to address these emergency requests. Now, the House is about to \npass a stripped-down supplemental appropriations bill in the amount of \n$983 million just for FEMA disaster relief, thus ignoring the Senate's \nsupplemental legislation enacted 2 weeks ago for wildfire fighting, \nNASA emergency funds, and AmercCorps funding.\n  I am distressed by the situation in which we find ourselves. It is \nnot the fault of the Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Mr. \nStevens. He has been trying to find a solution to this problem. The \nSenate has done its part to solve this problem. Citizens who find \nthemselves victimized by natural disasters and wildfires, and those \nindividuals and communities who would have benefited from the \nAmeriCorps program, do not appreciate the game-playing now taking place \nin the Congress.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I again thank the distinguished \nSenator from Alabama.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/25/senate-section/article/S9991-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9991-S9992]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HISTORY OF JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I think it is important, in light of \nSenator Hatch's remarks and some of the criticisms we have heard of his \nleadership in the Judiciary Committee a few days ago, that we recall a \nlittle history here on how we have handled judicial nominations in the \npast and why we are having problems today.\n  The criticism of Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch is simply \nunfair. He has stood foursquare for fairness, for constitutionality in \nthe process, and for good public policy as we go about confirmations. \nThat has been his record. When he chaired or was ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee during the 8 years of President Clinton's \nadministration, 377 Clinton nominees were confirmed to the bench. Only \none nominee was voted down. No nominee was voted down in his committee. \nNo nominee was filibustered in his committee.\n  When President Clinton left office, there were 41 judicial nominees \nwho had not yet been confirmed by this Senate. That is a very good \nrecord compared to the situation when former President Bush left \noffice. The Democrats controlled the Senate at that time, and 61 of \nformer President Bush's judicial nominees were left unconfirmed. Those \nnumbers are indisputable.\n  I know the distinguished Presiding Officer, Senator Warner from \nVirginia, remembers the complaints in the Republican Conference that \nSenator Hatch had been too generous to President Clinton's nominees. \nSeveral Republican colleagues fussed at Senator Hatch, and Members were \nsaying, ``you are moving too many,'' or, ``we need to block them,'' or, \n``let's consider a filibuster,'' or, ``let's change the blue slip rules \non circuit nominees,'' which would give individual Senators more power \nthan they historically had to block Clinton nominees.\n  There was a conference set aside for the very purpose of resolving \nthese issues. It was quite a battle. We discussed it for some time. \nSenator Hatch spoke passionately about the process, about what he \nthought the policy should be, about what he thought the law was, and \nabout what he thought the Constitution required. We finally voted, and \nwe voted not to filibuster and not to enhance the blue slip rule, \nthereby continuing the historic policies of this Senate. It was a very \nseriously contested matter. Senator Hatch argued passionately for his \nview, and at the time no one was sure how the vote would come out. But \nhis arguments won the day.\n  It is worth considering some other history about the confirmation \nprocess.\n  In the entire history of the American Republic, it is indisputable \nthat we have never had a filibuster of a circuit or a district judge. \nThis tactic was used for the first time 2 years ago by the Democrats. \nThey held a retreat not long after the 2000 election. The New York \nTimes reported that a group of liberal professors met with the \nDemocratic Senators, and they called on the Democrats to change the \nground rules about confirmations, to ratchet up the partisanship. They \nhad been complaining for 8 years that President Clinton's nominees \nweren't getting treated fairly. Overwhelmingly, I suggest, they were in \nerror in those complaints. But in any case, instead of saying ``we are \ngoing to act better now that we are in charge''--they were in charge of \nthe Senate for a little less than 2 years--the Democrats decided to \nchange the ground rules and make it even more difficult for President \nBush's nominees to be confirmed.\n  So let me tell you what they did. President Bush announced his first \ngroup of judicial nominations in May 2001. He nominated 11 superbly \nqualified lawyers. As a gesture of good faith, he included 2 Democrats \namong these 11 nominees. One, an African-American, had previously been \nnominated by President Clinton. These were men and women of \nextraordinary accomplishment, with high ratings by the American Bar \nAssociation, and with tremendous backgrounds.\n  For almost 2 years, only the two Democrats were moved promptly. \nVirtually all of the remaining nine of the eleven original nominees \nremained unconfirmed by 2002. They were not even voted out of \ncommittee. They were blocked in committee.\n  The Democrats appeared to change the burden of proof--now, the \njudicial nominee seemed to bear the burden of proving that he or she \nwas worthy of the judicial service. The chairman of the Courts \nSubcommittee then said that this would change the basic ground rules \nfor confirmation.\n  The Democrats also insisted on changes in the blue slip policy. The \nblue slip policy allows home State Senators certain powers to object to \nthe confirmation of Presidential nominees. The Democrats wanted to \nenhance that blue slip policy in order to block President Bush's \nnominees. They complained about it when President Clinton was in office \nand said it was wrong to use it as Republicans were properly doing. But \nwhen President Bush sent up nominees, they wanted to enhance the power \nof an individual Senator to block the President's nominees.\n  And then, of course, the Democrats started filibustering. They have \nalready filibustered Priscilla Owen and Miguel Estrada. Both of those \nextraordinarily qualified nominees languish on the floor today. Both \nwere given a unanimous well-qualified rating by the American Bar \nAssociation--a man and a woman of extraordinary achievement, great \nlegal experience, superb legal ability, and unquestioned integrity. Yet \nthe Democrats chose to filibuster each--the first filibusters in the \nhistory of this country for a circuit judge nominee.\n  Now, we have begun to see slowdowns in committee. The Democrats \neffectively have begun to try to filibuster in committee. They \nmisinterpreted Rule IV of the Judiciary Committee rules, saying the \nchairman could not call a matter up for a vote unless at least one \nmember of the Democratic minority agreed.\n  That rule was put in to make sure that a chairman had to bring a \nmatter up for a vote, whether the chairman wanted to do so or not, when \nthere were ten overall votes in favor, including at least 1 member of \nthe other party. This rule is a limit on the power of the chairman. It \ndid not stand for the novel proposition that, if the Democrats stuck \ntogether, no Republican nominee could be brought up for a vote.\n\n  To say that rule IV should be interpreted the way the Democrats on \nthe committee are now complaining would mean the chairman couldn't \nbring any matter up for a vote without minority support--that a \nminority in committee could block any nomination moving out of \ncommittee. This interpretation is a recipe for disaster: a chairman has \nto be able to get a matter up for a vote, or the committee cannot do \nbusiness.\n  Senator Hatch interpreted the rule as he is empowered to do. The \nmajority of the committee, not to mention two parliamentarians, \nsupported him on that. We should not and are not going to have \nfilibusters in the Judiciary Committee that keep judges from even \nhaving a vote in the Judiciary Committee.\n\n[[Page S9992]]\n\n  I just want to say to my fellow colleagues that it is not correct \nthat Chairman Hatch is acting unfairly. Chairman Hatch has acted with \nprinciple in this matter. He brought Clinton nominees to the floor, and \nhe moved them forward, even when some of us objected. Even when Senator \nHatch himself may have objected on the merits, those nominees got \nvotes.\n  Take, for example, the Richard Paez nomination, which I opposed. \nSeveral people had holds on that nomination. Some wanted to see if we \ncould work with President Clinton to get some more mainstream nominees \nfor the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. We were hoping to negotiate \nwith him on that, as we tried to do with other things. Finally, the \nRepublican Majority Leader, Trent Lott, said: It is time for this man \nto have an up-and-down vote. File for cloture. He filed for cloture, \nand I supported cloture. Orrin Hatch supported cloture. Trent Lott \nsupported cloture. When Paez was voted on, I am pretty confident that \nTrent Lott voted against him, just as I voted against him. Several \ndozen votes were cast against him.\n  I note parenthetically that now-Judge Paez was part of a panel of the \nNinth Circuit that overturned the ``three strikes'' law in California. \nThat panel was overruled by the U.S. Supreme Court earlier this year. \nJudge Paez was also part of the panel that declared the Pledge of \nAllegiance unconstitutional because it had the words ``under God'' in \nit.\n  Notwithstanding indications of such judicial activism during his \nconfirmation hearing and process, Judge Paez was confirmed. He got his \nup-or-down vote. The Republican leadership moved the nomination \nforward.\n  That is all we are asking of the Democratic leader, Tom Daschle, with \nrespect to Miguel Estrada and Priscilla Owen. Instead, it looks like we \nmay be heading toward more filibusters. I certainly hope not.\n  Of the many reasons why we shouldn't have a filibuster, an important \none is the Article I of the Constitution. It says the Senate shall \nadvise and consent on treaties by a two-thirds vote, and simply ``shall \nadvise and consent'' on nominations.\n  Historically, we have understood that provision to mean--and I think \nthere is no doubt the Founders understood that to mean--that a treaty \nconfirmation requires a two-thirds vote, but confirmation of a judicial \nnomination requires only a simple majority vote. That is why we have \nnever had a filibuster. People on both sides of the aisle have \nunderstood it to be wrong. They have understood it to be in violation \nof the Constitution.\n\n  As Senator Hatch has said, the complaint suggesting there was a \nfilibuster on the Fortas nomination is not really correct. They had \ndebate for several days. Apparently, when the votes were counted, it \nwas clear that considering those who were absent, there were enough \nvotes to defeat the nomination, and the nomination was withdrawn.\n  So there has never really been a filibuster of a judicial nominee in \nthe Senate until now, when our Democratic colleagues have decided to \nchange the ground rules on confirmation. They have said so and done so \nopenly, and seem to be little concerned that the Constitution may be \nviolated in the process.\n  Mr. President, these nominees are entitled to an up-and-down vote. If \na Member does not like them, he or she can vote against them. But it is \ntime to move these nominees. How can they defend voting against \nnominees of the quality of Priscilla Owen or Miguel Estrada? How can \nthey justify opposing a man of such integrity, ability, patriotism, and \ncourage as Attorney General Bill Pryor, a man of faith and integrity? \nThese are questions that should be answered on the floor. Let us \ndiscuss these nominees' records here. And then, let us just vote. That \nis what the Constitution and Senate tradition demand of us.\n  I think the American people are getting engaged, and they are telling \nus ``we are tired of obstructionism,'' ``we are tired of delays,'' and \n``we believe these nominees deserve an up-and-down vote.'' I could not \nagree more.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/25/senate-section/article/S9992-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9992]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RECESS UNTIL MONDAY, JULY 28, 2003, AT 11 A.M.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
