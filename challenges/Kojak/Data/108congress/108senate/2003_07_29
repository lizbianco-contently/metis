Mr. President, I want to very briefly comment on the \nEnergy bill. I did not make a statement on the bill and indeed was a \nbit disappointed on the progress we made yesterday for lots of \nextenuating circumstances. I do want to point out my absolute \ncommitment to aggressively addressing the bill this morning and over \nthe course of this week. Today, we do begin our 16th day, our 16th day \nof consideration on this Energy bill on the Senate floor. Just to point \nout to my colleagues, 16 days is longer than we spent on any other \nsingle bill this year. In fact, it is twice as long as we spent on the \nMedicare reform bill, the Medicare prescription drug bill. I say that \nonly to encourage my colleagues to come to the floor, offer amendments, \nallow us to offer the amendments so that we can debate and vote on the \namendments that people are at least considering.\n  Time and time again the statement is made that we spent 7 weeks on \nthis bill last year on the Senate floor. Seven weeks, that was 24 days \nthat we spent last year, and last year the bill didn't go through \ncommittee. It was not marked up. It wasn't debated in committee. It was \ntaken straight to the floor.\n  Now we have a bill that was marked up, debated in committee, and now \nwe spend 16 days on it. We need to finish this bill this week. We need \nto stay focused with it and we can't tolerate the sort of delays we \nhave seen to date. We need to aggressively recognize that we have a \nperiod of this week and use the time that is available.\n  The issue of organizing how we do these amendments and sort of \ngetting them done procedurally is what I have been concentrating on, \nbut I think all of us have to step back and recognize the substance of \nthis bill is what is important. It is incumbent upon us as U.S. \nSenators to address an issue that has been put forth by the President.\n\n  An Energy bill has been passed by the House of Representatives, and \nwe have a bill on the Senate floor that we are debating and we must \naddress and finish and complete this week.\n  A strong energy policy is what Americans want. It is what Americans \ndeserve, a policy that, indeed, balances new production with \nconservation, with the development of renewable resources, all of which \nis crucial to strengthening our economy and our national security.\n  In terms of the economy, we know this bill will have a direct impact \non the creation of jobs--not just 100,000 jobs or 300,000 or 400,000 \nbut 500,000 jobs it is predicted this bill will create.\n  We know what has happened with natural gas prices. We have seen what \nhas happened with those prices just since we have been discussing this \nbill. Again, it calls upon us to pass this Energy bill which sets out \nour policy.\n  While we have addressed issues, not as aggressively as I would like, \ngas prices have shot up. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has \nmade\n\n[[Page S10080]]\n\nthe statement that there is no end in sight. To put this in some sort \nof perspective on a personal level, 80 percent of the Nation's 35,000 \nlaundromats have raised prices in the past year due to high natural gas \nprices. Folks who have to take their laundry to the corner Sit and Spin \nare facing, every day, prices that increased over the past several \nweeks and months and may well increase into the future.\n  That is why we need to respond and respond expeditiously. If you take \nit beyond the personal level to the industry level, the U.S. chemical \ncompanies are closing plants. They are laying off workers. They are \nlooking to expand their own production, not domestically but expand it \nabroad, as a result of high prices.\n  Next year, the United States is expected to import, to bring into \nthis country, approximately $9 billion more in chemicals than it will \nexport.\n  American industry is caught between regulations, on the one hand \nlimiting the supply of natural gas, and regulations encouraging its use \non the other. The result is rising gas prices with some industries \ncutting jobs. Again, I want to keep coming back to jobs because it is \nan Energy bill, an energy security bill, but it is also a jobs bill. We \nfind some of these industries not just cutting jobs but sometimes being \npriced out altogether. And, of course, consumers are being hit with \nhigher and higher electric bills.\n  We need to diversify our sources of energy. We must do so in a way \nthat lessens our reliance on foreign sources. So when you summarize and \nstep back, our energy policy should be one that is consistent with our \nforeign policy; that is, it is independent and it is secure. By \nincreasing America's domestic production of clean coal, of oil and gas, \nnuclear, ethanol, solar, and other renewable energy sources, we \nincrease not just our energy supply but we increase our national \nsecurity.\n  Furthermore, by passing the comprehensive energy package we will be \ncreating jobs; as I mentioned, as many as 500,000 jobs. Indeed, the \nAlaskan pipeline, for example, will create at least 400,000 jobs alone. \nThe hundreds of millions of dollars that will be invested in research \nand development of new technologies will not only benefit the \nenvironment, which we know will be benefited, but it also will create \nnew jobs in engineering, in math and chemistry, science, physics.\n  So, in summary, we cannot continue to dither or delay. We need to \nfocus over the next 4 days on this bill, bring amendments to the \nchairman and ranking member, bring them to the floor for debate so we \ncan vote.\n  We simply cannot let the behind-the-scenes political maneuvering in \nany way deny the American people energy that is cleaner, that is more \nabundant, and, indeed, more secure.\n  We need to take action this week for the sake of our economy, for our \nnational security, and ultimately, and what is probably the bottom \nline, for our fellow Americans who are paying these bills each and \nevery month. It is time to pass an energy policy for the 21st century. \nI am confident we can do so this week.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/29/senate-section/article/S10080-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10080]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The acting minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, let the Record be spread with the fact that \nevery Democrat in the Senate supports an Energy bill. There is not a \nsingle Senator who opposes an Energy bill.\n  I know that the distinguished majority leader has talked about our \nhaving been on this for 16 days--and we have been. But many of them \nhave been extremely short days--Thursday afternoons and Friday \nmornings; a few days here and a few days there.\n  I think what we have to be concerned about is not how many days we \nhave spent on it but the question is, Is this bill as good as it should \nbe? I think the answer is a glaring no at this stage.\n  We have been willing to work with the majority to find consensus on a \nhost of issues. There is not a single Senator on the other side of the \naisle who I have worked more closely with than the chairman of the \nEnergy Committee, the distinguished senior Senator from New Mexico. Not \nonly have I worked with him on the Energy bill but I have worked with \nhim on the Appropriations Committee. He and I have done energy and \nwater bills for years. I have great respect for him. I know how badly \nhe wants an Energy bill. He tells me once or twice a day. I know how \nimportant it is for him to move this bill through the Senate. But we \ncan't move a bill through the Senate that doesn't have debate on \nimportant issues such as climate change, CAFE, electricity, renewable \nportfolio standards, and the tax title.\n  We on this side of the aisle are concerned about jobs. When we look \nat the last administration and 8 years, President Clinton created 25 \nmillion jobs. This administration and this President--as long as we \nhave kept records where we have lost jobs--lost 3 million jobs in the \nprivate sector. I think that says it all.\n\n  On the Alaskan pipeline issue, I offered that amendment on the floor. \nThat amendment passed. I am glad it did pass. We support that. It is \ngood for the economy. It is good for the security of this Nation to \nbring that gas from Alaska. We want to do that.\n  We talked about Medicare legislation and doing that more quickly. Of \ncourse, that was bipartisan legislation. It makes it a little easier.\n  We have a number of northwestern Senators who are desperate to work \nout something on the electricity title. They could not get a copy of--\nit is a major title to this legislation--until late Friday night. Some \ngot it but most didn't get it until yesterday; then to be asked, as we \nwere yesterday, to go right to the electricity title.\n  There are three amendments pending. I think without any question we \ncan have a vote on CAFE by 10:45 or 11 o'clock, according to how much \ntime the opposition takes on it. I think we can do that quickly. We \nhave discussed it with Senators Levin and Stabenow. Of course, there \nare others on the majority side who joined with these Senators on \nanother CAFE amendment. That should take a very short period of time--I \nwould say an hour or something like that, I would estimate.\n  Then we have to figure out some way as to what will be done with the \nCampbell amendment. Then there is nothing to stop us from going to the \nelectricity title. There will be some debate on that. It is an \nextremely important issue for us.\n  As I said, I have the highest respect and regard for my friend from \nNew Mexico, the senior Senator.\n  I don't see how we can do this bill this week. We are going to try. \nIt is not as if this is some guerrilla attack. We have been saying all \nalong that we need more time than this to complete the bill.\n  But on this side of the aisle, we recognize the importance of this \nlegislation. We want to do what we can but there are certain issues \nthat require debate and deliberation. We are going to make sure it \ntakes place. If we have to stay in through next week, we have to stay \nin through next week. But there are issues that are so important to \nthis country that we have to make sure that whatever bill comes out is \nthe best bill we can get.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/29/senate-section/article/S10080-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10080]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RESERVATION OF LEADERSHIP TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The majority leader.\n\n[[Page S10081]]\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, just briefly, I wish to respond because I \ncan tell both in opening and closing the Senate each day that we are \ngoing to come down to this same sort of dialog of our side of the aisle \nwants to move this bill through and the Democrats, or the other side of \nthe aisle, are saying we are not slow walking this and we need more \ntime. There is going to be sort of the setup at the end of the week \nwith the other side saying we just haven't had enough time.\n  I want to make it clear to my colleagues that for the last month this \nbill came before the Senate 16 days. This is the 16th day on the bill. \nWe are going to spend every day this week on it. These are not new \nissues. These are issues that we debated, that we talked about, that we \nhashed and rehashed last year. Indeed, it was 7 weeks and 24 days, and \nthe issues are essentially the same issues.\n  In this Congress, we have gone through the committee itself, and it \ncame to the floor on May 6. We spent 16 days on it. We are going to \nspend the next 4 days.\n  When I hear these statements either from the Democratic leader last \nnight or the potential of a charge at the end of the week that, Well, \nDemocrats just didn't want to finish the bill--those are the Democratic \nleader's words--I am beginning to think there is some delaying, there \nis some slow walking. I say that because I set up this schedule a long \ntime ago. We are now early in the week for this final week being spent \non the bill.\n  Yesterday we had the other side of the aisle objecting to setting \naside CAFE and laying down the electricity bill. Yet we just had the \nassistant Democratic leader and the Democratic leader last night say, \nWell, we just got it on Friday.\n\n  The whole point of laying it down yesterday was so we could look at \nit, so we could debate it, and so we could talk about it. Yet we spent \nall day yesterday--or they spent all day--objecting to laying it down \nand to setting other amendments aside.\n  It is too early to get into this sort of finger pointing back and \nforth. But I can tell from the Democratic leader's statements--no, we \nare not slow walking it, that you are going to accuse us of slow \nwalking it--all I can say is that it is early enough in the week, and \nif we stay focused and if we expeditiously and systematically address \nthe issues, we can complete this bill.\n  I encourage both sides of the aisle to allow the managers to deal \nwith these amendments and organize in a systematic way so we can \ndebate. It is our No. 1 priority this week so that we can do what the \nAmerican people deserve, we can pass a bill which has been adequately \ndebated and appropriately amended and which fulfills what both sides of \nthe aisle want to do; that is, to develop good energy policy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I just wanted to respond briefly to the \ncomments made by the distinguished majority leader.\n  I, again, will publicly affirm what I have said to him privately--\nthat we are more than ready to grind out amendments and work through \nthe many contentious issues. I listed them last night. He knows very \nwell what those issues are.\n  We have a very controversial electricity title that was redrafted. \nOnce the bill was reported out of committee, for whatever reason, the \nmajority decided they didn't like the electricity title and redrafted \nan entirely different electricity title that we had not seen until \nFriday. So we were not able to examine it for purposes of consideration \nof amendments and other issues until this weekend.\n  But we also have the question of nuclear licensing, the conservation \nquestions which we have talked about, the renewable portfolio \nstandards, and a number of issues that hopefully we can address in \naddition to the electricity matter. The tax title has yet to come up.\n  You can't slow walk a bill that has not been pending. And it has not \nbeen pending. We have urged our colleagues to bring the bill to the \nfloor so we could walk through these issues one by one and address them \nconstructively. For good reason, yesterday we were not able to come to \nthe bill, in part because the two managers, out of necessity, had to be \nin New Mexico.\n\n  So we are prepared to deal with the Durbin amendment and then the \nLevin amendment. I know the Campbell amendment is pending after that. \nIf we could dispose of that, there is no reason whatsoever we could not \ngo to the electricity title and begin debating that and consider \namendments to the electricity title.\n  So I will certainly again offer my cooperation to the distinguished \nmajority leader in an effort to begin addressing these issues. But I \nwish it were the beginning of this work period rather than the end. I \nwould feel a lot more confident about our ability to complete our work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, before the distinguished minority leader \nleaves the floor, might I say we, too, are prepared to move quickly to \nthe Durbin amendment. Senator Bingaman and I are writing up a list we \nwould agree on as to how we would proceed the next couple days. The \nproblem is, the pending amendment is the Campbell amendment on Indians, \nand we were going to ask if we could set it aside so we could proceed \nwith Durbin and then proceed with the subsequent amendment on \nautomobiles which is just pending, and right on down--we have a list--\nincluding getting the amendment on electricity offered today for \ndebate.\n  But there is an objection to our proceeding. So that means we \nprobably will have to take one of two actions: either put the \nelectricity amendment on the Indian amendment, which I do not like, or \nwe do the Indian amendment first. I don't know if we can do that. So it \nis too bad. Whoever is objecting, it would be good if they would not \nobject to just setting the Indian amendment aside. It is being worked \non. It is not a game breaker; it is just a question that there are now \npeople who want to work it out as compared with fighting over it.\n  Senator Bingaman is here. I think he wishes to speak.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, if I might respond quickly to the \ndistinguished Senator from New Mexico, I simply say that however he \nwants to address the Campbell amendment managerially is his decision. I \nthink it is important to dispose of it. You have plenty of options. \nEven though we have a finite list of amendments, you can easily bring \nit back if it is in other forms and address it later on to clear the \npath, if you wish, to bring up the electricity title. So whether or not \nthere are objections to setting it aside should not be an impediment. \nThere ought to be ways in which to address it, and I know he will find \none. Again, I will work with him to see if that can be done.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I agree with the points made by the \nminority leader and Senator Domenici as well. Let me just suggest, \nthough, that I know Senator Durbin is here ready to debate his \namendment, on which we hope we can get a vote this morning.\n  I think we could go ahead with that debate and then possibly even go \nahead with some debate on the Bond-Levin issue while we are trying to \nclear any objections on this side. The hope is then we would be able to \nvote on one or both of those amendments before we go to the discussion \nabout the Priscilla Owen nomination.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I think the minority leader has \nconvinced me, and his suggestion was a good one. I withdraw the \nCampbell amendment provided he has the right to offer it at a later \ndate.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there an objection?\n  Mr. REID. Objection.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, under the present parliamentary situation, \nof course, it takes consent to withdraw because we have a finite list \nof amendments. We have at least one Senator here whom we have to \nprotect. As a result of that, I object.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thought the other side said I could \ndispose of it however I would like so we\n\n[[Page S10082]]\n\ncould get on with the business. I just tried to do that.\n  Mr. REID. But of course, Mr. President, we have two amendments ahead \nof that. It is not parliamentary procedure that is proper at this \nstage. When we get to the Campbell amendment, the distinguished \nDemocratic leader said the Senator would have to do what he wanted in \nthat regard. We stand on that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We can't proceed with any of the other amendments.\n  Mr. REID. But even at that time, even if the other two amendments \nwere gone, the alternatives are, as the Senator said, second-degreeing \nthe amendment or disposing of it with a motion to table or some other \nthing. But just to agree to withdraw it, I am not in a position to do \nthat right now.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We would like to proceed with the CAFE amendment at \nthis point.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. If the Senator will suspend, the Chair \ninforms the Senator from New Mexico, the finite list requires that the \namendment must be disposed of. It cannot be withdrawn except by \nunanimous consent.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to Senator Durbin, would you like to then proceed \nfor a few minutes on your amendment?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I had the floor, and I will yield in just 1 \nsecond. I would also say, so there is not a problem in the future, I \ndon't think you can amend the Campbell amendment with an electricity \ntitle under the rules that are now before the Senate. I would just \nalert Senators to that.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. I think the Senator from New Mexico had \nthe floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We will get to that.\n  Senator Bingaman wants some time to speak to a Senator. So I ask \nSenator Durbin, how much time would you like to speak on your \namendment?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am prepared to move to my amendment. It is my \nunderstanding that the minority leader may be seeking the floor. If he \nis, I will certainly yield to him.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator yielding. I will \nnot take a lot of time now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/29/senate-section/article/S10082-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10082-S10083]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            TRADING IN DEATH\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I come to the floor in part to call to \nthe attention of my colleagues an article which appeared in the New \nYork Times this morning. The article is entitled ``Pentagon Prepares A \nFutures Market On Terror Attacks.''\n  The article reports that the Bush administration is prepared to spend \n$8 million on a program that actually encourages betting on the \nprobability of future terrorist attacks. I am really amazed. This fits \nin that category: ``We are not making this up.''\n  You ask whether there are traders or traitors--T-R-A-D-E-R-S or T-R-\nA-I-T-O-R-S. As we understand it, even terrorists would be allowed to \nbet on the likelihood of future terrorist attacks.\n  This program could provide an incentive, actually, to commit acts of \nterrorism. We are asking the administration this morning to renounce \nthis plan to trade in death. The administration should issue a public \napology, especially to the families of the victims of September 11. \nThis is just wrong: The Pentagon calls its latest idea a new way of \npredicting events and part of its search for the ``broadest possible \nset of new ways to prevent terrorist attacks.'' I don't know how one \ncan possibly use the marketplace for that purpose.\n  The initiative, which is called the Policy Analysis Market, is to \nbegin registering up to 1,000 traders on Friday. It is the latest in a \nseries of projects advanced by DARPA, a Pentagon unit that has run into \na great deal of controversy over other issues.\n  But I must say, this is perhaps the most irresponsible, outrageous, \nand poorly thought out of anything I have heard the administration \npropose to date. For the life of me, I cannot believe anybody would \nseriously propose that we trade in death, that we set up a futures \nmarket on when, as the Web site proposed, the King of Jordan could be \noverthrown, when a leader would be assassinated, when a terrorist \nattack would occur. Most traders try to influence their investments. \nHow long would it be before you saw traders investing in a way that \nwould bring about the desired result?\n  I hope the administration will explain what it is they had in mind, \nwhy they are doing this, why we are investing taxpayer dollars in the \nprobability of future terrorist attacks.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask the Senator from South Dakota, our \ndistinguished minority leader, is it not true that those who find your \nstatement incredulous can log on to policymarketanalysis.com and find \nthis proposal from the Department of Defense to create some sort of \ninvestment speculation in the possibility of assassination and \nterrorism? Is that not a fact?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Illinois has exactly stated the fact. \nPolicymarket.com can be called up on your Web site today. The Web site \ncan be called up on the Internet and you can see for yourself.\n  Mr. DURBIN. In fairness to the Senator, I think the reference is \npolicyanalysis.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Will the Senator please address through \nthe Chair? The Senator from Nevada has the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I believe the Senator from South Dakota has the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I sought recognition and the Chair recognized me.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Very well. I thought the Senator yielded \nto the Senator from Nevada. The minority leader has the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the minority leader would further yield, through the \nChair, is it not true that the site referenced here is \npolicyanalysismarket.org, for those who question whether what you are \nsaying is accurate?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is correct. I don't have the Internet reference in \nfront of me.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is it not also, I say through the Chair, that the \nadministration is proposing spending $8 million of taxpayer money \nthrough the year 2005 in creating this marketplace to trade in \nspeculation about assassination and terrorism, $8 million over the next \nseveral years?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. It is my understanding they are actually encouraging \ninvestors to trade in this terrorist probability or possibility. Their \nview is that somehow, by those who invest, in watching or monitoring \nthose who invest, they can better determine where this terrorist attack \nmay occur. What they don't fail to appreciate is that investors try to \nmake good on their investments. So would it not stand to reason that \nonce this investment was made and the market moved in the direction of \nassassinating a given leader, indeed, that would be the ultimate \noutcome?\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator would further yield for a question, is it \nnot true that on their Web site yesterday they put up some hypothetical \nthings that people could invest in, questions as to whether, for \nexample, Mr. Arafat, with the Palestinian Authority, would be \nassassinated, whether North Korea would launch a missile attack, \nwhether the King of Jordan would be overthrown, and whether Israel \nwould be attacked with bioterrorism weapons? Weren't these some of the \nitems on which the Department of Defense was suggesting we start \nopening speculation and investment and betting by people around the \nworld, including possible terrorists? Wasn't this on the Web site \nyesterday and removed today?\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Each of the items that the Senator from Illinois has \nreported were on the Web site yesterday: When the first biological \nattack would occur in Israel, when the King of Jordan might be \nassassinated. Each of these were listed as possible investment \nopportunities. Of course, our distinguished colleagues--I cite them for \ntheir efforts, Senators Wyden and Dorgan--called attention to these \nparticularly unusual investments, and they were pulled from the Web \nsite once the fact that these were listed was made public.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator would further yield, I would ask the \nSenator from South Dakota to reflect on the reaction of the United \nStates and the Congress----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). The Senator will suspend.\n\n[[Page S10083]]\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Is the Pastore rule in effect at this time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, am I not recognized on leader time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I appreciate that.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator from South Dakota will further yield for a \nquestion, would the Senator from South Dakota indicate what his \nreaction would be if we learned that in some country overseas they were \nopening up betting on the assassination of American officials, opening \nup betting on the possibility that America would be the target of \nfuture terrorism? Could the Senator from South Dakota speculate on our \nreaction if a similar betting scheme were opened in some other country \nin the world?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will address his questions through \nthe Chair.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Through the President, I ask whether the Senator from \nSouth Dakota would respond.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Responding to the Senator, I would simply say where do \nwe limit this? What would prevent somebody from offering a futures \nmarket on terrorist acts within the United States on a leader of the \nUnited States? If these markets were available to leaders in the Middle \nEast, countries in the Middle East, it doesn't take much of a stretch \nof the imagination to suggest that perhaps these new investment \nopportunities on terror for U.S. leaders, U.S. politicians, U.S. \nlocations would be a big part of this market of death in a very short \ntime. Once this is in the marketplace, as we say, there is no telling \nwhat the market may do.\n  This policyanalysismarket.org is something I would encourage my \ncolleagues to check out. It is the most amazing Web site I think I have \nseen in my life. I just cannot imagine that somebody seriously would \npropose something as outrageously irresponsible as this.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for one final question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask through the Chair, it is my \nunderstanding from press reports that former Admiral John Poindexter \nhas now been associated with this concepted idea, the same man who was \ninvolved in the controversy of Iran-contra and the same individual who, \nthrough this same office, suggested a massive intelligence-gathering \noperation across the United States involving the invasion of medical \nrecords, financial records, that was discredited by the administration? \nIs this the same John Poindexter who was behind this proposed scheme by \nthe administration?\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I answer the Senator from Illinois by \nsaying yes, indeed, the same John Poindexter with the checkered past \nthat we have known him to have is back again. This time \npolicyanalysismarket.org apparently is one of the projects for which he \nis responsible. This new trade in death is something that I am told he \nis heading. I am anxious to get more information, of course, from the \nadministration and others about how this individual as well as this Web \nsite came to be.\n  Just very quickly, this is the Web site the Senator from Illinois \ncited, the specific possibilities for investment: The King of Jordan \noverthrown, the price they suggest starts at just 23 cents on that one. \nArafat assassinated, that is worth 23 cents as a possibility. The price \nrange may be anywhere from 22 to 33 cents. They expect a volume of \n2,333 investors.\n  We can move to the second chart. This is the actual Web site from \nDARPA: King of Jordan overthrown, North Korea missile attack, Arafat \nassassinated. All of these are on the Web site.\n\n       Whatever a prospective trader's interest in the web site, \n     the involvement in this group prediction process should prove \n     engaging and may prove profitable.\n\n  This is one of the most intriguing parts of their assertion, that \nthese actual investments in these incidences could actually prove to be \nprofitable, as they consider investments in any one of these tragedies. \nI should say, investing in these incidences for purposes of profit.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am wondering if the distinguished \nDemocratic leader's reaction, when he and I read the front page of the \nNew York Times today, was the same as mine--amazement, bewilderment--\nwhen reading on the front of the New York Times: ``Pentagon Prepares a \nFutures Market on Terrorist Attacks''?\n\n       The Pentagon office that proposed spying electronically on \n     Americans to monitor potential terrorists has a new \n     experiment. It is an online futures trading market, disclosed \n     today . . . in which anonymous speculators would bet on \n     forecasting terrorist attacks, assassinations, and coups.\n       Traders bullish on a biological attack on Israel or bearish \n     on the chances of a North Korean missile strike would have \n     the opportunity to bet on the likelihood of such events on a \n     new Internet site established by the . . . [Pentagon].\n\n  Did the Senator read that in disbelief?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I actually thought it was a hoax. I could not believe \nthat we would actually commit $8 million to create a Web site that \nwould encourage investors to bet on futures involving terrorist attacks \nand public assassinations. For the life of me, I cannot believe that we \nwould spend the money this administration has committed for that \npurpose.\n  But, as you said, according to the article in the New York Times this \nmorning, that is indeed what has happened. The Web site is up. I \nencourage my colleagues to check policyanalysismarket.org for \nthemselves and consider what this remarkable development may mean for \nus in public policy and for the safety and security of our country as \nwe consider its ramifications.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/29/senate-section/article/S10083-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10083-S10090]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ENERGY POLICY ACT OF 2003--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Illinois is \nseeking to speak on his amendment. Is there a time agreement on that \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is not.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I would like to have an opportunity to speak on the \nEnergy bill. I do not want to interfere with the Senator's amendment if \nwe can get it done.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Alaska if he \nwould give me an idea how much time he would like.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The reverse is true also. I am glad to yield to the \nSenator if he would consider giving us a time agreement on his \namendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator from Alaska would like to work with me \nthrough the leadership to come up with a time agreement, I will be \nhappy to do that. At this point, with no time agreement, I will yield--\nwithout yielding my right to the floor on the amendment--for the \nSenator to speak on the Energy bill. He certainly has a right to do \nthat. I am happy to yield for that purpose.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have come to the floor to speak on the bill in \ngeneral, but I would be happy to have an opportunity to have the \nSenator from Illinois debate his amendment and have it voted on. As I \nunderstood it, that was the plan this morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I address the Senator from Nevada. Is it \npossible to get an agreement on the Durbin amendment?\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Durbin has always been agreeable to \nthat. He has indicated he would want probably 45 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. And Senator Stabenow may want 10 or 15 minutes. We will \ncheck with her. I am sure we can do it within an hour on our side. I \nwould propose that on the Durbin amendment there be 1 hour of debate on \nour side, that there be no second-degree amendments in order, and we \nwould then vote on or in relation to the Durbin amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We are trying to work with Senator Bingaman on the \nDurbin amendment and the other CAFE amendment.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from New Mexico that we have seen the \nproposal. We are not going to agree to the\n\n[[Page S10084]]\n\nunanimous consent agreement that was given to me.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We don't need a time agreement on Senator Durbin at \nthis point.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield so I may comment \nbriefly, I think we have tried to be as reasonable as we can on the \nDurbin amendment, which is the pending amendment. The Senator from \nIllinois has agreed from the beginning on a time agreement. That still \nstands.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I will speak briefly. I hope, however, we \ncan move on to the Durbin amendment as soon as we get a time agreement.\n  Mr. President, one of the basic goals of the Energy bill, as our \nleader has indicated, is job creation. According to the estimates that \nI have, based upon the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the natural gas \npipeline project to bring Alaska's natural gas to market would create \nas many as 400,000 job years. There have been various press releases \nissued in that regard. The more conservative estimates by the Energy \nCommittee staff put the number at 118,000. Even those figures include: \n1,650 welders and helpers; 2,000 operators; 135 surveyors; 1,250 \nlaborers; 755 teamsters; 418 inspectors; 90 UT technicians; and 170 \nsalaried foremen. Beyond that are both manufacturing jobs and \ninfrastructure jobs, including airstrip improvements at 5 airports.\n  Additionally, the project will require an enormous number of buses, \nloaders, and automatic welders. We will need 440 sidebooms, 225 other \nsidebooms, 18 trenchers, 250 backhoes, 236 large dozers, 125 stringing \ntractors, and 1,300 pickup trucks.\n  I have come to the floor to raise my voice in support of this Energy \nbill and to urge the Senate to complete it. I commend Senators Domenici \nand Bingaman and their staffs for their efforts so far. This Energy \nbill is an important step toward a comprehensive and balanced national \nenergy policy. It contains many important provisions designed to ensure \nour energy security.\n  The most important of those, to me, is the authorization for a \nnatural gas pipeline from the North Slope of Alaska connecting through \nCanada to what we call the Lower 48.\n\n  As we are all aware, our country faces a natural gas crisis. The \nleader spoke of that this morning, and I want to emphasize the \nimportance of his remarks. In the last 10 years, demand for natural gas \nhas increased by 19 percent. It is projected to grow over 50 percent in \nthe next quarter century. Absent a new supply of natural gas, a gap of \n15 billion cubic feet per day or 6 trillion cubic feet per year is \nlikely in the next decade.\n  High natural gas prices have severely impacted our industries and our \nconsumers and are hindering our economic recovery.\n  The fertilizer industry alone has seen its current operating capacity \nin the United States for ammonia plants drop to 60 to 65 percent of \nformer capacity. High gas prices are responsible for the closure of \nalmost 20 percent of the nitrogen fertilizer capacity.\n  This has severely impacted our farmers. They are now paying $350 per \nton for fertilizer, more than twice what they paid last year.\n  Our chemical industry has been similarly affected as high gas prices \ncontinue to affect its market share, which again threatens millions of \nexisting jobs.\n  The chemical industry employs more than 1 million Americans, with 5 \nmillion Americans working at jobs dependent upon that chemical \nindustry. Millions of Americans are depending upon our ability to \nmaintain an adequate supply of gas. Our constituents are also feeling \nthe pressure from natural gas prices. Sixty million households in this \ncountry use natural gas.\n  In 1999, their average gas bill was $534. In 2001, the average gas \nbill was $750. This year, the average gas bill for American consumers \nat home will be $915--almost double what it was in 1999, Mr. President.\n  Given these disturbing facts and the negative impacts high gas prices \nare having on the Nation as a whole, I urge the Senate to act quickly \nto address this situation. This Energy bill must pass this year. It \nmust be passed by the Senate now before we go on recess so a final \nconference package can be voted on in the fall.\n  The Energy Committee has taken the first step towards addressing this \nsituation by including authorization for the Alaskan gas pipeline. The \npipeline is vitally important to preventing an even more serious \nnatural gas crisis in the future.\n  The gas pipeline will increase our supplies. Alaska's gas alone would \nmeet approximately 10 percent of our country's natural gas needs, which \nmeans 4 billion to 6 billion cubic feet per day. It will decrease our \ndependency on foreign gas and imports of liquefied natural gas. It will \ngenerate over $40 billion in revenues for the Federal Government. It \nwill create the jobs I outlined earlier.\n\n  I do hope the Senate will focus on the jobs created by the Energy \nbill and particularly the Alaska natural gas pipeline. The gas pipeline \ntranslates into 7,000 construction jobs, thousands of manufacturing \njobs necessary to create equipment, and thousands of infrastructure \njobs.\n  In addition to the authorization language, the Finance Committee has \nprovided a fiscal incentive package to ensure the pipeline can begin \ndelivering gas as quickly as possible. I will discuss the fiscal \npackage once the energy tax provisions are introduced. We are working \nwith the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee to assure that \nthose provision meet all the objectives of assuring financing for this \nenormous project.\n  I urge the Senate to consider that this is gas that was produced \nalongside oil at Prudhoe Bay, almost 13 billion barrels of oil to date. \nAs that oil was produced, natural gas was pumped to the surface as \nwell. This gas was then separated from the oil and reinjected into the \nground. This is not gas we have to look for; we know where it is. This \nis 35 trillion cubic feet of gas that is stored beneath Prudhoe Bay.\n  I point out to the Senate that 35 trillion cubic feet of gas is \nmerely what has already been produced. The North Slope of Alaska has an \nabundant supply of gas, which has the potential to produce around 100 \ntrillion cubic feet of gas. The Alaska gas pipeline project must begin \nso that we can start tapping into Alaska's gas reserves. No one is \ndrilling gas wells in my State now because there is no transportation \nmechanism for gas. The known reserves of natural gas will be \nproduceable as soon as there is a transportation mechanism to bring it \nto market. This pipeline will be that transportation mechanism to bring \nAlaska's gas to the Lower 48.\n  Nothing is more important to our Nation right now in terms of our \neconomy than reassuring our people that we will have the natural gas \nsupplies we need for the future. The Alaska natural gas pipeline can do \nit. It will help to fill the gap for the immediate future once it is \nconstructed, and the benefits of the Alaska pipeline will have lasting \neffects on our Nation.\n  It will take a long time to construct the pipeline. We estimate it \nwill be 2012 or 2013 before that gas actually gets to market. But once \nit gets to market, it will be competing with new liquefied natural gas \nthat will be coming from foreign sources.\n  It is estimated that eventually we will import about 6 percent of our \ngas supplies in LNG. The counterweight to LNG is Alaska's gas. There is \nno other source in the United States with such an enormous amount of \ngas.\n  I urge us to move swiftly on this bill, and I will do anything I can \nto help accelerate the decisions on this bill. Again, I congratulate \nthe two Senators from New Mexico for what they have done so far. I wish \nwe could get together on a bipartisan basis and come up with a \nsubstitute. We ought to find some way to resolve these differences. The \ncountry needs this energy, and my State and the country need this \nproject. I urge Senators to consider what we have to do to get this \nEnergy bill passed as quickly as possible and that it contain the \nlegislative authorization that is now in the bill and the tax \nprovisions necessary to get the pipeline built.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we are preparing a unanimous consent \nrequest with reference to CAFE that has a reasonable chance. I wish to \nsay to everyone, the distinguished Senator from Alaska just suggested \nthat we attempt to get this bill completed, suggesting that we sit down \nand try to\n\n[[Page S10085]]\n\nfind some alternative. In this Senator's humble opinion, there are \nample votes to get the pending bill passed. Individual Senators, \njustifiably, have reason for delay. That is their business, and they \nare going to do just that.\n  The question is how long will they delay and to what end. There is no \nquestion that the Senator is correct with respect to natural gas. There \nare even other provisions with reference to natural gas. But the issue \nnow is to get an agreement where we can have some votes.\n  It appears to me that we are now close to getting something done on \nCAFE. There are two very important CAFE amendments. We are trying to \nget them written up where we will get them scheduled for debate and \nvotes shortly after the recess this afternoon, after which the pending \namendment will obviously be the Campbell amendment, and we will attempt \nto dispose of that amendment. Then we are free to move with dispatch, I \nsay to the Senator from Alaska.\n  I wonder if we are pretty close to getting a unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, I will be pleased to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Perhaps Senator Durbin can start his debate, and as soon as \nthe unanimous consent request is prepared, perhaps he will yield the \nfloor so the Senator may put the request to the Chair.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Might we count his time now? I have no objection. He is \ngoing to get some time in the unanimous consent request. I ask that \nwhatever time he uses now be counted.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Senator from New Mexico yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will be pleased to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I have been here an hour trying to begin the debate. I \nhave tried to cooperate completely. I ask the Senator from New Mexico \nif he will give me assurance that I will get an up-or-down vote on my \namendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. He will. Did the Senator ask for an up-or-down vote on \nhis amendment?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I cannot give the Senator that assurance. It is not \ntotally up to me. If it was up to me, it would be all right. It is not \nup to me.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will it be included in the unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It is not included.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It could be.\n  Mr. REID. The unanimous consent request says ``on or in relation'' to \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, ``on or in relation.''\n  Mr. DURBIN. I know where that is headed. I will proceed to engage in \na debate on this amendment if no one else is seeking recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from New Mexico?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I agree. The Senator can have an up-or-down vote.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. REID. And as to Senator Domenici's request, Senator Durbin's time \nwill be counted against the time in the order; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I understand my amendment is not pending, \nalthough it has been offered and set aside. I would like to address \nthat amendment and engage in some explanation for my colleagues so they \ncan understand what will be voted on shortly by the Senate.\n  I hold in my hand S. 14, and it is the bill that has been prepared, \nwith long hours of work by the Senator from New Mexico and many others, \nto address the energy security of the United States of America. I \nsuggest that if one visits the State of Nevada or the State of New \nMexico or my home State of Illinois and asks the average person on the \nstreet, If the Senate is serious about energy security, should they \nconsider the fuel efficiency and fuel economy of the cars and trucks \nthat we drive, the answer would be universally yes because people \nintuitively know we are dependent on overseas oil to power our cars and \ntrucks, and that, of course, is expensive not only in terms of dollar \namounts but in terms of our political commitment to Saudi Arabia and \nother countries.\n  If we are talking about America's energy security, most Americans \nbelieve S. 14 would include provisions that lead to more fuel \nefficiency and more fuel economy of America's cars and trucks. But the \nsad report for the American people is this: They are wrong.\n  S. 14 includes no provisions requiring that automobile manufacturers \nprovide us more fuel-efficient cars in the future. So how can it be a \nserious energy proposal? How can we talk about our energy security if \nwe ignore the obvious?\n  Let's take a look for a moment at what we face. The vast majority of \noil reserves in the world, according to this chart, are in the Middle \nEast. In terms of the billions of barrels of oil, there are 677 billion \nbarrels of oil in the Middle East. There is no other part of the world \nthat can even come close in terms of its potential for providing oil. \nThe closest I guess would be South and Central America with some 86 \nbillion and then, of course, North America, some 76 billion. But the \nreserve of oil in the world, outside of the Middle East, pales in \ncomparison.\n  That is important for us to consider because we in the United States \nand in Canada are the largest global consumers in the world of oil per \ncapita. These 1999 figures show of what I am speaking. In the United \nStates and Canada, we consumed 3 gallons of oil for every man, woman, \nand child every day in 1999. That is 3 gallons a day.\n  Let's look at other industrialized countries. It is 1.3 gallons per \ncapita in other industrialized countries.\n  The world average was about half a gallon. So we have a veracious \nappetite for oil that we do not own.\n  When we are talking about energy security, we have to wonder how this \nbill, S. 14, can honestly address energy security without addressing \nthe obvious--that unless and until we are less dependent on foreign oil \nto sustain our lives and our economy, how in the world can we reach \nenergy security?\n  The obvious question is, What are we doing with all of this oil? \nWell, intuitively we know the answer, but this chart tells us with \nspecifics: U.S. oil demand by sector, over a 50-year period of time.\n  What we will find is this: Cars, SUVs, minivans, pickup trucks, and \nother vehicles account for 40 percent of U.S. oil consumption; and the \ntransportation sector in total, 60 percent. They own the oil. We \nconsume it in quantities unparalleled in the world. We consume it to \npower our vehicles.\n  Stick with me because I think this takes us to the end point and why \nthe Durbin amendment really gets to the heart of energy security.\n  The amendment which I have proposed would save a cumulative amount of \n123 billion gallons of oil by 2015.\n  Now, some have said there are other ways to do this; we do not have \nto ask for Detroit or any automobile manufacturers to do anything \nresponsible for fuel efficiency and fuel economy. We can ignore that. \nLet the market work. We continue to have bigger, heavier, less fuel \nefficient vehicles. Just ignore it. There are other ways out. There is \nan easy way to deal with it.\n  What is the easy way that opponents of my amendment are proposing? \nTake a look at it. One of them is, let's go drilling for oil in the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge. Take a refuge created by President \nEisenhower in the 1950s, that is supposed to be protected, and open it \nup for oil exploration. They say: If we just open up the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge, we do not have to worry about cars, trucks, \nand fuel efficiency. There is so much oil up there, we just do not have \nto sweat it. So give a little. Compromise this national wildlife \nrefuge. Let oil companies come in and make a few bucks and future \ngenerations are going to be in a much better position.\n  Look at the facts. Look at the comparison. Look at what the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge will save for us, or at least produce for us, \nin terms of billions of gallons of gasoline over a 17-year period of \ntime. The number is down here and it shows, I think conclusively, that \nwe are dealing with a very small amount that would come out of the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge; in fact, less than a tenth of what we \nwould derive if we set about a sensible national energy policy calling \nfor more fuel efficient cars and trucks.\n\n[[Page S10086]]\n\n  NHTSA, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, has a \nproposal that would save 20 billion gallons of gas, and that is a good \nidea, but that again is just a fraction of what we can do if we address \nthe obvious: The fuel economy of the cars we drive.\n  A lot of people have said: We can invent our way out of this problem. \nWe do not have to sweat it in terms of demanding from Detroit and other \nautomobile manufacturers that they come up with better cars and trucks. \nLet them continue to sell these behemoths on the road that have \nterrible fuel economy and eventually we are going to invent our way out \nof the problem.\n  Well, would that that were true. In this situation, when we take a \nlook at the proposals for fuel cell vehicles, one of the things we have \nheard about is hydrogen power. I support that. I think the President's \nresearch is a good idea. But even if it is successful, in a matter of \n12 years it could save us less than 10 billion gallons of gasoline. \nThat is less than a tenth of what my amendment would achieve.\n\n  What about the consumers? I have heard Senators say: We have no right \nto dictate to American consumers what they want, what they prefer. We \nshould let the consumers have what they want. Let the market govern.\n  I will tell my colleagues what consumers have said. An annual survey \nby J.D. Power and Associates found that fuel consumption was the second \nmost common driver complaint industry-wide.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for a unanimous \nconsent request, I ask that Senator Domenici now be recognized to offer \na unanimous consent agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing Senators be permitted to speak in relation to amendments Nos. \n1384 and 1386: Senator Levin, 10 minutes; Senator Bond, 10 minutes; \nSenator Lott, 10 minutes, to follow Senator Durbin; Senator Stabenow, \n10 minutes; Senator Lautenberg, 10 minutes; Senator Durbin, 40 minutes; \nSenator Bingaman, 5 minutes; Senator Domenici, 5 minutes. Further, that \nthe Bond amendment be amended with a Bingaman second-degree amendment \nwhich is at the desk and has been agreed to by both sides. Further, I \nask unanimous consent that following the use or yielding back of the \ntime, the votes occur on the Durbin amendment No. 1384, to be followed \nby a vote in relation to the Bond amendment No. 1386, as amended, at a \ntime determined by the majority leader after consultation with the \nDemocratic leader, and that there be no second-degree amendments in \norder to the amendments prior to the votes in relation to the \namendments.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask that the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee modify his amendment to allow Senator Bingaman 5 minutes to \nspeak after Senator Lott on the Levin amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest of the Senator from New Mexico?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object, only to clarify where I am \nwith my 40 minutes, I do not know how much time I have consumed. I \ninquire of the Chair how much time I have consumed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois has consumed 8\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  Mr. REID. Nothing happens until 11:15, and then we go to a judge. So \nthe Senator has plenty of time to speak.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator. I have no objection to the unanimous \nconsent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest of the Senator from New Mexico?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n          Unanimous Consent Agreement--H.R. 2738 and H.R. 2739\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time \nto be determined by the majority leader, with the concurrence of the \nDemocratic leader, the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of \nH.R. 2738 and H.R. 2739, en bloc, under the following conditions for \ndebate only: Senators Grassley, 45; Baucus, 45; Hollings, 60; Daschle, \n30; Jeffords, 60; Sessions in control of 45; Hatch, 15; Stevens, 15; \nCornyn, 15; Feinstein, 60. I further ask that upon the use or yielding \nback of the time, the bills be read a third time and the Senate \nimmediately proceed to a Senate resolution regarding immigration \nprovisions included in the Singapore and Chile free trade agreements; \nthe resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion \nto reconsider be laid upon the table; provided, further, that the \nSenate then proceed to a vote on passage of the Singapore free trade \nagreement followed by a vote on passage of the Chile free trade \nagreement, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished manager of the bill \nif he would modify the agreement to allow Senator Harkin 30 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. On the unanimous consent I just read?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there objection to the original unanimous consent request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Before we proceed to Senator Durbin, I say to all the \nSenators, so there will be no misunderstanding, we are going to dispose \nof the CAFE amendments this afternoon. That means that the next \namendment which will be before us is the amendment regarding Indians. \nIf there continues to be objection that we cannot set it aside, we will \nvote either on it or in relation to it immediately following \ndisposition of the CAFE amendments. It is the intention of the manager \nthat that occur, after which time it is the intention of the manager to \nproceed to lay before the Senate the electricity amendment which has \nbeen in the hands of Senators for almost 4 days now.\n  I thank everyone for their cooperation thus far. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Chair be kind enough to notify me after I have \nused 25 minutes of the 40 minutes I have allocated under the unanimous \nconsent request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Going back to the point I was making about more fuel \nefficient vehicles, a lot of people say if we are going to have more \nfuel efficient vehicles, they are going to cost more and they have to \nadd things to these vehicles that will be expensive to consumers. But \nthey fail to account for several things. One is that a more fuel \nefficient vehicle costs more money to operate. If it costs $1,200--and \nthat is the estimate from the National Academy of Sciences--to put on \nthe new fuel-saving technology, over the life of the car that same \nconsumer will save $2,000 in terms of the gasoline they have to buy.\n  Arguing that this is a consumer burden is plain wrong. In fact, most \nconsumers are concerned about fuel economy; unfortunately, the Senate \nis not. The Senate has taken the position, which unfortunately major \nautomobile manufacturers in this country espouse, that we should not be \nconcerned about fuel efficiency and fuel economy.\n  As a person who makes a point of trying always to buy American \nvehicles and having done that all my life, it is becoming increasingly \napparent that Detroit is falling further and further behind when it \ncomes to new, environmentally responsible technology to deal with fuel \nefficiency.\n  What we have with the Levin-Bond amendment is a concession to the \nfact that Detroit continues to fail, Detroit continues to come in \nsecond when we deal with new technology. I am concerned about that. Our \nAmerican automobile industry is critically important to our economy.\n  As a person who wants to buy American as often as possible, I look at \nthis and say we have to do better. This Energy bill before the Senate \ndoes not challenge the automobile industry to do better at all. It \nbasically says we are going to include language which does not place \nany burden on the automobile manufacturing industry or anyone else. We \nare going to ignore the CAFE standards and basically allow what is \ncurrently existing to continue indefinitely. That is energy security? I \ndon't think so.\n\n[[Page S10087]]\n\n  One of the concerns I have is the impact on pollution by automobile \nemissions. The United States produces a third of the greenhouse gases \nemitted from automobiles worldwide. Out of all of the emissions from \nautomobiles in the world, the United States is responsible for one-\nthird of the pollution. These greenhouse gases affect agriculture, \npublic health, the economy, our sea levels and shore lines. The \ngreatest impact is at the North and South Pole.\n  Scientists predict, for example, that many species will be threatened \nbecause of the greenhouse gases that are aggravated and exacerbated by \nthe emissions from the tailpipes of our cars and trucks. That is a \nreality.\n  It is not just a question of lessening our dependence on foreign oil \nbut a question of environmental responsibility. Let me give one \nillustration. When I was a young boy growing up in East St. Louis, IL, \none of the biggest treats in my life was to go over to the St. Louis \nzoo. I would stand there watching the polar bears until my mom and dad \nfinally said we had to go home. I got the biggest kick out of that as a \nkid. A lot of children around America look at polar bears--the big, \nhuge, lumbering white bears in zoos--and think, what a magnificent \ncreature. The sad reality is if we do not get honest about the \nenvironment and the destruction of the environment for which we are \nresponsible, this species of animal will be threatened.\n  Scientists say if the most optimistic scenario should evolve, the \npolar bears will not be extinct for 100 years. It means that though \nyour children may see them during their lifetime, their children will \nnot. Others say, no, 50 years. If that is true, if in 50 years polar \nbears will be extinct because of the pollution coming out of tailpipes \nof our cars, because of the refusal of the Senate to accept the \nresponsibility to reduce automobile emissions, to reduce the use of \nfuel, if that happens in 50 years, you can say to your children and \ngrandchildren today, go to the zoo and look closely because this animal \nwill not be here for your children to see. There is no way.\n\n  Do we want that burden? Do we want to accept that burden in the name \nof not pushing the automobile companies to make more fuel-efficient \nvehicles? That is what this vote comes down to.\n  From my point of view it is very simple and very sad. We sometimes \nhave a responsibility to make tough decisions in the Senate. We have a \nresponsibility to say to these big multinational corporations that \nproduce these automobiles: You have to do better. You have to do better \nso the United States is not dependent on foreign oil, so we have true \nenergy security and reduce the environmental degradation and damage of \nair pollution. We have to accept that responsibility. If we don't, who \nwill? Do you expect the marketplace to answer this? The marketplace \nwill answer this by eliminating this species from the Earth. That is \nhow the marketplace will answer.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I take this opportunity to tell the Senator from Illinois \nthrough the Chair that this is the most important amendment dealing \nwith the environment that will be offered all year. I was asked in a \ntelevision interview yesterday what I believed was the most important \nenvironmental issue facing America today. I said fuel efficiency of \nautomobiles. There is not a close second.\n  I believe in the Clean Air Act, clean water, endangered species, \nhistorical preservation, and there is not an issue that is more \nimportant to the people of America and to the world than fuel \nefficiency of these cars and trucks in America today.\n  I want the record to be spread with the fact that the Senator from \nIllinois has offered, in my opinion, the most important environmental \namendment that could be offered this Congress. I give the Senator my \nsupport.\n  I know what the vote was previously on this issue. We will probably \nlose this, which is too bad. The majority of the people in America \nsupport this amendment. The majority of people in America support this \nlegislation. The Senate does not. That is too bad. On this issue we are \nnot reflecting the will of the American people.\n  Does the Senator acknowledge that?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I agree with the Senator. So does the League of \nConservation Voters, an organization in Washington that looks for \nimportant environmental votes. They said the Durbin amendment is a \ncritical vote on the scorecards of Senators across the United States \nbecause it gets to the basics: Do you care about the future? Do you \ncare about the responsibilities of American consumers and American \nproducers of automobiles to make a better car and a better truck? If \nyou do not care, then you want the current situation to continue.\n  Remember the history. If you reflect on the history, where did we \ncome up with the word ``cafe''? How was this created? It was created by \na law in this Chamber in 1975 which said to automobile manufacturers: \nYou have to do better; 14 miles a gallon is sinful. It will make us \nmore dependent on foreign oil and it will pollute the environment. You \nmust produce a more efficient car.\n  The chorus from Detroit and other automobile manufacturers could be \nheard all over the Chamber. They said the opponents of this amendment \nare saying it is technically impossible to make more fuel-efficient \ncars. It cannot be done.\n\n  Second, go ahead and make more fuel-efficient cars; they will not be \nas safe. We guarantee it. We will be riding around in these flimsy cars \nthat are so light that lives will be lost right and left.\n  Third, they said: This is a job killer. More fuel efficiency for cars \nin America means we are going to ship American automobile manufacturing \njobs overseas.\n  Those are the same three arguments they are making today. The Senate \nignored them in 1975. The Senate said to the special interest groups: \nYou are wrong. America's national interests demand we pass this bill. \nAnd we did.\n  As a result of passing that bill, we increased the fuel efficiency of \nAmerica's vehicles from 14 miles a gallon to 27.5 miles a gallon in 10 \nyears by Government mandate from a law we passed.\n  Is America a better place as a result? You bet. We have less air \npollution; we did not sacrifice automobile safety; and we still have a \nvibrant automobile manufacturing industry.\n  To suggest we are going to kill jobs because we want cars that are \nmore fuel efficient is, frankly, to wave the white flag and say \nAmericans are not smart enough. We cannot figure this out.\n  Why is it, time and again, when it comes to fuel-efficient vehicles, \nautomobile manufacturers from other countries seem to have it figured \nout? Look at these hybrid vehicles. Gasoline-electric hybrid vehicles \nhave great potential. Is it as embarrassing to my colleagues in the \nSenate as it is to me that the first two companies to produce these \nvehicles were Toyota and Honda? Where was Ford? Where was General \nMotors? Where was Daimler-Chrysler? Why do we always have to come in \nsecond when it comes to this technology? Is it that our people are not \nsmart enough? I don't buy that. What is lacking is leadership, \nleadership in the American automobile industry and leadership in the \nSenate.\n  My colleagues will come to the Senate today and say 40 miles a gallon \non our cars in 12 years cannot be done. If it is going to be done, you \nare going to condemn soccer moms and their kids to driving back and \nforth in cars that are death traps.\n\n  Listen, another thing that is wrong with the Durbin amendment, you \nwill hear, is it is going to cost us jobs to America. That is the same \nstory, the same argument we heard 28 years ago, the same tired old \narguments that give up and give in instead of showing real leadership \nas this amendment demands that we do.\n  I say to my colleagues in the Senate, for goodness' sake, don't take \nthe telephone calls from the special interest groups for a few hours. \nListen to your heart and your mind and understand where the American \npeople are.\n  Yesterday I was in the south suburbs of Chicago, Palos Heights. A \nwoman came up to me who appeared to be a soccer mom. She stopped by the \nDominick's food store, and I saw her as she walked by. She knew about \nthis amendment, and she said: ``Thank you for doing this. We have to do \nsomething about these gas guzzlers.''\n\n[[Page S10088]]\n\n  She knows, as we know, that no individual consumer can change this. \nUnless we show leadership, Detroit is going to continue to make the \nmost fuel inefficient vehicles, put them on the highway, creating more \npollution, more dependence on foreign oil, and ultimately destroying \nthe environment of the Earth on which we live.\n  I don't think I am overstating the case--not at all. When 60 percent \nof the oil we import into America goes into our transportation, I \nbelieve I am understating the case. You cannot have a serious bill \nabout America's energy security, or any serious legislation that \nconsiders the impact of energy on the environment, and ignore this \nissue. Ignore it we have.\n  The Landrieu amendment, which I supported, is a good idea. It is a \nstudy. It is an important message. It has no teeth, no enforcement. The \nsame thing is true on the Levin-Bond amendment. It is an amendment \nthat, in name, says we are concerned about this but, in fact, creates \nno responsibility on the automobile industry to do anything.\n  We can do things. The technology is within our grasp. What we need is \nthe leadership in the Senate. My amendment would say we have to improve \nthe fuel efficiency of cars and SUVs, minivans and crossover utility \nvehicles, to 40 miles a gallon by the year 2015; to require pickup \ntrucks and vans to achieve a CAFE standard of 27.5 miles per gallon by \nthe same year.\n  It changes the definition of passenger vehicle. That has been one of \nthe most egregious violations of the original intent of the CAFE law \nthat has occurred. You know these huge monster vehicles called Hummers, \nHumvees, and the like. Take a look at those and realize for a minute \nthey are exempt from the CAFE law.\n  Take a look at these massive SUVs and realize we create tax \nincentives for businesses to buy the most fuel inefficient cars in \nAmerica. I have a tax amendment, which will not be part of the \namendment I offer this morning, but it goes after this tax policy which \nencourages the worst instead of the best.\n  The argument was made here, as I said earlier, that this technology \nis so expensive, it is going to cost $1,200 a car.\n  Forgive me; I have been buying cars recently. Cars are pretty \nexpensive nowadays, and $20,000 and up, I guess, is average. Mr. \nPresident, $1,200 on that cost at the front end, if you are going to \nsave $2,000 in gasoline over the life of the vehicle, is certainly not \ntoo much to ask.\n\n  In terms of losing jobs, the Union of Concerned Scientists say the \nopponents of this amendment have it all wrong. The opponents say, if we \ntalk about new technology and American leadership, we are going to lose \njobs. Just the opposite occurs. We are going to be creating jobs to \ncreate this new technology. We will be reducing the cost of business. \nThe businesses that are dependent on cars and trucks with better fuel \nefficiency will have lower costs, lower input costs, will be more \nproductive and more competitive. But the opponents just don't see it. \nThey have tunnel vision. What they see are these massive SUVs getting \nbigger and bigger and the American consumers having no alternative but \nto buy.\n  Many have said the Durbin amendment is not necessary. I would say the \nLandrieu measure includes no new authorities to help reach oil savings \ngoals and no enforcement mechanisms to ensure that the requirement be \nfulfilled.\n  The Levin-Bond amendment, they say, is based on sound science. But I \nwould say the contrary is true. In 2002, the National Academy of \nSciences found that existing and emerging technologies--existing and \nemerging technologies--could improve fuel efficiency of a light truck \n50 percent to 65 percent; the fuel efficiency of cars 40 to 60 percent.\n  The people who oppose this amendment ignore the reality. This \ntechnology is within our grasp. But, sadly, what we have found over and \nover again is that Detroit and other automobile manufacturers do not \nbelieve they have any obligation to offer it.\n  The Levin-Bond amendment does not require an increase in fuel \nefficiency. It delays the job, passes the buck to NHTSA. It adds new \nroadblocks to NHTSA's decisionmaking process. NHTSA has failed to make \nany meaningful increase to fuel economy for 10 years. The record is \nthere. We know if you hand this over to the National Highway Traffic \nSafety Administration, you are not going to get fuel efficiency for a \ndecade. Its latest increase of 1.5 miles per gallon to light trucks is \nalmost laughable, to think that is the best they can do considering \nthat the standards for light trucks were last changed 18 years ago.\n  So if every 18 years we are going to increase the efficiency of \nvehicles in America by 1.5 miles a gallon, how long do you think we \nwill be dependent on foreign oil? The answer is obvious: Forever.\n  We are addressing fuel efficiency through the President's hydrogen \nfuel cell initiative. I support that. But that certainly is not the \ntotal answer.\n  I say to my colleagues, there are people in the business of selling \ncars. There are people in the business of buying cars. There are \nconsumers across America who are going to ask one basic question: Is S. \n14 for real? It is not for real if we do not include any provisions \nrequiring more fuel efficiency and more fuel economy of our vehicles.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 25 minutes.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask that I be notified when I have used 7 \nminutes of my time. I intend to yield the remaining 3 minutes to my \ncolleague from Missouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be notified.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I think Senators are all aware, now, that if \nyou are serious about doing something positive regarding fuel \nefficiency and safety standards but avoiding something negative for \njobs, safety, and consumer choice impact, you should vote yes on the \nLevin-Bond CAFE amendment to the pending Energy bill.\n  I am only going to make this speech one time, not three times as \nthose on the other side do, as we drag it out. I want to point out, \nagain, a similar amendment was agreed to last year on a vote of 62 to \n38, supported on both sides of the aisle.\n  As I said on the floor a few days ago, Members supported our \namendment because they knew then and I hope they know now that setting \nfuel economy standards is complicated. Future standards should be based \non sound science and take into account important criteria: Jobs, \ntechnology, consumer choice, and many others, but also safety--safety \nwhich has been compromised by the politically set lower CAFE standards \nof the past. They should not be based on the political numbers. I urge \nmy colleagues to oppose the higher, politically set CAFE numbers \nincluded in the Durbin and Feinstein amendments.\n  There are a lot of people who are very strongly supportive of the \nBond-Levin amendment--farmers, union members, soccer moms, small \nbusinesses. The United Auto Workers wrote to us specifically urging \ndefeat of the Durbin and Feinstein bills. The Chamber of Commerce also \ndid. Not often do you see the UAW and Chamber teamed up, in opposition, \nbut the people who have proposed these unreasonable standards have \nmanaged to achieve it.\n  I spent a lot of time on this floor talking about the impact of \nexcessive CAFE standards, and I think it is important to talk about the \nhard industry data, economic impact, and the National Academy of \nSciences report. After listening to the debate of the last few years, \nit is clear there are many myths.\n  The first myth is automakers take advantage of an SUV loophole. Fact: \nDuring the creation of the program in 1975, Congress recognized, \nbecause of their utility, different standards should be set for light \ntrucks and passenger cars. While light trucks feature more amenities \nthan their predecessors and provide more than 50 percent better fuel \neconomy than their 1970 counterparts, they remain fundamentally trucks. \nThey satisfy consumer needs for safety, passenger cargo space, towing \nability, and off-road capability.\n  Second myth: Only Congress can increase CAFE standards. The other \nside has floated the old canard that our amendment ignores CAFE \nstandards.\n  Fact No. 1, the Bond-Levin amendment requires increasing CAFE \nstandards to the maximum extent feasible as far as the technology will \npermit.\n\n[[Page S10089]]\n\n  Fact No. 2, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has \nthe authority and expertise to change fuel economy regulations, and a \nfew months ago it announced the biggest increase in 20 years in CAFE \nlevels for light trucks and SUVs. The agency has already announced its \nintention to set new CAFE standards starting in 2008.\n\n  The difference is they are going to use science and technology and \nnot force the use of smaller cars that kill people on the road more \nfrequently.\n  Another myth is that automakers need to use more technology in their \nvehicles to increase full economy.\n  Fact: The auto industry utilizes world-class technology across \nproduct lines. The average automobile contains 40 to 50 microprocessors \nand has far more power than the computers used for the Apollo mission \nto the Moon. Engineers and scientists for the big three domestic \nmanufacturers and their international competitors have focused on \ndevelopments in advanced technology to produce cleaner, more full-\nefficient vehicles along with a host of safety advancements.\n  In addition, my colleague from Illinois has said the National Academy \nof Sciences has a huge number that can be achieved. If you will read \nthat NAS study, I ask my colleagues to focus on the part of the NAS \nreport which states ``The committee cannot emphasize strong enough that \nthe cost-efficient fuel economy levels are not recommended CAFE \ngoals''--not recommended CAFE goals.\n  Let us stick with science.\n  Proponents of higher CAFE standards try to avoid any discussion of \nthe job impact or just dismiss concerns as overreacting. But we have \nheard, as I have said, from union officials, technical experts, plant \nmanagers, local dealers, and small businesses. They tell me the only \nway for manufacturers to meet these unrealistic political numbers is to \ncut back significantly on producing light trucks, minivans, and SUVs, \nor to make them significantly smaller.\n  Look at this. This is a picture of a Ford F-250 series pickup truck. \nIt is a workhorse. You buy this truck because you have a job to do, \nwhether it is farming, construction, hauling, or any number of other \nlegitimate needs. It weighs somewhere between 8,500 pounds gross \nvehicle weight or less than 10,000. It is currently not covered by CAFE \nas it is configured to do more than haul people. Under the Durbin \nproposal, these vehicles would be swept into the CAFE program to the \ndetriment of everybody. They would become CAFE-constrained with several \nbad outcomes.\n  First, you tell this rancher or farmer that he will need to get a \ngolf cart with a little wagon to carry one bale of hay at a time or you \ntell other farmers, ranchers, and construction workers they won't be \nable to buy these vehicles, and then you explain to the workers in the \nautomobile industry how they will have jobs.\n  Did you know the average compensation by employees in the auto \nindustry was $69,500 in 2001? This figure is 60-percent higher than the \naverage U.S. job. Those would be the jobs we would lose because they \ncould no longer make this machine.\n  Furthermore, as I have stated before, mandating politically set CAFE \nstandards in the past has led to reduced weight, which, according to \nthe National Academy of Sciences in the year they studied it, killed \nbetween 1,300 and 2,600 people a year on the road. That is roughly \n2,000 people a year.\n  These are reasons to support the Bond-Levin amendment.\n  I yield 3 minutes to my colleague from Missouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  We have six production facilities in Missouri that make vehicles. In \nKansas City, they make the F-series truck for Ford, and the Escape. In \nSt. Louis, they make the Dodge Ram and the Mercury Mountaineer. There \nare 36,000 jobs in Missouri that are directly dependent on auto \nmanufacturing, and 220,000 jobs that are indirectly dependent on auto \nmanufacturing.\n  The proposal before the Senate would require an immediate and \nsubstantial increase in CAFE standards which would increase the cost of \nthose vehicles by anywhere from $3,000 to $5,000 and would mean, in \nshort, that sales would go down and thousands and thousands of people \nin Missouri would be out of a job. It would be a disaster for them.\n  These are jobs that pay $50,000, $60,000, or $70,000 a year. These \nare jobs that mean kids can go to school and families can take \nvacations.\n  That is what we are talking about. This is not theory. This is not \nabstraction for them. It is bad enough when we try to help people get \njobs and preserve their jobs and we fail because of extreme \nphilosophies or partisanship or personalities or whatever. It is worse \nwhen we do something that actually takes their jobs away from them. \nThey ought to be able to expect this Government is going to try to help \nthem get jobs and preserve jobs. At a minimum, we ought not to pass \nlegislation that takes it away from them.\n  I know this isn't going to happen. The Union of Concerned Scientists \nsays the technology is available to do this without costing any jobs. \nThat is a great comfort for my people back in Missouri who are trying \nto come out of a recession.\n  Maybe we can forgive them for being concerned and not trusting the \nUnion of Concerned Scientists when the people who make the cars--the \nauto manufacturers--say they can't do it. The engineers who design the \ncars say they can't do it. The unions that produce the cars say they \ncan't do it. I hope we will forgive my people back home in Missouri who \ndepend on these jobs for being a little bit concerned.\n  I presided over the House while we were debating the measure to \nexplore for oil in ANWR, which I think is related to this a little bit. \nA lot of folks who didn't want to explore for oil in ANWR wouldn't \naccept the fact we have the technology available today to do that \nwithout affecting the environment. They said we can't take that chance \nbecause it might adversely affect the caribou. It might be bad for the \ntundra in ANWR. Many of the same people who are advocating this big \nincrease in CAFE standards said the technology is not available and we \ncan't do it. They weren't going to take a chance when what was at stake \nwas the caribou or the tundra. But they are willing to take a chance \nwhen what is at stake is somebody else's job in Missouri.\n  I thank the Chair. I will look forward to having a little more time \nlater.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I think I have 10 minutes under the \nreservation. I would like to reserve 2 minutes of that time so Senator \nBond can close when the debate is finished on this side.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could, just for a matter of \nparliamentary procedure, at 11:15 we consider the judges. I ask \nunanimous consent that the Senator from Mississippi be allowed to \ncomplete his statement before we start with the judgeship. It would be \n3 minutes later. Is that what the Senator wants?\n  Mr. LOTT. That would be much appreciated.\n  Mr. REID. We would extend consideration of the judgeship for 3 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: It is my \nunderstanding that I have been given 10 minutes. Is that right?\n  Mr. REID. Yes but not now. We are going to the judge at 11:15. The \nSenator from Mississippi has the floor.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I will speak more later on about the bill \nitself in general terms. But for 3 years the Senate has been trying to \ncome to an agreement on legislation that could get through the \nconference and be sent to the President so we will have a national \nenergy policy. I believe this is a very important issue for the future \nof this country. If we don't have a national energy policy and if we \ndon't deal with these many areas of concern, the day will come when the \nlack of a national energy policy will cause national security or \neconomic problems for this country. We could see that even this coming \nwinter as we see a declining availability of natural gas.\n  By the way, it is inexcusable that we are having a national gas \nshortage. It is because of our policies. That led to\n\n[[Page S10090]]\n\nthis shortage. If we don't have an adequate supply, it will affect the \neconomy across the board. It is already affecting the chemical industry \nin my State, and the fertilizer industry. It is going to affect \npeople's quality of life. This is so important. We need the whole \npackage. We need more production. We need new technology. We need clean \ncoal technology. That is just one example. We need more conservation of \na responsible nature. We need to look at alternative fuels. I think a \nlot of these alternative fuels are, quite frankly, not very legitimate. \nBut it is legitimate to try to find alternative fuels.\n  I urge my colleagues, let us work together. Let us get this done, get \nit into conference, and let us produce a national energy policy.\n  I think this issue is more important than any issue Congress is \nconsidering at this time. It is urgent that we get this work done.\n  I wanted to speak in support of the Bond-Levin amendment. I know very \ngood work has been done on this amendment. I worked last year with \nSenator Bond and Senator Levin. They have given a lot of thought to how \nthis should be designed. It bases decisions on these CAFE standards on \nscience and solid data. I believe this idea of just plucking a number \nout of the air and saying that number is achievable is irresponsible. \nIt may not even be achievable. Based on what? It makes somebody feel \ngood? And what about the choices for the American people? What about \nthe sacrifices in safety that we are asking them to make?\n\n  When you just pick a number, such as 32 miles per gallon or 37 miles \nper gallon, I don't think that is a wise decision, unless it has been \nbased on thorough study and solid data. Of course, the organization to \nmake that determination is the NHTSA. They have the expertise to \nanalyze the numbers and consider all that should be involved, including \nthe jobs that might be affected, the technology, how this improved fuel \nefficiency could be obtained, and, yes, safety. There are proposals out \nthere which would adversely affect all these areas, including jobs, \nemployment, consumer choice, and safety.\n  The National Academy of Sciences CAFE report declared there will be \nmore deaths and injuries if fuel economy standards are raised too fast \nwithout proper consideration given to how that is being done and what \nimpact it might have.\n  This amendment is supported by a broad coalition: labor, the UAW, the \nAFL-CIO, the Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of \nManufacturers, the Farm Bureau, automobile dealers, and over 40 other \norganizations. That ought to tell you something. That type of broad \nsupport indicates that people are concerned about what might be done \nwith this CAFE standard.\n  Yes, we should continue to work to improve fuel efficiency. We should \nhave incentives to move in that direction. But I am very worried we are \ngoing to cause some real damage. What about the choice made by \nAmericans? This is still America, isn't it?\n  Is the Federal Government going to mandate that every driver drive an \nautomobile like the one in this picture? Last year, I talked about the \n``purple people eater.'' Shown in this picture is a version of the \n``purple people eater.'' That might be fine around town in Washington, \nDC, but I can tell you, on some of the back roads in my State of \nMississippi that will get you killed. That is not practical and people \nwill not choose to drive it. They want an SUV or they want a pickup \ntruck. And they don't want to be penalized by the Federal Government \nsaying to them: You have to do this. And, by the way, if you don't do \nthis, we will make you pay some kind of a price. This is ridiculous.\n  In my own case, my family is growing. We have our children and \ngrandchildren. It is a wonderful deal. Then, in August, when we take \nour annual family vacation, I have a choice. I can have a bigger \nautomobile with the three seats in it, where we can securely carefully \nfasten our grandchildren in these safety seats. We can take two \nautomobiles, each being an SUV, or we can take three automobiles. Now, \nhow much fuel is saved? And how much safety is given up?\n  Mr. President, this is ridiculous. It continues to be. It was last \nyear. The American people are speaking with their choices. They are \nvoting with their feet and their cash. They can buy these more fuel-\nefficient automobiles, but they are not doing it.\n  What percent is actually buying these smaller automobiles? I think, \nany way you slice it, not more than 14 percent. The American people are \nmaking other choices.\n  So I think what we are doing is very important. I think there are a \nlot of very substantive issues involved, and the least of which is not \nthe American people's choices.\n\n  I do not think we should be forced to drive that automobile shown in \nthe picture. I don't know who makes that automobile. I don't know where \nit is made, but it is probably reposing somewhere in France or Germany. \nI like the bigger vehicle shown in the picture behind it.\n  The American people have a need for vans or SUVs or pickup trucks. I \nunderstand there is going to be an amendment offered that will pick on \nparticularly light trucks. Goodness gracious, light trucks use less \nfuel. Why pick on a light truck versus a heavy truck? This makes no \nsense.\n  I oppose the amendment that is going to be advocated by Senator \nMcCain and, I think, Senator Feinstein. I oppose the Durbin amendment.\n  This amendment by Bond and Levin is bipartisan. It makes common \nsense. It moves us in the right direction. But it is based on \ncommonsense science and solid data. So I urge that we adopt this \namendment, and let's leave the choice in the hands of the American \npeople and not have the ``Grand Poobah Government'' tell us what we \nhave to do in one more area. Don't make the American people drive this \nlittle grunt of a car shown here.\n  Mr. President, do I have any time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to the \nSenator from Missouri, keeping in mind that Senator Bond would have 2 \nminutes to close at the end of the debate on this section, I believe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I doubt I will use the full 3\\1/2\\ \nminutes. It is just that I ran out of time before when I was in the \nmiddle of ranting and raving on this subject. I would hate to close my \nremarks on that tone, anyway.\n  Let me explain to the Senate why this is so important to me \npersonally. I recently visited the Kansas City Ford plant where they \nmake the new Ford 150 truck. It is a triumph of American engineering \nand the productivity of American workers.\n  The workers there are proud of that truck. And they should be proud \nof it. It means many people will be able to travel in this country \nsafely and with comfort. I drive an SUV. I don't drive it because I am \ntrying to hurt the environment or affect our energy independence. I \ndrive it because we have small children. I used to drive a hatchback, \nbut if we got in an accident in that hatchback, it would fold up like \nan accordion. That is why I drive an SUV. That is why millions of \npeople do.\n  The Senator from Mississippi is right to say it is wrong to disparage \nthese vehicles. People who make these vehicles in Missouri and around \nthe country are proud of what they do. They are satisfied with their \njobs. Let's not gamble with their jobs. We are trying to come out of a \nrecession. We are trying to create jobs in this country.\n  Vote for the Bond-Levin amendment. It is a good, modern amendment and \nmoves us forward. It protects people's jobs. I urge the Senate to \nsupport the amendment.\n  I thank the Senator from Mississippi for yielding me a few extra \nminutes. I yield back whatever time remains.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/29/senate-section/article/S10090-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10090-S10100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  NOMINATION OF PRISCILLA RICHMAN OWEN, OF TEXAS, TO BE UNITED STATES \n              CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT--Resumed\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, not withstanding the \nprovisions of rule XXII, there will now be 1 hour of debate equally \ndivided between the Senator from Utah, Mr.\n\n[[Page S10091]]\n\nHatch, or his designee, and the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy, or his \ndesignee.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nunanimous consent that the time be charged equally between Senator \nHatch and Senator Leahy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Ohio has the floor, \nbut through the Chair to him, I would note we are under a time \nconstraint. If the Senator wishes to speak, I have no objection as long \nas it is charged off of Senator Hatch's time.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I would like permission to speak on the \nCAFE amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as I indicated, I object unless the time is \ncharged to Senator Hatch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time will be so charged, unless the Senator \nfrom Utah objects.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask what the request is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The unanimous consent request is that the \nSenator from Ohio be able to speak on CAFE standards.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. For 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Charged to the time for the judge.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask the Senator, could you keep it a little lower than \nthat because we--\n  Mr. REID. I cannot hear the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Do you think you could do it in less time than that \nbecause we have very little time.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I can do it in 6 minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I thank the Senator from Utah.\n  (The remarks of Mr. VOINOVICH are printed in today's Record in \nlegislative session.)\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah for \ngiving me this opportunity to speak on behalf of the Bond-Levin CAFE \nstandards.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are under an hour of time equally divided. \nThe Senator controls 24 remaining minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of the \nnomination of Priscilla Owen for the United States Court of Appeals for \nthe Fifth Circuit and to speak about the pattern of political tactics \nbeing used against President Bush's well-qualified judicial nominees.\n  We find ourselves at an important point in Senate history. History \nwill show an effort by a minority of Senators to completely block well-\nqualified circuit court nominees during the 108th Congress. History \nwill further show that this minority group of Senators was not asking \nfor a full and open debate on the Senate floor. They were not asking \nfor meaningful deliberation on these well-qualified nominees. Rather, \nthis minority group of Senators was committed to reworking the meaning \nof advice and consent.\n  I think we can agree that the confirmation process is broken. I \ncertainly do hope we can find a constructive way to restore the \nprocess, but recent events do not lead me to be overly optimistic--not \nwhen I hear injudicious talk about plans for more filibusters and not \nwhen I hear my colleagues characterize our advice and consent duty in \nterms of batting averages or quarterback completion rates. If anything, \nmy colleagues on the other side haven't let Justice Owen even get up to \nthe plate. This is not a matter of acquiring a certain win-loss record \non the baseball field; this is a matter of whether we will be fair to \nour judicial nominees--the many talented men and women who have \nvolunteered to serve our country through judicial service.\n  In Justice Owen's case, a handful of Senators blocked her nomination \nin committee last year, preventing a simple up-or-down vote on the \nSenate floor. Nearly a year later, Justice Owen still has not been \nafforded a vote by the full Senate. How much longer must she wait? One \nof my colleagues on the other side has already answered this question \nfor himself, saying that there are not enough hours in the universe for \nsufficient debate, but I strongly disagree. We have debated long \nenough. Justice Owen has been on the Senate floor for 4 months. It has \nbeen 7 months since she was renominated by President Bush. It has been \nmore than a year since her first hearing, and it has been more than 2 \nyears since she was first nominated by President Bush on May 9, 2001--\n811 days in total. During all that time, she has not been afforded a \nvote. I think it is time Justice Owen was given the courtesy of an up-\nor-down vote. Keep in mind, she has the unanimous well-qualified rating \nof the American Bar Association.\n  Priscilla Owen could not be a better selection for the Federal court. \nShe attended Baylor University and Baylor University School of Law, \ngraduating cum laude from both institutions. She finished third in her \nlaw school class. Justice Owen earned the highest score on the Texas \nbar exam, and she has 17 years of experience as a commercial litigator.\n  Justice Owen is committed to legal services for the poor. She \nsuccessfully fought with others for more funding for legal aid services \nfor the indigent.\n  Justice Owen is committed to creating opportunities for women in the \nlegal profession. She has been a member of the Texas Supreme Court \nGender Neutral Task Force, and she is viewed as a mentor by younger \nwomen attorneys. She was one of the first women to sit on the Texas \nSupreme Court. Incredibly, this is the woman the liberal attack groups \nsmear as ``anti-woman.'' Give me a break.\n  Justice Owen's confirmation is supported by Texas lawyers such as E. \nThomas Bishop, president of the Texas Association of Defense Counsel, \nand William B. Emmons, a Texas trial attorney and a Democrat who says \nthat Justice Owen ``will serve [the Fifth Circuit] and the United \nStates exceptionally well.'' After a full review of Justice Owen's \nrulings, Victor Schwartz, a respected trial attorney and co-author of \nthe leading torts textbook, concluded that she is a ``moderate \njurist,'' neither pro-plaintiff nor pro-defendant.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of Mr. Schwartz's letter to the \nJudiciary Committee be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 Shook, Hardy, & Bacon L.L.P.,\n\n                                     Washington DC, July 18, 2002.\n     Re nomination of Texas Supreme Court Justice Priscilla Owen.\n\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Throughout the past three decades, many \n     members of your Committee have been kind enough to ask my \n     views about tort law. I have taught in law school, and \n     practiced on behalf of plaintiffs in the 1970s. I currently \n     practice in the defense firm of Shook, Hardy & Bacon, L.L.P. \n     and represent the American Tort Reform Association. You have \n     appreciated that when I share my views with you, I try my \n     utmost to be objective. Because almost anyone's views on \n     judges are likely to be seen as having bias, I have refrained \n     from commenting on any judicial nominee.\n       I am now writing you about Texas Supreme Court Justice \n     Priscilla Owen because she has been attacked as being unfair \n     in the very area of my expertise, tort or liability law. \n     Since 1976, I have been co-author of the most widely used \n     torts textbook in the United States, Prosser, Wade & \n     Schwartz's Cases and Materials on Torts. I have also served \n     on the three principal American Law Institute Advisory \n     Committees on the new Restatement of Torts (Third). The study \n     of tort law has been the love of my professional life.\n       Because of my academic and practice obligations, I have had \n     a very deep interest in opinions of law in the field of \n     torts. Naturally, I am familiar with state supreme court \n     judges or justices who are thought to be ``pro-plaintiff'' or \n     ``pro-defendant.'' In that regard, when I heard about \n     controversies surrounding Justice Owen, I was somewhat \n     puzzled because I had not placed her in either group.\n       This past weekend, I reviewed most of her principal \n     opinions in tort law. My review of\n\n[[Page S10092]]\n\n     Justice Owen's opinions indicates that any characterization \n     of Justice Owen as ``pro-plaintiff'' or ``pro-defendant'' is \n     untrue. Those who have attacked her as being ``pro-\n     defendant'' have engaged in selective review of her \n     opinions, and have mischaracterized her fundamental \n     approach to tort law.\n       Justice Owen's fundamental approach to tort law is to make \n     it stable. On the one hand, she is not a judge who would be \n     likely to jump to the front of a plaintiff's lawyers petition \n     to expand the scope of tort law. Furthermore, she would be \n     unlikely to allow claims for brand-new types of damages, such \n     as hedonic damages, or create cutting-edge liability claims \n     (e.g., allowing a lawsuit against a fast food chain, where \n     there was no showing that an individual plaintiff's health \n     was actually harmed by eating at that chain). On the other \n     hand, she would not and has not arbitrarily thwarted the \n     rights of plaintiffs under existing tort law.\n       Let me give you just a few examples. In Merrell-Dow \n     Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Havner, 953 S.W.2d 706 (Tex. 1997), \n     a decision for which she was roundly criticized by a group \n     called ``Texans for Public Justice,'' Justice Owen held that \n     the evidence was legally insufficient to establish that a \n     birth defect was caused by exposure to the drug \n     Bendectin. Bendectin is the only drug \n     that helps alleviate the severe symptoms of morning sickness. \n     It is still approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration \n     and regulatory agencies throughout the world. As Justice Owen \n     recognized, the attempts by plaintiff's counsel to tie the \n     birth defects of the plaintiff's child to Bendectin \n     in the Havner case were insufficient. The Supreme Court of \n     the United States itself recognized, in a case involving that \n     very drug, that judges should act as gatekeepers, and not \n     permit juries to make judgments based on bad science. See \n     Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579 \n     (1993).\n       I am not surprised that the Association of Trial Lawyers of \n     America (ATLA), the organized plaintiffs bar, and those who \n     have empathy with that group criticized Justice Owen for her \n     decision. They also criticized the United States Supreme \n     Court when it rendered the Daubert decision. ATLA and its \n     sympathizers believe that judges should not act as \n     gatekeepers; rather, they believe that juries should be \n     permitted to weight scientific evidence as they choose.\n       Here is the rather interesting point. In a case decided \n     almost simultaneously with Havner, not mentioned by ``Texans \n     for Public Justice'' or other groups criticizing Justice \n     Owen, she would have allowed an adult to pursue a sexual \n     abuse claim against an alleged abuser who purportedly did the \n     wrongful acts when the plaintiff was a child. In the case \n     S.V. v. R.V., 933 S.W.2d 1 (Tex. 1996), expert testimony \n     indicated that the plaintiff had ``repressed memories'' that \n     arose when the plaintiff was an adult. The majority held that \n     expert testimony was insufficient to warrant the application \n     of the ``discovery rule,'' which would have tolled the \n     statute of limitations. It required ``objectively \n     verifiable'' evidence of abuse to apply the discovery rule \n     and toll the statute. Justice Owen noted, however, that such \n     evidence was often unavailable, and the unavailability of the \n     evidence is frequently due to acts done by the alleged \n     abuser. She would have held that the repressed memory \n     evidence was sufficient to toll the statute and allow the \n     claim. I recommend that Members of this Committee read \n     this case and note that Justice Owen wrote the sole \n     dissenting opinion in the case.\n       In a later case, Justice Owen prevented another plaintiff \n     from falling into a statute of limitations trap. A patient \n     brought a malpractice case against a surgeon in his \n     individual capacity. The patient later amended his complaint, \n     and named the surgeon's professional association as a \n     defendant. The association moved to dismiss the case because \n     the statute of limitations had expired by the time the suit \n     was brought against the association. Writing for the Texas \n     Supreme Court, Justice Owen held that the cause of action \n     brought against the surgeon in his individual capacity \n     preserved the potential of the claim against the association. \n     See Chilkewitz v. Hyson, 22 S.W.3d 825 (Tex. 1999).\n       Justice Owen's views about product liability law strike the \n     same balance. For example, Justice Owen joined in a Supreme \n     Court of Texas opinion that considered a question certified \n     by a federal court as to whether a manufacturer of a product \n     used by adults--a cigarette lighter--might have a duty, in \n     some situations, to childproof the product. Justice Owen \n     joined with the Court in holding that a manufacturer may have \n     such an obligation. See Hernandez v. Tokai Corp., 2 \n     S.W.3d.251 (Tex. 1999).\n       One finds the same sense of ``balance'' in Justice Owen's \n     opinions in other areas of tort law. In a very interesting \n     opinion, Justice Owen joined with the Texas Supreme Court to \n     strip a defendant business of its defenses based on a \n     plaintiff's fault when that defendant business had decided to \n     opt out of the workers' compensation system. Justice Owen \n     supported the sound public policy that would discourage \n     businesses from opting out of workers' compensation and \n     taking their chance on their vagaries of a tort lawsuit in \n     the workplace. As you and Members of your Committee know, a \n     fundamental reason why workers' compensation was adopted in \n     the first place is so that a worker's fault does not preclude \n     him or her from obtaining compensation for a workplace \n     injury. See Kroger Co. v. Keng, 23 S.W.3d 347 (Tex. 2000).\n       I wish to reiterate that I am not suggesting that Justice \n     Owen is a plaintiffs' lawyer's ``dream judge.'' She is not. \n     For example, when the Texas Supreme Court addressed the issue \n     of whether jurors should be told that if they find a \n     plaintiff more than 50% responsible for his or her own \n     injury, the plaintiff might lose, Justice Owen dissented from \n     the majority. The majority found that such information was \n     allowed to go to the jury. Justice Owen believed such action \n     could cause jurors to look more at the effect of the 50% rule \n     than the facts of the case. See H.E. Butt Grocery Co. v. \n     Bilotto, 985 S.W.2d 22 (Tex. 1998). While not everyone \n     (including myself) would agree with Justice Owen's decision, \n     it is anchored in logical judicial precedent and has a clear \n     public policy basis. See Victor Schwartz, Comparative \n     Negligence, Sec. 17-5(a) (3d Ed. 1994).\n       My fundamental point is that in the area of tort law, \n     Justice Owen is a moderate jurist; she is neither a \n     trailblazer for plaintiffs nor a captive of corporate \n     interests.\n       I would be pleased to answer any questions or inquiries by \n     Members of your Committee, and I value your taking the time \n     to read this statement.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Victor E. Schwartz.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Justice Owen is a consensus nominee. A bipartisan majority \nof the Senate supports her confirmation. Both of Justice Owen's home \nState Senators, Senators Hutchison and Cornyn, back her. The American \nBar Association has awarded her a unanimous well-qualified rating, \ntheir highest rating, and the gold standard formerly used by many of my \nDemocratic colleagues.\n  Former Texas Supreme Court Justices John Hill, Jack Hightower, and \nRaul Gonzalez--all Democrats--say Justice Owen is unbiased and \nrestrained in her decision-making. Alberto Gonzales, another former \nTexas Supreme Court colleague, says she will perform superbly as a \nFederal judge.\n  Fifteen past presidents of the Texas State Bar, both Democrats and \nRepublicans, who hold a variety of views on important legal and social \nissues, agree that Justice Owen is an outstanding nominee. Those who \nknow Justice Owen best support her confirmation.\n  Sure, the usual abortion-rights groups and highly partisan Texas \ntrial lawyer interest groups have announced that they expect Senators \nto filibuster. But what else is new? They have done and will continue \nto do what they do best: distort, smear, and profile. As Rena Pederson \nwrote in an op-ed published in the Dallas Morning News, ``The people \nwho know Priscilla Owen the best all agree. They say the Texas Supreme \nCourt judge is nothing like the person portrayed by critics of her \nappointment to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this editorial be printed in \nthe Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Dallas Morning News, Feb. 2, 2003]\n\n             Senate Didn't Get To Know the Real Judge Owen\n\n                           (By Rena Pederson)\n\n       The people who know Priscilla Owen the best all agree. They \n     say the Texas Supreme Court just is nothing like the person \n     portrayed by critics of here appointment to the 5th U.S. \n     Circuit Court of Appeals.\n       Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee voted along \n     party lines in September and rejected her appointment. They \n     contended she had an anti-abortion bias and was a tool of big \n     businesses like Enron.\n       But if they had bothered to check with the people who grew \n     up with her in Waco or worked with her in top law firms in \n     Houston or clerked at the Texas Supreme Court, they would \n     have gotten a different, more accurate picture.\n       Those sources describe Judge Owen this way: She is a \n     doggedly dutiful legal scholar who couldn't care less about \n     party labels or moneyed interests. Many cite her as a helpful \n     mentor for other women in the legal profession. She prefers \n     cooking for friends to the political or social circuit. Yes, \n     they say, she's a devoted Sunday school teacher, but not what \n     used to be called a ``goody-two-shoes'' or a narrow-minded \n     religious zealot. She was known to enjoy a few beers with her \n     friends at Baylor University and has a smart sense of humor. \n     She's a water-skier and was spunky enough to try \n     rollerblading in her kitchen a few years ago, breaking her \n     ankle.\n       The American Bar Association gave the 48-year-old Texas \n     judge its highest rating, ``well qualified.'' Many prominent \n     Democrats from Texas--including former Texas Supreme Court \n     Chief Justice John Hill and former State Bar President Lynne \n     Liberato--spoke up in Justice Owen's defense. But their \n     voices were discounted. A public relations campaign was \n     generated by several interest groups, using snippets from the \n     hundreds of cases that had come before her bench, in order to \n     make her look as bad as possible and snub President Bush.\n\n[[Page S10093]]\n\n       What particularly dismayed those who know the Texas justice \n     well is that she was made to look anti-abortion and anti-\n     woman. They emphatically insist that, while conservative, she \n     is not an activist or ideologue with an agenda.\n       Laura Rowe, who worked with Ms. Owen at the Andrews and \n     Kurth law firm in Houston, said, ``I came across her when I \n     was a young lawyer starting out, and she was a great mentor \n     for the other women. She was so smart, hardworking, but funny \n     and normal at the same time. When I met her, I thought \n     `that's a woman I would like to be like.' She was one of the \n     lawyers that people wanted to work for, tough but fair. It \n     did disturb me to see her vilified.''\n       Kristin O'Neal, who was a law clerk at the Texas Supreme \n     Court, said, ``I understand why people distorted her \n     opinions, because it furthered their agenda, but to say she \n     has some kind of activist agenda is absurd to me. She takes \n     very logical, methodical approach to everything. They tried \n     to make her look bad for writing an opinion that benefited \n     Enron because She had received a campaign contribution from \n     Enron some time earlier. What people didn't know was that it \n     was a unanimous ruling--and the judges don't select the \n     opinions they write. It's a random drawing. You might \n     disagree with one of her rulings, but I never, ever sensed \n     that she was using her position in an activist manner or to \n     further any personal beliefs. She takes her job and her role \n     very seriously.''\n       Ruth Miller, who has known Ms. Owen since they were in high \n     school in Waco, said, ``I don't know how Priscilla remained \n     so composed and calm, when some of the senators cut her off. \n     I though she handled herself with dignity, even when she \n     should have been able to continue. What people don't know is \n     that she had to work for weeks and weeks on her own to \n     prepare, on the weekends, no vacation. But she knew I was \n     going through a serious health problem, and so she would call \n     to check on me every week. And in the throes of the \n     confirmation process, she went with me to my appointmet at \n     the hospital in Houston and just brought her portfolio with \n     her.''\n       Nancy Lacy, Ms. Owen's sister, attended the hearings in \n     Washington and sat behind Justice Owen, as did the minister \n     from the church Justice Owen attends in Austin. ``It was eye-\n     opening,'' she said. ``It was a hard experience because no \n     matter what she said, they were going to stick with the \n     propaganda. It was obvious. I was hoping they were going to \n     really give her a shot, try to get to know who she really is, \n     ask her thoughtful questions. But the information they has \n     was wrong to begin with. I felt sorry for them at times; \n     their staff didn't do a very good job; it was obvious the \n     special interest groups gave them the information, and they \n     didn't research to see if it was true. The handwriting was on \n     the wall. I just wanted to say to them, `You're missing the \n     boat. You're missing the opportunity to get to know a really \n     neat person.' ''\n       By all accounts, it was a wearing experience for the Texas \n     judge. Although she understood she had been caught in a \n     political spite match, she couldn't help but be pained by the \n     attacks on her character. Still, her nomination has been \n     resubmitted by Mr. Bush, so Americans may get a chance to see \n     the rest of her story after all.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, Justice Priscilla Owen will be an excellent \nFederal judge.\n  We have a choice: Will we continue to block another highly qualified \nnominee for partisan reasons or will we allow each Senator to decide \nthe merits of the nomination for himself or herself?\n  I know my choice. We should allow a vote. I hope my colleagues will \ndo the right thing and make the same choice.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH. How much time does the Senator need?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Five to seven minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nTexas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, who has done yeoman's work in shepherding President Bush's \nhighly qualified judicial nominees through the Judiciary Committee and \nto the floor of the Senate.\n  Chairman Hatch has mentioned a number of people on both sides of the \naisle who support the nomination of this good woman to the Fifth \nCircuit Court of Appeals. I have a few comments--first, to echo those \ncomments in terms of the consensus of opinion in my State of Texas as \nto the good work that Priscilla Owen has done as a justice in the Texas \nSupreme Court. But I also bring a personal perspective to this debate \nbecause I served with Priscilla Owen for 3 years on the Texas Supreme \nCourt. Frankly, I do not recognize the caricature that has been painted \nof this good judge in the debate before the Senate.\n  In May of this year, I spoke on the floor regarding the 2-year \nanniversary of Justice Owen's nomination. That dismal anniversary \nshowed us just how far our confirmation process had gone awry. And now \nit has gotten even worse.\n  Today's vote is just the first in a series this week. Over the next 4 \ndays, we will see just how far the minority in this body is willing to \ngo to block well qualified nominees and parrot the talking points \nprovided by special interest groups who oppose this and other highly \nqualified judicial nominees. It is my hope that the Senate will do the \nright thing and provide an up-or-down vote for this judicial nominee.\n  As I said, Justice Owen and I served for 3 years together on the \nTexas Supreme Court--from the time she came in January 1995 until the \ntime I left in October of 1997. During those 3 years, I had a chance to \nobserve Justice Owen's work habits and her basic judicial philosophy at \nwork, how she approaches her job, how she thinks about the law, and how \nshe acts given that position of public trust that judges hold.\n  I can tell you from my personal experience that Justice Owen is an \nexceptional judge who understands her profound duty to follow the law \nand enforce the will of the legislature.\n  That is, of course, one reason the American Bar Association has given \nher a unanimous well qualified rating, and that is why she has such \nstrong bipartisan backing. That is why she enjoys the enthusiastic \nsupport of the people of Texas, where she got 84 percent in the last \nelection from the people who know her the best.\n  Not once during my tenure with Justice Owen did I ever see her \nattempt to pursue some political or other agenda at the expense of the \nlaw as she understood it. I can tell you that Justice Owen believes \nvery strongly, as I do and Americans do across this land, that judges \nare called upon not to act as another legislative branch, or as a \npolitician, but as judges--to faithfully read statutes and to follow \nthe law as written by the legislature and the precedents established by \nhigher courts in earlier times.\n  Some of my colleagues have, unbelievably, taken the position that \nJustice Owen is to be criticized for disagreeing with other members of \nthe Texas Supreme Court in some of her opinions. Some of my colleagues \nact shocked that appellate judges, particularly on the highest court in \nmy State, will disagree with one another and have spirited debates in \nthe form of opinions they write. But I firmly believe that is exactly \nthe job that is expected of a judge and that Justice Owen has fulfilled \nthat position well.\n  There are those who apparently believe a judge is not supposed to \nhave a real debate about their interpretation of the law and is just \nsupposed to assert his or her own will, regardless of what the law \nactually says. Perhaps these advocates believe a judge is supposed to \nfollow the practice of what author James Lileks has called ``teasing \npenumbras from the emanations of the glow of the spark of the \nreflection of the echo of the intent of the Framers.''\n  I fundamentally disagree with that idea. If we did not have judges \ndisagree with one another, it would mean somebody was not doing their \njob.\n  By the time cases get to the top echelons of our judicial system, \nthey are the hardest cases. They are the cases that cannot be solved by \nlower levels of the judiciary or indeed by settlement between the \nparties. These are important issues and must be decided, through study \nand debate.\n  A judge, unlike a Member of this body, cannot choose to simply walk \naway and ignore a thorny legal issue. Judges are not supposed to make \nlaw. They are supposed to interpret and enforce the law written by the \nlegislature.\n  In Texas, Justice Owen followed this duty to the letter. From \nexperience and from observation, I know that Justice Owen believes \nstrongly that judges are called upon to faithfully read the statutes on \nthe books, read the precedents in the case, and then apply them to the \ncase before the court.\n  Justice Owen did this job, and she did it well. She is a brilliant \nlegal scholar and a warm and engaging person. To see the kind of \ndisrespect the nomination of such a great Texas judge--and a great \nTexas woman--has received in this body is more than just disappointing. \nIt is an insult to Justice Owen. It is an offense against the great\n\n[[Page S10094]]\n\nState of Texas. And it is beneath the dignity of this institution.\n  It is clear who is calling the tune repeated by the minority \nopposition here on this floor. The beltway special interest groups are \nnot interested in trying to understand or evaluate Justice Owen by her \nreal record because, if they were, they would see it as a sterling \nrecord of intelligence, accomplishment, and bipartisan support. The \nspecial interest groups are not interested in the confirmation of \nnominees who merely interpret the law and render judgment responsibly. \nThey are only interested in confirming people who they believe are \nadvocates of their interests, something that is totally at odds with \nthe role a judge is supposed to perform.\n  Sadly, it is clear that these same special interest groups are \ninterested in obstructing as many of President Bush's judicial nominees \nas they possibly can. Those who oppose Justice Owen's confirmation \nappear to have really no stomach for debate and talking about the \nfacts. They choose instead to filibuster and engage in the worst kind \nof mean-spirited and destructive political attacks.\n  I can only hope that my colleagues will realize the truth of what is \ngoing on, and reject this special interest influence on the judicial \nconfirmation process. I can only hope that ultimately we will all \nstrive for a process that is fair and consistent with our \nconstitutional duty.\n  And I can only hope my colleagues realize that by blocking a vote on \nPriscilla Owen, they make themselves allies to these groups, groups \nthat rejoice at the prospect of a Senate in constant gridlock over \nthese qualified nominees.\n  My colleagues should not think the American people do not know what \nis going on here. They see when a nominee's well-recognized abilities \nare ignored in favor of scare tactics and revisionist history, and they \nsee some ignore the interests of the States from which they were \nelected, and instead kowtow to special interest groups.\n  I am confident that Members of the Senate are wise enough to reject \nthis inhuman caricature that has been drawn of Justice Priscilla Owen \nby special interest groups intent on vilifying, demonizing, and \nmarginalizing an admirable nominee. And I know that if we were allowed \nto hold a vote, a bipartisan majority of this body stands ready to \nconfirm Justice Priscilla Owen to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. \nThe question is whether that vote will ever happen.\n  I hope that my colleagues will give these qualified nominees what \nthey deserve, and allow them to have an up or down vote, today, \ntomorrow, and every day this week. For the sake of the Senate, the \nNation, and our independent judiciary, I hope that we will not have 4 \ndays of filibusters.\n  I hope my colleagues will vote to allow this fine judge an up-or-down \nvote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  If neither side yields time, time will be charged equally to both \nsides.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, how much time does the Senator from Utah \nhave?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 11 minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, how much time does the Senator from Alabama \ndesire?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Five minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nAlabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, in the history of this country, we have \nnot had a filibuster of a circuit judge or a district judge before and \nreally never even one for a supreme court judge. This is an \nunprecedented obstruction of a nominee--something that really is \nunheard of.\n  It is particularly distressing to me, beyond words almost, that this \nfine nominee, Priscilla Owen, would be a person who would be blocked by \na filibuster when she clearly has the votes, if given an up-or-down \nvote in this body, to be confirmed for the Fifth Circuit Court of \nAppeals. She is extraordinarily capable. She finished at the top of her \nclass in law school. She made the highest possible score on the Texas \nbar exam. What a strong statement that is. She won her last race for \nthe Supreme Court of Texas with 84 percent of the vote. She was \nunanimously rated well qualified, the highest possible rating the \nAmerican Bar Association can give for this position, when they \nevaluated her. She has the support of 15 former presidents of the Texas \nBar Association and is just extraordinary in every way.\n  As I looked through her record, I stumbled on this letter from a \nfemale attorney, Julie Woody, who clerked for the Texas Supreme Court. \nShe noted she is a lifetime Democrat and she had the occasion to \nobserve Justice Owen. She wrote these words. She went to Yale Law \nSchool, is a native of Pennsylvania, and practiced law in New York \nCity. She said:\n\n       As a result of my encounters with Judge Owen during my \n     clerkship, I came to regard her as a judge and legal scholar \n     of the highest caliber. She has a brilliant legal mind that \n     is matched by her legendary work ethic. Her analysis of any \n     issue is rigorous and true to the letter and spirit of the \n     law. Her impeccable ethics and honesty and lack of political \n     motivation in her decisionmaking were apparent in her \n     discussions of cases and the manner in which she decided \n     them.\n       Justice Owen is among the best and the brightest--she will \n     bring integrity, intelligence and the highest ethical \n     standards to the Fifth Circuit.\n\n  She goes on to note that she got to know her later because her \nhusband was in the seminary and at St. Barnabas, an Episcopal Church in \nAustin, a mission church. Priscilla was one of the original leaders and \na member of the altar guild where she teaches Sunday school. She said \nabout her:\n\n       Priscilla worked incredibly hard behind the scenes, never \n     seeking any attention or praise for her efforts. She \n     exemplified servant leadership.\n\n  What is the complaint about this excellent, magnificent justice on \nthe Texas Supreme Court? What is the objection? They do not like the \nfact that she affirmed lower court opinions concerning parental \nnotification when children, minors, desire to have an abortion. Eighty \npercent of the American people believe parents should be notified \nbefore a minor child should be allowed to have an abortion. The Texas \nlaw is not an extreme law. It simply says the parents should be \nnotified, and they do not have a right to object or stop an abortion \nfrom going forward--just one of the parents be notified, actually. If \nthe minor does not like that, they can go to court. They go to court, \nand they have a hearing before a judge. A judge takes evidence on these \nissues and makes a decision at that point whether the child who does \nnot want to notify even one of their parents should notify one of their \nparents.\n  If the judge concludes that she should notify a parent and the child \nand her lawyer are not happy, then the child can appeal to the Court of \nAppeals in Texas. Three judges will then hear the case. They will \ndecide whether the trial judge who heard the evidence ruled correctly \nor not. If they rule that the child has to notify her parents that she \nintends to have an abortion, or at least one of the parents, only then \ndoes it go to the Supreme Court of Texas.\n  Priscilla Owen never heard one of these cases, never made an initial \ndecision on one of these cases. She was one of a number of justices on \nthe Texas Supreme Court. Her only responsibility was to review the \nrecord of judges who had already decided and concluded, based on facts \nand evidence, having seen the minor and heard the evidence and saw the \nwitnesses in person, her question was: Should the decision be affirmed?\n  The opponents are unhappy that she voted to affirm both the trial \njudge and the three-court panel below the Texas Supreme Court. This is \nnot good. This is a radical obsession with eliminating any restriction \nwhatsoever, even for a minor child notifying her parent. It is not on \nany basis to object. Priscilla Owen would be a wonderful nominee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield myself whatever time I shall \nconsume.\n\n[[Page S10095]]\n\n  We have heard for several weeks the urgency of passing the Energy \nbill. As I said this morning, we accept that urgency, but we have also \nsaid for several weeks that we cannot complete the Energy bill with 382 \namendments in a period of 1 week, 4 or 5 working days. It cannot be \ndone. The majority leader has come to the floor and said we have been \non the bill 16 days. That is not fair because a lot of those days have \nbeen late Thursday and Friday mornings and sometimes on Monday. We have \nprobably had about 7 real days of work on this Energy bill.\n  Complicating matters, the leader is scheduling issues that are \nunnecessary. To have votes on these judges when cloture has been \nattempted on a number of occasions and has not worked, and will not \nwork again, is wasting valuable time. We could be working on Senator \nDomenici's and Senator Bingaman's Energy bill.\n  If the majority wanted to move judges--and we have moved 140 judges--\nbut if the majority wanted to move judges, we have some who have \nalready been cleared from the committee, something that is very unique \nbecause a lot of them are being cleared. We would be able to work out \nagreements to have James Cohn of Florida to be a U.S. district judge; \nFrank Montalvo of Texas to be a U.S. district judge; Xavier Rodriguez \nof Texas to be a U.S. district judge. We could also work something out \nfor H. Brent McKnight of North Carolina to be a U.S. district judge. We \ncould work something out on James Browning of New Mexico to be a U.S. \ndistrict judge.\n  I recognize there are intense feelings about Judge Owen, but the \nintense feelings have not changed during the period of time since we \nlast failed to invoke cloture on this nomination.\n  When there is an urgent need, according to the majority leader, to \nmove the Energy bill, it is almost beyond my ability to understand why \nwe would go to something when everyone knows what the outcome will be. \nWe lose momentum. Every time we go off a bill, as we have gone off the \nEnergy bill again, and try to start again, it takes time. I think the \nmajority leader should understand he is his own worst enemy in trying \nto move the Energy bill by going to all these extraneous issues that \nare doomed to failure before he starts.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah controls 4 minutes 21 \nseconds.\n  Does the Senator from Utah yield time?\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield the remainder of my time to the distinguished \nSenator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of my friend \nPriscilla Owen. I cannot think of a person who is being treated worse \nby the Senate than my friend Priscilla Owen. This is the nicest, \ngentlest person one could ever meet, and she also happens to be smart \nas a whip.\n  I watched her before the Senate committee. The chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Hatch, took the extraordinary step of having two \nhearings because Priscilla Owen was nominated over 2 years ago. She had \nher hearing and went through the process and did very well in her first \nhearing. Then, after the new Senate came in, in January, the chairman \nbrought her back before the committee, and she did an excellent job.\n  She knows exactly what she has done throughout her tenure on the \nSupreme Court of Texas, and she could cite the reasoning for all of the \nquestions she was asked about the positions she has taken. She answered \nthe questions in the most exemplary fashion. She showed exactly why she \nshould be a Federal judge. She showed it by her brilliance.\n  We know she was a magna cum laude graduate from Baylor Law School as \nwell as earning the highest score on the Texas bar exam that year, and \nshe showed in that way that she is qualified to be a member of the \nFederal judiciary. Her demeanor also showed why she would be such an \nexcellent Federal judge, because she has maintained the nicest and most \npatient demeanor I have ever seen of anyone who has been attacked in \nsuch a way. She has shown she has the temperament to be a good, honest, \nfair judge who also happens to be brilliant.\n  Priscilla Owen has been nominated for the Fifth Circuit. We have been \ntalking about her now for over 2 years. Since May 9, 2001, Priscilla \nOwen has been before the Senate. She has handled herself beautifully. \nShe has never shown any defiance. She has never shown any bitterness at \nthe way she is being treated. She just answers the questions like a \nprofessional.\n\n  She is a wonderful member of the Texas Supreme Court. She has been \nelected in her own right to the Texas Supreme Court, and when she was \nrunning for the bench, the Dallas Morning News called her record one of \naccomplishment and integrity.\n  The Houston Chronicle wrote:\n\n       She has the proper balance of judicial experience, solid \n     legal scholarship and real-world know-how.\n\n  She was endorsed by every daily newspaper in Texas that endorsed in \nSupreme Court races. She has a wonderful record. The ABA gave her a \nunanimously well qualified ranking when she went before their \ncommittee.\n  I will read the words of former Texas Supreme Court Chief Justice \nJohn Hill. John Hill is a Democrat. John Hill was attorney general of \nTexas. He was chief justice of the Texas Supreme Court. He denounced \nthe false accusations about Priscilla Owen's record, saying:\n\n       Their attacks on Justice Owen in particular are \n     breathtakingly dishonest, ignoring her long-held commitment \n     to reform and grossly distorting her rulings. Tellingly, the \n     groups make no effort to assess whether her decisions are \n     legally sound . . . I know Texas politics and can clearly say \n     these assaults on Justice Owen's record are false, \n     misleading, and deliberate distortions.\n\n  This is a judge who deserves to be confirmed, and I hope the Senate \nwill stop the delaying tactics on this wonderful woman and this \nqualified judge, and vote for cloture on Justice Priscilla Owen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The chairman's time has expired.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we are again being asked to consider the \nvery controversial nomination of Justice Priscilla Owen to the United \nStates Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The Senate has voted on \nthis before.\n  One might ask what has changed since the last Senate vote? The only \nthing that has changed is that the administration, the Republicans, \nhave ratcheted up their unprecedented partisanship in the use of \njudicial nominees for partisan political purposes.\n  Recently, they reached a new low through political ads and statements \nthat should offend all Americans. The White House and the backers \nshould understand with these ads they have gone far too far. They \nshould withdraw and disavow.\n  Last week I urged our Republican Senate colleagues to disavow those \ndespicable efforts. Unfortunately, they are choosing to continue the \nunfounded smear campaign of insult and division.\n  In that regard, I ask unanimous consent the articles in the New York \nTimes of this past Sunday, both editorials from the Washington Post, \nthe Boston Globe, Huntsville Times, Palm Beach Post, Atlanta Journal-\nConstitution, and Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, be printed in the Record at \nthis point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 27, 2003]\n\n                  Accusation of Bias Angers Democrats\n\n                            (By Robin Toner)\n\n       Washington, July 26.--The battle over judicial nominations \n     has grown ever more bitter on Capitol Hill, but Democrats on \n     the Senate Judiciary Committee say they are\n\n[[Page S10096]]\n\n     particularly outraged over the latest turn: the accusation \n     that their resistance to some conservative nominees amounts \n     to anti-Catholic bias.\n       In a recent newspaper advertising campaign, run by groups \n     supporting the Bush administration's judicial nominees, a \n     closed courtroom door bears the sign ``Catholics Need Not \n     Apply.'' The advertisement argues that William Pryor Jr., the \n     Alabama attorney general and a conservative, anti-abortion \n     nominee to the federal appeals court, was under attack in the \n     Senate because of his ``deeply held'' Catholic beliefs.\n       Democrats say they oppose Mr. Pryor because of his record, \n     including what they assert is a history of extreme statements \n     on issues like abortion and the separation of church and \n     state. All nine Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee \n     voted against Mr. Pryor's confirmation this week, while the \n     10 Republicans voted for it, sending the issue to the full \n     Senate--and the likelihood of further Democratic opposition.\n       Republicans and their conservative allies argue that the \n     Democrats have created a de facto religious test by their \n     emphasis on a nominee's stand on issues like abortion. ``It's \n     not just Catholics,'' said Sean Rushton, executive director \n     of the Committee for Justice, one of the groups that paid for \n     these advertisements, which are running in Maine and Rhode \n     Island. ``I think there's an element of the far left of the \n     Democratic Party that sees as its project scrubbing the \n     public square of religion, and in some cases not only \n     religion but of religious people.''\n       Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and chairman of \n     the Judiciary Committee, sounded a similar theme this week, \n     asserting that ``the left is trying to enforce an \n     antireligious litmus test'' whereby ``nominees who openly \n     adhere to Catholic and Baptist doctrines, as a matter of \n     personal faith, are unqualified for the federal bench in the \n     eyes of the liberal Washington interest groups.''\n       The accusation of anti-Catholic bias seemed especially \n     galling to some of the Democratic senators who happen to be \n     Catholic. Four of the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee \n     are Catholic. In fact, 57 percent of the Catholics in the \n     House and the Senate are Democrats, according to the \n     forthcoming Vital Statistics on Congress, 2003-4 edition.\n       Like many Americans of Irish descent, Senator Patrick J. \n     Leahy of Vermont, the ranking Democrat on Judiciary, said he \n     grew up hearing his father talk about the bad old says when \n     Irish Catholics were greeted with signs saying they ``need \n     not apply.'' He added, ``It was a horrible part of our \n     history, and it's almost like you have people willing to \n     rekindle that for a short-term political gain, for a couple \n     of judges.''\n       Senator Richard J. Durbin, who is Catholic, said he reached \n     his limit at a committee meeting on Wednesday when Senator \n     Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama (and a Methodist), began \n     explaining Mr. Pryor's positions as ``what a good Catholic \n     believes.''\n       Mr. Durbin, an Illinois Democrat who personally opposes \n     abortion but backs abortion rights, added, ``I understand the \n     painful process I have to go through with the elders of the \n     church on many of these issues, explaining my position. But \n     it is galling, to say the least, when my colleagues in the \n     Senate, of another religion, start speaking ex cathedra.''\n       Many Catholic elected officials are, perhaps, particularly \n     sensitive to the line between religious faith and public \n     responsibilities. It was a line drawn most vividly by \n     President John F. Kennedy, the first Catholic president, who \n     had to deal with widespared fears that a Roman Catholic \n     president would serve both Rome and the American people.\n       Kennedy responded by declaring, ``I believe in an America \n     where the separation of church and state is absolute, where \n     no Catholic prelate would tell the president, should he be a \n     Catholic, how to act, and no Protestant minister would tell \n     his parishioners for whom to vote.'' In recent years, Gov. \n     Mario M. Cuomo reasserted that line, particularly regarding \n     abortion.\n       Behind the anger of many Democrats is the suspicion that \n     this advertising campaign is part of the Republican Party's \n     courtship of Catholics, an important swing vote. In general, \n     Andy Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center for the \n     People and the Press, said Mr. Bush was ``doing pretty well \n     with white Catholics'' lately.\n       It is all part of a politics that has changed radically \n     since 1960. Among the nine Democrats on the Judiciary \n     Committee accused of working against the interests of \n     Catholic judicial nominees is, of course, John Kennedy's \n     brother, Senator Edward M. Kennedy.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Boston Globe, July 28, 2003]\n\n                       Pryor's Bad-Faith Backers\n\n       Congressional supporters of Alabama Attorney General \n     William Pryor have descended to low blows in promoting his \n     nomination to the federal bench. recently an independent \n     committee launched an advertising blitz in Rhode Island and \n     Maine, two states with swing Republican senators, claiming \n     that Pryor's opponents are motivated by anti-Catholic \n     bigotry. In the Senate committee hearing last week that \n     advanced Pryor's nomination to the floor, Republicans \n     repeated the allegation that Pryor's opponents believe ``No \n     Catholics need apply.'' This canard is designed to muddy the \n     only real issue--Pryor's fitness to be a federal judge. When \n     the full Senate considers Pryor's nomination, it must not \n     allow itself to be swayed by such intimidation tactics.\n       Pryor, a Catholic, opposes abortion even for victims of \n     rape or incest not just as a religious view but as a legal \n     principle. He has called Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court \n     decision legalizing some abortions ``an abomination.'' He \n     also supported the Texas law banning sodomy that was recently \n     overturned by the Supreme Court. Pryor's backers now claim \n     that anyone questioning these views--views that, after all, \n     conflict with existing federal law--is really targeting his \n     religion. ``Some in the U.S. Senate are attacking Bill Pryor \n     for having deeply held Catholic beliefs,'' the ad reads.\n       In trying to cloak Pryor's views in protective religious \n     garb, the Republicans have covered themselves in hypocrisy. \n     First of all, Pryor holds one view at odds with Catholic \n     teaching: He ardently supports the death penalty, which Pope \n     John Paul declared in 1995 was permissible only in cases of \n     ``absolute necessity'' to maintain civil order, occasions the \n     pope said were so rare as to be ``practically nonexistent.'' \n     Pryor supports capital punishment so fiercely he even fought \n     state legislation to replace Alabama's electric chair with \n     lethal injection.\n       The ironies don't stop there. Conservative Republicans are \n     forever railing against ``identity politics,'' when \n     minorities seek special assistance from the government. But \n     when it comes to stacking the federal bench with right-wing \n     judges, these same folks reach for the race or religion card \n     with impunity. Opponents of nominee Miguel Estrada were \n     accused of being anti-Hispanic, for example, and Clarence \n     Thomas called opposition to his Supreme Court appointment ``a \n     high-tech lynching.''\n       It was Senator Orrin Hatch, a Republican supporters, who \n     first inserted Pryor's religion into the committee \n     proceedings, not opponents. Pryor and his pious backers \n     should take heed of John Kennedy's remarks in 1960, just \n     before he became the nation's first Catholic president: ``I \n     believe in an America where the separation of church and \n     state is absolute.'' That should apply to political tactics \n     as well as matters of law. It was Senator Orrin Hatch, a \n     Republican supporter, who first inserted Pryor's religion \n     into the committee proceedings, not opponents.

Lucky for him his competitors \n     were not conservative Republicans. They would have run right \n     up his back.\n       For an example of how these conservatives play the game, it \n     is probably best to live in Maine or Rhode Island. In those \n     states, an organization called the Committee for Justice has \n     been running newspaper ads accusing Senate Democrats of using \n     a religion test for judicial nominations. The nominee in \n     question is William H. Pryor Jr. of Alabama. The ad says that \n     if Pryor were not a strict Catholic, the Democrats would have \n     no problem with him.\n       The newspaper ads show a picture of a door labeled \n     ``Judicial Chambers.'' A sign says ``Catholics Need Not \n     Apply.'' The ad goes on to say that Pryor is being opposed \n     because of his ``deeply held'' Catholic beliefs, omitting the \n     awkward fact that some of the Democrats who oppose him are \n     also Catholic. The ad--not to put too fine a point on it--is \n     a lie.\n       What's more, it's an insult to Catholics. It employs a \n     historically redolent phrase, once so familiar to New \n     England's Irish Americans, to sidestep the real problem with \n     Pryor's nomination to a Federal appeals court--not his \n     ``deeply held'' religious convictions but his deeply held \n     determination to impose them on others. The ad's sponsors \n     deeply hope that Catholics react viscerally. I pray that they \n     don't.\n       Pryor's record is unequivocal. As Alabama's attorney \n     general, he not only made statements deploring Supreme Court \n     decisions upholding the separation of church and state--``it \n     seems our government has lost God''--but repeatedly expressed \n     his conviction that the God he had in mind was the Christian \n     one. ``The challenge of the next millennium will be to \n     preserve the American experiment by restoring its Christian \n     perspective,'' he said in 1997.\n       On another occasion--his investiture as Alabama's attorney \n     gengeral--he concluded his remarks by saying, ``With trust in \n     God, and his Son, Jesus Christ, we will continue the American \n     experiment of liberty and law.''\n       Although a state official, Pryor chose to intervene in \n     federal court cases on the side of Roy Moore, now the state's \n     chief justice. As a trial judge, Moore opened court with a \n     prayer delivered by a Christian clergyman. He displayed the \n     Ten Commandments in his courtroom and later, when elected the \n     state's chief judge, had a monster statue of the Ten \n     Commandments placed before the courthouse. Higher courts told \n     him to remove it.\n       Whatever Pryor's religious convictions, they are no \n     business of the Senate. But they\n\n[[Page S10097]]\n\n     are its business when he seeks to impose those beliefs on \n     others--as he has repeatedly tried to do. This is what the \n     Democrats on the Judiciary Committee object to. Yet the ads, \n     sponsored by a committee led by C. Boyden Gray, the first \n     President Bush's White House counsel, simply label Pryor's \n     opponents as religious bigots. Gray lent his name to this \n     cause, and so did former president George H.W. Bush, who lent \n     his house for a fundraiser. This is a GOP operation, pure and \n     simple.\n       Gray ought to be ashamed. Instead of battling religious \n     prejudice, he is using the fear of it to stack the courts \n     with conservative Republicans. At the same time, he has \n     allied himself with those who traffic in their own kind of \n     religious bigotry--a smug disdain for the beliefs of others, \n     including dissenting Christians, non-Christians and people \n     who have no religion at all. Pryor clearly feels his religion \n     is the better religion--the one the state should support, the \n     one with which to open a court session or to proclaim in \n     stone on the courthouse steps.\n       This is dangerous stuff. We are a pluralistic society. I \n     happen to think some religions are just plain weird. I also \n     happen to think that Pryor cannot for a second explain \n     through reason--reason, not faith--why his convictions are \n     better, truer or closer to God's than mine. Such matters \n     cannot be debated. Historically, they have been settled at \n     sword's point. If you believe that a cow is sacred, I cannot \n     argue with you. The same holds for the virign birth, or, for \n     that matter, the burning bush. You believe what you believe. \n     It is that simple.\n       Gray and by extension former president Bush ought to \n     repudiate the ad. At its core, it is a demagogic lie. As for \n     Pryor, by statements and actions, he has disqualified himself \n     for the federal bench. I don't care if he's a good Catholic. \n     I do care that he'd make a bad judge.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 26, 2003]\n\n                            Beyond the Pale\n\n       ``Some in the U.S. Senate are attacking Bill Pryor for \n     having `deeply held' Catholic beliefs to prevent him from \n     becoming a federal judge. Don't they know the Constitution \n     expressly prohibits religious tests for public office?''\n       So reads a wildly inappropriate ad run in newspapers in \n     Maine and Rhode Island by a group called the Committee for \n     Justice. Mr. Pryor is the elected attorney general of Alabama \n     and President Bush's choice to sit on the U.S. Court of \n     Appeals for the 11th Circuit. We oppose the nomination--which \n     the Senate Judiciary Committee this week reported on a party-\n     line vote--and hope it will be defeated on the Senate floor. \n     Yet some of Mr. Pryor's supporters seem unwilling even to \n     debate this troubling nomination on its merits. So they have \n     hit on an alternative: branding his opponents as motivated by \n     anti-Catholic bigotry.\n       The tactic is not entirely new. Republican senators--\n     including committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and \n     Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn.)--have been complaining \n     for some time of what Mr. Frist has called ``a religious test \n     on the confirmation of our judges.'' And Democrats during the \n     last administration complained of bias in the Senate's \n     treatment of women and minority nominees--as, indeed, \n     Republicans now complain of bias in the treatment of appeals \n     court nominee Miguel Estrada. But the new ad campaign \n     ratchets up this gross kind of politics a notch, and the \n     unwillingness of key Republican senators to distance \n     themselves from it is striking.\n       The Committee for Justice was formed by former White House \n     counsel C. Boyden Gray to support Mr. Bush's nominees. Its ad \n     ran in states with large numbers of Catholics and moderate \n     Republican senators. It shows a picture of a courthouse door \n     with a sign hung on it saying, ``Catholics Need Not Apply.'' \n     And it asks ``Why are some in the U.S. Senate playing \n     politics with religion?'' It goes on to describe the nominee \n     as ``a loving father'' and ``a devout Catholic'' and insists \n     that ``it's time for his political opponents to put his \n     religion aside and give him an up or down vote.''\n       But who exactly is ``playing politics with religion'' here? \n     We are aware of no instance in which any Senate opponent of \n     Mr. Pryor has raised his religion--nor did the Committee for \n     Justice produce an example in response to our inquiries. The \n     only people raising Mr. Pryor's Catholicism, rather, seem to \n     be his supporters. Mr. Pryor's nomination is controversial \n     for the simple reason that he has never shied away from \n     taking strident positions on matters of national moment: His \n     record is replete with the sort of unblinking partisanship \n     and ideological fervor that properly should raise questions \n     about potential service on the bench. We have criticized \n     liberal groups for smearing President Bush's nominees. \n     Smearing senators is no better.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Huntsville Times, July 25, 2003]\n\n                    Sham Issue Invoked To Help Pryor\n\n                           (By David Person)\n\n       Bogus. That's the only word that accurately describes this \n     week's dust-up on the Senate Judicial Committee over the \n     nomination of Alabama Attorney General Bill Pryor to the \n     Federal Appeals Court. Sens. Jeff Sessions of Alabama and \n     Orrin Hatch of Utah, both members of the committee, suggested \n     that other committee members were opposed to Pryor because he \n     is a Catholic\n       This criticism seems part of a larger strategy. According \n     to National Public Radio, some ads have been running in Maine \n     and Rhode Island that suggest the same thing. And according \n     to NPR, it was Hatch who introduced Pryor's faith into the \n     proceedings by asking Prior about his religious affiliation \n     during the nominee's June hearing before the committee.\n       Methinks the GOP doth protest suspiciously and a bit too \n     much. Four of the nine Democrats on the committee--ranking \n     member Patrick Leahy of Vermont, Dick Durbin of Illinois, \n     Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, and Joe Biden of Delaware--\n     are Catholics.\n       That probably disqualifies them from being against Pryor \n     due to his faith, you think?\n       My guess: The GOP knew that Pryor's right-wing views on Roe \n     vs. Wade, Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore's Ten Commandments \n     monument and homosexuality would be lightning rods. So \n     instead of going the stealth route--which would have been \n     difficult since Pryor, to his credit, has been upfront about \n     his views--why not spin out the ruse that opposition to \n     Pryor's politics is actually opposition to his faith?\n       As a political strategy, it's clever. But discerning \n     observers will know that the baloney-salami quotient is high.\n       Being anti-religion and opposing the insertion of religion \n     into the public life are as different as being a meat-eater \n     and vegan. The two aren't even remotely the same.\n       Pryor, a smart, competent, compassionate and honest elected \n     official, has made it no secret that he follows one of \n     Alabama's most practiced political traditions: fusing faith \n     and politics. Again, to his credit, he's aboveboard. He \n     doesn't pretend to be anything other than what he is. That's \n     why many Democrats and liberals have supported him here and \n     even in his quest to be appointed to the federal bench.\n       But history shows that when religious dogma collides with \n     public policy and practice, someone will be hurt. (Please \n     turn in your history books to the chapters on the Crusades, \n     the Reformation, and Salem witch trials, and the conflicts \n     between Protestants and Catholics in Ireland, Muslims and \n     Christians on the African continent, and fundamentalist \n     Islamic regimes and their opposition.)\n       In fact, isn't the United States currently resisting \n     attempts by fundamentalist Muslims to assume control in a \n     reconstituted Iraq?\n       Pryor's fellow Catholics on the Senate Judiciary Committee \n     oppose how he applies his religion, not the religion itself.\n       This shouldn't be hard to grasp. Religions, like political \n     parties, often have competing ideological wings.\n       Some of my Catholic friends in town also oppose Pryor. They \n     mince no words as they spit out their criticism of him.\n       Not one had anything to do with his faith.\n       The committee, by the way, has voted along party lines to \n     send Pryor's nomination to the full Senate for a vote. By the \n     end of the summer, we may know if Pryor will get the \n     appointment or if it will be derailed by a Democratic \n     filibuster.\n       If the latter, I guess Leahy, Durbin and any others who \n     will have opposed him will be called bigots by GOP \n     extremists. But this will be a false charge. The only thing \n     they will be guilty of is disagreeing in matters of faith.\n       Last time I checked, the Constitution gives them that \n     freedom.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Palm Beach Post, July 27, 2003]\n\n                   No Defense for Pryor's Convictions\n\n                           (By Randy Schultz)\n\n       As part of their ongoing effort to stack the federal \n     courts, Republicans first accused Democrats of being anti-\n     Hispanic. Now, they're accusing Democrats of being anti-\n     Catholic. Here's the funnier part: Many of the Democrats in \n     question are Catholics.\n       When it comes to judicial nominations, the Supreme Court \n     obviously gets most of the attention. The highest court is \n     the last word on issues that prompt fund-raising letters. In \n     June, for example, the justices reaffirmed that race can be a \n     consideration in college admissions and rules that sexual \n     orientation can't be a consideration when states make laws \n     about sex between consenting adults.\n       In fact, the highest court hears only about 100 cases each \n     year. The 13 federal appeals courts, however, rule on nearly \n     30,000 cases in 2001. In practical terms, appeals court \n     judges set most of the law. Also, they are the Supreme \n     Court's farm teams. Seven of the nine justices--William \n     Rehnquist and Sandra Day O'Connor are the exceptions--were \n     promoted from the federal appeals courts.\n       So President Bush wants to put the youngest, most \n     conservative people he can on those courts. The lastest is \n     41-year-old William Pryor, and you can tell how unqualified \n     he is by the lengths to which Republicans are going.\n\n\n                    to florida from Alabama? no way\n\n       Mr. Pryor is Alabama's attorney general. He believes that \n     the 1973 Supreme Court did greater harm by legalizing \n     abortion than the 1857 court did by legalizing slavery. \n     President Bush wants to put him on the 11th U.S. Circuit \n     Court of Appeals, which hears cases from Florida, Georgia and \n     Alabama. To maintain geographical balance, this vacancy on \n     the 12-member court goes to Alabama.\n       But to William Pryor? No way. There's evidence that he \n     solicited political donations\n\n[[Page S10098]]\n\n     from companies that do business with his office. There's \n     evidence that he wasn't straight about that when he testified \n     before the judiciary committee last month.\n       So Democrats have objected, as they have when Mr. Bush has \n     tried to put similarly ultra-orthodox conservatives such as \n     Miguel Estrada and Priscilla Owen onto other appeals courts. \n     When Democrats blocked Mr. Estrada's nomination, Republicans \n     whooped that Democrats don't like Hispanics. Except that \n     Republicans blocked Hispanics whom President Clinton had \n     picked for the appellate bench.\n       Last week, the GOP kicked up the hysteria another notch. A \n     group run by the first President Bush's chief counsel ran ads \n     saying that Democrats want to keep Catholics such as Mr. \n     Pryor off the court. The ads show a courthouse with a sign \n     reading, ``Catholics need not apply.'' Boston merchants used \n     the same language in the 19th century, saying ``Irish'' \n     instead of ``Catholics.'' Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., \n     parroted the ad Wednesday. ``Are we saying that good \n     Catholics can't apply?''\n\n\n                   non-catholics lecturing catholics\n\n       How hilarious that must have sounded to the four out of \n     nine Democratic committee members who are Catholic. As \n     National Public Radio reported, one of them, Sen. Dick \n     Durbin, D-Ill., first said, ``This is disgusting.'' Then he \n     remarked, ``I want to express my gratitude to my colleagues \n     who are members of the Church of Christ and the Methodist \n     Church and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints \n     for explaining Catholic doctrine today.''\n       Sen. Orrin Hatch, the Mormon in question, yelped that \n     Democrats were opposed to any Catholic with ``deeply held'' \n     beliefs or any nominee who opposed abortion. Sen. Durbin \n     noted that the Catholic Church opposes the death penalty \n     while Mr. Pryor supports it. Also, a Bush nominee who called \n     abortion ``evil'' got a seat on another appeals court with \n     Democratic support.\n       For all the Republican fussing, President Bush got more of \n     his nominees through a Democratic Senate than President \n     Clinton got through a Republican Senate. Nearly half of Mr. \n     Clinton's appeals court nominees got no vote in the \n     congressional term when they were nominated.\n       Now that Democrats are going all-out to block Mr. Bush's \n     worst nominees, Republicans can't take it. They rant, and \n     they pout. They can't argue the facts, and they can't argue \n     the law. So they are trying to argue ethnicity and religion. \n     The problem isn't their Democratic opponents. It's their \n     president's nominees.\n                                  ____\n\n\n         [From the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, July 25, 2003]\n\n           Bring on the Filibuster Against Ultraconservative\n\n       Southerners who care about the separation of church and \n     state should hope Alabama Attorney General William Pryor \n     never sits on the 11th Circuit appellate bench, which rules \n     on appeals in cases from Alabama, Georgia and Florida. The \n     ultraconservative Pryor, who preaches that Christianity \n     should be more a part of American public life, was approved \n     by the Senate Judiciary Committee Wednesday in a 10-9 vote \n     along partisan lines.\n       If ever there were a nomination that merits a filibuster, \n     it is this one. Not just because Pryor holds views far out of \n     the mainstream, but also because of the unprecedented \n     twisting of the Constitution's advise and consent process by \n     President Bush's corporate pals. Misleading ads, funded by \n     the deceitfully names ``Committee for Justice,'' have already \n     run in Maine and Rhode Island to pressure moderate Republican \n     senators into voting for Pryor's confirmation on the Senate \n     floor. The despicable ads show a courthouse door with a sign \n     across it saying ``No Catholics allowed.''\n       Sen. Richard Durbin (D-Ill.), who is Catholic and opposes \n     the Pryor nomination, is infuriated that he and others were \n     being accused of discriminating against Pryor for his \n     religion, a false charge. Sen. Patrick Leahy, the ranking \n     Democrat on Senate Judiciary, said religion is irrelevant to \n     consideration of a judicial candidate. ``Just as we're \n     supposed to be colorblind, we must be religion-blind,'' he \n     said.\n       The committee funding the ads is headed by the White House \n     counsel to former President Bush, C. Boyden Gray, and \n     includes lawyers and lobbyists who represent huge tobacco, \n     insurance and investment banking corporations with cases \n     pending before the federal courts. Because it would be \n     unseemly to campaign for judges who favor corporations, they \n     have cleverly aligned with the Ava Maria List, a Catholic \n     pro-life political action committee.\n       Pryor's record is sufficient to disqualify him from any \n     judgeship. In addition to his extreme views on abortion (he \n     opposes it for rape victims), he favors prayer in public \n     school classrooms and the Ten Commandments in the Alabama \n     courthouse. He was also the only attorney general in the \n     nation to argue that the Violence Against Women Act is \n     unconstitutional.\n       Georgians ought to let U.S. Sens. Saxby Chambliss and Zell \n     Miller know their opposition to Pryor. He is simply unfit for \n     the decision-making essential to a fair, independent and \n     nonpartisan judiciary.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           [From the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, July 25, 2003]\n\n   Pryor Restraint: Specter Should Have Balked at an Extreme Nominee\n\n       With Pennsylvania's Sen. Arlen Specter trying to have it \n     both ways, the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday sent \n     to the floor an unacceptably extreme nominee to a federal \n     appeals courts--but not before some silly sniping over \n     whether the nominee, Alabama Attorney General William Pryor \n     Jr., has been the victim of anti-Catholicism.\n       The anti-Catholic canard, raised by a conservative pressure \n     group and echoed by some Republican senators, would be \n     laughable if anti-Catholicism weren't an ugly part of \n     American history. Fortunately, excluding people from public \n     life because they are ``papists'' is largely a thing of the \n     past. Mr. Pryor himself is proof of that: Alabama, where he \n     serves as the chief law enforcement officer, was historically \n     home to Bible Belt anti-Catholicism.\n       But if some of Mr. Pryor's supporters are to be believed, \n     opponents of his nomination to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of \n     Appeals are anti-Catholic bigots. A pro-Pryor group aired \n     television ads showing a locked courthouse with a sign \n     reading ``No Catholics Need Apply.'' On the committee, \n     Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions referred to his fellow Alabaman \n     as ``this solid Catholic individual'' and offered a \n     convoluted argument for the bigotry charge.\n       According to Sen. Sessions, Mr. Pryor's veiws on abortion--\n     he called the Roe vs. Wade ruling an ``abomination''--are \n     rooted in his church's teaching. Therefore senators who \n     oppose Mr. Pryor because of his denunciation of Roe vs. Wade \n     are really subjecting him to an unconstitutional ``religious \n     test'' for office.\n       Well, not really. The concern isn't that any Catholic judge \n     will repudiate Roe vs. Wade--Justice Anthony Kennedy, a \n     Catholic, voted to reaffirm Roe in a 1992 ruling--but that \n     Mr. Pryor's vehement denunciations of Roe as bad law indicate \n     that he is a man on a mission, despite his protestations that \n     he would apply the law judiciously. The problem with Mr. \n     Pryor isn't his religion; it's the fact that he is what we \n     have called a ``walking stereotype'' of right-wing legal \n     extremism.\n       (We wonder, by the way, if Sen. Sessions would rush to the \n     defense of a liberal Catholic nominee who, citing \n     pronouncements by the pope and America's Catholic bishops, \n     denounced Supreme Court decisions upholding the \n     constitutionality of capital punishment.)\n       Some Democrats on the Judiciary Committee who are \n     themselves Roman Catholics objected to the Republicans' \n     decision to play the Catholic card. Sen. Richard Durbin \n     facetiously thanked Sen. Sessions, a Methodist, and Judiciary \n     Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, a Mormon, for elucidating his \n     own church's doctrine for him.\n       The ``anti-Catholic'' discussion was an unseemly sideshow \n     to the committee's decision, on partisan lines, to approve \n     the Pryor nomination and send it to the floor. To his \n     discredit, Sen. Specter, who faces a conservative challenger \n     in next year's Republican primary, joined in that vote--while \n     suggesting that he might vote against the nomination on the \n     floor. That straddle is the opposite of a profile in courage. \n     If Sen. Specter thinks Mr. Pryor unsuitable for the court, he \n     should have voted no.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this has begun because the President \nrenominated a divisive and controversial activist to another circuit \ncourt. That is regrettable. The Republican leadership in the Senate is \nforcing a confrontation at this time that is neither necessary nor \nconstructive. I am sorry the White House has chosen to make these \nmatters into partisan political fights rather than to work with Senate \nDemocrats to fill judicial vacancies with qualified consensus nominees. \nThere are thousands of qualified Republicans who would be endorsed by \nboth Republicans and Democrats in this Senate. That would allow the \nAmerican people to say we are not politicizing the courts. There would \nbe a sigh of relief.\n\n  But we do not see that. We have a historic low level of cooperation \nfrom the White House. In fact, in the 29 years I have been here, \nthrough both Republican and Democratic administrations, I have never \nseen such a low level of cooperation.\n  Notwithstanding that, we have already confirmed 140 of President \nBush's judicial nominees, including some of the most divisive and \ncontroversial sent by any President, Republican or Democrat. In fact, \nthis year the Senate debated and voted on the nominations of three \ncircuit court nominees who received far more than 40 negative votes.\n  If it were simply a case of filibustering judges, they would not have \nbeen confirmed. For example, Jeffrey Sutton's nomination to the Sixth \nCircuit received the fewest number of favorable votes of any \nconfirmation in almost 20 years. He got only 52 votes.\n  When you have somebody who gets through the Senate with only 52 \nvotes, you have to ask what kind of a signal that sends to the people \nof that circuit. Does it send a signal to the people of that circuit \nthat we sent somebody\n\n[[Page S10099]]\n\nthere who is representing all the people within that circuit, \nRepublicans, Democrats, independents? Or are we sending somebody who is \nintended to be a partisan ideologue representing only one party on a \ncourt that is supposed to be independent of party politics?\n  In fact, the administration is seeking to force through the \nconfirmation process more and more extreme nominees in its effort to \npack the courts and tilt them sharply in a narrow ideological \ndirection. Instead of uniting the American people, too many of this \nadministration's nominations divide the American people and divide the \nSenate. How much greater service could be done to the country and to \nthe courts if the President sought to unite us and not divide us?\n  In fact, the unprecedented level of assertiveness by the \nadministration has led to more and more confrontation with the Senate. \nAs Republicans in the Senate abandon any effort to provide a check or \nbalance in the process, it falls to Senate Democrats to seek to protect \nthe independence of the Federal courts and the rights of all Americans.\n  Our Democratic leadership in the Senate worked hard earlier this year \nto correct some of the problems that arose from some of the earlier \nactions of the Judiciary Committee. But, once again, just last week, \nRepublican members of the Judiciary Committee decided to override the \nrights of the minority and violate longstanding committee precedent and \nactually violated--imagine this, the Judiciary Committee violating its \nown rules, the Judiciary Committee of all committees, the committee \nthat should set the standards for everybody else--violated these rules \nand precedents in order to rush to judgment even more quickly this \nPresident's most controversial nominees.\n  It was a sad day in committee, but it was a devastating day in the \nSenate. Yet my friends on the other side of the aisle persist in their \nobstinate and single-minded crusade to pack the Federal bench with \nright-wing ideologues, regardless of what rules, what longstanding \npractices, what personal assurances, what relationships, or what \nSenators' words are broken or ruined in the process.\n  Republican partisans fail to recognize that Democrats worked \ndiligently and fairly to consider President Bush's nominees, including \nnominees to the same court as that to which Justice Owen has been \nnominated. Two months ago, on May 1, the Senate confirmed Judge Edward \nPrado to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Senate \nDemocrats cleared the nomination of Judge Edward Prado to the United \nStates Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit without delay.\n\n  The irony is, we cleared Judge Prado immediately, but he was held up \nby one anonymous hold--and it came from the Republican side. At the \nsame time the White House is excoriating Democrats for holding up their \nnominees, we had a nominee of President Bush to the Fifth Circuit and \nfor a month, while we are trying to have him confirmed, he is being \nheld up by an anonymous hold, not even a hold somebody is willing to \nstate for the record but an anonymous hold on the Republican side. Talk \nabout rope-a-dope--if we clear the nominees, they hold them up and we \nget the blame. Interesting.\n  All Democratic Senators serving on the Judiciary Committee voted to \nreport his nomination favorably. All Democratic Senators indicated they \nwere prepared to proceed with the nomination. When Republicans finally \nlifted their hold on Judge Prado, he was confirmed unanimously.\n  When Democrats assumed Senate leadership in the summer of 2001, there \nhad not been a Fifth Circuit nominee confirmed for 7 years. There had \nbeen a lot of nominees, but they were blocked by the Republicans. \nIndeed, Republicans blocked consideration of three qualified nominees \nto the Fifth Circuit in the years 1995 to 2001, along with 60 other \njudicial nominees of President Clinton.\n  In 2001, Democrats worked hard on the nomination of Judge Edith Brown \nClement, a conservative judge nominated by President Bush, and with the \nefforts of Democrats she was confirmed. Thus, unlike the years 1995 to \n2001 when Republicans were preventing action on every single one of \nPresident Clinton's nominees to the Fifth Circuit, Democrats have \nalready cooperated in the confirmation of two of President Bush's \nnominees to that circuit, including one while we were in the majority.\n  In spite of the treatment by the Republicans of so many moderate \nnominees in the previous administration, we proceeded last July to the \nhearing on Justice Owen and we proceed to debate and vote on all three \nof President Bush's Fifth Circuit nominees, despite the treatment of \nPresident Clinton's nominees by the Republican majority.\n  The nomination of Priscilla Owen was rejected by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee. She was rejected as a judicial activist with extreme views. \nThat is where it should have ended. Never, ever in our Nation's history \nhas a President renominated somebody to the same judicial vacancy after \nrejection by the Judiciary Committee--never. In this case, of course, \nthey did, to create a political point.\n  We tried very hard to work with the administration to fill judicial \nvacancies, in great contrast to the fate of many of President Clinton's \nnominees from Texas who were blocked and delayed by Republicans, \nincluding Enrique Moreno, nominated to the Fifth Circuit Court of \nAppeals, who never got a hearing or a vote; Judge Jorge Rangel, \nnominated to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, who never got a \nhearing and never got a vote; and Judge Hilda Tagle, whose nomination \nwas delayed nearly 2 years for no good reason.\n  All we are saying is let's have judges who are there for all the \npeople. It is one thing for Republicans to control the White House. The \nPresident was inaugurated. He has that right. Republicans control both \nHouses. But the courts are supposed to be nonpartisan.\n  We have worked hard to try to balance the need to have enough judges \nto handle cases with the imperative that they be fair judges for all \npeople, poor or rich, Republican or Democrat, of any race or religion. \nThis has been especially difficult because a number of this President's \njudicial nominees have records that do not demonstrate that they will \nbe fair and impartial.\n  The White House's allies have bombarded us with all sorts of \nmisleading information to try to bully us into rolling over and rubber-\nstamping these nominees. They are playing politics with the judicial \nbranch and using it for partisan political purposes. That is most \nregrettable. Their charges of prejudice are simply appalling and should \nbe rejected by all Americans as the crass and base partisan politics \nthat they are.\n  The plain fact is that this Senate has confirmed more judges at a \nfaster pace than in any of the past six and one half years under \nRepublican control with a Democratic President. With Democrat \ncooperation, this Senate has doubled the number of judicial \nconfirmations and more than doubled the number of circuit court \nconfirmations of President Bush's nominees compared to how the \nRepublican-controlled Senate treated President Clinton's. The Senate \nhas confirmed 40 judges already this year. That exceeds the number of \njudges during all of 2000, 1999, and 1997, and is more than twice as \nmany judges as were confirmed during the entire 1996 session. It is \nmore than the average annual confirmations for the 6\\1/2\\ years the \nRepublican majority controlled the pace of confirmations from 1995 \nthrough the first half of 2001. Thus, in the first 7 months of this \nyear, we have already exceeded the year totals for 4 of the 6 years the \nRepublican majority controlled the pace of President Clinton's judicial \nnominees and the Republican majority's yearly average. One hundred and \nforty lifetime confirmations in 2 years is better than in any 3-year \nperiod from 1995 though 2000, when a Republican majority controlled the \nfate of President Clinton's judicial nominations.\n  We have already this year confirmed 10 judges to the Courts of \nAppeals. This is more than were confirmed in all of 4 of the past 6 \nyears when the Republicans were in the majority--in 1996, 1997, 1999, \nand 2000. And in the 2 other years, the 10th circuit nominee was not \nconfirmed until much later in the year. We have now confirmed 27 \ncircuit court judges nominated by President Bush. This is more circuit \ncourt judges confirmed at this point in his presidency than for his \nfather, President Clinton, or President Reagan at the same point. We \nhave made tremendous progress and\n\n[[Page S10100]]\n\nI want to thank, in particular, the Democratic members of the Judiciary \nCommittee for their hard work in this regard. These achievements have \nnot been easy. The Senate is making some progress. More has been \nachieved than Republicans are willing to acknowledge.\n  So, as we repeat our vote on this nomination today and Republicans \ncontinue their drumbeat of unfair political recriminations, we should \nall acknowledge how far we have come from the 110 vacancies that \nDemocrats inherited from the Republican majority in the summer of 2001. \nIn addition to more confirmations and fewer vacancies, we have more \nFederal judges serving than ever before.\n  Under a Republican majority, circuit vacancies more than doubled and \noverall vacancies increased dramatically. Despite the fact that close \nto 90 additional vacancies have arisen since the summer of 2001, we \nhave worked hard and cut those vacancies from 110 to less than 60. \nEarlier this year, until new judgeships were authorized, the vacancy \nrate on the Federal courts was at the lowest number in 13 years. Even \nwith the 15 new judgeships effective this month, the vacancy rate is \nnow well-below where Senator Hatch inherited it, and well-below the \nrate Senator Hatch called ``full-employment.'' There are more full-time \nFederal judges on the bench today than at any time in U.S. history, in \nthe last 214 years. And, if you add in the senior judges, there are \nmore than 1,000 Federal judges sitting on the Federal courts.\n  With a modicum of cooperation from the other end of Pennsylvania \nAvenue and the other side of the aisle we could achieve so much more. \nAs it is, we have worked hard to repair the damage to the confirmation \nprocess and achieved significant results. Republicans seem intent on \ninflicting more damage, to the process, to the Senate, and to the \nindependence of the Federal courts.\n  Unfortunately, the nomination of Justice Owen is a nomination that \nshould never have been remade. It was rejected by the Judiciary \nCommittee last year after a fair hearing and extensive and thoughtful \nsubstantive consideration. The White House would rather play politics \nwith judicial nominations than solve problems. This unprecedented \nrenomination of a person voted down by the Senate Judiciary Committee \nis proof of that. That Senate Republicans are continuing to press this \nmatter knowing the outcome of this vote shows what a charade this has \nbecome.\n  This nomination is extreme. This nominee has shown herself to be a \njudicial activist and an extremist even on the very conservative Texas \nSupreme Court where her conservative colleagues have criticized her \njudging as activist again and again.\n  The nomination process starts with the President. It is high time for \nthe White House to stop the partisanship and campaign rhetoric and work \nwith us to ensure the independence and impartiality of the Federal \njudiciary so that the American people, all of the American people, can \ngo into every Federal courtroom across the country and know that they \nwill receive a fair hearing and justice under the law. It is time for \nSenate Republicans to stand up for the Senate's role as a check on the \nunfettered power of the President to pack the courts and for fairness.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there is an order floating around here on \nthe floor that sets forth about 7 hours of debate on these two trade \nagreements, the\n\n[[Page S10101]]\n\nSingapore and Chilean trade agreements. Is that true?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The order has been obtained.\n  Mr. REID. It has been obtained?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding the Senator from California, Senator \nFeinstein, has an hour under that agreement. Is that true?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Feinstein be allowed \nto use her hour on the trade agreements at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California.\n\n\n           The Chilean and Singaporean Free Trade Agreements\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada for \nthe courtesy of allowing me to move ahead with some additional remarks \non the Chilean and Singaporean free-trade agreements and on the \nimmigration policy that is attached to those agreements. I have \nexpressed my deep concern about the temporary entry provisions of the \nfree-trade agreements on which we are about to vote. I was prepared to \nsupport the trade agreements. However, I believe the USTR has made a \nterrible mistake in negotiating immigration provisions in these trade \nagreements, and, thus, delving into areas of authority that should have \nbeen left to the Congress.\n  I spoke to this to some extent on Friday, and I would like to speak \nagain today because I think this is like peeling an onion. The more you \nlook at it, if you look at immigration law, the more you see the major \nloophole this agreement is creating.\n  This agreement would create new categories for nonimmigrant visas for \nfree-trade professionals. It would permit the admission, on its face, \nof up to 5,400 professionals from Singapore and up to 1,400 from Chile \neach year. That is on its face.\n  It would require the entry for their spouses and children, so they \ncould join foreign workers in the United States. That, of course, makes \nit less of a temporary visa program. Those visas can be extended \nindefinitely. They can be renewed year after year after year ad \ninfinitum. The bill would require without a numerical limit the entry \nof business persons under categories that parallel three other current \nvisa categories: The B-1 visitor visa, the E-1 trader or investor visa, \nand the L-1 intercompany transfer visa.\n\n  In fiscal year 2002, the State Department issued more than a total of \n5,232,492 visas to foreign nationals under the current temporary visa \ncategory that parallels those in the free-trade agreement--5.2 million \nindividuals from foreign countries who come here each year and replace \nAmerican workers in various pursuits.\n  How many more do we need? This legislation requires the entry of \nforeign workers in a new way on L-1 visas regardless of whether they \nare nationals of Singapore or Chile.\n  I don't think most Members realize that. You can get an L-1 visa now \nunder this trade agreement just if you have been employed by a Chilean \nor Singaporian country. You don't have to be a citizen of that country. \nThis is particularly egregious, and I will explain why a little later.\n  The bill would permit but not require the United States to deny the \nentry of a free-trade professional if his or her entry would adversely \naffect the settlement of a labor dispute. It would require the United \nStates to submit the dispute about whether it should grant certain \nindividuals entry to an international tribunal. An international \ntribunal for the first time that I can recall would determine now under \nthis treaty a sovereign right which belongs to the United States of \nAmerica.\n  In enacting the Trade Promotion Act, the Congress did not provide the \nUSTR authority to negotiate new visa categories or immigration programs \nor to impose new requirements on the existing temporary entry system. \nIn fact, the USTR has taken that upon itself.\n  In negotiating these agreements, the USTR has negotiated a perpetual \nvisa category that we as Members will not be able to modify no matter \nwhat the circumstances or the economic consequences may be. Employers \ncan renew these new employee visas each and every year under the \nagreement with no limit while also bringing in every year an additional \ncrop of new entrants to fill up the annual numerical limits for new \nvisas.\n  This makes it possible for foreign employees entering the country on \na supposedly temporary basis at the age of 22 to remain until he or she \nis ready to retire at the age of 70.\n  That is not what temporary visas aim to do.\n  In effect, by voting for these provisions we are adding to the U.S. \nlabor market a continuous supply of 6,800 guest workers a year in \naddition to the more than 40,000 from Chile and the 30,000 from \nSingapore who came in last year under the existing temporary work \ncategories.\n  In other words, this is in addition to the 50,000 workers who have \nalready come in from these two countries. I don't believe Members \nrealize that.\n  These workers come in without taking into account the potential \nimpact on U.S. workers.\n  By voting on this agreement, we as Members of Congress are \neffectively ceding our authority to limit the duration of these visas \nwhen it is in the national interest to do so because we can't change a \nthing. We can't change a comma. We can't dot an ``i''. We can't cross a \n``t''. That is fast track.\n  Another problematic provision--and we should be very concerned about \nthis--is that the unlimited L-1 visa category included in the Chile and \nSingapore agreement does not require that these workers be citizens of \neither Chile or Singapore. They can be from anywhere as long as they \nare working for a company right now located either in Chile or \nSingapore.\n  This means under the agreement, a Chinese or Indian or any other \ncountry's multinational corporation with offices in Singapore, for \nexample, can transfer an unlimited number of Chinese or Indian \nemployees to the United States.\n  What happens if the corporation also has offices in countries hostile \nto the United States or are state sponsors of terrorism?\n  Under these agreements, the corporation may send an unlimited number \nof such nationals to the United States under the E-1 trader visa and \nthe L-1 intercompany transferee visa category.\n  In other words, these trade agreements create a major loophole \nthrough which thousands of foreign workers can come into the country \nwith little scrutiny.\n  I don't believe there is anybody virtually in this Senate who \nunderstands that.\n  This is the problem of having the USTR negotiate an immigration \nagreement. They don't understand it either. And I don't think they \nreally understand what has been accomplished here.\n  Effectively, these agreements permit unlimited entry through \nSingapore and Chile under the L-1 visa category for any worker \nanywhere.\n  In negotiating these agreements, the USTR has eviscerated existing \nrequirements that U.S. corporations first demonstrate that there is a \nshortage of domestic workers in an industry seeking foreign workers. \nEvery one of us knows that unemployment rates are on the rise. In \nprofessional and technical services, it is over 6 percent. In computer \nand mathematical occupations, it is 5 percent. In architecture and \nengineering occupations, it is 4 percent. In informational technology, \nit is 7 percent. In financial services, it is about 4 percent. In \nbusiness and professional services, it is almost 9 percent.\n  When there are all of these vacancies, why are we allowing new \nsources of low-wage labor into this country when we are not facing a \nlabor shortage in any of these industries today? There is no public \ninterest in keeping Americans unemployed in order to accommodate new \nguest worker programs that would be established by these trade \nagreements. Quite the contrary. We face the highest unemployment rate \nin almost a decade, and I can tell you it is high among these worker \ncategories as well.\n  I think these agreements are going to do no more than foster a race \nto the bottom where American workers are forced to compete with \nwhatever foreign workers will accept in the lowest wage categories. \nThat is wrong. This trend should be stopped, not exacerbated.\n  In negotiating these agreements, the USTR has expanded the types of \noccupations currently covered under the H-\n\n[[Page S10102]]\n\n1B visa to include management consultants, disaster relief claims \nadjusters, physical therapists, and agricultural managers--professions \nthat do not require a bachelors degree. This a weakening of what are \nsupposed to be highly qualified and highly skilled workers. Now they \nare amending this to permit a whole host of unskilled categories. You \ndon't even have to have a higher education to qualify to come in as a \nskilled worker in a technical field.\n  These agreements lower the skill level in another way, too. In \nnegotiating the agreements, the USTR has lowered the standards for \nwhich foreign professionals could enter the United States to work. \nUnder current law, H-1B professionals must exhibit--and this is a term \nof art--highly specialized knowledge in the occupation for which he or \nshe is seeking a visa. This agreement would require the applicant only \nto possess specialized knowledge. In other words, they are weakening \nthe requirement. You don't need to be highly specialized, just \nspecialized. And then for some, you don't even need to have a higher \neducation.\n  This distinction is critical because the highly specialized knowledge \ncriteria used under the H-1B program was designed to ensure that \nemployers don't abuse the program to undercut American workers in \noccupations where there is no skill shortage. I assume that this is a \ncrucial point.\n  To back that up, neither the trade agreement nor the implementing \nlanguage would enable the Department of Labor to have the authority to \ninvestigate or conduct spot checks at worker sites, as they do now with \nH-1B visas, to uncover instances of U.S. worker displacement and other \nlabor violations pertaining to the entry of foreign workers. So what \nthis agreement is doing is handcuffing the Labor Department and \nremoving from it specific authority that it has now to go out to \ninvestigate and to see whether the law is being abused and domestic \nworkers are being replaced purposefully with foreign workers.\n  You would say: Well, is this really necessary for them to have this \nauthority? The answer is absolutely. There have been labor violations \ninvolving H-1B visas, and not a few but a lot. These violations have \njumped more than fivefold since 1998, according to the Labor \nDepartment. Back pay awards for such employees who have been replaced \nhave soared by more than 10 times, jumping from about $365,000 in 1998 \nto over $4 million in 2002. So we know there is fraud going on. What \nthis bill does is just simply eliminate the regulations to eliminate \nany investigation as to whether the fraud exists or not.\n  In response to what I have just said about the soaring awards because \nof fraudulent uses of visas, Labor Department officials have stepped up \nH-1B investigations. They say there really could be thousands of H-1B \nworkers today who don't file complaints because they fear the loss of \ntheir visa.\n  In the last 5 years, Labor investigated 656 complaints involving H-1B \nvisas. What did they find? They found that out of 308 cases that have \nbecome final, the Labor Department found 261 H-1B violations. That is \nalmost a two-thirds rate of violation. Of that number, 227 employers \nowed 1,413 domestic workers who were replaced by foreign workers almost \n$8 million in back wages.\n  This temporary work visa system gives employers tremendous power over \nimmigrants. More than 1 million people already are employed in the \nUnited States under visas for skilled workers. The growing trend in H-\n1B violations is proof that some companies will, in fact, violate and \nhave violated the worker protection laws to protect their bottom line. \nThis is happening now, and in a tough economy it is going to happen \nmore often. Those of us who are elected by workers to protect them, if \nwe vote for this agreement, fail to do our job because this agreement \nweakens protections. The most offensive aspect of these provisions is \nthat the USTR has bargained away our sovereign right to set the \ncriteria for admitting foreign visitors and workers to our country. \nUnder the agreement, if Congress determines that the visa categories in \nthis agreement should be subject to numerical limits or labor \ncertification, we could well be subject to defending that decision \nbefore an international tribunal. So an international tribunal would \ndecide the sovereignty of the United States of America to make these \ndecisions.\n\n  During a time when our country is preoccupied with the threat of \nterrorism on our soil, what protection do we have to prevent \nindividuals from purposely utilizing and abusing this visa process?\n  In essence, control over employment-based visas will effectively be \ntaken out of the hands of Congress and placed in the hands of corporate \nexecutives, the USTR, and countries that are parties to these types of \nagreements. That is, frankly, unacceptable to me, and such proposals \nshould be rejected by Congress.\n  I don't think this Congress should relinquish its plenary authority \nover immigration to any administration, whether it be Democratic or \nRepublican, nor to any country that is party to a trade agreement. It \nis hard to imagine that against the backdrop of the highest \nunemployment rate in almost a decade, this administration has \nnegotiated what, in essence, is a permanent guest worker program. That \nis the hard fact of what is in this bill.\n  Today in our Nation, 15 million people are unemployed, underemployed \nin part-time jobs out of economic necessity, or have given up looking \nfor work altogether; 9.4 million are considered officially unemployed. \nIn California, 1.1 million are out of jobs. The average person has been \nout of work for 20 weeks, a phenomenon this country has not seen since \n1948, in over 50 years.\n  Yet while we are faced with unprecedented unemployment, we are \nnegotiating and accepting a permanent guest worker program.\n  Beneath the aggregate unemployment numbers is an even more disturbing \ntrend. Unlike past instances of high unemployment, the ranks of the \njobless are increasingly populated by highly skilled, college-educated \nworkers. Workers who typically had little difficulty finding a new job \nare becoming discouraged by their lengthy stay on the unemployment \nroll.\n  A recent CBS news segment on the Nation's unemployed captured so \npoignantly the lives behind the numbers. The Presiding Officer should \nknow that this CBS clip was actually done in his State. The news \nfootage shows a line of cars stretching out of sight down a flat two-\nlane road in Logan, OH, where the jobless and struggling families were \nwaiting for the twice-a-month distribution of free food by the local \noffice of America's Second Harvest. The head of the agency said: We are \nnow seeing a new phenomenon. Last year's food bank donors are now this \nyear's food bank clients.\n  CBS reporter Cynthia Bowers observed:\n\n       You could call it a line of the times, because in a growing \n     number of American communities these days, making ends meet \n     means waiting for a handout.\n\n  There are many reasons for the persistent weakness in the labor \nmarket. But I think we are making the situation worse by agreeing to \nthe immigration provisions set out in these trade agreements. \nIncreasingly, American workers have expressed fears of losing their \npositions to foreign workers who are paid considerably less and whose \nability to remain in the United States is often contingent upon their \nnot making trouble from their employer. I must tell you, I didn't \nbelieve this 5 or 6 years ago because I was importuned by one CEO after \nanother to vote to increase the quota on H-1B visas.\n  They all supported me, that there was no abuse. It was only when we \nbegan to look deeply into it that we found there was abuse.\n  Today, more and more out-of-work technology workers are filing \ncomplaints with the Government or going to court to protest perceived \nabuses of temporary visa programs. We cannot simply blame the foreign \nworkers for causing Americans to lose their jobs. It is shortsighted, \nbehind-the-scenes policies such as these visa provisions, negotiated in \nsecret, without any meaningful public hearing, included in trade \nagreements in small print, that invite a dependence on cheaper, more \npliable foreign labor, and thus threaten American jobs.\n  The scarcity of jobs has left many skilled immigrants more dependent \non their employer and less willing to quit if trouble starts. The \nabuses have been particularly widespread in the high-tech industry, \nwhich used H-1B visas to\n\n[[Page S10103]]\n\nbring in tens of thousands of programmers and other professionals. \nRemember, it is not just these workers; there are another 5.2 million \ncoming in each and every year. They come in and companies seize upon \nthem.\n  Let me give you an example of testimony that is going on right now in \nthe Judiciary Committee in the Immigration Subcommittee. A woman named \nPat Fluno, a computer programmer and former Siemens employee, is \ntestifying that she and 14 of her colleagues were required to train \ntheir foreign worker replacements before U.S. workers were laid off. \nTheir replacements were foreign nationals on L-1 visas. That is exactly \nthe visa program we are establishing in this trade agreement. They were \npaid one-third the salary the U.S. workers were making. There is no \nrequirement that L-1 visa employers pay the prevailing wage. Ms. Fluno \nwas making $98,000 a year. Her replacement is making $32,000 a year. \nThis is Siemens, and that is what it did to 15 workers.\n  Unlike U.S. workers, foreign workers on L-1 visas don't pay income \ntax. Ms. Fluno, before the Immigration Subcommittee of Judiciary right \nnow, estimates that the Federal Government and the State of Florida \nwould lose over $1.1 million in income taxes as a result of layoffs of \nthe 15 employees.\n  The international consulting firm that Siemens used to obtain the \nforeign workers knew that the U.S. workers would be laid off, so they \ndid not use the H-1B visas to bring the workers in; they used the \nunderregulated L-1 visa to get around the existing employer protection \nof the H-1B visa program. That is what we are creating more of in this \nbill.\n  This type of abuse really should stop because if we don't stop it, it \nis going to go on. Look, if you pay an American worker $98,000 and you \ncan bring in a technical worker and pay them $32,000, and it is OK, how \nwould any of our workers ever be able to own a home and raise their \nkids?\n  Temporary professional workers are often paid less than American \nworkers despite requirements that they be paid prevailing wage rates. \nEmployers seeking to hire H-1B workers can base their prevailing wage \nrates on third party salary surveys up to 2 years old. An H-1B worker \nin a job since the beginning of 2003 might still be getting the 2001 \nprevailing rate.\n  I only use this because H-1B is a much more regulated program than \nthe L-1 visa program that is in this bill. You see how they can kind of \ngerrymander this program by using out-of-date prevailing wage rates.\n  In December of last year, a New Jersey-based company, Pegasus \nConsulting Group, was ordered to pay $231,279 in back wages to 19 \nformer employees. Most of them were Indian nationals. The judge also \nrequired the company to pay $40,000 in civil money penalties for \nviolating the prevailing wage provisions of the H-1B visa rules. The \njudge found that some of the employees had gone several months without \nbeing paid. So this is happening today.\n  Our Nation's growing dependence on foreign workers is not--and I \noriginally thought it was--spurred by a lack of skills or education in \nthe United States. In June of this year, an estimated 1.286 million \nbachelor's degrees were conferred all across the United States, along \nwith 436,000 master's degrees, 80,400 professional degrees, and 46,700 \ndoctoral degrees. In addition, an estimated 633,000 associate's degrees \nwere awarded. We have told, and continue to tell, our young people to \nacquire more education, to get a skill, to remain competitive in the \njob market, and they are doing so.\n  If an advanced degree, years of experience, and a good work ethic are \nnot enough to land a job and to keep a job, what does the future hold \nfor the American worker? Now, for some, the answer to that question is \nreally pretty tragic.\n  Just in April of this year, Kevin Flanagan, a 41-year-old software \nprogrammer, took his life in the parking lot of Bank of America's \nConcord Technology Center on the afternoon he was told he lost his job. \nHis father said it was the ``straw that broke the camel's back.'' \nFlanagan knew that his employer, Bank of America Corporation, as other \ncorporations weathering the economic storm, was cutting high-tech jobs \nand sending them overseas. He applied for other jobs at the bank but \ndidn't receive responses. His father said: ``He felt like he was \nfighting a large corporation that pretty much didn't care.''\n  Kevin Flanagan's death, which is a suicide, underscores the anxiety \nthat has swelled among technology workers throughout this land, at the \nBank of America in particular, and elsewhere, as more businesses shift \nhigh-tech jobs to foreign workers, even as they cut those jobs in the \nUnited States. To add insult to injury, some employers are requiring \nU.S. workers to train their replacements before they are laid off, and \nthen they see where their replacement worker earns one-third the \nsalary.\n  So I don't think we should gamble with the lives and livelihoods of \nAmerican workers with an agreement the consequences of which are so \nproblematic. I really find expanding the least regulated of all the \nvisa categories at a time of economic distress in the United States, at \na time when we have so many of our own highly skilled domestic workers \nout of work and looking for a job, somewhat cynical.\n  To do this in secret, not do it by virtue of lawmakers who are \nelected, who know their States, who hold hearings, and then make \nadjustments to visas is really stealth and very ill advised.\n  We should never use immigration law as a bargaining chip to negotiate \nbad trade deals. We should never have offered visas to Chile and \nSingapore as part of these trade deals, and we should not trade \nAmerican jobs as part of a free-trade agreement. That is what we are \ndoing in this trade agreement.\n  Bear in mind, we already have tens of thousands of workers, highly \nskilled workers, coming in from Chile and Singapore every year under \nthe H-1B visa. What is cynical here is that the L-1 visa does not have \nthe protections the H-1B visa has, and the Labor Department cannot go \nout and do an investigation and, therefore, cannot certify that no \nAmerican worker is being replaced in his or her job. So I have to \naccept that the reason they are doing the L-1 visa is because they want \nto do just that: replace American workers with foreign workers. \nRemember, you can have a Chilean-owned company or Singaporean-owned \ncompany, I believe, not necessarily in Singapore, that can qualify \nunder this agreement.\n  The fast-track process should not undermine Congress's authority \nunder the Constitution, and that is what this agreement does. This is a \nbad trade bill, a bad precedent, and if this Congress does not stand up \nfor its right to protect the American people, who will?\n  We asked in the Judiciary Committee for more time. We were denied \nmore time. We asked to send this bill back to the administration and \nask them to sever the immigration provisions from the trade provisions, \nand we were refused in our request. I do not think because immigration \nlaw is complicated and every visa program has with it a different set \nof rules, regulations, procedures, and protocols and that creating more \nof one of the weakest, in terms of protecting American workers at a \ntime when American workers need the most protection because of rampant \nunemployment--the highest unemployment in the 10 years I certainly have \nbeen in the Senate--seems to me it is not timely, it is not \neconomically productive except for the bottom line of some companies.\n  I believe in these remarks I have shown where many of these visas are \nbeing misused. I have shown where there is fraud, where there have been \nback payments made. And I have shown where already without this \nprogram, year in, year out, 5.2 million technical foreign workers come \ninto this country without this addition.\n  I conclude by saying that I think the real angst, if I may use that \nword, of this bill is for us to accept the abdication of our \nconstitutional authority and power over immigration law. I cannot do \nthat because I represent a very large State that is going to be \naffected by this trade agreement, and a State where we have 1,100,000 \npeople out of work, a State where the unemployment insurance trust fund \nis going to be in deficit at the end of next year and workers will not \nget anything when unemployed.\n  I think it is not good public policy at a time of economic \ndeprivation for millions of Americans to be bringing in workers who \nwill take a third of the\n\n[[Page S10104]]\n\nsalary of their American counterpart, displace that counterpart, not \ncomplain and to, by law, say to the Department of Labor of the United \nStates of America: You cannot investigate any one of these complaints, \nand you cannot make a determination whether, in fact, an American \nworker has been replaced unfairly by a foreign worker. We should not do \nthat.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1386, As Modified\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 \nminutes in support of the Bond-Levin amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, under the order now in effect, we have to \ntake somebody's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is asking consent.\n  Mr. REID. To take whose time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. To have his own time.\n  Mr. REID. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada.\n  I rise today to join my colleagues in support of the Bond-Levin fuel \neconomy amendment that reasonably improves safety, fuel economy, and \nenvironmental conservation as mutual goals. I am pleased to join with a \nbipartisan list of Senators as a sponsor of this amendment that will \nensure that our public policy in America does not compromise common \nsense, the free market, consumer choice, safety, or American workers. I \nwish to touch on some of these key issues.\n  Insofar as safety is concerned, estimates from the Harvard Center for \nRisk Analysis, Journal of Law and Economics, and Regulation Magazine \nhave shown that between 2,000 and 4,500 deaths occur each year as a \nresult of our current CAFE standards.\n  The reality is very logical: With smaller, lighter cars there is a \nhigher risk of injury when an accident occurs. The issue of vehicle \ncost also affects consumers. The National Academy of Sciences concluded \nthat CAFE standards have raised prices by as much as $2,500 for cars \nand $2,750 for pickup trucks and SUVs.\n  Clearly, if the opposition's amendments are adopted rather than the \ncommonsense, reasonable approach that is proposed by Senator Bond and \nSenator Levin, we would have higher prices. With higher prices, what do \nwe get? Obviously, if fewer people can afford to purchase new vehicles, \nsales are reduced, which translates into fewer jobs in the automobile \nindustry.\n  The job loss issue is not theoretical. I have met with United Auto \nWorkers in Virginia and learned that even a 1-mile-per-gallon increase \nin CAFE standards would result in the loss of approximately 10 percent \nof auto manufacturing jobs. The last thing I want to do is go down to \nthe Ford F-150 assembly plant in Norfolk, Virginia and have the 2,000-\nplus employees line up and say to them: One out of every 10 of you is \ngoing to lose a job because of what some officious people in Congress \nwant to impose on America's auto industry and consumers.\n  I do not want to do the same thing with the GM Powertrain facility in \nFredericksburg-Spotsylvania County and tell those employees: One out of \n10 of you will lose your job because certain elected officials in \nWashington are taking away your ability to put food on the table for \nyour families.\n  The employment of over 116,000 Virginians is dependent on the \nautomobile industry, and congressionally mandated unreasonable \nincreases in CAFE standards will put these jobs in jeopardy.\n  The great success of America as a world economic leader is based on \nfreedom and the ability of the free market and consumer choice to \nprevail in the marketplace.\n  Recently, my friend and fellow colleague from Missouri, Senator Bond, \nused a clever reference to a recent movie to describe the other side's \napproach to CAFE mandates, calling the approach ``too fast, too \nfurious.''\n  I also want to draw on Hollywood and the recent success of Arnold \nSchwarzenegger's latest ``Terminator'' movie and point out that the \nother side's unreasonable and unscientific approach terminates jobs, \nterminates safety, terminates consumer choice and terminates common \nsense.\n  American's already have the choice of what vehicles they wish to \ndrive. There are already vehicles available that get 40, 45, 50-plus \nmiles a gallon. If Americans want smaller, lighter vehicles, they are \navailable. It is important that we use sound science and common sense \nand trust free people to make the right choices for themselves, their \nfamilies, and the environment.\n  The Bond-Levin amendment states that auto experts at the National \nHighway Transportation Safety Administration and the auto and safety \nindustry ought to have the ability to determine the best methods of \nachieving these goals. The CAFE numbers used by the other side, in our \nview, are arbitrary and truly based on political science as opposed to \nsound science.\n  The Bond-Levin amendment increases the use of incentives to industry \nand consumers alike rather than punitive market distorting mandates \nthat would decimate an industry responsible for approximately 3 percent \nof our gross domestic product and employs about 2\\1/2\\ percent of all \nAmericans.\n  Also, it is a very forward looking approach in that it provides tax \nincentives for research and development of advanced technological \ninnovation in fuel cells, hybrids, and electric vehicles.\n  It is my view that Congress should be in the business of providing \nincentives to people and manufacturers for innovation that do not \ncompromise safety, do not cause the loss of American jobs, and do not \npreclude individual choice in the marketplace so that people can make \ntheir own decisions for themselves and their families.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the Bond-Levin amendment. We should \ntrust free people to make decisions for the health, safety, comfort, \nand well-being of their families. Most importantly, we ought to make \nsure that America stays strong and competitive.\n  When we look at our auto industry, our strongest market base is in \nSUVs, minivans, and pickup trucks, which would be harmed by the \nopposition's amendments. So let us stand strong for American workers, \nas well as our families and free market, and support the Bond-Levin \namendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of a letter from the American \nInternational Automobile Dealers Association in support of the Bond-\nLevin amendment be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            American International\n\n\n                               Automobile Dealers Association,\n\n                                    Alexandria, VA, July 25, 2003.\n     Hon. George Allen,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Allen: On behalf of the American International \n     Automobile Dealers Association (AIADA), I am writing to urge \n     your support of the proposed amendment by Senators Bond (R-\n     MO) and Levin (D-MI) to allow a regulatory approach to the \n     raising of CAFE standards. AIADA is the national trade \n     association representing over 10,000 American international \n     nameplate automobile dealers and the 500,000 American workers \n     who sell and service some of the finest automobiles and \n     trucks available in the world.\n       The National Highway Traffic Administration (NHTSA) \n     recently issued a final rule on April 1, 2003 aggressively \n     increasing CAFE standards for light-duty trucks. NHTSA \n     increased the light-truck CAFE standard from the current \n     standard of 20.7 mpg to 21.0 mpg in model year (MY) 2005, \n     21.6 mpg for MY 2006, and 22.2 for MY 2007, the biggest \n     increase in over twenty years. The standard applies to pickup \n     trucks, mini-vans, and sport utility vehicles. NHTSA's charge \n     was to set the light-truck CAFE standard at the ``maximum \n     technologically feasible level'' while weighing the impact of \n     increasing CAFE standards against a host of criteria, \n     including vehicle safety, employment, and consumer choice, \n     among other factors. NHTSA allows a process to increase CAFE \n     standards that is based on sound science.\n       AIADA believes the regulatory process is the best way to \n     increase standards in light of changing technology and market \n     conditions. The Bond-Levin amendment establishes new \n     standards through the regulatory process therefore ensuring \n     the consideration of key factors when increasing CAFE \n     standards.\n       Lastly, consumer choice should not be jeopardized to meet \n     new federal standards. Consumer demand drives the automobile \n     retailing market. A dramatic increase in CAFE standards could \n     eliminate some of the most popular vehicles from the \n     marketplace.\n       AIADA believes the Bond-Levin amendment is the best \n     solution to achieving increased fuel economy without \n     jeopardizing consumer choice and safety. AIADA opposes any \n     other CAFE amendments that propose to legislatively increase \n     current CAFE\n\n[[Page S10105]]\n\n     standards. We ask you to support the Bond-Levin amendment as \n     part of a national comprehensive energy policy.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Marianne McInerney,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, as cochairman of the Senate Auto \nCaucus, I am pleased to join with my colleagues, Senator Bond and \nSenator Levin, as a cosponsor of this CAFE standards amendment to the \nenergy bill. This is truly an important issue; one that impacts upon \nour Nation's economy, our environment, and the safety of the traveling \npublic.\n  There is no doubt that each of us wants the automobile industry to \nmake cars, trucks, SUVs, and minivans that are as energy efficient as \npossible. Not only is it good for the environment, it also means more \nmoney in the pocket of the American consumer because they will spend \nless at the gas pump.\n  However, I am deeply concerned that the extreme Corporate Average \nFuel Economy standard supported by some of my colleagues will have a \ndevastating effect on public safety, as well as put a severe crimp in \nthe manufacturing base of my State of Ohio which is already under \nduress because of high natural gas costs, litigation, health care \ncosts, and competition from overseas.\n  Two years ago, new vehicle sales of trucks, SUVs and minivans \noutpaced the sale of automobiles for the first time in American \nhistory. This remarkable result can be attributed to a number of \nfactors, but one reason that is often cited is the fact that these \nvehicles are seen as safer.\n  Another concern is that an arbitrary standard would have a \ndevastating effect on jobs. Ohio is the No. two automotive \nmanufacturing State in America, employing more than 630,000 people \neither directly or indirectly. I have heard from a number of these men \nand women whose livelihood depends on the auto industry and who are \nfrankly very worried about their future.\n  There is genuine concern that a provision mandating an arbitrary \nstandard could cause a serious disruption and shifting in the auto \nindustry resulting in the loss of tens of thousands of jobs across the \nNation.\n  For example, DaimlerChrysler's fleet of light trucks makes up more \nthan 50 percent of their entire fleet. The company manufactures the \nJeep Liberty and the Jeep Wrangler in Toledo, OH and employs \napproximately 5,200 workers at this plant. If an arbitrary CAFE \nprovision is mandated that requires a shifting of vehicles \nmanufactured, this plant could close because Chrysler would be forced \nto redistribute their manufacturing base to build more small, high-\nmileage cars.\n  The Bond-Levin amendment is a rational proposal that will keep \nworkers both in Ohio and nationwide working, allowing these men and \nwomen to continue to take care of their families and educate their \nchildren while also encouraging greater fuel efficiency and safer \nvehicles.\n  This amendment calls for the Department of Transportation to increase \nfuel economy standards based on several factors including the \nfollowing: technological feasibility; economic practicability; the need \nto conserve energy; the desirability of reducing U.S. dependence on \nforeign oil; the effect on motor vehicle safety; the effects of \nincreased fuel economy on air quality; and the effect on U.S. \nemployment.\n  I believe this is a much more responsible approach that will improve \nthe fuel efficiency of our Nation's vehicles while also protecting \npublic safety and our nation's economic security.\n  This amendment also requires that the Department of Transportation \ncomplete the rulemaking process that would increase fuel efficiency \nstandards within 2\\1/2\\ years. If the administration doesn't act within \nthe required timeframe, Congress will act, under expedited procedures, \nto pass legislation mandating an increase in fuel economy standards \nconsistent with the same criteria that the administration must \nconsider.\n  The amendment will also increase the market for alternative powered \nand hybrid vehicles by mandating that the Federal Government, where \nfeasible, purchase alternative powered and hybrid vehicles.\n  I believe that this guaranteed market will encourage the auto \nindustry to continue to increase their investment in research and \ndevelopment with an eye towards making alternative fuel and hybrid \nvehicles more affordable, available and commercially appealing to the \naverage consumer.\n  As a matter of fact, I have ridden in a hybrid manufactured by \nDaimlerChrysler, and I have driven a fuel cell automobile manufactured \nby General Motors. I firmly believe that my children and grandchildren \nwill one day be driving automobiles that run on hydrogen and give off \nonly water. However, it will take time for the technology that makes \nthese vehicles possible to be cost-effective and for these vehicles to \nbe marketable.\n  Until then, truck, SUV, and minivan demand is not expected to \ndecrease anytime soon. Automakers that are meeting this demand will \nhave to manufacture and sell a high-gas mileage vehicle that likely \ndoes not exist now. This will only increase prices for the safe \nvehicles America wants.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Bond-Levin amendment. It meets \nour environmental, safety and economic needs in a balanced and \nresponsible way, contributing to the continued and needed harmonization \nof our energy and environmental policies.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, pending are the Durbin amendment, the Levin \namendment, another Durbin amendment, and the Campbell amendment. I ask \nunanimous consent that the Feinstein CAFE amendment be the next \nDemocratic amendment in order. I recognize that the right of first \nrecognition comes on the other side. I want there to be an agreement \nthough that the next amendment we would offer would be that of Senator \nFeinstein dealing with CAFE.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Objection.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Bond-Levin \namendment. I ask that Senator Mikulski be added as a cosponsor to my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Bond-Levin \namendment and in opposition to the Durbin amendment. I will take about \n8 or 9 minutes to lay out some of the differences between the two \namendments. There are some very key differences.\n  First, our amendment, the Bond-Levin amendment, employs positive \nincentives to promote the leap-ahead technologies which are so critical \nif we are going to make significant improvements in fuel economy. We do \nthis in a number of ways right in this amendment, including the \nresearch and development part of this amendment where we authorize a \nsignificant increase in the funds for the Department of Energy to \ndevelop advanced hybrid vehicles, where we provide significant funds \nfor the Department of Energy to work collaboratively with industry to \nresearch and develop clean diesel technologies, and a number of other \nways.\n  In a separate amendment, dealing with the tax side, there will be an \neffort made to provide some additional incentives in that area as well.\n  In the body of the Bond-Levin amendment, we will be promoting the \nleap-ahead technology development by using the purchasing power of the \nGovernment to buy the hybrids which are going to be made available in \nthe next few years. Since Government purchases a significant number of \nvehicles, it is essential that we use that purchasing power to acquire \nthose new vehicles which will create a demand for those vehicles and \nhelp to commercialize them as well.\n  We require the Government purchase of hybrid trucks for our fleet of \nlight trucks that are not covered by the Energy Policy Act. So there is \nno conflict between what we do in this bill and the Energy Policy Act \nitself.\n  There is another major difference between our approach and the \napproach in the Durbin amendment. What we do is we direct NHTSA, the \nDepartment of Transportation, to raise the fuel economy standards but \nwe do not pick an\n\n[[Page S10106]]\n\narbitrary number to be reached. Instead, we set forth a series of \nfactors which we want NHTSA, the Department of Transportation, the \nagency that has the expertise to do this and has done this and has been \ngiven that responsibility historically to set these standards, we lay \nout a number of criteria which we want them to consider, including what \ntechnologies might be available, which are emerging, what will be the \ncost of those technologies, what are the safety considerations, what \nare the job considerations, what are the air quality considerations, \nwhat will be the savings in terms of fuel, including imported oil. A \nwhole host of criteria are set out which they should consider but which \nare not at all considered by selecting an arbitrary number and simply \nplugging that into a law.\n\n  To pick one factor which is real, and that is the safety factor, the \nNational Academy of Sciences, in its report, found that in just the 1-\nyear study, which was 1993, the effect of CAFE, which was already in \nlaw, was the death of between 1,300 and 2,600 people. They also found \nthat between 13,000 and 26,000 additional moderate to critical injuries \noccurred because the CAFE standard which had been put in law resulted \nin down weighting and downsizing of vehicles.\n  Should we consider safety? Should someone consider safety? I would \nhope so. Should that be a factor which should be looked at in the \nrulemaking process? I would hope so, among all the other factors.\n  Saving fuel is important, and our amendment does that. It will lead \nto fuel savings but we do it in a very different way. Instead of \nselecting an arbitrary number, a very high number in the Durbin \namendment, 40 miles per gallon, we direct NHTSA to use the various \nrelevant factors to reach a conclusion, not just what is \ntechnologically achievable regardless of cost but what is the cost, \nwhat is the cost benefit, and all the other factors, including safety \nand impact on jobs.\n  There is another major difference between our approach and the Durbin \namendment. It is not just that the Durbin amendment picks a number, a \nvery high number, for this new CAFE standard, but in doing so, it uses \nthe current structure. That so-called CAFE structure limits the \nproduction and sale of domestic SUVs of the same efficiency as imported \nSUVs, on which it has far less impact.\n  This is a critical issue. It is an issue which is not adequately \nunderstood by colleagues because it is very complicated. The very \nfundamental CAFE structure, because it was designed to look at the \nentire fleet instead of dividing the fleet into different \nclassifications by weight, has an inherently discriminatory impact on \nthose companies which have traditionally produced the larger vehicle. \nIt has favored the imports because those companies have tended to \nproduce the lighter weight vehicles, the vehicles at the lighter end of \nthe continuum.\n  I quote the National Academy of Sciences because they have made a \nstatement which I hope all of our colleagues would pause to consider \nbefore voting for the Durbin amendment. This is what they said in a \nJanuary 2002 report:\n\n     . . . one concept of equity among manufacturers requires \n     equal treatment of equivalent vehicles made by different \n     manufacturers.\n\n  Now the key words:\n\n       The current CAFE standards fail this test.\n\n  This is something which is so fundamental to American jobs that it is \ncritical all of us take some time to read that portion of the National \nAcademy of Sciences study and to fully soak in its impact as to what it \nis saying. Equal treatment of equivalent vehicles made by different \nmanufacturers is not achieved by CAFE.\n  By piling an arbitrary number on that CAFE structure, as the Durbin \namendment does, it worsens the situation. The equivalent vehicles of \nequal efficiency are treated differently depending on the manufacturer, \nand the difference works against the domestic manufacturer; that is, \njobs which are lost with no benefit to the air at all.\n  There is no reason I can conceive as to why we would want to say it \nis OK to drive a 17-miles-per-gallon imported SUV, but it is not OK to \ndrive a 17-miles-per-gallon domestic SUV. It does nothing for the air \nto reach that result. Yet that is what the current CAFE structure leads \nto.\n  I have one other quote from the National Academy of Sciences report.\n\n       A policy decision to simply increase the standard for \n     light-duty trucks to the same level as for passenger cars \n     would operate in this inequitable manner. Some manufacturers \n     have concentrated their production in light-duty trucks while \n     others have concentrated production in passenger cars. But \n     since trucks tend to be heavier than cars and are more likely \n     to have attributes, such as four-wheel drive, that reduce \n     fuel economy, those manufacturers whose production was \n     concentrated in light-duty trucks would be financially \n     penalized relative to those manufacturers whose production \n     was concentrated in cars. Such a policy decision would impose \n     unequal costs on otherwise similarly situated manufacturers.\n\n  I don't understand why we would even think about treating similar \nvehicles of similar fuel efficiency in a different way, particularly \nwhen that works against the domestic manufacturers.\n  The Durbin amendment compounds this problem by raising the SUV level, \nat least in the case of the minivans and SUVs themselves, to the same \nrequirement as standard vehicles. In doing so, it compounds the \nproblem, the discriminatory effect, of the CAFE structure. I hope for \nthat reason and the other reasons I have mentioned that we will defeat \nthe Durbin amendment and adopt an alternative approach which focuses \nmore on positive incentives to achieve fuel economy, which is what the \nBond-Levin approach does and which also focuses more on the rulemaking \nauthority, the efficiency, the experience, and the fairness of the \nDepartment of Transportation that would look at all of the factors \nwhich should go into the rulemaking rather than picking an arbitrary \nnumber.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I have conferred with the minority whip. \nSome of our colleagues are in a meeting of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee. I urge those who have time who are not on the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee to follow the distinguished \nSenators from Michigan and take their time and express their views so \nwe may get on with this debate. We hope to have votes on these very \nimportant amendments.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will yield in a brief minute to the junior \nSenator from Michigan. While the acting leader is here, I want the \nrecord to reflect we are doing everything we can to cooperate in the \nconsideration of this Energy bill. There was an hour we could have done \nnothing because there was no one here to do anything because they are \nmeeting at the White House. In an effort to expedite matters, there was \nan order pending on the Singapore and Chile trade agreements. There are \n7 hours of debate in an order here before we vote on that; we used an \nhour of that time even though that was not anything we had to do.\n  If we were trying to ``slow walk,'' as was said here today, that \nwould have been an easy way to slow walk. The Senator from California \ncame to the floor and used her hour.\n  The record should reflect this Energy bill is a very complex bill. \nPeople in good faith have different views on the legislation. As I said \nthis morning, there is not a single Democratic Senator who does not \nwant an Energy bill.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the minority whip for his words. Obviously, there \nare times when other discussions have to go forward on the floor, and \nit was clear that the Senator from California had time. There will be \nmany other areas of accommodation, setting aside amendments, to move on \nto the electricity amendment, for example.\n  We appreciate the cooperation of both sides of the aisle. I simply \nurge those who are not committed to the energy meeting to bring their \npositions to the floor and let us hear them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to support the Bond-Levin \namendment and I am very pleased to be a cosponsor. I commend both my \ncolleague from Missouri and my senior Senator from Michigan for their \nwork on this issue, and I certainly commend the Senator from Michigan \nfor his statement. He presented the argument very well.\n  I also rise to oppose the Durbin amendment. I begin by saying this \ndebate is not about whether we should increase vehicle fuel efficiency. \nThat is\n\n[[Page S10107]]\n\nnot what this is about. I agree with Senator Durbin about the \nimportance of creating more fuel-efficient cars and SUVs, not only \nbecause it decreases our consumption of oil and our dependence on \nforeign oil but because of the important benefits it has to our \nenvironment.\n  This debate is about what is the best way to increase fuel efficiency \nwithout punishing U.S. manufacturers and American jobs. We have made \nsignificant progress since last year's debate. NHTSA is moving forward \nwith increasing CAFE standards. This past April, it announced its final \nrulemaking for light trucks for model years 2005 through 2007. This \nwill be the largest CAFE increase in 20 years and\n  NHTSA has already announced plans to continue with rulemaking for the \n2008 model year and beyond, later this year.\n  While this progress is extremely important, there are significant \nproblems with the current CAFE standards and the way they are \ncalculated. For example, the regulations continue to ignore such basic \nfactors as the adverse competitive impacts of CAFE on our U.S. \nautomakers, impacts on U.S. employment, and technology costs and \nnecessary lead-time--which is very important.\n  The Bond-Levin amendment addresses these problems and builds on \nSenator Landrieu's amendment to reduce our dependence on foreign oil by \n1 million barrels a day, an amendment I supported.\n  However, the Durbin amendment not only fails to fix the problems with \nthe current CAFE system, but it makes them significantly worse.\n  Despite producing vehicles that are as fuel efficient, and often more \nfuel efficient than their foreign counterparts, our U.S. automakers \ncontinue to have a lower CAFE average then their foreign competitors. \nWhy? That doesn't make any sense. Because the CAFE system does not \nreflect the real fuel economy of the cars and trucks in an automaker's \nfleet; instead it really reflects what vehicles consumers buy.\n  Therefore, an automaker can increase the fuel efficiency of all of \nits vehicles but still have a decline CAFE average depending on what \nmodels sell the most.\n  For example, over the past 4 years, GM has introduced new car and \nlight truck models that are more fuel efficient than the models that \nthey replaced, but GM's light truck CAFE has actually gone down.\n  In model year 2001, GM's combined car and truck CAFE average was 24.2 \nmiles per gallon. For model year 2002, GM made fuel economy \nimprovements to 18 different vehicles in its fleet, including SUVs and \npickup trucks.\n  Some of these vehicles had 18 percent, 17 percent, 10 percent \nimprovements in fuel economy over the previous year's models. The \nChevrolet Silverado, a full size pickup truck, had over a 7 percent \nimprovement on fuel economy.\n  But do you know what GM's combined car and truck CAFE average was for \nmodel year 2002? It was 23.4 miles per gallon, a 0.8 mile per gallon \ndecrease from 2001. GM improved the fuel economy of 18 vehicles and \ntheir CAFE actually went down.\n  How does a system that does not reflect actual improvements in \nvehicle fuel economy and penalizes automakers for doing the right thing \nmake sense? That is what this debate is about.\n  During last year's debate on this issue, we discussed in great depth \nthe need for building a real federal partnership with our automakers to \ndevelop cleaner, advanced technologies, over arbitrarily picking higher \nCAFE numbers. The Senate resoundingly supported the first approach with \na vote of 62-38 for last year's Levin-Bond amendment which I was \npleased to cosponsor.\n  The Durbin amendment, however, would increase the CAFE standard for \npassenger cars from 27.5 miles per gallon to 40 miles per gallon--a 45 \npercent increase--in only 10 years. Incidentally, excluding hybrid and \ndiesel vehicles, there are no cars on the market today that would meet \nthis requirement.\n  It would also shift SUVs into the passenger car category, requiring \nSUVs that currently have a 20.7 mile per gallon CAFE standard, to \ndouble their fuel efficiency and meet a 40 mile per gallon standard. \nThat would require an almost 100 percent CAFE increase for SUVs in just \n10 years.\n  This amendment will have a disproportionately negative impact on our \nBig Three automakers, since they make a higher proportion of SUVs and \npick up trucks than passenger cars. Furthermore, this CAFE proposal \nwill not guarantee a more fuel efficient SUV, but it will guarantee \nthat the SUV will not be made by an American auto company. How does \nthat make sense?\n  It is also important to remember that the 40 miles per gallon number \nin this amendment is not anywhere in the National Academy of Science's \n2001 report on CAFE.\n  Even under the most optimistic scenarios in the NAS report, which \nassume that consumers are willing to recover the higher costs of the \ntechnology over a 14 year period instead of a 3 year period and assume \n``low'' technology costs, the highest projected level for any car \nwithin the 10-15 year timeframe, is 38.9 miles per gallon and that is \nfor subcompact passenger cars.\n  And that is less than 40.\n  So if you assume that everyone gives up the SUV, gives up the truck, \ngives up the midsize car even, and goes to a subcompact passenger car, \neven if we all did that, we would not be able to reach the number in \nthe Durbin amendment.\n  This amendment sets a CAFE number that according to the experts at \nNAS, not even the smallest passenger car could meet today.\n  The Bond-Levin amendment increases vehicle fuel efficiency without \nplacing anticompetitive restrictions on our U.S. automakers. The \namendment looks to the future, and provides the market incentives and \ninvestment in developing technologies that will really revolutionize \nthe automobile industry.\n  The amendment directs the NHTSA to complete a rulemaking to increase \nfuel efficiency for passenger cars within the next 30 months, and \nstandards for model year 2008 and beyond for light trucks within the \nnext 32 months, but it also requires NHTSA to consider the flaws in the \ncurrent CAFE system for this rulemaking.\n  We need to let the experts at NHTSA continue to do their job. And \nNHTSA has already moved forward by announcing the recent regulations \nfor light trucks, the largest CAFE increase in 20 years.\n  Congress also needs to help automakers move in the right direction, \ninstead of pulling them in the wrong one. Our automakers have already \ninvested millions of dollars in developing cleaner, better \ntechnologies, and these investments are starting to pay off for the \nAmerican consumer.\n  For example, a hybrid electric version of the GM Sierra full size \npickup truck is going into production next year. Ford is currently \ndeveloping a hybrid Ford Escape SUV which will be capable of being \ndriven more than 500 miles on a single tank of gasoline.\n  In addition to these great technological developments, automakers \nhave been working on fuel cell vehicles which could revolutionize the \nautomobile sector within the next 15 years.\n  The Durbin amendment will force automakers to divert funding and \nresearch away from these important technological advancements and make \nmeeting these incremental CAFE increases a funding and research \npriority. The Durbin amendment also locks the automakers into a rigid \nfuel efficiency plan for the next 10 years, setting back the progress \nthey should be making on these important technologies.\n  Instead of placing restrictions on what our automakers produce, we \nshould be looking for ways to help them introduce these better, cleaner \ntechnologies.\n  The Bond-Levin amendment includes incentives such as federal fleet \npurchase and alternative fuels requirements and a real federal \ninvestment in hybrid and clean diesel research and development.\n  These incentives will help create and build market demand for the \nmore fuel efficient hybrid, electric or fuel cell vehicles, instead of \nlocking automakers into costly incremental CAFE increases.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for Bond-Levin-Domenici-Stabenow \namendment and support increased fuel efficiency and a vibrant, \neconomically healthy U.S. auto industry.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S10108]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to support the Durbin amendment \nto raise the fuel economy standard and close the SUV loophole. I \nconsider this truly bipartisan because I disagree with Democrats as \nwell as our Republican friends. But I feel compelled to bring a problem \nto the public with which we have to deal.\n  I think it is fair to say that this amendment strikes a reasonable \nnote in what is too often a contentious debate.\n  Today, 18 years after the first Corporate Average Fuel Economy \nstandards were implemented, the standards for cars, trucks, and SUVs \nremain unchanged.\n  We are running in place and a major reason is that when CAFE \nstandards were first required in 1975, light trucks made up just 20 \npercent of the market and were used mostly for work, not for \nnegotiating congested urban streets.\n  But that was a quarter century ago. Today, light trucks--a category \nthat includes SUVs and minivans--represent half of all vehicles sold.\n  SUVs produce 48 percent more smogforming exhaust and 44 percent more \ngreenhouse gases than cars.\n  Today's SUVs are not light trucks. They are passenger vehicles and we \nshould regulate them as such.\n  The impact of regulating SUVs as passenger vehicles, instead of \ntrucks, would be impressive: we would save more than 40 billion gallons \nof gasoline by 2010--an average of 6 to 7 billion gallons a year.\n  By updating our regulations to reflect today's driving realities \nconsumers would also save $7 billion at the pump during that same \nperiod, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists.\n  Another reason to raise CAFE standards is global warming.\n  The U.S. transportation sector is responsible for nearly one-third of \nall U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.\n  Since 1975, the miles traveled by vehicles have skyrocketed by 150 \npercent.\n  Higher CAFE standards are essential to cleaning up the air of our \nNation's metropolitan areas and in protecting the health of Americans--\nespecially the health of our young and our elderly who are most \nvulnerable.\n  The Durbin amendment provides until 2015 to set the CAFE standard to \n40 miles per gallon.\n  So this amendment is reasonable, it is doable, and it is the right \nstep toward reducing our dependence on foreign oil.\n  But there are a few standard myths invoked by opponents of better \nfuel economy standards that could prevent some of our colleagues from \nsupporting this amendment. I would like to try to straighten that out.\n  For example, we usually hear that jobs will be lost. Detroit worries \nthat requiring better mileage standards will hurt car sales and lead to \njob losses.\n  But I submit that by their insistence on maintaining a decades-old \nstatus quo, American car manufacturers are stuck in reverse.\n  Instead of improving fuel economy, we have just hit a 22-year low.\n  The Big Three have demonstrated considerable skill in improving \neverything about American vehicles--except for their fuel economy.\n  It is that backward thinking that will actually hurt their businesses \nand lead to job losses.\n  EPA's Green Vehicle Guide for 2003 models revealed that out of the \ntop 75 most fuel efficient vehicles, there were only four American \nmodels--only four! We can do better than that!\n  Another claim often heard is that lighter cars will lead to more \nhighway deaths.\n  I submit this is a disingenuous and specious scare tactic.\n  In fact, a University of Michigan study found that based on deaths \nper million vehicles sold, SUVs are more dangerous than most types of \ncars on the road.\n  Contrary to conventional wisdom, the study went on to say that many \nsmall cars have lower total mortality rates than SUVs.\n  In other words, vehicle weight does not necessarily determine a \nvehicle's overall safety performance.\n  The Big Three insist that they are victims of ``consumer choice,'' \nthat they only give American car buyers what they demand.\n  But while Americans like the convenience of an SUV, they certainly \ndon't like to spend $45 or $50 filling the tank once or twice a week.\n  Americans want fuel-efficient automobiles which save them money at \nthe pump.\n  The facts are clear. For the health of Americans, for environmental \nprotection, for our energy security and for our pocketbooks, I urge my \ncolleagues to close the SUV loophole and raise the bar for CAFE \nstandards by voting for the Durbin amendment.\n  I also not once again the fact that there is a sufficient period of \ntime put out there for these standards to be met.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am voting in favor of the Bond-Levin \nAmendment, and I want to explain my views in detail. Fuel efficiency is \na critically important issue for our country, for my home State of \nWisconsin, and for our future. I remain committed to the goal that \nsignificant improvements in automobile and light truck fuel efficiency \ncan be achieved over an appropriate time frame. Some will argue that my \nvote for Levin-Bond is a vote against increasing Corporate Average Fuel \nEconomy, CAFE, standards; I do not share that view. The Bond-Levin \namendment seeks to renew the Department of Transportation's role in \nsetting CAFE standards acting through the National Highway Traffic \nSafety Administration, NHTSA. It requires NHTSA to set new standards by \na time certain. If Congress does not act today to try to restore \nnormalcy to the NHTSA process, Congress will always either block or act \nto set CAFE standards, every 20 years or so, when the political will is \nsufficient to do so. It will never become part of the normal process of \nreviewing and incrementally improving fuel efficiency for automobiles, \nas Congress originally intended when it passed the CAFE law in the \n1970s.\n  As I did in the debate on last year's energy bill, I am committing \nmyself to a consistent position on CAFE. Other interests have not done \nso. With my vote, I am affirming my past position, and I want to \nexplain the evolution of that position.\n  Months prior to the midterm elections in 1994, NHTSA published a \nnotice of possible adjustment to the fuel economy standards for trucks \nbefore the end of the decade. The following year, however, the House-\npassed version of the fiscal year 1996 Department of Transportation \nAppropriations bill prohibited the use of authorized funds to \npromulgate any CAFE rules. The Senate version did not include the \nlanguage, but it was restored in conference. Much the same scenario \noccurred in the second session of the 104th and the first session of \nthe 105th Congresses. In both those sessions, a similar rider was \npassed by the House and not by the Senate, but included by the \nconferees and enacted. However, the growth in gasoline consumption and \nthe size of the light-duty truck fleet were concerns cited behind \nintroduction in the Senate of an amendment to the bill expressing the \nSense of the Senate that the conferees should not agree to the House-\npassed rider for fiscal year 2000. The amendment, sponsored by the \nformer Senator from Washington, Mr. Gorton, and the Senator from \nCalifornia, Mrs. Feinstein, was defeated in the Senate on September 15, \n1999 by a vote of 55-40 and the rider was once again enacted into law.\n  As I stated on the Senate floor in the debates on the CAFE rider on \nJune 15, 2000, my vote was about ``Congress getting out of the way and \nletting a federal agency meet the requirements of federal law \noriginally imposed by Congress.'' I supported removing the rider \nbecause I was concerned that Congress had blocked NHTSA from meeting \nits legal duty to evaluate whether there is a need to modify fuel \neconomy standards by legislative rider.\n  As I made clear then, I have made no determination about what fuel \neconomy standards should be, though I do think that additional \nincreases are possible, and that the recent rulemaking affirms that \nview. NHTSA has the authority to set new standards for a given model \nyear taking into account several factors: technological feasibility, \neconomic practicability, other vehicle standards such as those for \nsafety and environmental performance, the need\n\n[[Page S10109]]\n\nto conserve energy, and the recommendations of the National Academy of \nSciences. I want NHTSA to fully and fairly evaluate all the criteria, \nand then make an objective recommendation on the basis of those facts. \nI expect NHTSA to consult with all interested parties--unions, \nenvironmental interests, auto manufacturers, and interested citizens--\nin developing this rule. And, I expect NHTSA to act, and if it does \nnot, this amendment requires Congress to act on a standard.\n  Voting against the Bond-Levin amendment would mean that I subscribe \nto the view that the rulemaking process cannot work. I do not support \nthat view, just as I could not support retaining the CAFE rider in law.\n  The NHTSA should be allowed to set this standard. Congress is not the \nbest forum for understanding whether or not improvements in fuel \neconomy can and should be made using existing technologies or whether \nemerging technologies may have the potential to improve fuel economy. \nChanges in fuel economy standards could have a variety of consequences. \nI seek to understand those consequences and to balance the concerns of \nthose interested in seeing improvements to fuel economy as a means of \nreducing gasoline consumption, dependence upon foreign oil, and \nassociated pollution.\n  In the end, I would like to see that Wisconsin consumers, indeed all \nconsumers, have a wide range of new automobiles, SUVs, and trucks \navailable to them that are as fuel efficient as can be achieved while \nbalancing energy concerns with technological and economic impacts. That \nbalancing is required by the law. I fully expect NHTSA to proceed \nexpeditiously with the intent to fully consider all those factors, and \nthis amendment ensures they do so.\n  In supporting this amendment, I maintain the position that it is my \njob to ensure that the agency responsible for setting fuel economy be \nallowed to do its job. I expect them to be fair and neutral in that \nprocess and I will work with interested Wisconsinites to ensure that \ntheir views are represented and the regulatory process proceeds in a \nfair and reasonable manner toward whatever conclusions the merits will \nsupport.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise as a cosponsor of the Bond-Levin \namendment to provide a reasonable compromise on CAFE standards. Our \namendment provides a strategy for energy conservation while \nsafeguarding American jobs. I strongly believe in energy conservation, \nand I support the effort to build more fuel efficient cars. Yet I also \nbelieve in job conservation. I believe we can improve the fuel \nefficiency of our cars without making it even harder for American \nworkers to compete.\n  In considering any fuel efficiency standard proposal, I apply four \ncriteria. Any proposal must achieve real savings in oil consumption. \nSecondly, it must preserve U.S. jobs. The goals for increased CAFE \nstandards must be realizable and achievable by giving companies a \nreasonable lead time to adjust their production. And finally, it must \ncreate incentives to enable companies to achieve these goals. The Bond-\nLevin amendment meets this criteria.\n  I strongly agree with the underlying goals of greater fuel efficiency \nand energy conservation associated with increases in CAFE standards. We \ndesperately need to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. We use about \n20 million barrels of oil a day. About 40 percent of that goes to fuel \ncars and light trucks. Half of our oil is imported, a quarter of which \nfrom the Persian Gulf. It is imported from countries like Saudi Arabia, \nwhich sits on roughly two-thirds of all the oil reserves in the world. \nA reduction in our dependency on foreign oil would also greatly \nincrease our flexibility in the war against terrorism. That's why I \nsupported the Landrieu amendment. This amendment requires the President \nto submit to Congress a yearly report on the progress made toward \nreducing our dependency on foreign petroleum imports by 2013. This \namendment also requires the Administration to develop and implement \nstrategies to reduce our dependency by 1 million barrels of oil per day \nby 2015.\n  I support the key provisions in the energy bill that will help us \nconserve fuel. We need to build on these innovative provisions that \nencourage better fuel economy. And we must do it in a way that doesn't \ncost American jobs. That's why I oppose legislating arbitrary increases \non CAFE.\n  Arbitrary Increases in CAFE would be counterproductive. Any increase \nshould be a question of science, not the result of legislative \ncompromise. The NAS study said the most efficient small car could \nachieve 35.1 mpg within 15 years and the most efficient small truck \ncould achieve 30 mpg within 15 years. One standard for small cars, one \nfor small trucks. The study said nothing about a combined calculation \nfor cars and trucks. There was no recommendation for an entire vehicle \nfleet.\n  Other proposals which call for an arbitrary increase in CAFE would \nhave a devastating effect on our Nation's biggest industry--the \nautomobile industry. It is unfair to the American auto worker. In my \nState of Maryland, 1,500 people work at the GM plant at Broening \nHighway in Baltimore building mini-vans. The workforce at the Broening \nHighway plant is down from 2,700 workers in the mid 1980's. Arbitrary \nincreases would give an unfair advantage to foreign car manufactures \nand penalize U.S. automakers and auto workers, like the hard-working \nmen and women at the Broening Highway plant, for selling vehicles that \nAmericans are actually buying.\n  Large vehicles represent a small portion of the total fleet of \nEuropean and Japanese auto companies. These companies produce so many \nsmaller cars because that's what their customers buy. Most of their \nmarkets are in Europe and Asia where the landscape is much different. \nConsumers pay as much as $4 or $5 per gallon of gas. They have narrower \nroads and a limited highway infrastructure. Bringing a small fleet into \nthe U.S. allows them to easily comply with our fuel economy standards. \nEven when you include their SUV's and light trucks, the average fuel \nefficiency standard for their fleet is still low.\n  When a foreign auto maker exceeds our fuel efficiency standards they \nalso earn CAFE ``credits'' to buffer them in future years. These \ncredits can be shifted to offset shortfalls for up to three model \nyears. This means that if companies have a banner year selling smaller, \nmore efficient vehicles, they can buffer future sales of larger trucks \nand SUVs. But this does not mean that foreign manufacturers sell more \nfuel efficient trucks and SUVs. In fact, the difference is usually 3-4 \nmpg. Their dependence on a smaller fleet allows them to enter the truck \nand SUV market without worrying about the CAFE standards of the larger \nvehicles.\n\n  Over the past decade, U.S. manufacturers struggled to meet CAFE \nrequirements across a full-line of vehicles--both cars and trucks. \nBecause a higher proportion of the U.S. automakers' fleets are trucks, \nraising CAFE standards will have more severe adverse effects on GM, \nFord, and DaimlerChrysler than on other manufacturers.\n  Proposals to increase CAFE standards are also unattainable. They set \naggressive standards on too short a timeline. This is in direct \ncontrast to the NAS panel, which states ``Technology changes require \nvery long times to be introduced into the manufacturers' product \nlines.''\n  Within any argument on CAFE, we must not forget to take into account \nthe demands of consumers. A drastic increase in fuel efficiency \nstandards causes a drastic change in the types of cars, which causes a \nlimited choice of available cars and trucks for consumers. Alternate \nproposals set a default level for light trucks that is not achieved by \nANY light truck on the road today. This would effectively cap the sales \nof light trucks--it would curb consumer choice.\n  I believe we can find other ways to achieve fuel conservation that \nwon't cost American jobs. Our domestic automakers have already been \nweakened by the current recession, and we can't rely on foreign \nmanufacturers to provide American jobs.\n  The numbers don't lie. The NAS reports that the United Auto Workers \nhas seen its membership drop from 1.4 million members to 670,000 from \n1980 through 2000. This loss was countered by the creation of only \n35,000 jobs in assembly plants built in the U.S. by foreign automakers \nalthough imports have risen by 9 percent over the past 8 years. Our \ndomestic auto share is falling. Only 64 percent of cars bought in\n\n[[Page S10110]]\n\nAmerica today are built in America compared to 73.9 percent in 1994. \n1,000 workers were recently laid off at the GM plant in Baltimore, and \nthe plant went through another shutdown after slow sales. In fact, GM \nshut down 14 of its 29 North American assembly plants for at least a \nweek last year.\n  Today, all manufacturers have advanced technology programs to improve \nvehicle fuel efficiency, lower emissions and increase occupant \nprotection. A return to a flawed regulatory program of higher CAFE \nstandards would divert resources from these efforts. Raising CAFE \nstandards to levels that effectively squash the American auto industry \nis not the only solution. Senators Bond and Levin have an alternative \nthat is reasonable and fair. It brings together two common goals of \nIncreasing fuel efficiency and protecting jobs and the American \neconomy.\n  The Bond-Levin amendment directs the Department of Transportation to \nincrease CAFE standards for cars and light duty trucks based on several \nfactors. These include the desirability of reducing our dependence on \nforeign oil; the effect on U.S. employment; impacts on motor vehicle \nsafety; cost and lead time required for introduction of new \ntechnologies; and the effects of increased fuel economy on air quality.\n  It also directs the Department of Transportation to complete two \nrulemakings. First, they must complete a rulemaking within 30 months to \nincrease standards for passenger cars. Second, they must complete a \nrulemaking to increase standards for light trucks no later than April \n2006. This will go into effect for model year 2008. Each rulemaking is \nto be given on a muliti-year basis, but cannot exceed 15 model years. \nThis amendment also directs Congress to take action on CAFE should the \nDOT not take action in the required timeframe.\n  This bi-partisan amendment also includes expanded research and \ndevelopment into the production of hybrid electric vehicles and to \nimprove diesel combustion. It authorizes $50 million per year over the \nnext three years to conduct the hybrid electric technology research, \nand $75 million per year over the next three years for advanced \ncombustion engine research and development.\n  Finally, the Bond-Levin amendment requires the Federal Government to \npurchase advanced technology vehicles, beginning in 2005. Hybrid \nvehicles must be purchased or leased for light duty truck fleets and \nalternative fuel vehicles must be purchased or leased for passenger car \nfleets.\n  We can have both energy conservation and job conservation. But it \ncannot be done by changing a number. It will take innovative solutions, \nimproved technology, and the setting of realistic, achievable goals. \nThe Bond-Levin amendment accomplishes these goals.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Bond-Levin \namendment.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: I just returned, \nand I apologize. Where are we now? As I understand it, some time was \nused on a matter other than this bill charged to other matters. How \nmuch time is left now, and who has the time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey has 4 minutes \nremaining. The Senator from Illinois has 15 minutes. The junior Senator \nfrom New Mexico has 5 minutes. The senior Senator has 5 minutes. The \nSenator from Mississippi has 1\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I note the distinguished minority whip is here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from New Jersey yield his \ntime?\n  Mr. REID. No. He is not yielding back his time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. He did. Yes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I am reserving the rest of my time.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, now that the manager of the bill is here, I \nrenew a unanimous consent request that I made a short time ago. I ask \nunanimous consent that the Feinstein CAFE amendment be the next \nDemocratic amendment in order. In addition to the unanimous consent \nrequest, I know the Republican manager has first right of recognition, \nbut there is going to come a time when we offer our next amendment. I \nam alerting everyone that it will be the Feinstein CAFE amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We object to granting you that privilege at this point. \nWe understand the time will come, but it isn't certain that she will \nhave the next amendment. That is the point.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator does not have time under the \nagreement.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent to have the Lautenberg time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, all day we have heard that we are slow-\nwalking this bill. In an effort to help manage what goes on here, we \nhave asked the Senator from California who has a CAFE amendment to be \nthe next in order. We have 382 amendments. We have about half of them \nover here. Any one of the Senators can call up any one of their \namendments. I think it would be in the best interest of the Senate if \nwe have an orderly process for offering these amendments. This does not \ndisadvantage the majority in any way. We have done what we can to help \nmove this bill forward. Senator Feinstein spoke. She came over to offer \nthis amendment and couldn't do it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have no objection. I misunderstood. I apologize. If \nyou want the Record to reflect that the next Democratic amendment will \nbe Senator Feinstein's amendment on CAFE, we have no objection.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, so there is no misunderstanding. I ask \nunanimous consent--this is for the Democratic Senators--that next \nDemocratic amendment that we offer, whenever that might be, will be the \nFeinstein CAFE amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is correct; whenever you do.\n  Mr. REID. That is right.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. So you don't have any misunderstanding either, we will \nbe finished with the debate and, as we understand it, we will then \nvote.\n  Mr. REID. We will vote. Following that vote we have two amendments to \ndispose of--another Durbin amendment which may work out very easily, \nand the second is the Campbell amendment. Following that, we have been \nadvised on several occasions that the majority who has first right of \nrecognition wants to offer the new electricity section.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. That is fine. Whenever we offer our next amendment, Senator \nFeinstein will offer her amendment on CAFE.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We want to accommodate. If there was any \nmisunderstanding, it perhaps was on my part. I have no objection.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask \nunanimous consent that the time be charged equally to the remaining \nthree Senators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, how much time remains for me to discuss \nthe Levin-Bond amendment and the Durbin amendment under the unanimous \nconsent agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me speak for that 4 minutes to \nindicate my opposition to the Levin-Bond amendment. As I see that \namendment, by adopting it, we would do two things. First, we would be \nerecting new barriers to the development of meaningful fuel economy \nstandards. Secondly, we would be effectively walking away from an \nopportunity to do something right about decreasing our growing oil \nconsumption. In both cases, we would be making a mistake.\n  The Bond-Levin amendment establishes additional criteria that would \nimpose unnecessary hurdles to any significant increase in fuel \nefficiency standards. There are multiple new factors such as the effect \nof CAFE standards on the relative competitiveness of manufacturers and \nlevels of U.S. employment. Those kinds of criteria are\n\n[[Page S10111]]\n\nbeing added to the current rulemaking process. In my view, adding those \nkinds of criteria will only cause the courts to revisit the careful \nbalance that is already struck in the present statute.\n  NHTSA already considers in-depth evaluations of the impact of a \nstandard on safety, on the environment, and on American jobs. And the \nLevin-Bond amendment complicates the agency's task by providing a \nlengthy list of 13 items which, in my view, are unnecessary and \ndeliberately vague new statutory provisions that have to be considered.\n  This is not progress. We need to be honest with the American people \nand ourselves and recognize that if Alan Greenspan cannot even tell us \nthe effect of a small drop in interest rates on the economy in the near \nfuture--as it is clear that he cannot and has not been able to, and he \nreadily admits has not been able to--how can we expect the National \nHighway Transportation Safety Administration to possibly determine with \naccuracy the effect of any change in CAFE standards on employment \nlevels or on relative competitiveness?\n  Passenger vehicles today already use more petroleum than is currently \nproduced in the United States. The Energy Information Agency projects \nconsumption to increase an additional 2 million barrels per day before \nthe end of this decade. Consumer preference has switched to light \ntrucks and sport utility vehicles in recent years, and this has caused \nthe average fuel economy in the U.S. passenger fleet to actually drop \nrather than improve. We are going backward with regard to fuel \nefficiency in vehicles.\n  Today, we have the lowest fuel efficiency we have had since the early \n1980s in our entire fleet of vehicles. A decision not to increase CAFE \nstandards significantly is a decision to become more and more dependent \non foreign energy sources.\n  I just returned from a meeting in the White House, where the \nPresident met with many of us, including my colleague from New Mexico, \nmyself, the majority leader, the Democratic leader, and all of us were \ntalking about how important it is that we move ahead with progressive \nenergy legislation, and that we do so in order to reduce our dependence \non foreign oil. The biggest factor causing an increased dependence on \nforeign oil is the increase in the use of oil and gasoline in motor \nvehicles. Instead of increasing the efficiency with which we reduce the \nefficiency of our motor vehicles, we are moving in just the opposite \ndirection.\n  Despite what automakers are saying, new engines, transmission, and \nhybrid technologies are now available to give automakers the means to \nincrease gas mileage over the next 10 years without reducing either \nvehicle size or weight. Mr. President, we drove to the White House a \nfew minutes ago in a new Honda Civic that is a hybrid. The average \nmiles per gallon of that vehicle is between 45 and 50 miles.\n  It is very unfortunate, in my view, that the only hybrid vehicles \navailable to a U.S. consumer today are Japanese vehicles. They are the \nhybrid that is produced by Honda and the hybrid produced by Toyota.\n  I see that my time is up. I urge my colleagues to oppose the Levin-\nBond amendment. I do support Senator Durbin's amendment. I hope we can \nadopt that amendment and make some significant progress toward \nincreasing vehicle fuel efficiency.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, would you tell me how much time there is \nbefore the votes on the Durbin and Bond-Levin amendments?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois has 12 minutes; the \nSenator from New Jersey has 1 minute 40 seconds; the Senator from New \nMexico has 3 minutes 45 seconds; the Senator from Mississippi has 1 \nminute 8 seconds.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Not on my time.\n  Mr. REID. This will be off of Senator Lautenberg's time. The Senator \nfrom Missouri, Mr. Bond, has asked that the proponents of these \namendments have some time to speak before the votes take place. Senator \nDurbin should be able to speak last, which is normal; it is his \namendment. I want to make sure everybody has ample time to speak. The \nSenator from Missouri said he wants 2 or 3 minutes. Is that OK if \nSenator Bond has 2 minutes?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is fine. I was going to make sure he got it by \ngiving him some of mine. I appreciate that very much. It is hard to say \nwho should speak last because the first amendment to be voted on is \nSenator Bond's amendment. Maybe he should be speaking last. If that is \nthe way we are going to do it----\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, to clarify, is there time after the vote on \nthe Durbin amendment for debate on the Bond-Levin amendment?\n  Mr. REID. The Senator said you are going to be first.\n  Mr. BOND. Is there time for debate after that on the Bond-Levin \namendment?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 4 \nminutes equally divided.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, what is the regular order of the votes on \nthe amendments?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote will occur first on the Durbin \namendment, followed by the Bond amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I understand the unanimous consent request by the \nSenator from Nevada, there will be 4 minutes before the vote on the \namendment of the Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. REID. I modify my request to that effect.\n  Mr. BOND. There will be time allotted for those of us on the other \nside prior to the Durbin amendment--who has the last minutes on that, I \nask the managers?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Well, look, Senator Durbin has 15 minutes. We don't \nneed to give him any more time. He can save 2 of that for just before \nthe vote. We need to save Senator Bond 2 minutes. We need to give \nSenator Bond 2 minutes to speak in opposition. Senator Durbin doesn't \nneed any additional minutes beyond the 15.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I probably have all I need.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thought you had been speaking all afternoon--but it \nis eloquent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, please alert me when I have 3 minutes \nremaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, before us is the most important single \namendment on the question of energy security of the United States. That \nis quite a bold assertion but I stand by that because we understand \nhow dependent we are on foreign oil. We understand that as long as the \ncars and trucks that we use in America are not fuel efficient, we will \ncontinue to have this dependence on foreign oil. So if we want to \nsecure the Nation from an energy point of view, we have to show \nleadership on the floor of the Senate. We did that in 1975; 28 years \nago, we established standards that said to those producing cars for \nsale in America: You are not doing a good enough job. Fourteen miles a \ngallon is unacceptable. You have to do better and we will give you 10 \nyears to improve that. And they did.\n\n  At the end of 10 years, 27 and a half miles per gallon was the \naverage fleet economy average across America. It was done because this \nCongress had the will. This Congress stood up to the special interest \ngroups and said it is more important for the energy future of America \nand for families and businesses for us to have fuel efficiency. Look \nwhat we got for it: safe, fuel-efficient vehicles by 1985--double the \nfuel efficiency of just 10 years before.\n  Now I come to the floor and say, why haven't we done anything since \n1985? Eighteen years of inaction. Isn't it time for us to show \nleadership again? You would think I was proposing the end of the \nautomobile industry in America. Listen to the arguments we hear from \nthe other side. A Senator came on the floor today and said: If Durbin \nhas his way, we are all going to be driving golf carts.\n  Get real. The technology is there. Don't take my word for it. I am a \nliberal arts lawyer. What do I know about engineering?\n  In 2001, the National Research Council came out with a report \nspecifying all the technologies currently available that could increase \nfuel efficiency in cars and trucks. Why aren't they being\n\n[[Page S10112]]\n\nput on those vehicles? Because Detroit doesn't have the will to do it. \nAnd because they don't, we continue to be sold heavier, more \ncumbersome, and, in many respects, more dangerous vehicles, with even \nworse fuel economy; we continue to import oil from overseas and be \ndependent on the Middle East; we continue to burn that oil, polluting \nthe environment, creating greenhouse gases, resulting in public health \nproblems and a degradation of the environment and, frankly, endangering \nspecies on Earth that could live, because they are God's creation, but \nwill be destroyed because we are ignoring our responsibility today.\n  There are those who said: We cannot do this. We must understand that \nwhen it comes to this technology war between the United States and \nother countries, those who oppose this amendment say: Don't you \nunderstand, Senator Durbin, we are not up to this fight; we cannot win \nthis fight; we have to find a way to avoid this battle. And I will say \nto them: That is not my point of view. I believe America can compete. \nWe have proven it in the past. We proved it in 1975.\n  These people who are so afraid that we will be forced to put a more \nfuel efficient car on the road that is also safe have told us it is \nimpossible, and leading that chorus is none other than the big three in \nDetroit, once again falling behind when it comes to a global challenge \nto do the right thing. That is sad.\n  For those of us who want to encourage American automobile \nmanufacture, for those of us who want to stand behind those workers, I \nask them the simple question: Why are they afraid to lead? Why are they \nafraid of a challenge to their creativity, to their innovation, to \ntheir leadership? Why must we always take second place when it comes to \nautomobile technology? I think America is capable of much more. But \nthose doubters, those who do not believe America is up to the \nchallenge, say: Defeat the Durbin amendment. If you establish a \nstandard of 40 miles a gallon, America is throwing in the towel; we are \ngiving up; no way we can compete on that kind of a standard.\n  They also say--and this is the saddest part of their argument--we \nalso know foreign countries can compete and will compete successfully \nagainst us. What a sad commentary on American industry for the critics \nof this amendment to come up with that argument. I do not stand by it. \nI think if we show our leadership, they will show theirs. They did it \nin 1975; they can do it again today.\n  There is an old story--and it is probably anecdotal--that after we \npassed the CAFE standards in 1975 and said we wanted better fuel \nefficiency in our cars, in Japan they got the message of the passage of \nthis new law and they said: Go out and hire an army of engineers; we \nhave to be ready to compete. When they got the news of the passage of \nthis new law in Detroit, they called all their leaders together and \nsaid: Go out and hire an army of lawyers to fight this law. That is \nsadly reflective of the mentality that comes to the floor today.\n  Instead of saying American industry can do better, that American \nfamilies can expect more, that the next generation will have more safe \nand fuel-efficient cars, the opponents of this amendment say it is \nimpossible, it cannot be done, and it can only be achieved at the \nexpense of the American automobile industry.\n  That is a sad commentary. Frankly, it is one we should reject. I say \nto my colleagues in the Senate: If this Energy bill that involves so \nmuch work by so many people, S. 14, is to have any value, aren't we \ngoing to address the most important single use of energy by American \nfamilies and businesses today--our transportation sector and its \nutilization of the imports of oil? If we do not do that, this bill is \njust window dressing. It is nice.\n  There are some aspects of the bill I actually like, but it does not \nget to the heart of the issue. It fears the heart of the issue because \nthere are people who are afraid of it, and I think they are just plain \nwrong.\n  Let me mention a couple of other arguments brought up by my \nopponents. They said the Durbin amendment achieving 40 miles a gallon \nby 2015 is too fast and too furious. I remind them, the Durbin \namendment is an increase of less than 1 mile per gallon per year for \nthe first 6 years. That is hardly fast and furious.\n\n  They say my amendment is going to terminate jobs, safety, and \nconsumer choice. The same weak arguments were made in 1975, and they \nshould be rejected today as they were in 1975.\n  They say my CAFE levels are arbitrary. Listen, we use a standard, not \npolitical argument. The National Academy of Sciences already identified \nthe technologies that can be put in cars and trucks effectively. They \nalso say the Bond-Levin amendment is a great leap forward, but it is a \ngreat leap forward for litigation.\n  The Bond-Levin amendment is not an invitation to innovation; it is an \ninvitation to litigation. Let me tell my colleagues why I say that. \nThey establish the standards by which we can improve fuel efficiency in \nAmerica through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. On \none side of this chart are the existing standards. There are a handful \nof them. The opponents of my amendment decided to add all of these \nitems to the standards that have to be followed by NHTSA before they \ncan improve fuel economy.\n  What does this mean? It means that if they ever muster the courage to \nsay we can have more fuel efficient vehicles, they will be challenged \nin court on each and every one of these elements. They will be tied up \nin court for years. That is exactly what the opponents of the Durbin \namendment want. They do not want to see more fuel efficiency. They want \nthis delayed indefinitely. And that delay means more dependence on \nforeign oil. It means more pollution. It means less energy security for \nAmerica.\n  To come up with all of these new categories that have to be met is \njust a guarantee that, in our lifetime, we will never see a change. For \n18 years we have not. NHTSA, left on its own for the last 18 years, has \nnominally improved MPG, miles per gallon, in America by 1.5 miles per \ngallon--in 18 years. How long will it take us to reach 32 miles a \ngallon by that standard? We would not see it this century. That is how \nslow they are today.\n  In comes the Bond-Levin amendment and it says: Let's throw some other \ncategories in here and obstacles to increasing fuel efficiency.\n  The American people get this. American businesses do, too. They \nunderstand that more fuel efficient vehicles are going to make a more \nproductive economy, make certain that America is more competitive, make \ncertain there are more and good paying jobs. We are not going to throw \nin the towel. With the Durbin amendment, we accept the challenge that \nwe can keep our love affair with the automobile alive but do it in a \nresponsible way. It is the kind of situation our Nation has responded \nto time and again, and I think we should today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes remaining.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, obviously, I do not have the time the \nSenator from Illinois has, but I do want to point out that the National \nAcademy of Sciences says:\n\n       The committee cannot emphasize strongly enough that cost \n     efficient fuel economy levels are not recommended CAFE goals.\n\n  The National Academy of Sciences also said that when the politically \ndriven fuel economy numbers were imposed in the seventies and eighties, \nsomewhere roughly approximating 2,000 deaths a year occurred on the \nhighways due to smaller cars. Talk about the production of automobiles \nin auto-related industries in Missouri and Illinois, even in New \nMexico: 21,000 in New Mexico; 16,000 in Rhode Island; 221,000 in \nMissouri; 331,000 jobs in Illinois.\n  I previously submitted for the Record a letter from the United Auto \nWorkers saying it would endanger the jobs of their members.\n  Furthermore, we also know it does not relate to consumer choice. \nThirty cars on the road today get more than 30 miles per gallon, and \nthey represent only 2 percent of the sales. Consumers do not want them. \nUnless we have to tell people what they have to drive, we are not going \nto get them to drive around in these cars unless and until we get the \ntechnology to produce more fuel efficient cars.\n  We have seen NHTSA, the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration, make the most significant increase in fuel economy with \ntheir light\n\n[[Page S10113]]\n\ntruck standards which are going into effect. We mandate in the Bond-\nLevin amendment that the maximum feasible technology be utilized to \nincrease standards in the future.\n  Let's get real. Let's talk about what is technologically feasible, \nwhat will continue jobs, get better fuel economy, not risk the lives of \nthe drivers on the road and their families, and also not throw out of \nwork the very wonderful American men and women who are making these \nautomobiles in my State and others.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the Durbin amendment and support the \nBond-Levin amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have how many minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes 53 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will try to do it in that period of \ntime. I ask unanimous consent for 3 minutes instead of the 2 minutes \nand something.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, the Senator from New Mexico, \nthe manager of this bill, can have whatever time he wants.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I think I am going to do it in 2 minutes \nand whatever few seconds.\n  First, I have been looking forward to this debate all day because it \nis a very mature debate. The Senate spent a good deal of time last year \ndiscussing these two amendments, as well as others. The Feinstein \namendment we agreed to and that we will be talking about, I think we \ndiscussed it heretofore also, but in any event, a lot of time has been \nspent discussing these amendments.\n  In addition to these amendments, I remind Senators that we have \nalready adopted an amendment, that came as quite a surprise, by Senator \nLandrieu that would require the President to develop a plan to reduce \ndomestic petroleum consumption by 1 million barrels a day by 2013. \nSince major reductions in oil consumption are most likely going to be \nachieved through reductions in the use of transport fuels, the \nPresident, as a result of the Landrieu amendment, will probably have to \nfocus on measures to increase fuel economy.\n  I suggest to Senators that the Landrieu amendment may obviate the \nneed for further debate. Nonetheless, we are debating and we will \ncontinue to debate. It seems to me the Landrieu amendment gives the \nPresident the kind of authority and flexibility needed in this country \nif, in fact, this issue is as important as it is being alluded to.\n  Keeping that in mind, if the Senate must choose among the offered \nCAFE amendments, I must lend my support to the amendment offered by \nSenator Bond and Senator Levin. Under Bond-Levin, standards will be \nbased upon sound science and solid technical advice. Their amendment \nmandates that NHTSA experts set a new CAFE number considering jobs, \nsafety, technology, and other key factors.\n  The Bond-Levin amendment passed overwhelmingly last year. I do not \nthink much has changed. As a matter of fact, we are a little bit more \nsecure in terms of energy now. We are still using a lot, maybe more, \nbut the world is a little more secure in terms of oil dependence. The \namendment they have offered is what I would call a commonsense \namendment. It would not adversely affect employment, safety, or \nconsumer choice, but it would do the job.\n  Incidentally, the amendment is supported by the United Auto Workers, \nthe National Chamber of Commerce, the AFL-CIO, the Association of \nManufacturers, the Farm Bureau of America, and over 30 additional \nassociations.\n  When combined with the considerable tax incentives for advanced \nvehicle technology in the Finance Committee package, the Bond-Levin \namendment offers a sensible way to achieve fuel efficiency gains and to \nreduce our dependence on foreign oil. It does so in a way that would \nnot hurt the United States economy, increase vehicle cost to consumers, \nand cost American jobs or endanger lives.\n  I understand the distinguished Senator from Illinois has about 3 \nminutes, after which time we will start a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I understand I have 3 minutes to close the \ndebate, is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes and 45 seconds.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that a list of organizations \nsupporting the Durbin amendment, as well as a letter from Mr. Chuck \nFrank of Z. Frank, the world's largest Chevrolet dealer, who supports \nmy amendment, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             National Support for the Durbin CAFE Amendment\n\n       Cosponsors: Nelson (FL), Jeffords, Reed (RI), Reid (NV), \n     Kennedy, Boxer, Lautenberg.\n       Supporting Organizations: Sierra Club, Union of Concerned \n     Scientists, Natural Resources Defense Council, U.S. PIRG, \n     National Environmental Trust, Friends of the Earth, Public \n     Citizen, The Wilderness Society, Citizen Action Illinois.\n       Coalition on the Environment and Jewish Life, National \n     Council of Churches, Hadassah, the Women's Zionist \n     Organization of America, American Jewish Committee, Jewish \n     Council for Public Affairs, Union of American Hebrew \n     Congregations, Central Conference of American Rabbis, MoveOn, \n     Chesapeake Climate Action Network.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    July 24, 2003.\n     Hon. Richard Durbin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Durbin: I am writing in support of raising \n     fuel economy standards. I am the President of ``Z'' Frank \n     Chevrolet. I've sold well over 1,000,000 vehicles. My family \n     has been selling and leasing cars and trucks in Chicago since \n     1936. Before entering the family business in 1976, I \n     graduated from George Washington University and then the \n     University of Chicago Graduate School of Business. I have \n     been a Chevrolet dealer since 1982 and since then have also \n     held franchises from Oldsmobile, Hyundai, Mazda, Subaru and \n     Volkswagen.\n       I know the car business, and I know that car companies can, \n     and must, do better for the sake of our country.\n       I call on you to support the three CAFE related amendments \n     that are expected to be offered--the Durbin amendment, the \n     Kerry/McCain amendment and the Feinstein/Snowe amendment.\n       I support these amendments because I know that cars, SUVs \n     and other light trucks consume 8 million barrels of oil every \n     day and account for 20 percent of U.S. global warming \n     emissions. At a time when energy security is a national \n     priority, raising fuel economy standards will cut the \n     country's dangerous dependence on oil, curb global warming, \n     and save consumers money at the gas pump. Raising fuel \n     economy standards is the best way to manage our energy future \n     and encourage automakers to implement technologies that \n     already exist.\n       How do I know that the auto companies can make vehicles \n     that go further on a gallon of gas? Because they're already \n     doing it with a small number of vehicles!\n       Existing fuel-saving technologies like more efficient \n     engines, smarter transmissions, and sleeker aerodynamics are \n     being put in some vehicles, but they could be in all. Already \n     this year, we have seen a host of announcements showing that \n     all kinds of vehicles can get better fuel economy using \n     existing technology. For instance:\n       General Motors announced that it will be putting \n     Displacement on Demand technology in 100,000 Chevy \n     Trailblazers and GMC Envoys, helping improve the fuel economy \n     of these large SUVs. Continuously Variable Transmissions are \n     also gaining in popularity.\n       Hybrid-electric drivetrains are also becoming available in \n     a range of vehicles. At this year's Detroit Auto Show, Ford, \n     General Motors, and Toyota all announced that they will have \n     hybrid gasoline-electric SUVs on the road within two years \n     that will get close to 40 miles per gallon.\n       Toyota already has a hybrid gasoline-electric car on the \n     road, the Prius, and plans on having SUVs and more hybrid \n     cars as well. The Chevrolet Malibu will have a hybrid version \n     by 2005.\n       J.D. Power and Associates has forecasted that sales of \n     hybrid-electric vehicles will reach 500,000 within five \n     years.\n       It is not easy for me to be at odds with the manufacturer I \n     represent. Selling Chevrolets has been very financially \n     beneficial for me and my family. But the fact is, they can \n     and must do better. They can build cars, trucks and SUVs that \n     are safe, affordable, and exciting to drive, while still \n     going further on a gallon of gas. It's in the best interest \n     of our country to raise the fuel economy standards of our \n     cars and light trucks. Please feel free to share this letter \n     with others. I hope it helps.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Charles E. Frank,\n                                 President, ``Z'' Frank Chevrolet.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, when one lists all of the groups that \noppose\n\n[[Page S10114]]\n\nthis, on business and labor, frankly, we would have found the same \nopposition in 1975. Those are the same groups that were arguing it is \nphysically impossible for us to have more fuel-efficient cars. If they \nwould have had their way, we would still all be driving cars at 14 \nmiles a gallon or worse.\n  This Congress rejected those same groups and their positions 28 years \nago, but we have not done a thing since. As a result, the fuel \nefficiency of our cars and trucks has gone down. Is that in the best \ninterest of America? Is that as good as Congress can do, to abdicate \nour leadership and responsibility on something this essential?\n  I look at these automobile manufacturers--many of them are my friends \nand I have worked with them. Certainly, United Auto Workers has been \none of my strongest supporting organizations since I have been involved \nin politics, but I just disagree with them. I believe America can do \nbetter. I think if we challenge American business and labor to work \ntogether for more fuel-efficient vehicles, they can rise to the \nchallenge. But if we throw in the towel, as the Bond-Levin amendment \ndoes, then we know what is going to happen. We are going to continue to \nsee this situation get worse.\n  The Senator from New Mexico talks about the Landrieu amendment, and I \nvoted for it because it was a wonderful little message to include in \nthis bill, but it does not have any teeth. It has no enforcement. What \nit basically says to the President is we hope he will see the light, we \nhope he will lead the way, and if he does, we would sure like to help \nhim.\n  If that is the case, if that is all Congress is about, why do we have \nthis bill? Why do we not say to the President of the United States, why \ndoesn't he take care of the energy needs of America, and if he needs \nus, call us? Well, we do not say that. We say we accept our part of the \nresponsibility to pass reasonable laws based on sound science to make \nAmerica more energy secure.\n  I say to my colleagues, if we have an energy bill that does not \naddress the fuel efficiency of vehicles, we have ignored the most \nimportant energy and environmental issue that should be debated under \nthis bill. The special interests will have won the day again, as they \nfailed in 1975, and as a result we will continue to see dependence on \nforeign oil, more air pollution, and less energy security for America.\n  That is not what we should promise to further generations, and I urge \nmy colleagues to support my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 1384.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we are going to vote on this amendment, \nand then immediately following that, the next amendment will be the \nBond-Levin amendment, which will be preceded by 2 minutes of debate on \nthe part of Senator Durbin in opposition and Senator Bond in favor. So \nSenators should know we have one vote, with 4 minutes of debate \nfollowed by another vote. I ask unanimous consent that the second vote \nbe a 10-minute vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 1384.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Florida (Mr. Graham), the \nSenator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry), and the Senator from \nConnecticut (Mr. Lieberman) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``yea''.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 32, nays 65, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 309 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--32\n\n     Akaka\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Collins\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feinstein\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Kennedy\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Snowe\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--65\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Conrad\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Johnson\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Levin\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Pryor\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--3\n\n     Graham (FL)\n     Kerry\n     Lieberman\n  The amendment (No. 1384) was rejected.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 1386 As Amended and Modified\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, fellow Senators, if you will not \nleave, we will vote again very shortly. There are 4 minutes with 2 \nminutes on each side, and then we will vote on the Bond-Levin \namendment. The Senator from Illinois has the first 2 minutes and \nSenator Bond wraps it up. Then we will vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, under the unanimous consent agreement, I \nhave 2 minutes to speak in opposition to this amendment.\n  I understand some of my colleagues have offered this amendment in \ngood faith in an effort to address the issue. The amendment which was \njust defeated addressed the issue. It would have increased fuel \nefficiency of cars. This Bond-Levin amendment establishes additional \ncriteria for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to meet \nbefore they recommend and implement any increase in fuel efficiency.\n  What does this mean? Here are the existing standards that have to be \nmet with the passage of this amendment. We add all of these new \nstandards that have to be met. There are more hurdles to be cleared. It \nis an invitation for litigation because as the rules are announced \nthose who oppose them will be able to step forward and say: you didn't \nmeet this Bond-Levin criteria or you didn't meet this one. It just \nmeans further delay.\n  We know what NHTSA has done on its own. It has increased fuel \nefficiency by 1.5 miles per gallon in a span of 18 years. This is false \nhope. This is a figleaf for those who just voted no and say they want \nto vote yes. I encourage my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I yield to the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, our amendment will increase full \nefficiency but in positive ways by giving incentives to purchase \nvehicles, by having the Government buy the vehicles which are leaps \nahead in technology, and by having the Government be more involved in \njoint research and development. By the way, we don't add criteria which \nmust be met. We add criteria which we want the Department of \nTransportation to consider.\n  Is there anyone who doesn't want the Department of Transportation to \nconsider--consider--technological feasibility or safety or economic \npracticability or the effect on jobs?\n  These are not hurdles which must be jumped. These are simply relevant \nfacts which we want NHTSA to consider. For the life of me, I cannot \nunderstand why all of us would not want NHTSA to consider those \nrelevant facts.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators\n\n[[Page S10115]]\n\nBunning, Voinovich, and Nickles be added as cosponsors.\n  I thank my colleagues for a very strong vote. With the Senator from \nMichigan and other cosponsors, we ask for your support of this measure.\n  As I indicated in my earlier remarks, there is strong support by the \nUnited Auto Workers which believes, as I do, and which I hope a vast \nmajority of this body does, that we can move forward to make progress \nthat is economically feasible to assure better fuel economy while not \nsacrificing safety and not sacrificing jobs but making it clear that we \nare going to use the technology to build on the most significant \nadvance in fuel economy in 20 years that the National Highway Traffic \nSafety Administration has just promulgated for light trucks.\n  Let us continue to move forward with CAFE based on sound science and \nnot political numbers. I urge my colleagues to support the Bond-Levin \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Missouri has \nexpired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.

The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, if I may have the attention of \nSenators, please, there are two amendments. One is a Durbin amendment, \nwhich Senator Durbin indicated when he sent it to the desk was sent up \nby mistake. It is a so-called Durbin No. 2 tax amendment. He said, \nthen, that he would like to withdraw it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that he be permitted to withdraw that \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Objection. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico retains the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I move to table the Durbin amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll to ascertain the \npresence of a quorum.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The motion to table has been made.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Parliamentary inquiry: Is a motion to set aside the \nDurbin tax amendment the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has made a motion to table the \nDurbin amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. A motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That motion is not debatable.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let's go.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the motion \nbe withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That having been done, I move to set the amendment \naside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The amendment is withdrawn?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to table has been withdrawn.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The amendment is still pending. I move to set the \namendment of Senator Durbin aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I want to set both amendments aside so that I can \nproceed with another amendment. I ask unanimous consent that the Durbin \namendment be set aside and that the Campbell amendment be set aside so \nthat we may proceed with the electricity amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, \nbut I publicly express my appreciation to the Senator from Washington, \nMs. Cantwell, who has some very strong concerns that she hopes to \nexpress once we get on the electricity title. She has several \namendments. I have asked the distinguished manager if it would be his \nintention to allow the Senator from Washington to offer some of these \namendments tonight. It is my understanding--and he can confirm this--\nthat he is prepared to allow the Senator from Washington to offer these \namendments tonight. I know that the distinguished ranking member, the \nSenator from New Mexico, also has an amendment he is prepared to offer. \nSo it is with that understanding that the ranking member and the \nSenator from Washington will have amendments, and that the Senator from \nWashington will be recognized to offer those amendments. We do not \nobject now to moving to the electricity title and setting aside the \namendments that have been pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank Senator Cantwell for her cooperation. First, I \nassure her that what we have just done in no way jeopardizes her rights \nto offer amendments. She has not only one but maybe a number of \namendments she wants to offer to the so-called electricity provisions. \nThat will be offered next, and clearly we are going to be on it until \nSenators have no more amendments. So we are going to be here long \nenough for the amendments of Senator Cantwell to be offered, whatever \nthey are and however many there are.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1412\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I send the electricity amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], for himself, \n     Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Thomas, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Campbell, Mr. \n     Smith, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. \n     Hagel, Mr. Talent, Mr. Bunning, and Mr. Coleman, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1412.\n\n\n[[Page S10116]]\n\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text \nof Amendments.'')\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The electricity amendment pending at the desk has 13 \ncosponsors. I thank the cosponsors, Senator Landrieu, Senator Thomas, \nSenator Murkowski, Senator Campbell, Senator Smith, Senator Alexander, \nSenator Kyl, Senator Nelson of Nebraska, Senator Hagel, Senator Talent, \nSenator Bunning, and Senator Coleman.\n  I have a very brief statement, and I trust Senators will listen. It \nis to the point. We will be on this until there are no more amendments \nto offer to this title.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator from New Mexico yield for a question?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will be pleased to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I wanted to make the point and ask the \nquestion on the electricity title. The Senator from New Mexico \nindicated that all amendments would be available to be offered, and I \nappreciate that. This title, of course, is somewhat controversial.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The question of protection for consumers is very \nimportant. It is a very complicated title. I hope everyone in the \nSenate wants to plug the holes that existed with respect to some of the \nprevious price manipulations that went on, on the west coast. My hope \nis that it is not just a case of allowing people to offer amendments \nbut to have the staffs on both sides to actively work together so that \nwe understand these provisions and actually plug the holes that exist \nthat failed to protect consumers on the west coast in the last couple \nof years.\n  I know that is what the Senator would like to have happen. I know we \nhave people on this side who want that to happen. I hope we can work \ntogether to make sure we understand it and then fix it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I can guarantee Senators that the \nSenator from New Mexico has worked for the last 7 months on this bill. \nThe electricity amendment is a compromise supported by a broad array of \nstakeholders, much broader than I ever would have thought when I \nassumed the chairmanship of this committee. I believe that, per se, \nassumes that this amendment plugs all the so-called loopholes so there \nwill not be any Enron end runs.\n  I repledge that I will work with any Senator who has an amendment \nthat they think improves upon this bill. That does not mean, however, \nthat every amendment that comes along, that says it makes this bill \nbetter, is going to be one that this Senator accepts. I do not want to \nreturn to the regulation of PUHCA as a way of protecting the consumers. \nQuite to the contrary. I believe its day has come. It has served its \npurpose.\n  There are a number of letters of support for this electricity \namendment which I am offering. Let me start with the administration. \nThey say they support the substitute electricity amendment and believe \nit will effectively modernize our Nation's antiquated electricity laws.\n  The National Rural Electric Cooperative Association:\n\n       Supports passage of the carefully crafted Domenici \n     amendment without modification.\n\n  The American Public Power Association:\n\n       Strongly supports the compromise in its totality without \n     modification.\n\n  The Large Public Power Council:\n\n       Supports the electricity substitute without modification.\n\n  Electric utility companies such as Mid-America, Allegheny, and Xcel, \nhave offered their support for the Domenici electricity amendment, and \nI have now told my colleagues that it is supported by 13 Senators.\n  Because it is bipartisan, we might call it the Domenici-Landrieu \namendment. For those who claim we need a balanced energy policy, here \nis a balanced electric title with wide support that needs to be \nincluded in our final bill. Some would add changes to it, and we are \nwilling to look at them, but those who understand the complexities of \nthe issues known as the Domenici electricity amendment know it \nrepresents a fair common ground. That is why there is support for this \namendment without modification.\n\n  I know there will be a number of second-degree amendments, and I am \nwilling to look at them. I have already said I am willing to look \nspecifically at amendments from the distinguished Senator from \nWashington, Ms. Cantwell. I will look at them carefully. I understand \nthe significance of the problem she confronts. I do not support any \namendments yet, and obviously if they disturb the delicate and \nsometimes gentle balance in this bill, I will have to oppose them. I \nwill look with genuine interest, with the best talent I have, at \namendments that Senators have if they think they really address the \nissues that have beset this country over the past 25, 26 months in \nterms of natural gas, utility prices, and utility companies and their \nshenanigans, such as at Enron.\n  The amendment is now pending. I am very proud of it, and I am pleased \nto be at this point. I thank the Chair for recognition, and I thank the \nSenate for paying attention. We are going to be open to amendments, and \nI understand my friend and colleague from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman, \nwill probably have an amendment shortly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1413 to Amendment No. 1412\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I send the amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1413.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To strengthen the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's \n              authority to review public utility mergers)\n\n       On page 41, after line 17, strike all that follows through \n     page 43 line 10, and insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   .

The amendment Senator Domenici has now offered is a \nsubstitute for the entire electricity title of the Energy bill. It \npurports to contain consumer protections in order to compensate for the \nfact that in this bill we are also proposing to repeal PUHCA. What is \nPUHCA? That is the Public Utility Holding Company Act.\n  I have to agree the substitute amendment Senator Domenici has \nprovided does contain some increase in the authority the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission will have to review mergers and dispositions; \nthat is, some increase in the authority of FERC to review mergers and \nacquisitions compared to the previous bill. I also concluded the \nsubstitute does not do enough to solve the problem.\n  The amendment I am offering contains the language we passed in last \nyear's Senate Energy bill, language we believe fills this inadequacy, \nsolves this problem in the underlying provision. Not only did the \namendment pass the Senate last year, there was an amendment that would \nhave removed this language. That amendment lost in the Senate by a vote \nof 67-29. Forty Senators voted for much stronger merger review \nauthority than the provision contains.\n  FERC's merger review authority is essential in this industry which \nhas been based on a system of local and regional monopolies. It is \nessential that authority be vested in FERC. The industry we are talking \nabout historically has been based on local and regional monopolies and \nis moving toward depending much more on a competitive wholesale market \nfor electricity generation. The industry is highly concentrated. \nConsolidation of generation and distribution transmission can prevent \nthe development of a genuinely competitive market.\n  There are two big problems in the substitute provision Senator \nDomenici has provided with relation to merger and acquisition \nauthority. Let me try to explain those.\n  First, this proposal does not cover the generation of energy. \nEveryone understands there are various parts to the energy industry. \nThere are generation companies involved in generation, there are those \ninvolved in transmission, those that are involved in distribution, and \nsome that are involved in all. However, generation is not covered under \nthis language.\n  The second big problem is there are no real protections against \ncross-subsidies or encumbrance of assets owned by utilities. That \nraises a real prospect that people who pay utility bills will wind up \nsubsidizing nonprofitable, unprofitable ventures that companies get \ninto, particularly in the case where there are holding companies \ninvolved.\n  Let me talk about each of these issues. The first key failure I have \ntalked about in the Domenici substitute is it does not make generation \nacquisitions or dispositions jurisdictional under the law. That means \nit does not give FERC authority over those. There is no requirement \nanyone oversee it at the Federal level and sign off on it.\n  For generation mergers, while it is true most activities in this area \nare divestiture of generation by vertically integrated utilities at \nthis time, that may not always be the case. Utilities getting rid of \ngeneration do tend toward deconcentration of the market but not if they \nsell to large and growing generation companies. Instead of leading to \nless concentration, it can lead to more concentration, depending upon \nwho is buying these generation facilities.\n  Without the authority provided in my amendment, FERC, which is \ncharged with making sure the competitive market produces just and \nreasonable rates, would have to stand by and watch while the industry \nreconcentrates rather than deconcentrates. A single company could \nacquire every generator in this country and FERC could do nothing about \nit under the Domenici substitute. This is not compatible with the \ndevelopment of a competitive market. Even when the transaction is only \nthe sale of generation facilities, there are serious issues at stake.\n  Many of the utilities in the headlines lately because they are either \nfacing bankruptcy or have deep financial troubles have come as a result \nof the utility spinning off its generation to an affiliate who then \ngets into the unregulated electricity market. As a result, there are \ncompanies such as Xcel and Allegany that are experiencing serious \nfinancial distress because of the activities of their generation and \nmarketing affiliates, but these affiliates are not under the \njurisdiction of the FERC, so there will be no Federal oversight.\n  The second failure in the Domenici substitute is it does not require \nthe FERC to create real protection against cross-subsidy or against \nencumbrance of assets in the new merged company. My amendment \nstrengthens the standards under which FERC reviews mergers. Our \nprovision requires the transactions can be shown to do no harm, either \nto competition, to consumers, or to the capacity of regulators to \nregulate. Further, it requires that FERC determine there will not be \nany cross-subsidy of affiliate companies and there will not be any \nencumbrance of assets for the benefits of the affiliate. This is \nessential if we are going to protect ratepayers. We did not allow that \ncross-subsidy to exist. The underlying Domenici amendment does not \nrequire that of the Federal Regulatory Commission.\n  Essentially, our provision requires that FERC create some way to \ndetermine the goals of the requirement be met. Perhaps the only way to \naccomplish this is to create real corporate insulation between the \nutility affiliate of a holding company and its unregulated affiliates. \nThat could be done by creating firewalls around the utility affiliate, \nby enacting rules about transactions between affiliates or in a \ncombination of the two.\n  The purposes behind the Public Utility Holding Company Act which we \nare ready to repeal as part of this overall Energy bill are to ensure \nconsumers are not harmed by the complexity of corporate structure, that \nregulation not be made too difficult by that complexity, and that \nutility affiliates not be allowed to benefit from cross-subsidization \nor to cross-subsidize nonutility affiliates so that resources of the \nutility wind up being drained away from service to the customers. This \nis exactly what the bill requires FERC to do before approving a merger. \nThat is what our amendment requires FERC to ensure before approving a \nmerger.\n  I have three charts that will try to make this clearer. This is \ncomplex. Frankly, one of the difficulties of trying to begin in the \nevening at 6 p.m. with this very difficult, complex subject, there is \nan awful lot of knowledge Senators need to have in order to vote \nintelligently on these issues. Let me try to go through it with the \ncharts.\n  The first chart is FERC jurisdiction at the present time. The Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission, FERC, has jurisdiction over mergers of \ntwo different utilities. We are talking about, under the Federal Power \nAct, utilities that are vertically integrated. That is the traditional \nutility, the utility that provides electricity to my home in New \nMexico, provides electricity to my home in Washington, DC, and to homes \nall around this country. Utilities own the generation capacity, own the \ntransmission, and own the distribution. If two utilities want to merge, \nthey have to present their proposal to merge to the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \nlooks at that and says this is OK or this is not OK because we have \ndetermined it is not going to adversely affect the ratepayers. The \npeople at home who are being served by one or the other of these \nutilities will not have to pay more if we approve this\n\n[[Page S10118]]\n\nmerger. That is what FERC has to determine at this point.\n\n  In the past, all generation was owned by jurisdictional utility \ncompanies. This is the way the system was operated. If you had a plant \nto generate power, almost certainly that plant was owned by a utility \ncompany. There were no independent companies out there saying all we \nwant to do is generate power and then we will sell it to utilities. It \nwas all owned by utilities. If a utility merged with another utility, \nthe merger was jurisdictional at FERC under the Federal Power Act. That \nmeans that FERC had to sign off on the deal, essentially, and that was \nthe protection that was built into the law for consumers.\n  Since all generation except for small renewable generators and \ncogenerators under the Public Utility Regulatory Policy Act was owned \nby utilities that were, in fact, under FERC jurisdiction, all mergers \ninvolving generation came under the jurisdiction of FERC.\n  That was a good system as far as it went, but that was the system \nwhich made sense when the Federal Power Act was enacted because then we \nwere dealing with vertically integrated utilities.\n  The world has changed, so let me go to chart No. 2.\n  Before I talk about the changed world, let me describe this second \nchart. The title of this chart is ``PUHCA Jurisdiction.'' I said \nbefore, PUHCA is the Public Utility Holding Company Act, and the Public \nUtility Holding Company Act provides essentially a set of restrictions \non what holding companies are able to do, and particularly what holding \ncompanies are able to do with regard to purchase or acquisition of \nutilities. If a holding company acquired a utility company, then the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission under PUHCA, the Public Utility \nHolding Company Act, had jurisdiction and authority to review that \nacquisition. The relationships between the utility and all of its new \naffiliates were governed by the Public Utility Holding Company Act.\n  The proposal we have here before us in the Senate is let's repeal \nthis entire thing. All of the restrictions under which holding \ncompanies operate today would no longer apply. The question is, If we \ndo that, what are we going to substitute for that jurisdiction or for \nthat oversight to ensure that consumers are not adversely affected? \nThis shows the holding company over here on the right, and under it you \nsee it owns a utility, it owns other affiliates, it owns perhaps \nanother utility, generation and marketing affiliate--it has a variety \nof companies it holds as a holding company. The question is, Who is \ngoing to have the responsibility to be sure there will not be cross-\nsubsidy so that ratepayers of utilities are not adversely affected if \nwe eliminate the Public Utility Holding Company Act?\n  Let me move to the third chart to try to explain this. In the new \nworld in which we now find ourselves, we no longer have as many \nvertically integrated utility companies. More and more we are seeing \ngeneration of electric power done by other companies which are not \nvertically integrated utilities. In this new world, generation is \nseparated from the utility company, and it is either sold to a stand-\nalone generation company or spun off as an affiliate of a holding \ncompany that owns a utility. The sales or the spinoff would not be \nunder FERC jurisdiction under the Federal Power Act, since generation \nfacilities were not specifically put under FERC's authority. Generation \nfacilities wound up under FERC's authority because they were part of \nintegrated utilities. Now we are saying: OK, what do we put in place to \nlive with this new world?\n\n  We are saying we need to specify that generation facilities are under \nFERC authority. They clearly would not be covered--there is no \njurisdiction under FERC for the generation affiliate down below, or the \ngeneration affiliate of this utility. If those generation affiliates \ndecide to merge, there is no prohibition against that. There is no \nrequirement that any Federal agency review that to see whether it helps \nor hurts utility payers, ratepayers.\n  We get back to the point I was trying to make at the very beginning \nof my comments, which is you could see a company come along and buy up \nthis generation affiliate, that generation affiliate, buy up all the \ngeneration affiliates in a region of the country, and do whatever it \nwished with regard to their rates for electricity, and nobody at the \nFederal level has oversight to review that.\n  I do not think that is in the best interests of consumers. I do not \nthink that is in the best interests of ratepayers. Accordingly, I think \nwe should fix it.\n  There are some horror stories that should make the point that what I \nam talking about is not just academic. This isn't something we dreamed \nup in some ivory tower somewhere. These are horror stories that can be \nread about in the mainstream press, in the trade press; in fact, it is \nhard to pick up a news publication that does not tell a new story about \nhow some utility or other is in trouble because of its investments in \nand involvement in nonutility businesses. That is a very common problem \nthat has arisen.\n  This is a quote from the December Wall Street Journal.\n\n       Energy companies burned by disastrous forays into \n     commodities trading and other unregulated businesses are \n     increasingly seeking to pass some of the financial burden \n     onto their utility units. This could lead to higher \n     electricity rates for consumers in coming years.\n\n  That is the Wall Street Journal, which is not a left-wing \npublication. According to the Journal:\n\n       Utilities are being nudged to buy assets from affiliates, \n     to make loans to down-at-the-heels siblings, or to pass more \n     money to their parent companies.\n\n  Then the story goes on to say:\n\n       In many cases, regulators can do little to prevent energy \n     holding companies from milking their utility units.\n\n  What my amendment is trying to do is put in place some protections \nagainst this milking of utility units. When you talk about milking a \nutility unit, that is easily translated into raising electricity rates, \nraising the rates of the ratepayers in order to compensate for bad \nbusiness judgments, unprofitable investments in other areas.\n  It is not enough for us to have in place some vague idea that we want \nto be helpful to consumers. What we want to say is the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission needs to make a finding when it approves one of \nthese acquisitions or mergers. It needs to make a finding that there is \nnot going to be a cross-subsidy, that we are not going to see the \nassets of the utility encumbered in order to help some other part of \nthis business, some other part of this holding company. That is what we \nare saying.\n  All of these stories result in negative effects on ratepayers and \nconsumers.\n  When the utility is downgraded, its consumers pay increased costs of \ncapital. Where the utility itself is facing bankruptcy, the effects on \nconsumers can be even worse than that.\n  Wesstar is one example. Wesstar's regulators have been left with the \nunpleasant alternative of saddling the utility's ratepayers with $100 \nmillion per year, which is the cost that is required to pay down the \ndebt the company caused by its investment in unregulated ventures.\n  It is clear that utility customers need to be protected against these \nexcesses; that firewalls need to be built between the utility \naffiliates of a holding company and its unregulated affiliates.\n  These are not stories from the distant past. These are stories from \ntoday's headlines. Let me go into a little more detail on a few of \nthem. Let me mention Wesstar. Wesstar I just mentioned. Let me go into \na little more detail about the problem.\n  Wesstar is the largest utility in the State of Kansas. It is owned by \na holding company, WRI, that also owns KP, the other large utility in \nthe State. It owns a variety of nonutility companies and holdings. All \nof these together used to be the Kansas City Power and Light and Kansas \nGas and Electric.\n  Wesstar came under scrutiny last year because of its problems caused \nby nonutility affiliates. Wesstar had invested in a number of \nunregulated ventures, including a home security company. That \ninvestment did not turn out well. The holding company shifted $1.5 \nbillion of debt from the unregulated companies to the utility.\n  The Kansas Corporation Commission began an investigation. The Justice \nDepartment began an investigation last summer. The Federal \ninvestigation\n\n[[Page S10119]]\n\nresulted in the indictment of the CEO of the company for bank fraud. \nThe Kansas Corporation Commission investigation resulted in a dramatic \nrestructuring of the company to separate the utility from the \nunregulated companies of the holding company.\n  The utility customers, in spite of all that has since happened--these \ninvestigations occurred after the fact--are still left with an \nobligation to reduce the debt of the utility by $100 million a year \nbecause of the activities of the unregulated affiliates. Ratings \nagencies have reduced the debt rating of the company to below \ninvestment grade at this time. That is one example.\n  Let me mention another. AES is a holding company that owns generation \nassets and marketing assets around the world. In 2000, AES acquired \nIndiana Power and Light, which is a regulated utility in Indiana. \nBecause of the difficulties in wholesale electricity markets, the \nutility has been propping up the debt of the parent company over the \nlast 2 years. For the 2 years of 2000 and 2001, the utility's dividend \npayments to the parent exceeded its earnings by over $100 million. The \nparent company's rating has dropped from AA minus to double B since \n2001. The utility's IPL is at the lowest investment grade. The Indiana \nUtility Regulatory Commission had no jurisdiction to review the \nacquisition of the utility by the holding company.\n  Let me give one more example. That is Portland General Electric. \nPortland General Electric is a regulated utility in Oregon. PG in the \nlate 1990s was acquired by Enron Corporation. The Oregon Public Utility \nCommission required a number of conditions before it agreed to approve \nthat acquisition. As a result of the corporate separation required by \nthe public utility commission, the effect of Enron's bankruptcy has \nbeen less than other similar acquisitions in other States. But even so, \nPG is now a parentless company. It is in danger of being taken over \nby another company. The fate of the parent company has also had an \neffect on the ability of the company to gain access to capital markets.\n\n  I think the Senators from Oregon are probably better qualified than I \nto talk in detail about the frustration and dissatisfaction that \nutility ratepayers in Oregon have felt as a result of their unfortunate \ncircumstance after being purchased by Enron.\n  The amendment I have offered is straightforward. In my view, it \ncloses a very significant loophole that still exists in the electricity \ntitle and substitute electricity title Senator Domenici has presented \nto the Senate. It will help us head off the kinds of crises and the \nkinds of inflation or dramatic increase in utility rates that \nunfortunately have been seen in some parts of the country.\n  This is one of these issues where I think 2, 3, or 5 years from now \npeople may look back and say, I wonder why I didn't vote for that \namendment when we had a chance to plug that loophole. Those of us on \nthe Energy Committee, quite frankly, will be saying, OK, who do we call \nbefore the Senate Energy Committee to hold accountable when these \nproblems arise? The reality is it is going to be very hard to call \nanyone before the Senate Energy Committee unless we strengthen this \nlegislation and put in there some very clear, bright-line tests that \nensure we don't have crossover, to ensure the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission is held responsible for overseeing the acquisition, sale, or \npurchase of generation facilities. If we make a decision here to not \nvest that responsibility somewhere in the Federal Government--and \nobviously the place to do it would be the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission--then I think we will rue the day we stopped short of doing \nthat.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this amendment. It goes to the very \nheart of the electricity title of this bill. It would correct a very \nmajor deficiency in the electricity title of the bill as it now comes \nbefore the Senate.\n  I yield the floor. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, let me say, first of all, I am happy we \nare moving forward with this amendment. This, of course, is a total \neffort to take last year's activities with relation to the electric \ntitle in the Energy bill and to redo it. Actually, we have been through \nthis same argument before and we came up with a different \nrecommendation.\n  What we are seeking to do is cause our electric industry to be in a \nmore modern status; to make changes in law and policy that reflect \nchanges that have taken place and are taking place now in the energy \nindustry.\n  What we are trying to do here is deal with the Public Utility \nRegulatory Policy Act of 1935. We have, of course, a Federal policy \nthat has been in place for almost 65 years. The Public Utility \nRegulatory Policy Act is an outdated statute that imposes barriers to \ncompetition and discourages investment in transmission.\n  This is key. What we are seeking to do here is to modernize this \nsystem so that because of the changes that have already taken place, \nfor instance, 30 percent now the power being generated by merchant \ngenerators who do not do their distribution, then there has to be an \nopportunity to have transmission lines. The investment in those is very \nhigh, and we have to make some changes in terms of how capital is \ncreated to be able to do that.\n  PUHCA limits geographic and product diversification and imposes many \nburdensome filing requirements. We are seeking, again, to see if we \ncan't make these rules and these laws more simplified without having \nthe expense of going through all these things. PUHCA is also a barrier \nto the formation of regional energy markets because arguably it could \napply to the RTOs, the regional transmission organizations. This is \nagain where we are moving. This is where we need to be.\n  What we are seeking to do with this amendment is have the rules that \napplied since 1935 to an electric industry that is here in 2005, \nalmost. So we are moving backward in a situation which we are seeking \nto modernize. That is really what it is all about. Repealing PUHCA \nwould not preclude State and Federal regulators from protecting \nratepayers. We have an apparatus in place in Government to do that.\n  Access to books and records as well as rules regarding debt \nacquisition and accounting will protect investments on behalf of \nratepayers. Also the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade \nCommission will continue to protect against antitrust violations.\n  The Securities and Exchange Commission, which currently overseas \nPUHCA, has recommended on a number of occasions that PUHCA be repealed \nwith certain consumer protections transferred to FERC and State \nregulatory commissions, as noted.\n  Certainly there will be market transparency. There will be \nantimanipulation and enforcement in place. There will be rules issued \nto establish a system to do that. It prohibits the filing of false \ninformation regarding the price of wholesale electricity and \navailability of transmission capacity. It prohibits round-trip trading \nwhich was mentioned as the reason for making this change. It prohibits \nround-trip trading. It expands who can file complaints and who is \nsubject to FERC investigation. It increases the penalties.\n  I guess the point is that there is substantial consumer protection in \nplace. That is basically what we are seeking to do.\n  I rise in opposition to the pending amendment which proposes to \nexpand the FERC's merger review authority to include acquisition of \ngenerating facilities. Under the current law, electric utility mergers \nare already heavily regulated. In addition, FERC, the Department of \nJustice, and the Federal Trade Commission must review proposed mergers \nfor their impact on competition. State regulators in affected States \nalso review proposed mergers. Expanding FERC's authority to cover \nacquisition of generation facilities is unnecessary. Furthermore, this \namendment preempts the States' ability to protect consumers.\n  The Bingaman amendment requires FERC to review and approve any \nutility acquisition of a generation asset in excess of $10 million. \nEvery time a utility wants to replace a major boil or steam turbine or \ninstall a new switchyard, they have to get approval. What does that \nhave to do with protecting competition which is the reason why FERC \nneeds the authority? Absolutely nothing.\n  Let me explain why this amendment is unnecessary to protect \nconsumers.\n\n[[Page S10120]]\n\nUnder existing law, FERC has jurisdiction over wholesale power rates \nand States have jurisdiction over retail electric rates. That means \nthat an electric utility cannot pass through to consumers, either in \nwholesale electric rates or in retail electric rates, any cost without \nfirst having obtained FERC or other State public utility commission \nauthorization to do so. So a utility that purchases a new boiler--\nwhether it is $1 million or $100 million--cannot pass through these \ncosts without having to prove to the relevant regulator that the \nexpenditure was prudent.\n  If the regulator decides the expenditure is not prudent, then the \nutility cannot pass through the costs, and they are borne by the \nutility's stockholders and not its customers. That is good consumer \nprotection practice.\n  Let me explain why the pending amendment would actually interfere \nwith State protection of consumers. Under existing Supreme Court \ndoctrine, States may not deny the pass through of federally approved \ncosts. The Supreme Court recently reiterated this principle just this \nsummer in a June 2, 2003, decision, Entergy Louisiana versus Louisiana \nPublic Service Commission. The Supreme Court held that FERC approved \nrates could not be second-guessed by State regulators. Accordingly, if, \nas the pending amendment proposes, we require FERC to approve and \nreview utility acquisitions of powerplant utilities used for system \nsupply to make retail sales, we are preempting the ability of a State \npublic utility commission to review and approve--or deny--the utility's \nincurrence of those costs.\n  I ask, why should we deny the State public utility commissions the \nability to review utility costs that are being passed through in retail \nrates? How does that protect consumers? Will the FERC do a better job \nthan our State commissions?\n  This amendment is both unnecessary and unproductive. FERC will \ncontinue to review utility mergers to ensure that it is consistent with \nthe public interest and will review proposed rates for the merged \ncompanies to ensure they are just and reasonable. That is FERC's \nappropriate role and we do not need to change it.\n  Increasing FERC's merger authority to include generation-only \nfacilities will only serve to impede efficient transactions without \ngaining consumer benefits.\n  For these reasons, I think we should oppose the amendment, and I urge \nthat we oppose the amendment.\n  Again, in general terms, what we have done is packaged in this whole \ntitle, this electric title, the idea of what is happening in the \nelectric system, where we want to be over time, a policy that will work \nin what is currently going on and what we hope to have happen in the \nfuture. To maintain and continue to go backward does not seem what we \nare appropriately here to do.\n  We have gone through this whole thing. We have gone through witnesses \nin our committee. It has been approved. Certainly we ought to move \nforward with this package as it is conceived and dedicated, and we can \nimprove the way we provide electric energy to everyone. But we have to \ncontinue to look forward and do things differently than we have done \nthem in the past.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me make a few comments in response \nto my colleague, my good friend from Wyoming. I do think that he is in \nan awkward position because he was cosponsor with me of this exact \nlanguage in the consideration of the Energy bill in the last Congress--\nthe exact language that I am now proposing by way of amendment. I \nthought it was the right policy then. I still think it is the right \npolicy. I hope very much we can persuade Senators to adopt it as part \nof this bill.\n  His statement was that we are preempting State authority if we adopt \nthe language that I have offered by way of amendment. The National \nAssociation of Regulatory Utility Commissioners--those are the State \ncommissioners--characterized the bill we had last year that had this \nprovision in it, the provision I am now offering, as ``an admirable \ncompromise between Federal and State jurisdictional issues.''\n  That does not sound like the words of an entity that believes it has \nbeen preempted to the point that it is unable to do its job. While it \nis true that States have some ability to deal with some of these \nproblems, it is almost always the case that their statutes do not \nreflect the degree of protection that is currently in the law in the \nPublic Utility Holding Company Act. They have not needed to have laws \nto provide those protections because PUHCA was in place. It has been \nFederal law for many years.\n  It is also true that many States that have found their customers to \nbe victims of such abuse have not had the ability to deal with the \nproblems. I gave you a couple of examples before where the States came \nalong after the fact and tried to investigate, tried to find some way \nto make their consumers or their ratepayers whole, and found that they \nare not really able to do that. Some are trying. Some are trying in the \nface of tremendous opposition from their utilities to get the necessary \nauthority from their State legislatures.\n  Do we have to wait for every State in the country to realize that \ntheir protections are inadequate once we repeal the Public Utility \nHolding Company Act or should we not here in the Congress provide at \nleast some minimum protection at the Federal level to replace the \nprotections we are eliminating as we repeal the Public Utility Holding \nCompany Act?\n  I think we owe it to those who sent us here to provide this minimal \nprotection. PUHCA broke up the industry into manageable chunks and \nfocused on its core business--that is, the provision of a monopoly \nelectric provision service by requiring that utilities either operate \nprimarily in a single State or be regulated stringently at the Federal \nlevel by the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n  Utilities were also forbidden to engage in businesses that were not \ndirectly related to their monopoly electric service without explicit \napproval from the SEC. Large utilities were forbidden from such \nactivities completely. A holding could not acquire more than one \nutility company in more than one State without coming under these very \nsevere bans.\n  So the sprawling empires of interconnected corporations owning \nelectricity utilities were broken up. Companies were required to choose \nbetween their other businesses--staying in those other businesses or \nstaying in the electric industry.\n  If we are going to repeal the Public Utility Holding Company Act, as \nwe are proposing to do in this bill, then it is essential that we lodge \nthe consumer protections that are so important to all Americans in a \nmeaningful place. We have seen, over the last few years, how far astray \nfrom the goals of providing electricity to consumers at affordable \nprices our industry can wander. As we move forward, we must be sure \nthat consumers are protected.\n  Let me make a comparison between the language that I proposed by way \nof amendment and the underlying language. The reason I am offering my \namendment is that the Domenici substitute has in it, in my view, very \ninadequate language to ensure that consumers are protected. It says:\n\n       After notice and opportunity for a hearing, the Commission \n     shall approve the proposed disposition, consolidation, \n     acquisition, or change of control--\n\n  That is any merger or acquisition anyone proposes and brings before \nthe commission--\n\n     if it finds that the proposed transaction will be consistent \n     with the public interest.\n\n  Well, that is fine. I certainly want everything to be consistent with \nthe public interest. But that is somewhat in the eye of the beholder as \nto what is meant by that phrase. It goes on to say:\n\n       In evaluating whether a transaction will be consistent with \n     the public interest, the Commission shall consider whether \n     the proposed transaction will adequately protect consumers, \n     will be consistent with the competitive wholesale markets, \n     will not impair the ability of the Commission or State \n     commission from having jurisdiction following the completion \n     of their transaction over any public utility, and will not \n     impair the financial integrity of any public utility that is \n     a party to the transaction, or an associate company or any \n     part of the transaction, and satisfies such other criteria as \n     they think is consistent with the public interest.\n\n  Essentially, it is going back and saying the Commission has \ntremendous\n\n[[Page S10121]]\n\nauthority to decide what is consistent with the public interest and \nwhat is not consistent with public interest. Whatever they decide \npretty much controls.\n  What I have proposed in the amendment that I have sent to the desk, \nand what we had in our bill last year, which my good friend from \nWyoming supported last year, was much more specific. It said:\n\n       After notice and opportunity for a hearing, the Commission \n     shall approve the disposition, or consolidation, or \n     acquisition of control if it finds that the proposed \n     transaction, No. 1, will be consistent with the public \n     interest; second, will not adversely affect interests of \n     consumers of electric energy; third, will not impair the \n     ability of the Commission or the State Commission; and, \n     finally, will not lead to cross subsidization of associate \n     companies or encumber any utility assets for the benefit of \n     an associate company.\n\n  It seems clear to me that we should want to be sure that cross-\nsubsidy will not occur. That is a bedrock requirement, as I see it, if \nFERC is going to sign off on these acquisitions and mergers. That is \nwhy we proposed this amendment.\n  The other thing we propose in this amendment, which I think is also \nbedrock, is that companies involved with generation--the purchase and \nsale of those companies should also be under the jurisdiction of the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission. The FERC has not had to have that \nauthority up until now because we have had the Public Utility Holding \nCompany Act, which ensured there was oversight. There was regulation of \nthose generation companies. That will no longer be the case once the \nPublic Utility Holding Company Act is repealed.\n  The question is, Who is going to oversee the purchase and sale of \ngeneration companies? Who is going to try to ensure that electric \nutility rates in a region, in a State, in a particular area do not go \nup because of the noncompetitive merger, or acquisition, or purchase of \nvarious generation facilities?\n  So, clearly, our amendment tries to plug some major loopholes. It is \nexactly the language we offered in the debate last year. It was adopted \nat that time by a substantial majority of Senators. It was supported by \nmy good friend from Wyoming last year. It is good policy. It was good \npolicy then, it is good policy now, and it is the kind of test which, \nif we don't adopt it, we will regret that we did not. It is another one \nof these circumstances where at some future date we will be giving \nspeeches on the Senate floor saying let's tighten up the regulation, \nstrengthen the regulation; we don't want to see somewhere around the \ncountry any more of those problems like we just saw.\n  I think the opportunity is here today. We know enough about the \nproblem of cross-subsidization. We know enough about the economic \ndifficulties, the financial difficulties that lead to cross-\nsubsidization to anticipate this problem and to get ahead of it and \ndeal with it. That is what my amendment does. I urge adoption of my \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Domenici, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first, I congratulate my colleague from \nNew Mexico on his superb argument and presentation. I regret that I \nhave to disagree. But before I state a few remarks, because I believe \nmy friend from Wyoming has done a very good job of telling the Senate \nwhy we don't need this amendment, I would like to ask the Senate and \nall the Senators and their staffs, who were paying attention on their \nbehalf, to remember now that we are on that very important part of this \nlegislation--the electricity section--which we understood many Senators \nwere worried about, and we understood a number of Senators had \namendments.\n  I have known from the beginning that my friend, Senator Bingaman, had \none or two amendments. But I heard other people saying: We don't want \nto hurry along here because this is a very important piece of \nlegislation and we want to have a chance to offer amendments.\n  Well, the time is now. I am very hopeful, and the majority leader has \ntold me it is up to me. I look at my distinguished friend, who is very \nmuch on top of things in the Senate, the Senator from Nevada, and say \nthat he told me and our leader to stay here as late as we can tonight \nto get all the amendments we possibly can on this subject.\n  We know a lot of Senators are busy, but we know they were told we \nwere going to be in session every day this week. We are going to work \nday and evening. Every evening we work, it takes away an extra day at \nthe end of the week that will detract from our recess. So if Senators \nhave amendments, get them ready. We want them after this amendment.\n  When I am finished, and after my friend from Wyoming has another \nchance to speak, if he wishes, I am going to ask the minority side what \nthey would like to do next.\n  Mr. President, I say to Senator Reid, my desire is that we not vote \nimmediately on the Bingaman amendment, although I am perfectly willing. \nIt is 20 minutes of 7. There is nobody on our side saying we should \nnot. Maybe Senator Reid knows some reasons. I much prefer Senators keep \ndoing what they are doing but that somebody come down and offer another \namendment. Then I prefer not to vote on that amendment. I prefer \nanother amendment until we have as many amendments as we can get in by \nlate tonight.\n  Why do I want to work late tonight? Besides it being Tuesday and we \nwant to finish this bill by Friday, it is the unspoken word that the \nother side of the aisle, more so than we do, wants to offer some clean-\nair type amendments that really do not belong on this bill but have \nhistorically or traditionally found their way on it because they do not \nhave any other place to go. They want to offer some amendments.\n  There are apparently two amendments on that side, at least, plus a \ncouple of other amendments in the same vein. They wanted to offer them \ntomorrow, which can be nicknamed ``environmental day.'' We want to \ncooperate. To the extent we have to use more of the day for electricity \namendments, we use less time for other amendments.\n  I will in a very few words state my case. In 1935, I was 3 years old. \nI am not a student of what happened in the world during the Great \nDepression, but PUHCA was passed. It is funny sounding. It is terrible \nit had to have such an acronym, PUHCA, Public Utility Holding Company \nAct. It is almost one of those acronyms that cries out to never be \ncalled by an acronym, and it is better to be called the Public Utility \nHolding Company Act than PUHCA.\n  Over the years, I have heard that funny word, and I did not even want \nto find out what it meant, but Public Utility Holding Company was a \nprotective mechanism to make sure that during an era of pyramiding, \nwhere big money would buy up utilities, there was somebody watching. As \nan example, if one very rich bank out of Chicago, IL, started buying up \ncompanies all over the country and became a holding company--thus the \ntitle.\n  Nobody is crying for the retention of PUHCA because there are so many \nother protections for that which it was invented. It is time for that \nfunny name to disappear, and then it will not be used so much. We can \nthen just say ``used to be PUHCA,'' and we will not have to talk about \nit.\n  The truth is, as Senator Thomas said--and I agree--expanding FERC's \nauthority to cover acquisition of generating facilities, which is part \nof Senator Bingaman's amendment, is unnecessary. Furthermore, this \namendment preempts States' abilities to protect consumers. Repealing \nPUHCA will not preclude State and Federal regulators from protecting \nratepayers. Access to books and records, as well as rules, regarding \ndebt acquisition will protect investment made on behalf of ratepayers.\n  Also, the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission will \ncontinue to protect against antitrust violations, and the Securities \nand Exchange Commission, which currently oversees PUHCA, has \nrecommended on a number of occasions that it be repealed with certain \nconsumer protections transferred to FERC and State regulatory \ncommissions, as noted above.\n\n  What we are doing is getting rid of PUHCA, the 1935 antiquated law. \nIn place of it, we clarify the jobs FERC does today and expand it only \nin a limited fashion. Our amendment let's PUHCA review utility \ntransactions. The new authority is granted over gas\n\n[[Page S10122]]\n\nacquisitions of utility companies by an electric utility company. This \nprotects consumers and promotes investment in that regard.\n  Clearly, if ever there was a case where we are overprotecting, it is \nthe utility companies. I mentioned how many protections already exist. \nPUHCA started disappearing into the woodwork and became subservient and \nalmost consumed by the SEC--they run it. SEC said they do not need \nPUHCA anymore.\n  Believe it or not, it is pretty certain, when we finally vote, we are \ngoing to get rid of PUHCA. It is like certain past Presidents \nrecommended getting rid of PUHCA and 40 years later something happens. \nThat reminds me of something interesting and funny. About 8 years ago, \nI was heralded as one who had passed the largest single sale of public \nproperty, and all I had done was to take the U.S. Government's \nownership of converting highly enriched uranium for use by nuclear \npowerplants, which is owned by the public, which had been recommended \n30 years before to be privatized, and I privatized it. I was heralded \nfor having passed the first multibillion-dollar sale of property of the \nFederal Government. It is nothing new. It sure did not take any \ningenuity, just like it takes no ingenuity to know that PUHCA ought to \nget out of here.\n  In getting rid of PUHCA, the test that FERC applies is:\n\n       Consistent with the public interest, we do not add new \n     tests.\n\n  Senator Bingaman's amendment does. I do not think we need to add new \ntests. I believe what is in the bill is adequate for the governance of \nFERC in that regard.\n  When I introduced the bill, I told the Senate all the groups that \nliked this bill--the public-private ownership, all of them. And it is \nmost interesting, they all think we adequately protect against whatever \nthe evils might have been that PUHCA might have covered: \nMunicipalities, the APRAs, the large public power companies. They think \nthere is a pretty good balance just like it is.\n  At some point in time I hope when we vote on this that Senator \nBingaman will understand there are those of us who think what we put in \nthe bill is perfectly adequate and well balanced with reference to \nprotection in this area.\n  I ask Senator Bingaman and Senator Reid if they are finished? Are we \nready for another amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. If I could ask the Senator from New Mexico a question?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. As I understand it, the Senator indicated what he would \nlike to do tonight on the electricity title is have people come and \noffer amendments on the electricity title.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Bingaman has an amendment. Senator Cantwell perhaps \nhas an amendment. There are a number of other Senators who wish to \nmaybe offer amendments. The question I have to ask the Senator from New \nMexico is, there are people who have amendments on other issues, \nseparate and apart from the electricity title, and at least two \nSenators have asked if the Senator from New Mexico would allow the \nelectricity title to be set aside and go to other areas.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to the Senator truthfully, it is not understood \nhow hard I worked and how much I worried and sweated to get to where we \nare, which is the pending matter. I want Senators to understand we have \nto get rid of it.\n  Mr. REID. I understand.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. So I do not want to do that. I want Senators to get \ntheir amendments, even if it takes us a little while longer. The \nSenator is implying there may be four, maybe five. I do not know.\n  Might I ask Senator Bingaman if he has another amendment?\n  Mr. REID. If I could respond, the manager of the bill on our side \ndoes have another amendment he could offer tonight. I would like to \ncontinue my colloquy with the Senator from New Mexico, through the \nChair. We have people wondering, are we going to vote on the first \nBingaman amendment now, the second Bingaman amendment; are we are going \nto have two votes? What is the pleasure of the Senator from New Mexico?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. My pleasure is that we have votes tonight, unless the \nSenate sends word, in its inimicable way, that we are going to get all \nthe amendments on electricity in due course this evening, in which \nevent I would say we will not have any votes.\n  Mr. REID. I respond to my friend from New Mexico, I do not think that \nis going to happen. Senator Cantwell, for example, has amendments she \nwants to offer. She wants to take a little time on the first amendment. \nIt is going to be more than a few minutes. She has asked for some time \non that. If we cannot agree on a time, I assume she would talk for a \nlittle while and then offer the amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. When does the Senator think she might know?\n  Mr. REID. Well, she is ready to offer her first amendment but that is \ngoing to take some time. I do not know if she is willing to finish the \ndebate on it tonight. I could call and ask her.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Could the Senator inquire? What we could do then, while \nthe Senator is inquiring, we could go with the second Bingaman \namendment and we will stack them with a clear understanding that when \nwe are ready, we will proceed in the same order they have been offered \nto vote on them.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from New Mexico, I think realistically \nif Senator Cantwell's is going to be the next amendment, it will be \nvery difficult to finish all of the electricity amendments tonight. \nThere are other people who want to offer amendments.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. To the extent the Senator from Nevada desires and can \nbe helpful--and that is strictly up to him--I would rather we get other \nSenators to offer amendments. Senator Bingaman has one. Are there any \nothers?\n  We know Senator Cantwell wants a lot of time and we would say to her \nshe could be last tonight and take as long as she wants. We could then \ncome in in the morning and take some more. I do not think we ought to \nhave her come up and then say the only thing we did tonight was the \nBingaman No. 1 and Cantwell all evening. I think we ought to be doing a \nlittle more than that.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from New Mexico, as I said earlier \ntoday, I know how hard he has worked to get the bill here and how \nimportant this bill is to him personally, and how important he believes \nthis is for the country, but I say as sincerely as I can we are not \ngoing to be able to offer all the amendments on electricity tonight. I \njust do not think it will happen. I will go to the cloakroom and make \nsome calls while the second Bingaman amendment is offered, but I think \nif the Senator's statement is that we are going to have to vote on the \ntwo Bingaman amendments unless we finish offering amendments tonight, \nwe are going to have to vote on the two Bingaman amendments because I \ndo not think we can get through all the amendments tonight.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let's try to do this: Let us assume that we had \nBingaman No. 2 and the Senator from Nevada went off and tried to \ndiscern how many other amendments on this subject we have, and that he \nreturn and say what they are. I am perfectly willing then to try to set \nin motion an agreement that some of them would be taken up in the \nmorning.\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to respond to the Senator in the next \nlittle bit.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If we do not know, we are going to stay here and see \nhow many we can flush out.\n  Does Senator Bingaman want to proceed?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would like to say a few more things \nabout the pending amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Sure.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Then I do have a second amendment which I am glad to \noffer this evening as well.\n  I indicated there are several organizations that have supported the \namendment I have sent to the desk, the American Association for Retired \nPersons, AARP, the Air Conditioning Contractors of America, Consumers \nfor Fair Competition, the Consumers Union, the National Association of \nState Utility Consumer Advocates, National Electrical Contractors \nAssociation, Plumbing, Heating and Cooling Contractors, National \nAssociation of Public Citizens, U.S. PIRG. All of those groups support \nthe amendment I have offered.\n  In addition to that, we have a statement from the Bush administration\n\n[[Page S10123]]\n\nwhich was from last year supporting FERC review of transfers of \ngeneration assets, which is part of what the amendment does that I have \nsent to the desk. I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Bush Administration Supports FERC Review of Transfers of Generation \n                                 Assets\n\n\n   09/14/01 Administration Includes Language in its draft ``Electric \n                     Reliability Transmission Act''\n\n       ``Clarify the commission's authority over holding company \n     mergers and mergers and asset sales involving generation \n     facilities.''\n\n\n  10/16/01 Administration Comments on Draft Senate bill ``Electricity \n                  Restructuring Act'' (Bingaman bill)\n\n       Mergers and Asset Dispositions. ``FERC has the authority to \n     review mergers of `public utilities' under section 203 of the \n     Federal Power Act, and has asserted jurisdiction over mergers \n     of public utility parent companies. This assertion has not \n     been challenged, and holding companies have submitted their \n     mergers to FERC for its review. This language also clarifies \n     FERC authority over public utility mergers and asset \n     dispositions involving generation facilities. Under current \n     law, FERC has authority over only those generation facilities \n     associated with a wholesale power contract. If it is going to \n     prevent accumulation of market power, it should have \n     jurisdiction over generation facilities owned by public \n     utilities'' (emphasis added).\n\n\n 10/9/01 ``Major Principles in Administration Position On Electricity \n                  Legislation'' (Department of Energy)\n\n       Mergers and Asset Dispositions: ``Clarify FERC authority \n     over holding company mergers and mergers and asset \n     dispositions involving generation facilities.''\n\n\n10/24/01 Letter from FERC Chairman Pat Wood to Rep. John Dingell (D-MI)\n\n       Review of Mergers: ``It may be a good idea to clarify the \n     Commission's authority to review mergers involving only \n     generation facilities and mergers of holding companies with \n     electric utility subsidiaries. The increasing amount of \n     competition in power generation markets makes this more than \n     an academic question.''\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. The administration includes language in its draft \nElectric Reliability Transmission Act to clarify the commission's \nauthority over holding company mergers, and mergers and asset sales \ninvolving generation facilities. In another place in the \nadministration's statement it says they support clarifying FERC \nauthority over holding company mergers and mergers and asset \ndispositions involving generation facilities.\n  What I am proposing is not a radical policy proposal. It is exactly \nwhat we adopted last Congress. It was adopted by a substantial majority \nof the Senate. It was supported by the Bush administration. Now we are \nbacking away from that.\n  I am told the Senator from New Mexico, my good friend Mr. Domenici, \nsays this is agreed to by the Public Power Association and by the Rural \nElectric Cooperative Association. That is fine. I can understand that \nthere are other things in the bill, in the overall electricity title, \nwhich cause them to believe this is something they should be quiet \nabout or be willing to support--swallow hard and support, I would add--\nbut the reality is, it is not good policy for us to leave this issue \nunaddressed, this issue of adequate authority of the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission to oversee the acquisition or sale of generation \nfacilities. That ought to be covered if we are going to pass an \nelectricity title.\n  Clearly, there should be authority and an enforceable responsibility \non the part of FERC to ensure cross-subsidy does not occur. Those are \nthe two primary things my amendment tries to deal with. I think they \nare very important.\n  I have a letter from MBIA, Richard L. Weill, who is the vice chairman \nof MBIA Insurance Corporation. I will read portions of that for my \ncolleagues, because I think it is instructive. He says:\n\n       I am writing on behalf of the MBIA Insurance Corporation in \n     support of your proposed amendment to the Energy Policy Act \n     of 2003 that would strengthen the regulatory framework of \n     utility mergers.\n       MBIA Insurance Corporation is the largest financial \n     guaranty insurance company in the world. We have guaranteed \n     the timely payment of principal and interest on more than $14 \n     billion of electric utility debt. Our guarantee is \n     unconditional and irrevocable, even in the event of fraud. In \n     that context, we are profoundly concerned about the strength \n     and integrity of the regulatory scheme of electric utilities.\n       We are, in a sense, a gatekeeper to the capital markets for \n     these utilities. We provide investors with our unconditional \n     and irrevocable guarantee and, as a result, provide the \n     utilities with the lowest possible cost of access to the \n     capital markets. Our Triple-A rating by all major rating \n     agencies enables the utilities to sell debt at the lowest \n     interest rate. We can continue to serve these investors and \n     this industry only if we can be assured of the probity, \n     comprehensiveness and fairness of the regulatory framework.\n       Your amendment would require that proposed mergers promote \n     the public interest that is defined as encompassing the \n     effects on competition, economic efficiency and regulatory \n     oversight. It would also close loopholes that enable certain \n     corporate combinations to avoid being characterized as \n     mergers.\n       We believe that this amendment will be viewed favorably by \n     the capital markets.\n\n  We are trying to close loopholes that enable certain corporate \ncombinations to avoid being characterized as mergers. That is exactly \nthe problem with the substitute proposal Senator Domenici has laid \nbefore the Senate.\n  By adopting the language in my amendment--that was in the bill last \nyear--we close those loopholes, we guarantee consumers will be \nprotected, we guarantee these utilities will get the lowest possible \ninterest rates and that this insurance arrangement can remain in \neffect.\n  This is a very good amendment. I hope my colleagues will support it. \nIt will strengthen this bill. This is not an amendment offered with the \nintent of undermining the electricity title. This is an amendment \noffered with the intent of strengthening the electricity title. It is \nvery well crafted, in my view, to accomplish that.\n  I yield the floor, and at the appropriate time I will offer another \namendment on a different aspect of the electricity title.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I need to confer with the Democratic leader \nabout the question asked by the Senator from New Mexico. In the \ninterim, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Illinois, Mr. \nDurbin, be recognized to speak for up to 5 minutes as in morning \nbusiness regarding an unfortunate death of one of his close friends.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Reserving the right to object, I would like to make some \nmore comments on this particular amendment following the remarks of \nSenator Durbin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Durbin are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I take a moment to comment again on the \npending amendment. It has been mentioned several times this was in our \nbill last year; that is true. I supported it; that is true. But we have \nto understand how we got in that situation.\n  First of all, we had come to the floor without having the committee \nwork on the bill at all last year. This is quite a different situation \nwhere we quietly and completely have gone through the bill.\n  I also have to say my friend from New Mexico had quite a stronger \nstatement and I had a less strong statement than what is in here. We \nagreed to a compromise. So it is not the way I would have done it had I \nhad my way, but we wanted to move something. In any event, that is the \nway we came to have that language.\n  We are talking about consumer protection. We get all tied up in some \nof these terms, but the fact is we are seeking to put authority there \nfor someone to oversee. What we want to do, of course, is to have FERC \ndo it without an expansion of authority.\n  So we are saying in the language of the bill, no public utility \nshall, without first securing the order of the commission authorizing \nit to do so, sell, lease, or otherwise dispose of facilities; to merge \nor consolidate, directly or indirectly, such facilities or any part \nthereof; purchase, acquire, take any security over $10 million.\n  It is very clear. That is what we do under the bill as it now is \ndrafted.\n\n  Then we go on to say in evaluating the transaction on the \napplications and so on, the Commission will adequately protect consumer \ninterests, will be consistent with competitive wholesale markets\n\n       . . . will not impair the ability of the Commission or the \n     ability of a State commission\n\n[[Page S10124]]\n\n     having jurisdiction following the completion of the \n     transaction over any public utility that is a party to the \n     transaction or an associate company of any party to the \n     transaction . . .\n\n  That is what we say in the bill.\n\n       . . . will not impair the financial integrity of any public \n     utility that is a party to the transaction or an associate \n     company of any party to the transaction, and\n\n  Finally:\n\n       . . . satisfies such other criteria as the Commission \n     considers consistent with the public interest.\n\n  So what we do is give the direction to the Commission to do the very \nthing that we are talking about, and that is to ensure that mergers are \nfair to consumers. That is what this whole area is about. It has been \ndrafted carefully to be in that form.\n  I think it would be a mistake for us to adopt any changes in that \nwhen we have what we need for the protection of consumers, something we \nhave agreed to, something that is part of a modernization effort. We \nshould not change that by an amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I indicated to my friend, the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom New Mexico, and Senator Bingaman, the manager on our side, that I \nwould check to find out what we have in the way of amendments.\n  This is certainly an incomplete list. We have not hot-lined this, but \nwe have had people call the cloakroom. We have five Senators who wish \nto offer amendments at this stage. We have at least one of those \nSenators who is going to offer multiple amendments--multiple means \nmaybe three, maybe four amendments.\n  To make a long story short and not take undue time, we would be \nagreeable to having the second Bingaman amendment debated tonight. We \nwould lay down the first Cantwell amendment with the understanding that \nshe will lay that amendment down tonight and debate it for an hour \ntonight. She wants 2 hours on it tomorrow.\n  If the Senator from New Mexico, the chairman of the committee, does \nnot want to agree to this, then we should have the two votes on \nBingaman, and likely we will not offer any more amendments tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. First, I thank the Senator for the hard work he is \ndoing, trying to ascertain from Senators at this hour--although we have \nall been telling them we are working, and this is the work part of the \nday, it is not hard to find out what they want to do. I thank you for \nthe obviously successful effort you made so far.\n  Mr. REID. If my friend will yield for one other thing I should have \nsaid before?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. As the Senator from New Mexico knows, this electricity \ntitle is very important to some Members of the Senate. None of these \namendments, I want the record to reflect, are done in any way to slow \nup, slow walk, or stop this bill. These amendments, as has been seen by \nthe amendments of the Senator from New Mexico, are amendments offered \nin good faith to try to improve this bill.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Might I say to the distinguished Senator from Nevada, \nall I want to try to do is move this bill along, as you know, and to do \nthat in a way that is consistent with Senators having ample time to \nprepare and to present their amendments properly. You indicated to me, \nwithout certainty but relatively close, that you probably--we are \nprobably looking at eight amendments, five Senators, with one of them \nwho has three.\n  I might ask, Is Senator Bingaman's No. 2 included in that?\n  Mr. REID. No.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. No. So it is the possibility of nine amendments. I want \nto tell the Senator from the start that, as far as the distinguished \nSenator Maria Cantwell, I certainly do not have any objection to 1 hour \ntonight and 2 hours tomorrow morning. We can start with that. But what \nI do have some concern about is trying to determine when we would be \nfinished with amendments to the electricity title. I tell you that as \nmuch because I have been hearing from your side of the aisle of the \ngreat desire to take up two amendments that have to do with climate \nchange. I have been told the only way that can be done, and done right, \nis tomorrow because everybody will be here. That is two.\n  I have been told that--and I know--Senator Bingaman wants to offer \nhis amendment with reference to a 10 percent mandatory renewable \nportfolio, and that belongs in the same package.\n  I have been told the distinguished Senator has a new source \nperformance review; is that correct? Is that what it is called?\n  Mr. REID. That is true. New source review.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I remember that when I was on the committee--new source \nreview. He had that up once. A couple of Senators came back who were \nnot here then. That may well be why. But that is another one we have to \nlook at.\n  I guess what I am wondering is, if it would be asking you too much to \nsuggest the following; that Senator Bingaman offer his amendment--I am \nnot suggesting, I am not proposing this officially--he offer his second \namendment here, and that Senator Cantwell offer her amendment tonight \nand debate it for an hour; that you try to find one more amendment to \nbe offered tonight, and then that we reach agreement, come back \ntomorrow, reconvene at 9 o'clock in the morning, at which time Senator \nCantwell would have her time, and all the remaining amendments--that is \n9, 10, 11--remaining amendments in this area would be finished by 1 \no'clock in the afternoon.\n  Mr. REID. We couldn't agree to that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. What time would you think?\n  Mr. REID. If Senator Cantwell debates for 2 hours, that is 11 \no'clock.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. And we have three votes, that takes us to about 12 or \n12:15. That would be almost humanly impossible.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. What would you like, 2:30; 3?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, I have no authority. I am dealing with \nfive Senators who are all Senators in their own right. I am here just \ntrying to help a little and take phone calls from them, things of that \nnature. Some of them, frankly, are out doing other things tonight. We \ncould not agree to that.\n\n  The Democratic leader, with whom I spoke just a few minutes ago, \nindicates he thinks, and I would acknowledge he is probably right in \nthis regard, about as far as we can go tonight is lay Cantwell down, \nget a time agreement on hers. Maybe during--not maybe, but during the \nmorning hours when she is debating hers, we would be able to try to \ncome up with a list of amendments.\n  But any one of these Senators can object to a finite list. I just \ndon't see anything happening in the next few hours.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would like to do this, with your concurrence. Why \ndon't we proceed with the Bingaman amendment, tell Senator Maria \nCantwell she will be next for an hour tonight. In the meantime, would \nyou let us work on the unanimous consent request proposal so your staff \nand ours----\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, I am very happy to do that. One thing \nthat people on my side--and, frankly, I have gotten a call from \nsomebody on your side. Are there going to be any votes tonight?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Unless an agreement is worked out, Senator, we are \ngoing to have a vote tonight.\n  Mr. REID. Then there will be no Cantwell amendment offered tonight. \nAs soon as Bingaman is offered, we can vote on that, and there will be \nno Cantwell amendments tonight.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Would the Senator like to work on a unanimous consent \nrequest that includes Senator Maria Cantwell?\n  Mr. REID. I say, Senator Bingaman is going to take a little bit of \ntime. He said he wouldn't take very long. But if he takes a half hour \nand there is response to that, we are not going to finish what we are \ndoing now until 8:30, quarter to 9. Senator Cantwell is not going to \noffer an amendment at that time.\n  If you want to finish Bingaman, have Cantwell laid down tonight, and \nhave Cantwell come in in the morning, that is fine. Have votes whenever \nyou want them, but if we are going to have votes on Bingaman, we are \nnot going to offer any more amendments tonight.\n\n[[Page S10125]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let us make this effort: That Senator Bingaman would \nproceed for as long as it takes, Senator Cantwell will offer her \namendment and take an hour tonight, and that we work on a UC request \ntogether while that is occurring. She will get her 2 hours tomorrow, \nand we will try to get a consent as to when we might finish. If not, I \nwill go along and say we won't have any votes tonight.\n  Mr. REID. I say through the Chair to my dear friend, the senior \nSenator from New Mexico, that I don't think it is possible to get an \nagreement locking in these amendments. I just do not think it is \npossible. I don't want to act in bad faith. I would like to do that. I \nbelieve in an orderly body. But I just don't think I can get that done. \nWe have people off the Hill and people just automatically object to \nthings at this time of night. I don't think we can get it done.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I want to say now--and I will say it three more times \ntonight before we finish--to Senators wherever they are that we are not \nquitting tomorrow night at 7:20. If there are Senators who want to be \noff the Hill, they can be off. We are going to be here tomorrow night \nvoting on amendments that your side wants. We are just about out of \namendments on our side of the aisle. I am not sure of any really \nimportant ones left. Your side has been telling me they want these very \nimportant amendments that they claim are related to this bill. A whole \nbunch of amendments that are left don't even belong on this Energy bill \nand are not even within this committee's jurisdiction. This Senator \nstands up and argues against them but, as a matter of fact, they ought \nto be argued by another committee chairman. I am not even the one who \ntakes care of them. But I will have to do that.\n  As long as everybody understands, Senator Cantwell will be taking 2 \nhours tomorrow. We are going to start at 9 o'clock. We are still going \nto be on these amendments to this bill. We need Senators to get ready \ntomorrow morning with additional amendments in this arena. Then we will \nproceed quickly to the amendments such as the one Senator Feinstein has \nand all the others. But we will be here tomorrow evening. We will be \nhere plenty late as we take those amendments, as long as we understand \nwe are ready to do what you recommend.\n  Mr. REID. If I could through the Chair, is the Senator from New \nMexico saying that tomorrow we are going to move off of the electricity \ntitle into other areas?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We will stay right on electricity in the morning and \ntry to finish it as soon as we can. I am hoping that it doesn't take \nall day so we can go to the other issues. But at this point, could we \njust, so as to protect you, agree that if you will move as follows \ntonight, we will set aside the current Bingaman amendment so that the \nsecond Bingaman amendment can be taken up. Then it will be set aside so \nwe can take up first the Cantwell. She will use 1 hour tonight. We will \nanswer, if we see fit. If not, we will debate it tomorrow. Nonetheless, \nwe will come in tomorrow at 9 o'clock, and when we get on this bill, \nSenator Cantwell will be up and she will have an additional 2 hours on \nher amendment. I am merely adding as a matter of discussion that \nfurther amendments on this section of the bill will be in order at that \ntime.\n  Mr. REID. I understand very clearly the chairman of the committee.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Is that fair enough?\n  Mr. REID. Very fair.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senators understand that means we are not going to vote \ntonight. But you certainly can look to a late night tomorrow night with \nvotes.\n  I yield the floor and thank the distinguished Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \namendment that I just sent to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1418 To Amendment No. 1412\n\n   (Purpose: To preserve the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's \n    authority to protect the public interest prior to July 1, 2005)\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1418 to amendment No. 1412:\n       On page 9, lines 23 through 24, strike ``including any rule \n     or order of general applicability within the scope of the \n     proposed rulemaking,'' and insert: ``nor any final rule or \n     order of general applicability establishing a standard market \n     design,''.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, my colleague from Wyoming is here. I \nmentioned to him that this is an issue which I would like us to try to \nfind some way to resolve. This is something that we may well be able to \navoid having a vote on tomorrow, if we can find a way to resolve it.\n  The amendment I have sent to the desk tries to clarify something in \nthe bill that I think is very important. Senator Domenici's substitute \ncontains a delay in the issuance of the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission's standard market design rulemaking until July 2005. I \nunderstand that. That is fine. I am not trying to disturb that. I \nbelieve the rule goes too far and should be dramatically modified or \ncompletely abrogated.\n  I know there are Members of the Senate who think 2005 is the wrong \ndate, that we ought to go to 2008 or some other date. Others believe \nFERC should be permitted to go ahead, and as quickly as they would \nlike. I am not taking a position on that issue with my amendment. I, \nfrankly, can see both sides of the argument.\n  My amendment leaves the delay of the standard market design rule that \nSenator Domenici has included in his substitute in place. However, in \nan effort to prevent the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission from \nrenaming the rule and issuing it under a new title, the bill also goes \non to prohibit ``any rule or order of general applicability on matters \nwithin the scope of the rule.''\n  That means the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission cannot issue a \nrule or order of general applicability on any issue that is dealt with \nin the proposed rule during the 2 years of the delay.\n  What kind of actions would this prevent? That is the obvious \nquestion.\n  I think it would prevent the Commission from doing its job. The \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission currently has a rule in the \nprocess on interconnections to the transmission grid. No matter what \nthat rule says, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission would be \nprohibited from issuing it under this language that we have in the \nDomenici substitute.\n  Other matters dealt with in the rule that the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission would be prevented from dealing with in a generic \nmanner are such issues as market oversight, market litigation, \ntransmission pricing, the scope of regional transmission \norganizations--RTOs--the adequacy of rules or transactions across RTO \nboundaries, and, in short, just about anything that the Commission does \nabout transmission or markets because the proposed rule touches on all \nof those issues.\n  There are even rules that the Commission is required to issue by \nother provisions in this Domenici substitute that they would be \nprohibited from issuing because of this provision that I am here trying \nto change. There are a number of rules necessary to get the reliability \nsection to work. The bill requires rules on mergers, on transmission \naccess by public power entities, on participant funding, and other \nmatters.\n  The provision that I am here trying to modify or change would \nprohibit the issuance of those rules whereas in another place in the \nsame title we are saying the Commission is directed to issue.\n  It would be ironic, indeed, if the rule's opponents who want stronger \nparticipant funding language in the rule were to have prevented the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission from issuing this rule related to \nparticipant funding that they want to see issued because of their zeal \nto prevent the standard market design from being issued.\n  I also believe that some of the orders that the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission issued in the Western market crises would be \ndefined as orders of general applicability and would have been \nprohibited.\n  If we have another crisis which occurs during these upcoming 2 years,\n\n[[Page S10126]]\n\nwould we not want the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to bring \norder to those markets the way they finally did in the West 2 years ago \nin the summer?\n  Everybody, both the opponents and the supporters of the standard \nmarket design, should support the amendment I am offering. It is an \namendment to clarify that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is \nnot banned from issuing any orders or rules that deal with any matter \nin the proposed rule; that they should only, instead, be prohibited \nfrom issuing a standard market design rule by any other name.\n  So I believe what I am proposing is something that all colleagues who \nhave looked at this issue would agree with. We are just trying to \nclarify the language so we do not wind up prohibiting the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission from doing the very things we are going to \nbe calling upon them to get done, and that is the effect of the \nlanguage that is in the Domenici substitute at this time.\n  So that is the thrust of my amendment. As I say, this is an issue \nwhich, frankly, we should not have to be dealing with by amendment on \nthe Senate floor. I would hope we could just get this resolved at a \nstaff level. We have not been able to. I hope that can still happen and \nthat we can avoid having to go to a vote on this question because I \nthink in the final analysis, if anybody will spend a little bit of time \ntrying to understand this issue, they will agree with this change in \nlanguage that I am proposing. And they will agree that is, in fact, \nwhat the Senate would like to see done.\n  So, Mr. President, with that, let me yield the floor. My colleague \nmay want to speak on this same amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I think the Senator raises an issue that \nwe should discuss, but I have to tell you, it has been discussed, and \nthere is a certain amount of balance that goes into this entire \nproject. In other words, there are other parts of the bill which \nindicate that FERC should work with RTOs, for example, or should do \nsome of the other things.\n  Market design is a rather broad concept, and I think this amendment \nis not necessary. It is illogical to read this SMD delay to tell FERC \nit cannot do its duty. So when you broaden the whole thing to say you \ncan't do anything, as this amendment implies in establishing a general \nmarket design, I suppose you might pick up some things that might be a \nmarket design and say you can't do that, when in the bill that is what \nwe are seeking to cause them to do.\n  I do agree perhaps there ought to be an effort made to clarify this \nlanguage, as I think the Senator wants to do. And perhaps there is a \nway where we could do a colloquy, or do something to make it certain \nthat it is not there to interfere with the other things we would want \nFERC to be doing; for instance, to issue rulemaking on market \ntransparency or participant funding.\n  We have a balance. And it is a little difficult to achieve that \nbalance if we go with this very broad change. So I think, as it stands, \nwe would have to oppose the amendment. But we encourage the Senator--\nperhaps we could get together with our staffs and figure out a colloquy \nthat would make it clear in some other fashion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of my friend \nfrom Wyoming. Now that we know the procedure--that this will not be \nvoted on until tomorrow at some point--therefore, there will be an \nopportunity, perhaps this evening or early tomorrow, when our staffs \ncan get together to see if there is any way to accommodate this concern \nI am trying to deal with in this amendment. As I say, it is a concern \nwhich I think many Senators will share if they will focus on what we \nare trying to deal with.\n  So the amendment is pending. If we have to, we can have a vote on it, \nbut I would hope we could find another way to deal with this issue that \nwill be acceptable to the chairman of the committee and to my colleague \nfrom Wyoming and to all Senators.\n  Mr. President, that is the only other amendment I intended to offer \nthis evening.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to my friend, Senator Bingaman, perhaps, with a \nlittle bit of time, we can work on it and see if there is some way we \ncan avoid an amendment. If not, clearly, you understand yours, and we \nunderstand our reasoning why we do not need it; that it should not be \nan amendment; that it should not be raised to that level; that it is \nnot needed in terms of the full amendment. But we will work on it.\n  Now, I understand the time has arrived when I would make a request \nbecause I don't think I did the other in the form of a unanimous \nconsent request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the second Bingaman amendment be set \naside so that the distinguished Senator, Maria Cantwell, can offer her \namendment, and that she would use up to 1 hour tonight and have up to 2 \nhours tomorrow on that same amendment.\n  I ask Senator Cantwell, that is correct, is it not, that you would \nlike up to an hour tonight and up to 2 hours tomorrow on this \namendment?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. That is correct.\n  My colleagues from throughout the West are very concerned that they \nhave ample time to express their opinion about the electricity title \nand this particular amendment. So if you want to limit it to an hour \ntonight, we will use the 2 hours tomorrow to give my colleagues a \nchance to speak.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I just wanted to make it clear we are not trying to \ndeny you anything. We just have to have some idea what comes next so \nother people can be ready. And if it looks as if we come in at 9, you \nwould still have up to 2 hours for further discussion by you and others \nregarding that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, it is my \nunderstanding, then, that the request is that Senator Cantwell would be \nable to lay down her amendment tonight, that she would have up to 1 \nhour tonight, 2 hours tomorrow, and there would be no tabling motion \nbefore that 2 hours is up in the morning.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator is correct, except, might I say, I think it \nis fair, just for the Senate's sake, that we say on both of those up to \n2 hours. And I do not intend to amend. But we don't have to wait here \nif she is finished.\n  Mr. REID. No question about that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. If I could clarify, I don't know whether we will \nactually physically lay down the amendment tonight or the first thing \nat 9 a.m., but we will talk about the amendment, use that 1 hour \ntonight, and use the 2 hours according to the agreement.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could respond to the Senator from \nWashington, that is your choice. You have 3 hours on this amendment. \nYou can either offer it tonight or in the morning. But if you offer it \nin the morning, the time you are taking tonight would run against your \ntime. So if you take more than an hour tonight, you will lose it in the \nmorning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I don't have any objection, but we have \nbeen talking for about an hour about that amendment and you, I say to \nthe distinguished minority whip, have been saying the important thing \nis that she would have an hour tonight on her amendment. But we are not \ngoing to have her amendment. We thought it was going to be laid down so \nwe would know what it is about.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend from New Mexico, the \nSenator from Washington--as long as she knows she has a total of 3 \nhours on her amendment--would have no problem sharing that with you \ntonight.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Can we have the amendment? That is all we want.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Absolutely.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Thank you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their \ncooperation. We want all Members to understand the amendment I will be \noffering\n\n[[Page S10127]]\n\ntomorrow, and we certainly want the American public to understand it. I \nhave a few comments on the Domenici underlying amendment and on the \nBingaman amendment as well. They are related to our overall effort.\n  Let me step back for a moment. The debate we have been having \ninvolves important issues about how America moves forward on an energy \nbill, how we diversify our energy away from foreign dependence, and how \nwe make the right investments. I have a lot of concerns about this \nbill, that it is not on target making the right investments. I am sure \nI will have a chance to get to that point later as this bill continues \nto be debated. But what I feel is most important tonight is that my \ncolleagues and the American people understand this bill has significant \nchanges in it as it relates to consumer protections and the failure we \nhave had as a government in protecting consumers from the energy crisis \nthat has damaged the west coast economy.\n  When I think of this debate we have had for the last hour or two--\nactually for the last day or so--about how much time we should give to \nthe Energy bill, I find it amazing. Because the west coast economy got \nhit basically to the tune of about $6 billion. That is the cost for \nmanipulated contracts that we in the west paid for in our economies. So \nwhen you say, let's debate these amendments and let's get them off the \ntable, let's give 6 hours to debating these amendments, we are \nbasically saying to the west coast ratepayers: We are giving you 1 hour \nfor every billion dollars you were gouged by Enron and market \nmanipulators.\n  We can do better than that. We ought to be willing to give the \nAmerican public at least an hour for every million dollars they paid in \nhigh energy costs that were part of manipulated contracts. I feel very \nfortunate that I have an hour tonight and that my colleagues from the \nwest and I have 2 hours tomorrow to talk about this important issue. \nFrankly, the American people need to have their day in this body to \ndebate fully whether we want to have changes to our consumer protection \nlaws, whether this body, the Senate, is taking adequate measures to \nprotect them from having another Enron crisis happen again, and whether \nour own regulators, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, are doing \ntheir job in protecting consumers.\n  This debate we just had about the underlying Domenici substitute and \nthe Bingaman amendment is about that, about whether we should allow for \nmore of the free market or whether we should have more controls.\n  My point to the American people is that we have a Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission that has not done its job. The Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission deserves an ``F'' when it comes to protecting \nconsumers.\n  Let me show what has happened in my home State of Washington, how \nconsumers have been gouged by high electricity prices. Yes, we were the \nunfortunate State that got caught with the second worst drought on \nrecord which meant our hydro system wasn't producing as much power as \nwe needed it to produce. Consequently, what happened? Well, we had to \ngo out on the spot market and buy electricity. When we went out to buy \nthat electricity, we bought it at a time when California had gone \nthrough their deregulation and there were exorbitant prices, sometimes \n300 times the price of electricity. Our utilities were forced to buy \nthat power. Our consumers were forced to pay that price.\n\n  You say: Well, that is an unfortunate circumstance of that time \nperiod and the fact that your State had a drought. I can tell you it \nwasn't all related to our State having a drought. What we have found \nsince this time is these contracts were manipulated. Enron has said \nthey were manipulated. The Department of Justice has said they have \nbeen manipulated. We have a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \nreport--that report is so voluminous, many pages--that basically \ndocuments all the different ways in which these contracts were \nmanipulated.\n  What is the result? The result of that has been in my home State of \nWashington we have had utilities that have ended up having increases in \ntheir rates. Down in southwest Washington, in the Vancouver area, there \nhas been an 88 percent rate increase; in parts of King County, a 61 \npercent rate increase; in Snohomish County, a 54 percent rate increase; \nover in eastern Washington, in Okanogan, one of the areas that is most \neconomically hard pressed in our State, a 71 percent rate increase; \nover on the Olympic peninsula, a 43 percent rate increase.\n  I ask my colleagues: Which States would be willing to put up with \nthose kinds of rate increases, from an energy crisis where contracts \nhave been manipulated, and say it is OK?\n  The kicker in this situation is these aren't just rates for 1999. \nBecause of this crisis and the manipulated contracts Enron has put \nforth, we are stuck with those high energy costs for the length of \nthose Enron contracts. In fact, even though this report from a Federal \nagency says these contracts have been manipulated, and unjustly so, \nthese utilities, particularly the one here in Snohomish County, have to \npay this 54 percent rate increase for another 5 years. They are stuck \npaying these Enron contracts for 5 years.\n  When the utility said: Why should we be paying this price? Why should \nwe pay a contract that has been knowingly manipulated? Enron is suing \nthem. Can you imagine that? Enron, who has admitted guilt in \nmanipulating contracts, has the audacity to sue utilities in my State, \nforcing them to continue to pay these high rates.\n  This debate is about whether we are going to get some relief. Somehow \npeople think maybe there is a way this rate increase of 54 percent \ndoesn't really impact people. If you think somehow this really isn't \ncausing harm, I want to submit for the Record a New York Times article \nfrom December of 2002, just last December, where it showed we had more \nthan 14,000 customers from that local utility in Snohomish County \nbasically disconnected from their energy source because they couldn't \npay.\n  We saw a 44 percent increase in actual disconnections in Snohomish \nCounty because people could not afford to pay that 54 percent rate \nincrease.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the article I referred to in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Dec. 22, 2002]\n\n                   Legacy of Power Cost Manipulation\n\n                           (By Timothy Egan)\n\n       Everett, WA., Dec. 19.--Two years ago this month, a record \n     was set at the height of the West Coast energy crunch: an \n     hour of electric power was sold for $3,250--more than a \n     hundred times what the same small block had cost a year \n     earlier.\n       Now, power supplies are abundant and wholesale prices have \n     plummeted. But the fallout from what state officials say was \n     the largest manipulation of the energy market in modern times \n     has continued to hit West Coast communities hard.\n       Here in Snohomish County, which has the highest energy \n     rates in the state, more than 14,000 customers have had their \n     electricity shut off for lack of payment this year--a 44 \n     percent increase over 2001. They have seen electric rate \n     increases of 50 percent, as the Snohomish County Public \n     Utility District struggles to pay for long-term power \n     contracts it signed with companies like Enron at the height \n     of the price run-up.\n       Aided by charities, most customers have had their power \n     returned within a day of being shut off, but others are \n     forced to make choices about which necessities they can live \n     without. ``It's a pretty tough thing trying to explain to \n     your 5-year-old kid why the lights won't come on anymore,'' \n     said Crystal Faye of Everett. ``I didn't pay much attention \n     to all that stuff about California and Enron, but it's \n     certainly come home to hurt us now.''\n       Ms. Faye and her husband, Rick, who are unemployed, have \n     had their power shut off twice this year. Brianne Dorsey, a \n     single mother, said she removed the baseboard heater in her \n     home here and has had to rely on a small wood stove for heat, \n     because she is $1,000 behind in paying her electric bills.\n       Faced with such tales tied to rate increases along the West \n     Coast, states are trying to get back some of what they lost \n     during 18 months when energy prices seemed to have no \n     ceiling. The decision this month by a federal regulatory \n     judge that California utilities had been overcharged by $1.8 \n     billion bolstered the case of Northwest utilities seeking \n     refunds, officials of those utilities said. It also \n     angered California officials, who say they will continue \n     to press for a total of nearly $9 billion in refunds. The \n     Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is expected to decide \n     on Northwest refunds in the spring.\n       No matter what the federal government decides, officials \n     say their best hope for compensation is from a number of \n     criminal investigations being pursued by Nevada and the three \n     West Coast states--Washington, Oregon and California. They \n     liken their cause to state lawsuits against tobacco \n     companies, which started as long shots but resulted in \n     enormous settlements.\n\n[[Page S10128]]\n\n       Aided by a guilty plea in October from a former trader for \n     Enron, and by newly discovered internal documents describing \n     how companies manipulated the energy market in 2000 and 2001, \n     the West Coast states are hoping to get settlement money from \n     more than a dozen energy trading companies. The companies say \n     they acted legally in taking advantage of a unique market \n     condition, but state officials say the companies created a \n     fake energy crisis.\n       At the height of the rise in energy costs in early 2001, \n     the Bush administration said the West Coast's troubles were a \n     precursor of what would happen if the nation did not build \n     1,900 power plants over the next 20 years. But state \n     officials in the hardest-hit areas say the crisis was never \n     about energy shortages so much as it was about an epic \n     transfer of wealth. They want payback--in some cases for \n     immediate relief to consumers who cannot pay their bills this \n     winter.\n       Last month, the Williams Company, in Tulsa, Okla., agreed \n     to a $417 million settlement with Washington, Oregon and \n     California. While admitting no wrongdoing, Williams agreed to \n     pay refunds and other restitution to the three states; in \n     return, the states dropped an antitrust investigation. Among \n     large energy companies, the states are seeking refunds from \n     the Mirant Corporation, Reliant Resources Inc., Dynegy Inc., \n     Duke Energy and Enron.\n       ``All of us on the West Coast have been hard hit by these \n     rate increases, but the poor in this county have just been \n     hammered,'' said Bill Beuscher, who runs the energy \n     assistance program in Snohomish County. Mr. Beuscher said \n     that in the first two weeks the winter energy assistance \n     program was open this year, requests for financial aid were \n     up 55 percent from the same period last year.\n       The power trading companies named in criminal \n     investigations and refund cases did not want to comment \n     publicly while the cases were pending. But several of the \n     companies that are fighting refunds have said in their public \n     filings that the utilities, particularly in the Northwest, \n     are trying to renege on legitimate long-term contracts. They \n     said they did not act in collusion and explained that the \n     highest prices were a result of severe market shifts brought \n     in part by the Northwest drought.\n       In some cases, the power trading companies said, the \n     utilities resisted buying shorter contracts, which would have \n     cost them less. They also said that some Northwest utilities \n     took advantage of the price spikes and sold power into the \n     market themselves, only to come up short later. The companies \n     said they expected to be vindicated when the government \n     finishes its refund cases next spring.\n       Mr. Beuscher said he would like to see money from the \n     Williams settlement be used to help people who cannot afford \n     the rate increase. Consumers in Oregon and California have \n     made similar pleas. But officials in all three states say \n     that until there are larger settlements with the energy \n     companies, consumers are unlikely to see relief.\n       ``We hope that the Williams case serves as a template,'' \n     said Tom Dresslar, a spokesman for the California attorney \n     general's office, ``because California was monumentally \n     ripped off by these energy traders.''\n       About seven million consumers in California, who were \n     initially shielded from having to pay for runaway energy \n     costs during the worst part of the state's deregulation \n     debacle, are paying rate increases averaging 30 percent more \n     than the pre-deregulation prices of 1996. The state has the \n     highest energy rates in the nation, consumer advocates say, \n     although the structure of the rate increase allows poor \n     people and low energy users to escape the recent increases.\n       ``I don't hold out a lot of hope that we will ever get \n     significant refunds,'' said Doug Heller of the Foundation for \n     Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, a nonprofit group based in Los \n     Angeles. The group calculates that California power customers \n     overpaid a total of $70 billion.\n       At the height of the energy troubles, the trading companies \n     boasted of record profits in their quarterly reports. But \n     many of those companies are now near bankruptcy as they cope \n     with a downturn that has caused the energy trading sector to \n     lose 80 percent of its value, according to Wall Street \n     analysts. ``It's like the highwayman robbed us and then spent \n     all the money on booze,'' Mr. Heller said.\n       The companies themselves blame the states. In one case that \n     was heard this month, William A. Wise, chief executive of the \n     El Paso Corporation, which is based in Houston, denied \n     manipulating the market and blamed the officials who set up \n     California's deregulated energy market for causing the price \n     run-ups with ``one bad policy after another.''\n       Under a New Deal-era law, power companies can be forced to \n     pay refunds if they have charged an ``unreasonable and \n     unjust'' amount for electricity. The Federal Energy \n     Regulatory Commission, which West Coast governors say did \n     very little to restrain power traders during the height of \n     the run-ups, will determine the exact refund amount, if any.\n       In the meantime, electric rates throughout the Pacific \n     Northwest, once among the cheapest in the nation, have \n     climbed as much as 50 percent.\n       California's problems stem from its chaotic attempt at \n     energy deregulation, approved in 1996 and put in effect in \n     1998. The Northwest, with its tradition of publicly owned \n     utilities, was drawn into the California crisis by a \n     convergence of dry weather and freewheeling trading of its \n     own.\n       Usually, the Northwest avoids price fluctuations by \n     providing a steady stream of hydroelectric power, aided by \n     abundant winter rainfall. But in late 2000, a drought in the \n     Northwest forced utilities to buy power on the open market. \n     Some utilities had also tried to sell power into the \n     California market but were pinched by the drought.\n       At the same time, major energy traders were withholding \n     blocks of power to create the appearance of further \n     shortages, according to Enron memorandums discovered this \n     year.\n       Refunds were once thought to be unlikely. But then came the \n     memorandums--many of them detailing schemes to manipulate the \n     market under names like Death Star--and the agreement in \n     October by Timothy N. Belden, a former senior trader for \n     Enron, to plead guilty to conspiring with others to \n     manipulate the West Coast energy market.\n       Prosecutors say Mr. Belden is cooperating with \n     investigations of the power trading companies.\n       ``What really started the ball rolling were the smoking-gun \n     memos, and then the guilty plea has helped as well,'' said \n     Kevin Neely, a spokesman for the Oregon Department of \n     Justice.\n       There is also continued bitterness among West Coast \n     officials toward the Bush administration for waiting until \n     June 2001 before putting price controls on the market, which \n     immediately ended the large price spikes and rolling \n     blackouts and brought stability.\n       Since then, power use has fallen and prices on the short-\n     term market are about where they were before the energy run-\n     up of 2000 and 2001.\n       ``It was a fallacy to blame this crisis on a lack of new \n     power plants,'' said Steven Klein, superintendent of Tacoma, \n     Wash.'s public utility, Tacoma Power. ``But it's a shame what \n     came of this. It put a dent in a lot of family budgets, and \n     forced some businesses to close.''\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. It is impacting people in my State. One of the largest \nemployers in the State, the Boeing Company, has their major \nmanufacturing base located in that particular county. In that county, \nthey have made it clear they planned to build the next generation \nplane. They are not sure whether they are going to build that plane \nthere or even in Washington State. What is on the list of issues about \nwhich they are concerned? The cost of energy, the high cost of energy. \nSo again, individual ratepayers are suffering. Businesses are \nsuffering. Businesses may decide the long-term investment in Washington \nState isn't worth it just because Enron manipulated contracts at a time \nmy consumers and my businesses needed affordable electricity.\n  We are here tonight to talk about this situation and what the Senate \nis going to do about it. It is clear we are not doing enough.\n  I think there are newspapers all over the country who basically have \nsaid we are not doing enough about it. The New York Times said, ``This \nenergy crisis dims small business hopes.'' This is an administration \nthat wants to get the economy on the right track. How can you get the \neconomy on the right track if you won't do anything about manipulated \nenergy contracts? Basically, they say the ``perfect storm is creating a \nreturn of the energy crisis,'' and ``power cuts in the cold winter \nahead for those struggling to pay for electricity.''\n  Just like I said, in Snohomish County, with a 44 percent increase in \ndisconnect notices and an energy crunch, the Northwest might face \nanother power crisis. ``Costs hit home for the energy crisis'' is in \nthe San Francisco Chronicle. Believe me, we are going to hear from my \ncolleagues from California tomorrow about how this crisis has impacted \nthem.\n  Again, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle can spend as much \ntime as they want talking about the need for future energy supply, \nwhich I am all for. About the fact that we should have been building \nmore supply. That is fine. But you have to address the issue. The issue \nis these contracts were manipulated. They were schemed. The American \npeople will come to know them by name--Get Shorty, Fat Boy, and a \nvariety of others. That might seem humorous to some people, but it is \nnot humorous when real people suffer the consequences. We are not doing \nenough about it.\n  So what else have newspapers said? The shocking thing is they \nbasically are saying what I think some of my colleagues, particularly \non the other side of the aisle, want to deny. I am not sure exactly why \nthey don't want to address it. But they say, ``Enron met with energy \nregulators during the crisis.'' ``Enron monitor failed to do the\n\n[[Page S10129]]\n\njob.'' ``Federal energy regulators inept,'' this says. ``Enron execs \noften called the FERC brass during crisis.''\n  What is going on here is we have had this incredible lobbying effort \nby Enron in getting FERC commissioners and doing nothing about this \ncrisis, and playing an overexcessive role. Now we have the choice as \nMembers of the Senate as to whether we are going to stand up and do \nsomething about this.\n  I am outraged and I have been outraged about this issue for some \ntime, because I go home almost every weekend and I see the real \nconsequences of this problem. But even that pales in comparison to the \nsteps I think this body is going to mistakenly take if it passes the \nDomenici electricity title as it is.\n  Mr. President, the Domenici electricity title as it is does nothing \nto protect consumers on power generation. The Domenici electricity \ntitle basically takes the only consumer protection law on the books--\nthe Public Utility Holding Company Act--and repeals it. The good \nSenator from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman, tried to say: ``Are you sure \nwe want to do that because I don't think we should?''\n  If you are going to change the oversight of these utilities, you \nought to put some protections in place. When they do these mergers, \nmaybe we ought to figure out a way that we have some oversight of this \nand protect it. We will have some other amendments--Senator Dayton's \nand some of mine--that say, listen, we cannot go far enough in \nprotecting consumers. How could you go too far in protecting consumers \nwhen we have had one of the biggest energy schemes in our country's \nhistory just unfold in the last couple of years?\n  I applaud this body for passing new accounting requirements. I \napplaud giving the SEC more to do on accountability, making sure that \nbooks are not cooked, that schemes are not put into place. I applaud \nthe Attorney General from New York for his aggressive action in making \nsure that those who have been participating from the financial side in \nhelping to portray to the American people that somehow these companies \nwere healthy, when in fact all they were deploying were buying-and-\nselling schemes with inflated pricing. I applaud all of that. But what \nthis bill fails to do is take a similar step. It fails to take a \nsimilar step because it is repealing the only consumer protection bill \nwe have for electricity.\n\n  So how did we get there? Some of my colleagues mentioned the Federal \nPower Act and the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. During \nthe Roosevelt era, guess what? We saw the same thing. No surprise. A \nbunch of energy companies had total control of the market, created a \npyramid scheme, jacked up the price on consumers. Guess what? The \nRoosevelt administration said: We cannot tolerate this. Consumers need \nto be protected.\n  So 1935 might seem like a long time ago to some of my colleagues, but \nI know one thing--too much concentration of power by a free market does \nnot deliver affordable energy.\n  My State is a big believer in cost-based pricing. We have a lot of \npublic power. That public power provides us with affordable energy. I \nam not opposed to market-based rates. I am not opposed to the free \nenterprise system. As a former businesswoman, I like the marketplace \nwhere businesses can compete and where competition exists, where \nanybody gets nervous when there is too much consolidation and when \nthere is no oversight.\n  So, basically, what we have here in the last 2 years is more of a \nmove toward market-based pricing, without the regulatory oversight. I \nwould love to hear from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nwho think State utility commissions don't have a responsible role in \nmaking sure that utility rates are not too high and too expensive. I \nwould love to hear from my colleagues that somehow they don't think the \nFederal Government should play a role in wholesale rates and in \nassuring consumers that wholesale rates are just and reasonable. But I \ncan tell you this. There is nothing just and reasonable about \nmanipulating contracts. Even Patrick Wood, chairman of the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission, said so before the Energy Committee:\n\n       ``Yes, that is right, Senator Cantwell, contracts that have \n     been manipulated cannot be just and reasonable.''\n\n  So why don't we do something about taking the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission and strengthening it? Why don't we smack them on \nthe hand and say actually you have not done your job, because if you \nwant to go through the sequencing--the issue is that in this timeframe \nof the explosion of the California market and the crisis and the \nproblem, what happened is prices rose to that exorbitant 300 percent \nincrease. We all started saying we need to do something about this; we \nneed to have some sort of price cap or price mitigation.\n  In fact, my predecessor, Slade Gorton, and several other Senators, \nactually wrote letters saying we need to do something about this energy \ncrisis. The former Energy Secretary, now the Governor of New Mexico, \nalso said we have to do something to stop this manipulation of pricing.\n  The prices actually started unfolding in May of 2000 even though a \nvariety of people said there is important business to do here. \nSecretary Richardson, in December of 2000, 4 or 5 months later, said \nthis is an emergency and we need to do something about it.\n  The next day FERC basically decides they are going to deny a request \nto do anything about capping the prices. They are not going to do \nanything! It took the outrage of many Members of Congress, and almost a \nyear later when a bipartisan group of Senators introduced a bill to put \non price caps that in April of 2001 the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission finally responded and said: Oh, yes, these prices are \noutrageous, and we should do something about them.\n  Mind you, all of us were saying during that time period that these \ncontracts have been manipulated. They have been manipulated, and it is \nnot fair. Our ratepayers should not have to pay these exorbitant \nprices. At that time, people were saying: This is just about supply, \nand if you guys built more supply, you would not have a problem. We \nhave come to find out that it is not all about supply. It is about \nthose manipulated contracts.\n  What happened is we finally heard from the source itself: Enron \ndeclaring bankruptcy, an investigation of potential energy market \nmanipulations, and then finally, in March of 2003, FERC issuing this \nreport saying the prices have been manipulated.\n  We had to drag that Federal entity kicking and screaming into the \nrealization that, one, the prices were too high; two, that consumers in \nthe West absolutely needed relief; and three, that these prices have \nbeen manipulated. Now we are trying to drag them into the realization \nthat manipulated contracts that cost ratepayers 54-, 77-, 80-percent \nincreases over the next 5 or 6 years are hardly just and reasonable or \nhardly in the public's interest.\n  The underlying Domenici amendment says: Go ahead and trust these FERC \npeople; they are doing a good job; and let's take away any of those \nbasic tools they have to regulate this industry.\n  I am surprised that some of my colleagues have not said: Let's just \ndo away with FERC and deal with the Power Act. We would be better going \nto court and having the courts decide in our favor than having a \nregulatory entity that fails to do its job. But I know this: tonight \nand tomorrow we should not be talking about repealing the Public \nUtility Holding Company Act. We should not be doing that.\n  PUHCA really does hold companies accountable for their business \nservice to retail customers. It gives the SEC the authority to review \nthese mergers and put a prohibition on acquisitions if they do not \nthink there is evidence that we are going to have efficient rates. It \nmakes sure they review the complex corporate structures. It makes sure \nthat these companies do not exploit the consumer. It really did give \nthe SEC the ability to regulate pyramid schemes that were based on \nfictitious or unsound value assets that had no relationship to fair \nsums of what was being invested and how much the company was worth. It \nis amazing, that was a 1935 act. I guess history really does repeat \nitself because these are the same abuses we have seen in the Enron \nsituation.\n  Remember the maze of affiliates and offshore partnerships that were \npart of the Enron scheme? Remember Enron's diversification into \nbusinesses as far afield as trading of weather derivatives\n\n[[Page S10130]]\n\nand water supply? Remember how Enron inflated their stock price and \nthen it collapsed? It created such a gaping hole for individuals that \nthey ended up losing their entire investment for retirement because of \nthe collapse.\n  I can tell you this: We do not want to repeal PUHCA. What we want to \ndo is have some further securities put in place. Some of those \nsecurities need to respond to these various schemes that have been \nperpetrated on the American consumer.\n  If we could see some of those schemes, I think the American public \nwould be shocked to know that someone actually spent their time \nthinking up schemes in which the market could be manipulated.\n  I even have an article that Enron's Ken Lay admitted that he had gone \nto the then-current FERC Commissioner and said: If you continue to help \nus on this scheme, then we will continue to support you for the \nrenomination of FERC. I guess Mr. Hebert was not quite so supportive \nbecause he was not renominated to that post. I ask unanimous consent \nthat this article be printed in the Record.\n  The being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, May 25, 2001]\n\n          Power Trader Tied to Bush Finds Washington All Ears\n\n                   (By Lowell Bergman and Jeff Gerth)\n\n       Curtis Hebert Jr., Washington's top electricity regulator, \n     said he had barely settled into his new job this year when he \n     had an unsettling telephone conversion with Kenneth L. Lay, \n     the head of the nation's largest electricity trader, the \n     Enron Corporation.\n       Mr. Hebert, chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory \n     Commission, said that Mr. Lay, a close friend of President \n     Bush's, offered him a deal: If he changed his views on \n     electricity deregulation, Enron would continue to support him \n     in his new job.\n       Mr. Hebert (pronounced A-bear) recalled that Mr. Lay \n     prodded him to back a national push for retail competition in \n     the energy business and a faster pace in opening up access to \n     the electricity transmission grid to companies like Enron.\n       Mr. Hebert said he refused the offer. ``I was offended,'' \n     he recalled, though he said he knew of Mr. Lay's influence in \n     Washington and thought the refusal could put his job in \n     jeopardy.\n       Asked about the conversation, Mr. Lay praised Mr. Hebert, \n     but recalled it differently. ``I remember him requesting'' \n     Enron's support at the White House, he said of Mr. Hebert. \n     Mr. Lay said he had ``very possibly'' discussed issues \n     relating to the commission's authority over access to the \n     grid.\n       As to Mr. Hebert's job, Mr. Lay said he told the chairman \n     that ``the final decision on this was going to be the \n     president's, certainly not ours.''\n       Though the accounts of the discussion differ, that it took \n     place at all illustrates Enron's considerable influence in \n     Washington, especially at the commission, the agency \n     authorized to ensure fair prices in the nation's wholesale \n     electricity and natural gas markets, Enron's main business.\n       Mr. Lay has been one of Mr. Bush's largest campaign \n     contributors, and no other energy company gave more money to \n     Republican causes last year than Enron.\n       And it appears that Mr. Hebert may soon be replaced as the \n     commission's chairman, according to Vice President Dick \n     Cheney, the Bush administration's point man on energy policy.\n       Mr. Lay has weighed in on candidates for other commission \n     posts, supplying President Bush's chief personnel adviser \n     with a list of preferred candidates. One Florida utility \n     regulator who hoped for but did not receive an appointment as \n     a commissioner said he had been ``interviewed'' by Mr. \n     Lay.\n       Mr. Lay also had access to the team writing the White \n     House's energy report, which embraces several initiatives and \n     issues dear to Enron.\n       The report's recommendations include finding ways to give \n     the federal government more power over electricity \n     transmission networks, a longtime goal of the company that \n     was spelled out in a memorandum Mr. Lay discussed during a \n     30-minute meeting earlier this spring with Mr. Cheney.\n       Mr. Cheney's report includes much of what Mr. Lay advocated \n     during their meeting, documents show. Both men deny \n     discussing commission personnel issues during their talk. But \n     Mr. Lay had an unusual opportunity to make his case about \n     candidates in writing and in person to Mr. Bush's personnel \n     adviser, Clay Johnson. And when Mr. Bush picked nominees to \n     fill two vacant Republican slots on the five-member \n     commission, they both had the backing of Enron, as well as \n     other companies.\n       Mr. Lay is not shy about voicing his opinion or flexing his \n     political muscle. He has transformed the Houston-based Enron \n     from a sleepy natural-gas company into a $100 billion energy \n     giant with global reach, trading electricity in all corners \n     of the world and owning a multibillion-dollar power project \n     in India. He has also led the push to deregulate the nation's \n     electricity markets.\n       Senior Bush administration officials said they welcomed Mr. \n     Lay's input but did not always embrace it: President Bush \n     backed away from curbing carbon-dioxide emissions, an effort \n     supported by Enron, which had looked to trade emission rights \n     as part of its energy business.\n       ``We'll make decisions based on what we think makes sound \n     public policy,'' Mr. Cheney said in an interview, not what \n     ``Enron thinks.''\n       The Bush-Lay bond traces back to Mr. Bush's father and \n     involves a personal and philosophical affinity. Moreover, \n     Enron and its executives gave $2.4 million to federal \n     candidates in the last election, more than any other energy \n     company. While some of that went to Democrats, 72 percent \n     went to Republicans, according to an analysis of election \n     records by the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit \n     group.\n       ``He's for a lot of things we're for,'' said Mr. Johnson.\n       But when it came to deciding on nominees for the \n     commission, Mr. Johnson said that Mr. Lay's views were not \n     that crucial. The two most important advisers, he said, were \n     Andrew Lundquist, the director of Mr. Cheney's energy task \n     force, and Pat Wood 3rd, the head of the Texas public utility \n     commission.\n       As governor, Mr. Bush named Mr. Wood to the utility \n     commission. This year, when the White House filled the two \n     Republican slots on the federal agency, Mr. Wood was the \n     first choice, Mr. Johnson said.\n       Consumer advocates and business executives praise Mr. Wood. \n     But Mr. Lay also had a role in promoting him. Shortly after \n     Mr. Bush was elected governor in 1994, Mr. Lay sent him a \n     letter endorsing Mr. Wood as the ``best qualified'' person \n     for the Texas commission.\n       In all, there are five seats on the commission, two held by \n     Republicans, two by Democrats and one held by a chairman who \n     serves at the pleasure of the president. Mr. Hebert, who \n     became a commissioner in 1997, was named chairman by Mr. Bush \n     in January.\n       The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's mandate to \n     ensure fair prices in wholesale electricity and natural gas \n     markets makes it crucial to sellers like Enron as well as \n     consumers.\n       The movement toward deregulation sometimes leaves the \n     commission caught in a tug of war: power marketers like Enron \n     are trying to break into markets and grids controlled by old-\n     line utilities, which operate under state regulation. The \n     commission's chairman has considerable latitude in setting \n     its agenda.\n       As part of its oversight of the wholesale electricity \n     markets, the commission ordered several companies to refund \n     what it considered excessively high prices this year in \n     California. One lesser offender named in the commission's \n     public filings--$3.2 million, of a total of $125 million--was \n     an Enron subsidiary in Oregon.\n       Enron owns few generating assets, but buys and sells \n     electricity in the market. Many of those transactions \n     resemble the complicated risk-shifting techniques used by \n     Wall Street for financial instruments.\n       Mr. Hebert, after he became chairman, initiated an \n     examination into the effects those techniques have on the \n     electricity markets. ``One of our problems is that we do not \n     have the expertise to truly unravel the complex arbitrage \n     activities of a company like Enron,'' he said, adding, \n     ``we're trying to do it now, and we may have some results \n     soon.''\n       William L. Massey, one of the agency's two democratic \n     commissioners, said he supported the inquiry but had not been \n     aware of it--an indication of the chairman's ability to set \n     the commission's agenda.\n       Finally, the commission is trying to speed the pace of \n     electricity deregulation by opening up the nation's \n     transmission grid, much of which is owned by privately owned \n     utilities that enjoy retail monopolies. Some Enron officials \n     say the commission has been moving too slowly to open the \n     grid. They attribute some of the problem to utilities. But \n     they also fault Mr. Hebert.\n       ``Hebert still has undeserved confidence in some of the \n     vertically integrated companies coming to the table and \n     dealing openly'' with transmission access issues, said \n     Richard S. Shapiro, an Enron senior vice president.\n       The utilities, however, maintain that they provide cheap \n     and reliable service for their customers. Washington \n     lobbyists for one Southern utility said that Enron was really \n     interested in focusing on the utility's big-business clients, \n     which under state regulation pay higher rates than \n     residential customers.\n       Since 1996, about half the states have moved to open their \n     retail markets to competition, and the commission has begun \n     to make it easier for outsiders to use the nation's \n     transmission grid. But the promise of cheaper rates has been \n     largely unfulfilled. So the push for more deregulation, in \n     which Enron has been a leader, has slowed, especially when \n     California's flawed program led to skyrocketing rates and \n     chaotic markets.\n       Mr. Hebert is a free-market conservative who favors \n     deregulation but also recognizes the importance of state's \n     rights. A former Mississippi regulator, he is a protege of \n     Trent Lott, the Senate Republican leader from Mississippi. \n     Mr. Hebert said Mr. Lott was instrumental in his nomination \n     to the commission in 1997 by President Clinton.\n       President Bush elevated Mr. Hebert to chairman on \n     Inauguration Day, a move Mr. Lay said he told the White House \n     he supported.\n       Mr. Johnson, the White House personnel chief, said that Mr. \n     Lott and Mr. Hebert had both been told that Mr. Hebert could \n     remain\n\n[[Page S10131]]\n\n      chairman at least until the administration's nominees--Mr. \n     Wood and Nora Brownell, a Pennsylvania utility regulator--are \n     confirmed by the full Senate. The Senate energy committee \n     voted earlier this week to approve the two nominees, after a \n     hearing last week indicated strong support.\n       It is widely expected that President Bush will name Mr. \n     Wood to replace Mr. Hebert as chairman after the Senate acts.\n       In an interview for a forthcoming episode of ``Frontline,'' \n     the PBS series, Mr. Cheney suggested as much. ``Pat Wood's \n     got to be the new chairman of the F.E.R.C., and he'll have to \n     address'' various problems in the electricity markets, he \n     said.\n       Mr. Hebert said that no one had told him he was being \n     replaced. If someone else is named chairman, Mr. Hebert can \n     remain a commissioner until the end of his term, which \n     expires in 2004.\n       It was a few weeks after President Bush made him chairman \n     Mr. Hebert said he spoke by telephone with Mr. Lay.\n       Mr. Lay told him that ``he and Enron would like to support \n     me as chairman, but we would have to agree on principles'' \n     involving the commission's role in expanding electricity \n     competition, Mr. Hebert said of the conversation.\n       A senior commission official who was in Hebert's office \n     during the conversation said Mr. Hebert rebuffed Mr. Lay's \n     offer of a quid pro quo. The official said that he heard Mr. \n     Hebert's side of the conversation and then, after the call \n     ended, learned the rest from him.\n       Mr. Hebert said that he, too, backed competition but did \n     not think the commission had the legal authority to tell \n     states what to do in this area. Concerning the issue of \n     opening transmission access through the creation of regional \n     networks, Mr. Hebert supports a voluntary process while Enron \n     seeks a faster and more compulsory system.\n       Mr. Lay said that while he might have discussed issues \n     relating to the commission's authority concerning access to \n     the grid, ``there was never any intent'' to link that or any \n     other issue to Mr. Hebert's job status.\n       The commission is a quasijudicial agency, so decision-\n     makers like Mr. Hebert must avoid private discussions about \n     specific matters pending before the commission. Mr. Hebert \n     and Mr. Lay both said that line was not crossed, but Mr. \n     Hebert said he had never had such a blunt talk with an \n     energy-industry executive.\n       Mr. Lay added that his few recent conversations with Mr. \n     Hebert were nothing special. ``We had a lot of access during \n     the Clinton administration,'' he said.\n       And he said that while making political contributions \n     ``probably helps'' to gain access to an official, he made \n     them ``because I'm supporting candidates I strongly believe \n     in.''\n       Last June, Enron executives were asked to make voluntary \n     donations to the company's political action committee. The \n     solicitation letter noted that the company faced a range of \n     governmental issues, including electricity deregulation.\n       This year, some people who sought but did not get \n     nominations to the commission said that Mr. Lay and Enron had \n     had a role in the process.\n       One was Joe Garcia, a former Florida utilities regulator \n     and prominent Cuban-American activist. He said he had been \n     ``interviewed'' by a few Enron officials, including Mr. Lay, \n     who he said had not been as ``forceful or insistent'' as the \n     other Enron officials.\n       But in their conversation, Mr. Garcia said, Mr. Lay made \n     clear that he would be visiting the White House, adding that \n     ``everyone knew of his relationship and his importance.''\n       Mr. Johnson, the White House personnel chief, could not \n     cite another company besides Enron that sent him a list of \n     preferred candidates for the commission, but he remembered \n     hearing the views of Tom Kuhn, who heads the utility industry \n     trade group, the Edison Electric Institute. Mr. Kuhn was a \n     classmate of Mr. Johnson and Mr. Bush at Yale.\n       As for his conversation with Mr. Garcia, Mr. Lay said he \n     was comfortable with his candidacy but ``I'm not sure what I \n     told him about my friends at the White House.''\n       This article is part of a joint reporting project with the \n     PBS series ``Frontline,'' which will broadcast a documentary \n     about California's energy crisis on June 5.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, what are these schemes that were \nperpetrated on ratepayers in the West?\n  Get Shorty is a scheme that individuals may have read about in the \npaper, or maybe some individuals know from being in California or \nhearing parts of what happened in Washington State or Oregon. I thought \nit was the title of a movie. I did not know it was a clever marketing \ntool presented by a bunch of executives at an energy company to \nmanipulate the prices so my ratepayers might pay more. I could not \nbelieve something like that would happen.\n  Another scheme that was part of the process is Load Shift, another \nway in which the individual consumer did not understand that some \ntrading was going on with the price, and yet prices could be inflated \nand because, again, we had a shortage and had to go out and buy on the \nspot market, we were trapped at buying at that high rate.\n  There is another attempt to defraud consumers known as the Silver \nPeak Incident. Silver Peak refers to a major transmission line in \nCalifornia but is outlined in an internal Enron e-mail that was made \npublic by the FERC investigation. It is also synonymous with a scheme \nthat was concocted by the Enron chief trader of the West who has since \npled guilty to charges of conspiracy to commit fraud, Mr. Tim Belden, \nand on May 25, 1999, Mr. Belden filed 2,900 megawatts of an offer to \nsell within the California PX, the transmission line that could carry \nonly 17 megawatts of power.\n  So the California PX and ISO did, in fact, detect that there was an \nanomaly. They ended up raising the price 71 percent that day, and \neventually Enron and the PX reached a settlement in which the company \npaid a $25,000 fine. It shows the kinds of problems that are in these \nvarious schemes, Fat Boy, also known as Icing Load, basically into \nrealtime power markets. According to a smoking gun memo that Enron had \nissued on December 6 and December 8, Fat Boy was one of the most \nfundamental strategies used by traders. According to one trader, it is \none of the oldest tricks in the book. It is now being used by other \nmarket participants.\n  I want to read to my colleagues how Enron's own attorney described \nFat Boy, but first remember how the market worked. It was the job of \nthe California system to balance the supply and demand within \nCalifornia's transmission, and that required market participants to \nsubmit schedules of how much power they planned ahead of time. Given \nthat there are various fluctuations because of weather and the demand \nthat consumers have, it was simply a fact of life that marketers and \nutilities were not able to forecast to the exact megawatt the precise \namount that would be needed.\n  Thus, in order to ensure that the lights stayed on, the ISO would \noffer payments to utilities that would increase their generation in \nrealtime in order to make sure that supply and demand matched up. So to \ntake advantage of the situation, Enron would anticipate when the market \nwas going to be short on supply. It would then submit a false day-ahead \nschedule loading the lines with generation it knew it had no intention \nof really using. That way, when it accessed the portion of power it put \non the realtime grid, it would receive extra payments from the ISOs in \nkeeping the lights on. That is right. By falsifying its day-ahead \nschedules, Enron received untold millions for pretending to keep the \nlights on in the West. I can assure my colleagues that is a very cruel \njoke to play on consumers in the West.\n  So what we have before us in the Domenici amendment is a failure to \nprotect consumers in the repeal of PUHCA and in the continuation of not \noutlawing these very practices that Enron has deployed. What we want to \ndo is take all these schemes and include them in an amendment that I \nwill lay down tomorrow that basically bans market manipulation. Yes, I \nwould like to see us adopt the Dayton amendment that keeps the 1935 law \non the books. Because, yes, left alone, energy marketers have shown \nthat even after 70-plus years, they can recreate the same types of \nmarket manipulation. So we need to have protections in place.\n  Round-trip trading is not the only thing that needs to be addressed \nin this bill in addition to PUHCA. What needs to be addressed, besides \nprotecting the Public Utility Holding Company Act and keeping that on \nthe books, and besides saying that round-trip trading is a problem, we \nalso need to make sure these various other schemes, the Wheel Out \nscheme--I do not know who the marketing person was who thought of these \nthemes. I am amazed--the Black Widow scheme, the Cuddly Bear scheme, \nthe Red Congo scheme--people can see we are having a tough time getting \nall of these charts up here because there were so many schemes of \nmanipulation, basically undertaken by a variety of individuals who \nthought this was a great idea to make money--the INC-ing scheme and the \nNon-Firm Export scheme.\n  The amendment I will lay down tomorrow says all of these \nmanipulations, not just on day-trip trading but all of these practices \nare illegal; that the Senate will not put up with market\n\n[[Page S10132]]\n\nmanipulation; that the Senate has seen, not just on the Democratic side \nof the aisle but the Republican side of the aisle--I want my Republican \ncolleagues to join with us tomorrow and say that market manipulation is \nwrong--that it is wrong and we believe we need stronger consumer \nprotections; that we think the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \nshould be given the powers to make sure we are protected from these \nschemes; that we have done our job from the Enron crisis, where we have \nlearned that we need to do a better job on accounting practices; that \nwe have learned that we need to do a better job on requirements of the \nSEC and, yes, we in the Senate understand that energy prices can be \nmanipulated and we are going to do a better job of making sure the \ntools stay in place to protect consumers. That new enhancements to \nthose tools prohibit these kinds of schemes from ever happening again.\n\n  As painful as this crisis has been for Washington State and for the \nWest, this particular amendment I am offering is really about our next \nsteps moving forward. It is about natural gas pricing. It is about the \nfuture manipulation that could happen if we do not put protections in \nplace. It is about saying that we want to make sure, as we continue \ntowards a diversified energy plan for our country, getting more natural \ngas from Alaska with a new pipeline, looking at renewable energy, \nlooking at conservation, looking at all sorts of alternative fuels, \nplanning for the hydrogen fuel economy, that while we are doing all of \nthose things, we are going to make sure market manipulation does not \ntake place. That is what is at stake with the amendments we are going \nto be voting on tomorrow.\n  Mine will not be the only amendment. As I have mentioned several \ntimes, Senator Dayton has a great amendment in which he says we should \nleave the Public Utility Holding Company Act in place. I am trying to \nstop these marketing schemes from being foiled on other States and \nother economies. I am trying to say the billion-plus that was lost in \nWashington State and the over $3 billion that was lost in California is \neconomic havoc that should never happen again to another State in this \ncountry.\n  To do that, we have to pass the Cantwell amendment that says these \nmarket manipulations are outlawed. That is what we are going to try to \ndo tomorrow. I hope my colleagues will take the time tonight to \nunderstand this.\n  I point out my colleagues have talked about this Energy bill and the \nvarious aspects of that Energy bill in a way that would leave most \nthinking these are simple issues and we should basically dispense with \nthem quickly. As I said, $6 billion to the west coast economy--and that \nis just the costs of additional power that we have had to buy at higher \nrates; that is not the ancillary costs of other businesses who have had \nto shut down.\n  We have had a paper company in Everett, WA, threaten if we have one \nadditional rate increase of even a couple percentages, they will \nprobably have to shut down that facility. We have had aluminum plants \nthroughout the State of Washington that had to shut down for periods of \ntime. If we have another rate increase they could be shut down \npermanently. We are talking thousands of jobs. We have had other \nindustries say they do not think they could survive another rate \nincrease.\n  It is hard when we have challenges to not say we should have a rate \nincrease. My response is, why can't we get out of these long-term \ncontracts by Enron? Why can't we renegotiate what have been manipulated \ncosts we in Washington have had to pay for? When I think of what has \nhappened to Washington State, we are talking about more than $6 \nbillion. We owe it to people to have a debate about these issues.\n  I plan to offer several other amendments. It is incredible we allow \nbig companies such as Enron to lobby for and to support the nomination \nof these FERC commissioners. Why should a big company like Enron get to \ninfluence the administration on who should chair a regulatory entity \nwhose job is to regulate that very entity that is pushing their \nnomination? I will have an amendment about that.\n  I think the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which engages in 15 \ncalls with Wall Street to tell them when and how they are going to make \ndecisions on these contracts and whether they are just and reasonable. \nI don't see why we should have a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \nthat spends its time telling Wall Street in advance whether they should \ntry to settle manipulated contracts out of court with clients. I don't \nthink that is their job.\n  We ought to have more protection on cost-based pricing than we have. \nWe will have other amendments that try to address this issue about what \nwe do about the fact that this voluminous report by the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission says all these contracts have been manipulated. \nYet they fail to do nothing about it when the Federal Power Act says it \nis the commission's job to do something about unjust and unreasonable \nrates. That is what the Federal statute gave the authority to FERC to \ndo, to make sure on wholesale rates the consumer was not gouged with \nunjust and unreasonable rates.\n  Now we have a Federal entity saying, yes, they certainly are \nmanipulated contracts. These schemes are unbelievable, but we are not \ngoing to do anything as regulators to help the ratepayers out of this \nsituation. We will have an amendment addressing the failure of FERC to \ndo anything about these manipulated contracts.\n  Some of my other colleagues will have amendments dealing with this \nsection. I don't know whether Senator Feinstein will offer her \namendment on derivatives but, again, that is another loophole Enron \nwalked itself through by coming to Congress and lobbying for an \nexemption to the Futures Commodities Trading Act. They said online \ntrades ought to be exempt. That was very smart of them to get that \nloophole. Why? Because then all online trading, that some of these \nschemes are the names for, was completed online where prices were \nmanipulated in trades, inflated, and consumers ended up paying the \nhigher price.\n\n  They get the derivatives loophole in the futures commodity. We say in \nAmerica you can trade futures on corn and a variety of other \nagriculture products but you have to have open books. You have to have \ntransparency. You have to show what you are actually doing so that if \nthere is some sort of manipulation of the market you can come in and \nsee what that manipulation is, a regulator can investigate.\n  But no, this body, several years ago, probably unknowing as to the \nunbelievable impact, said, let's go ahead and give them this exemption.\n  We found that a loophole big enough to drive a truck through--I \nshould say big enough to drive billions of dollars through; that gouged \nconsumers. I hope Senator Feinstein will offer her derivatives \namendment, which I cosponsor, to close that loophole.\n  Some of my colleagues say, we voted on that already; it failed. I ask \nmy colleagues, we voted on that amendment before we knew of all these \nschemes about manipulation. Now we know these schemes and manipulation \nhave happened and we are not going to try to do something to close \nthose loopholes? It is something we need to bring front and center to \nthe American people, demonstrating we here are doing our job. We are \ndoing enough to get something done.\n  I have letters from various constituents through the West who \nchronicled events that have happened to them, individuals who have \neither sent E-mails, letters or various documentations about the \nproblems they have seen in the energy market. The various costs they \nhave endured paying for additional electricity, which then meant they \nhad to make other choices. I know people that not only were part of \nthat 44 percent increase in disconnect rates. People who had to make \nother choices about education, about vacations, including a sad story \nfrom a woman who could not even send her daughter to the prom because \nshe could not afford to buy a dress because that money went to their \nenergy bill instead.\n  What it comes down to tomorrow is whether we are going to allow this \nmanipulation of Fat Boy, Get Shorty, Ricochet, Death Star, which the \nDomenici amendment is silent on. Whether we are going to take a vote to \nsay that market manipulation is wrong.\n  What are we going to say to ratepayers who had to pay 88 percent \nincreases, 61 percent increases, 54 percent\n\n[[Page S10133]]\n\nincreases, 71 percent increases, 43 percent increases? Again, these \naren't increases for 1 year, these are increases that my ratepayers are \nstuck with. They are stuck with them because they signed an Enron \ncontract and because we have a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \nthat basically says: Yes, they have been manipulated, but we don't \ncare, you still have to pay that rate.\n  I do not want this to happen to other parts of the country. I don't \nwant to see economies like the Northwest economy, or the west coast \neconomy, which is a critical part of our Nation's economy, suffer the \nconsequences of manipulation of energy prices. The American people, to \nwhom I have to answer when I go home to Washington State, or in other \nparts of the country if I travel, say to me: How come I am stuck with \nan 88 percent rate increase? How come I am stuck with a 61 percent rate \nincrease? How come I am losing my job because our company can't afford \nthe high electricity costs? or, How come my school district is paying \nhigh electricity rates and we have to pay a higher tuition? How come \nour school district is asking for a levy because we have higher \nelectricity rates? People are not even taking action on giving us \nrelief.\n  We will come back at this body on what we should do about past bad \nactions. But what we need to do tomorrow on the Cantwell market \nmanipulation amendment is say that market manipulation of energy prices \nis wrong and that an energy title that fails to address these issues is \nnot satisfactory.\n  I could take the last few minutes I have tonight, of my 1 hour, and \ntell you six or seven things that are also wrong with the Domenici \nelectricity title. There are lots of schemes in there that run towards \na market-based system on regional transmission organization and \nstandard market design that I know my colleagues from the South and \nparts of the West probably are not too anxious to hear about, aren't \ntoo excited that I put in play. The Domenici amendment is a step closer \nto that.\n  Why do they want more of a free market? Because they want to see \nhaving that free market without the regulatory aspects of the Public \nUtility Holding Company Act, or having oversight of mergers, or having \nthese kinds of hammers making sure no manipulation takes place. They \nwant to see how much further prices can be manipulated. They want to \nsee how they can have a free rein on what really is a needed utility \nfor the American people.\n  I think, regarding those RTO and standard market design schemes that \nare also part of the Domenici underlying amendment, it is the \nabsolutely wrong time to be talking about moving towards more change. \nWe have just had this crisis. My State is still paying for this crisis. \nWe are going to still be paying for it for years.\n  I understand the President is coming to the Northwest in August. I \nhope the President has an answer for why his administration, and the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission, have not dealt with this issue. I \nhope he has an answer, to say to ratepayers why we should continue to \nbe gouged on this issue; why we in the West, even though contracts have \nbeen manipulated, still have to pay those prices.\n  I would say to him: Mr. President, Washington State has a bright \nfuture. It still has a software economy. It still has an aerospace \nindustry. Yes, it has been challenged, but it is still strong. We have \na burgeoning biotech industry. We have a huge trade community. We have \na vibrant, diverse agricultural economy throughout our State. But none \nof those can continue to exist with exorbitant energy prices that have \nbeen manipulated.\n\n  I hope when he comes to Washington State, he has an answer. I can \ntell you right now, that answer will not be well received if it is \nabout just creating more supply. We are all for creating more supply in \nWashington State, and we are all for diversifying, but we are not for \nmarket manipulation.\n  We have to think through these other aspects of the Domenici \namendment on RTOs, regional transmission organizations, standard market \ndesign and the other elements that really do call into question our \nability to regulate the cost of electricity, for which the American \npeople count on us. I hate to think, after 70 years of having a similar \npyramid scheme push us into having the Public Utility Holding Company \nAct, that somehow this body will not get the message. Instead of just \ndealing with this crisis that we have dealt with in electricity--maybe \nnot next year, maybe not in 5 years, but 7 years down the road--we end \nup having a similar crisis with natural gas, and, instead of just \naffecting the west coast and Washington ratepayers, it impacts the \nwhole country.\n  Fair energy prices are part of having a healthy economy. Affordable \nenergy prices help to continue to stimulate economic growth. But \nmanipulated energy prices are not just. They are not reasonable. They \nare not in the public interest. This body ought to take strong action \nagainst them.\n  I know my colleagues all care about this issue. We wanted to do the \nright thing on securities law. We wanted to do the right thing on \naccounting law. It is time, with the Cantwell amendment tomorrow, to do \nthe right thing on making sure that energy market manipulation is \nprevented and does not happen again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

HOULIHAN: A LIFETIME OF GIVING\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute a great man, a \ncompassionate public servant, a decorated war hero and a beloved \nhusband, father and grandfather, John J. Houlihan, who died of lung \ncancer, Thursday, July 24, in his Palos Heights home surrounded by his \nloving family.\n  Born in 1923 on Chicago's South Side to the son of a slaughterhouse \nworker, John Houlihan graduated from Leo High School in 1941. Shortly \nafter the attack on Pearl Harbor in December of that year, John \nenlisted in the United States Marines. He was shipped to the South \nPacific where he saw action in the Battle of Midway.\n  On his 21st birthday, during a battle on the South Pacific island of \nBougainville, he was hit by enemy artillery fire and lost his left leg. \nJohn Houlihan was awarded a Purple Heart, the Marine Corps Medal and \nthe Asian Pacific Medal with 3 Bronze Stars.\n  He spent the next year and a half in Veterans' Administration \nhospitals recuperating from his wounds and undergoing physical therapy. \nDuring that time, a friend persuaded him to attend a church dance in \nChicago. It was at that dance that John met his future wife, Vernal. \nTogether they would raise a wonderful family of eight children.\n  Even while bouncing on crutches, John taught his children how to \nswim, ride bikes and hit baseballs. He taught them music and the joys \nof being a Notre Dame football fan. As his daughter Maureen has said, \nJohn's children grew up learning the Notre Dame fight song and the \nMarine Corps hymn.\n  After leaving the military, John attended DePaul University, where he \nstudied business and accounting, and began working in the Cook County \nClerk's office. He later worked in the offices of State Treasurers \nJerome Cosentino and Pat Quinn.\n  A loyal Democrat, John was elected to the Illinois General Assembly \nin 1965 and served 8 years in the State house, representing the 41st \nDistrict in the Park Forest area. He was also elected as a delegate to \nseveral democratic national conventions. While in the legislature, John \nstarted insurance and accounting businesses.\n  Following his service in the General Assembly, John's attention \nturned to veterans' rights and veterans' services. He became the first \ndirector of the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs when former \nGovernor Dan Walker tapped him to head the fledgling agency. He \ndeveloped programs for the Veterans' Administration in Washington under \nformer President Jimmy Carter, and most recently was supervisor of the \nCook County Veterans Assistance Commission. John spent decades fighting \nfor veterans' rights, winning honors and accolades along the way, \nincluding the first-ever Cook County Veterans' Recognition Award in \n2000.\n  Looking over this long list of accomplishments, I think anyone would \ncome to the conclusion that this was a great public servant. But what \nthose of us who knew John will tell you is that he was also a great \nhuman being.\n  Meet John Houlihan just once, the story goes, and he would greet you \nby name years later. If you were a veteran who needed help, John \nHoulihan was the man to see. It didn't matter if you were rich or poor, \nblack or white, Democrat or Republican, John Houlihan's door--and his \nheart--were always open to you.\n  They say some people are naturals when it comes to politics and \npublic service. Some people have the right temperament, the right \npersonality and the right mix of talents to be a good leader. John \ncertainly had all of those things. But in truth, John had something \nthat distinguished him from the crowd--a passion to help others and to \nmake sure they got a fair shake. A passion for life and a belief that \ngiving of yourself in the service of others was the highest calling.\n  John Houlihan gave completely of himself on the battlefields in the \nSouth Pacific; in the legislative fights on the House floor in \nSpringfield; in VA hospitals and service centers all across Illinois \nand the rest of the Nation; and every day to his wife and his children \nand his grandchildren.\n  Mother Teresa, the late Roman Catholic nun and missionary, once said: \n``We do no great things--we do only small things with great love.'' \nJohn Houlihan knew that. He showed us with his life. He will be greatly \nmissed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/29/senate-section/article/S10134-4", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10134]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              SINGAPORE SHOULD INCREASE PRESSURE ON BURMA\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I do not intend to delay consideration \nof the U.S.-Singapore free-trade agreement, but I do want to take a \nmoment to highlight a significant step that Singapore can take today to \nfurther the cause of freedom in Burma.\n  It has been reported, by U.N. Special Envoy Razali Ismail and others, \nthat the repressive and illegitimate State Peace and Development \nCouncil, SPDC, has assets tucked away in Singapore financial \ninstitutions. Given the many illicit activities of the SPDC, one can \nrightfully question the source of these funds.\n  Like the United States, Singapore should immediately freeze the \nSPDC's assets until such time that democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi \nand other all democrats are freed from detention and a process of \nnational reconciliation is agreed to and implemented by all parties--\nthe National League for Democracy, ethnic nationalities, and the SPDC.\n  Such action not only underscores Singapore's commitment to the rule \nof law throughout the region, but places much needed pressure on the \njunta in Rangoon to change their oppressive ways.\n  Southeast Asian countries can no longer ignore the many threats to \nregional stability posed by the generals in Burma. The situation in \nBurma should be a matter of concern to all of Burma's neighbors--and \nthe U.N. Security Council.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/29/senate-section/article/S10134-5", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10134-S10135]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MAKING IT EASIER FOR BAD APPLE GUN DEALERS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, last week I spoke about a report, released \nby the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, that identified a list \nof 10 ``bad apple'' gun dealers. According to data released by the \nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearm and Explosives, the dealers cited \nin the Brady Campaign report were the source of thousands of guns \ntraced to criminal activity. Earlier this week, despite the startling \ninformation contained in the Brady report, the House of Representatives \nincluded an amendment in the Commerce, Justice, and State Departments \nappropriations bill which would not only make reports like the Brady \nCampaign's much more difficult to produce but also might cripple the \nability of the ATF to enforce the nation's gun safety laws against \nfirearms dealers who supply guns to criminals.\n  The House amendment would prohibit the public release of information \nrelated to the importation and production of firearms. This means that \nthe only reliable national information available as to how many guns \nare produced in a given year, as well as type, caliber, and \nmanufacturer, would no longer be available to the public. Further, the \namendment would prohibit the public release of information related to \nmultiple handgun sales. Under current law, dealers are required to \nnotify the ATF of the sale of two or more handguns to the same person \nwithin 5\n\n[[Page S10135]]\n\nbusiness days. Eliminating the availability of this data would make it \neven more difficult to monitor the activities of reckless gun dealers. \nIn addition, the amendment would prohibit the release of information \nrelated to crime-gun tracing requests.\n  The amendment would also prohibit the ATF from issuing a rule \nrequiring Federal Firearm Licensees to submit to a physical inventory. \nA physical inventory recently revealed that a Tacoma, WA, gun dealer \ncould not account for the sniper rifle used by the Washington, D.C. \narea sniper and more than 200 other guns in its inventory. The \namendment would also require the immediate destruction of records of \napproved firearms purchases and transfers generated by the National \nInstant Criminal Background Check System. The retention of these record \nhas assisted law enforcement officials in trying to prevent guns from \ngetting into the hands of criminals, as well as identifying gun \ntrafficking patterns.\n  I believe this provision could shield reckless and negligent gun \ndealers from public scrutiny and weaken the ATF's oversight and \nenforcement authority. It will hopefully be rejected here in the \nSenate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/29/senate-section/article/S10135-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10135]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in Boston, \nMA. On July 4, 2003, a group of teens attacked a lesbian woman, Lisa \nCraig, at a Fourth of July fireworks display in Piers Park. Craig, her \npartner, and her two daughters were picnicking and watching fireworks. \nThe trouble began at the park's playground when a group of teens began \nshouting homophobic epithets. When Craig asked the groups to leave, she \nwas struck in the head by one of the teens. The attackers continued to \npunch and kick Craig as she was bleeding on the ground. Given the \nseverity of her head injuries, Craig underwent 2 operations and \nreceived over 200 stitches.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/29/senate-section/article/S10135-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10135-S10136]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, for nearly 15 years, our country engaged \nin a bitter struggle with the tyrannical regime of Saddam Hussein. We \nargued, negotiated, debated, and compromised with this brutal dictator, \nand yet the results were always the same: deception, deceit, and lies. \nIn the meantime, thousands of innocent Iraqis were raped, tortured, or \nmurdered. Some disappeared entirely, never to be seen again. Meanwhile, \nIraq's enormous wealth was pilfered and squandered by Saddam's cronies \nwho were more concerned about their collection of foreign sports cars \nthan ensuring the Iraqi people had running water and sufficient \nelectricity.\n  It is easy to lose sight of how far we have come. As we constantly \nhear stories of the guerrilla style warfare, of secret Iraqi resistance \ngroups, and the criticism regarding the pace of reconstruction, we \nforget about the people we have saved or the freedom we have provided. \nIraqis are now truly free, and we must remember that.\n  Change is not instantaneous, particularly when it comes to freeing a \npeople who have been oppressed for over 25 years. As the Center for \nStrategic and International Studies recently reported, the \nreconstruction in Iraq will be an enormous task. We cannot and should \nnot expect immediate results: decades of neglect and degradation cannot \nbe overcome by the simple exertion of will. No, rebuilding of Iraq will \nbe a slow and deliberate process. It cannot be rushed, and we must \nremember that we have only been rebuilding for 11 weeks.\n  The recommendations from the CSIS report were helpful in identifying \nthose areas that we need to work on. For example, the CSIS team found \nthat public safety remains the primary concern for many Iraqis as well \nas American commanders and recommends quickly expanding the Iraqi \ncivilian defense forces. Another critical recommendation is finding \nwork for unemployed Iraqis who have far too much time to consider their \nplight. Realistically, I believe agriculture and construction could \nprovide that employment.\n  Though we still have a long road ahead, we should also recognize how \nfar we have come. Saddam's brutal dictatorship is no longer in power, \nand we have taken steps to track down members of his former regime. The \nrecent killing of Saddam's two sons was an important victory, and it \nappears that it will only be a matter of time before we catch Saddam. \nThe Iraqi people are starting to realize that Saddam is not coming back \nto power and that freedom is truly theirs.\n  We have also restored most of the public utilities and improved \nsecurity. Thousands of Iraqis are joining the country's new civil \ndefense force, which will free up thousands of American troops for \nother missions. And oil revenue is increasing daily, helping defray the \ncosts of running the country.\n  Perhaps most significantly, Iraq's governing council has convened and \nthe process of developing a formal structure for governing the country \nhas begun. We also must not forget that 85 percent of the cities are \nnow governed by local Iraqi leaders.\n  Despite this amazing progress, some have criticized the \nadministration's approach to Iraq. For example, many have wanted to \nknow when our troops will come home for some time. Unfortunately, the \nArmy was unable to provide a rotation schedule until recently because \nof ongoing military operations and security concerns.\n  This concern resonated in my home State as well. In Colorado, we have \nbeen awaiting word on when the local soldiers from the 3rd Armored \nCavalry based at Fort Carson might return since the end of Operation \nIraqi Freedom. Thankfully, the Army recently announced its unit \nrotation schedule, which means that if all goes according to plan, many \nof the units in Iraq, including the 3rd Armored Cavalry, will be home \nwithin a year.\n  This information will bring joy to our troops who have served so \nvaliantly over the last several months. It will also give hope to the \nmany families who had been patiently awaiting for information on when \ntheir loved ones might return. We should not forget that without their \nsupport and sacrifice, our troops would not be able to function. It is \ntheir families who give our troops strength.\n  This is why I have been working with nonprofit organizations like the \nArmed Forces Foundation that have been providing support to these \nfamilies during this prolonged deployment. During the August recess, \nfor example, I will be joining the Armed Forces Foundation in \norganizing a fishing trip for the children of the soldiers form Fort \nCarson. While activities like the children's fishing trip cannot \nreplace a mother or father, they can lift the spirits of these families \nwho have sacrificed so much.\n  Other criticism, however, is completely unjustified at this time. For \nexample, some pushed for cost estimates on our future operations in \nIraq, which everyone knows is nearly impossible to predict at this \ntime. Department officials can't look into their crystal ball and pull \nout the magic number. Future operations in Iraq may cost more than the \n$4 billion we are currently spending or they may cost less. We just \ndon't know at this time, and we won't know until Iraq is completely \nstabilized.\n  Another criticism centers on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction \nprograms. Almost all of us believed, and many of us still believe, Iraq \nhad weapons of mass destruction. And what happened to these weapons is \na legitimate question.\n  Our forces have not found these weapons yet, but that does not mean \nthey didn't exist or that we wont' find them in the future. There are \nfew matters that our intelligence agencies have ever conclusively \nagreed on. One of those was that Iraq was developing weapons of mass \ndestruction. Last October's National Intelligence Estimate clearly lays \nout the intelligence supporting this belief.\n\n[[Page S10136]]\n\n  What attracted so much attention, unfortunately, was the use of \nparticular pieces of intelligence in speeches by administration \nofficials. The President's State of the Union Address for example \nincluded a statement that the administration now admits did not rise to \nthe level of certainty required for Presidential speeches.\n  While I won't attempt to justify the inclusion of such a statement, I \nwill say that the matter does not deserve the attention it has \nreceived. The President's statement was not false, and it was only one \nstatement in a series that laid out Iraq's effort to develop weapons of \nmass destruction. In fact, British intelligence still stands behind the \nstatement. And no one has questioned the veracity of the other \nstatements in the President's speech.\n  So despite this statement, it seems clear to me that the President \nlaid out a very convincing case that the American people and Congress \nagreed with. I also remind my colleagues that we voted to force Iraq to \ncomply with United Nations resolutions 3 months before the President's \nspeech.\n  Mr. President, Operation Iraqi Freedom was a spectacular campaign \nthat resulted in the freeing of millions from tyranny and oppression. \nWe should take pride in bringing freedom and liberty to the Iraqi \npeople. Our troops are performing admirably and continue to believe in \ntheir mission. We still have much to accomplish, but with patience and \nperseverance, we will make a difference in this long-troubled region of \nthe world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/29/senate-section/article/S10136-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10136]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      THE BEGINNING FARMERS AND RANCHERS TAX INCENTIVE ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss S. 1464, \nlegislation I recently introduced with Senator Dorgan to provide a \ncapital gains tax incentive to agricultural producers on the sale of \ntheir farm or ranch land.\n  Agriculture is a vital engine that helps drive this Nation's economy. \nBut this engine is only as powerful as the next generation of \nproducers. The relentless financial problems facing the agricultural \nsector, particularly for beginning farmers, are daunting. It is often \ndifficult for beginning farmers to compete for land with large capital-\nbased operations. S. 1464 helps level the playing field by easing the \ntransfer of land between the old and new generations of farmers and \nranchers.\n  S. 1464, the Beginning Farmers and Ranchers Tax Incentive Act, would \nprovide all agricultural producers selling their property to a \nbeginning farmer or rancher a 100-percent reduction of their capital \ngains tax rate. Producers selling their land to someone who pledges to \nkeep the land in agricultural production would receive a 50-percent \nreduction of their capital gains taxes. All producers selling their \nland would receive an automatic 25-percent reduction of their capital \ngains taxes. These incentives would encourage repopulation of the rural \nlandscape with a new generation of young, energetic agricultural \nproducers.\n  Family farmers and ranchers often do not benefit from some tax \nincentives already in place for other Americans. In 1997, Congress \nenacted a $500,000 capital gains tax exclusion for home sales. \nUnfortunately, this provision often does not benefit family farmers \nsince their homes are typically included as part of the larger \nfarmstead. S. 1464 would correct this inequity by extending the \n$500,000 exclusion to farmers and ranchers.\n  It is imperative that we do more to ensure that beginning farmers and \nranchers are given opportunities to succeed in strengthening rural \ncommunities. S. 1464 helps do this by reducing the tax burden on \nretiring farmers and ranchers, so that the continuity of agricultural \nproduction remains unbroken from one generation to the next.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/29/senate-section/article/S10136-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10136]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    COMPETITIVE SOURCING INITIATIVE\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record an op-ed article from the Government Executive Magazine.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        [From the Government Executive Magazine, July 28, 2003]\n\n                             Let's Compete\n\n                       (By Senator Craig Thomas)\n\n       A handful of lawmakers are embracing the status quo in an \n     attempt to shield federal agencies, such as the National Park \n     Service, from restructuring the way they provide commercial \n     services.\n       This opposition comes as President Bush moves forward with \n     his competitive sourcing initiative. Competitive sourcing, \n     part of the President's management agenda, represents not \n     only an opportunity to improve the way federal agencies \n     operate, but a way to save taxpayer dollars.\n       According to an inventory first conducted by the Clinton \n     administration pursuant to the 1998 Federal Activities \n     Inventory Reform (FAIR) Act, 850,000 positions in the federal \n     government were categorized as commercial in nature. These \n     are jobs performing engineering services, writing software, \n     making maps, hanging drywall, mowing lawns and other services \n     ranging from high tech to routine. These are the same jobs \n     offered by private firms and small businesses found in the \n     Yellow Pages in any town in America.\n       Under Office of Management and Budget Circular A-76, \n     competitive sourcing allows federal agencies to consider \n     whether the private sector could be used to create \n     efficiency. This does not preclude federal employees from \n     restructuring their departments and competing to keep the \n     work in-house. As it is now, many federal employees who work \n     in commercial functions are struck in inefficient \n     bureaucracies performing activities that are not inherently \n     governmental.\n       For example, the government is considering competitive \n     sourcing to help improve the services available at our \n     national parks. The effort underway at the Park Service to \n     use competitive sourcing as a tool for improving fiscal and \n     operational efficiency comes at a time when the agency is \n     facing a tremendous funding shortfall for maintenance at \n     almost every park. Nationwide, this maintenance backlog is \n     estimated at nearly $5 billion.\n       The Park Service faces many challenges while making \n     America's treasures available for million of visitors each \n     year; however, funds are limited for maintenance, security, \n     safety and a variety of other activities. In the past, the \n     Park Service has been instructed by Congress to reduce the \n     in-house performance of its commercial activities, but these \n     efforts have not evolved. It is important that we now allow \n     the Park Service to evaluate its workforce and how best to \n     use its funding.\n       As the author of the FAIR Act, I strongly support improving \n     effectiveness and efficiency in government. At the same time, \n     I realize that we need to go about it in the right way. We \n     need to have a clear process with a reasonable timeline and \n     federal employees need to be kept informed. It also is \n     important that any public-private competition involves a \n     level playing field--private sector contractors and the \n     government should be judged on the same requirements.\n       At a July 24 hearing of the Senate Energy and Natural \n     Resources Subcommittee on National Parks, I heard from \n     witnesses who explained how the competitive sourcing process \n     works and who corrected misinformation pertaining to the Park \n     Service's competitive sourcing plan. Several witnesses \n     testified that the government, on average, saves nearly 30 \n     percent regardless of whether in-house employees or a private \n     contractor win the competition. Although there are some \n     unfront costs associated with conducting these public-private \n     competitions, the long-term savings dwarf these expenses.\n       Every president for the last 50 years, Republican and \n     Democrat alike, has endorsed the elimination of commercial \n     functions in the federal workforce, but their plans were not \n     vigorously implemented or enforced. Thus, early half the \n     civilian federal workforce is doing work that could be done \n     by the private sector.\n       We should keep in mind that President Bush's competitive \n     sourcing plan is far different than the Clinton \n     administration's reinventing government initiative. President \n     Clinton's plan established an arbitrary quota for eliminating \n     252,000 federal jobs--without any form of competition. By \n     comparison, President Bush has set no such requirement for \n     outsourcing, but has urged federal agencies to review their \n     commercial functions aand open them up for competition.\n       Over the past two and a half years, the Interior Department \n     has noted that of the 1,600 full-time employees it has \n     analyzed for competitive sourcing, not one federal employee \n     has been involuntarily dismissed from his or her job. As the \n     case of the Interior Department reveals, agencies try to \n     reassign federal employees to higher priority, inherently \n     governmental positions within their agencies. Some employees \n     transfer to jobs in other federal departments, others take \n     early retirement, or they go to work for a winning \n     contractor.\n       The taxpayer is the ultimate lower when competitive \n     sourcing is stymied. Inefficient monopolies that waste \n     taxpayer dollars divert much-needed federal resources from \n     our government's most pressing programs. Through reasonable \n     comeptitive sourcing, I believe federal agencies like the \n     Park Service can increase services to the public, while \n     maintaining the valued resources we all enjoy.\n       Let's give good old-fashioned competition a chance.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/29/senate-section/article/S10137-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10137]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S10137]]\n                         BOEING EELV VIOLATIONS\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, last week, the Under Secretary of the Air \nForce, Peter Teets, announced the Air Force's determination that the \nBoeing Company had committed serious violations of Federal law by \nillegally acquiring thousands of documents from its chief competitor, \nLockheed Martin. Apparently, the Boeing Company used this information \nto underbid Lockheed during the billion-dollar Evolved Expendable \nVehicle competition. Boeing's illegal activity probably cost Lockheed \nMartin hundreds of millions of dollars in contracts and did serious \ndamage to the Federal Government's procurement process.\n  As a result, the Air Force has punished the Boeing Company by \nsuspending Boeing's Launch Systems, Services, and Delta business units \nfor an indefinite period of time. The Air Force also reduced the total \nnumber of Boeing launches by seven. The Air Force increased the total \nnumber of launches for Lockheed by the same number.\n  The Air Force granted Lockheed Martin permission to develop a west \ncoast launch capability at Vandenberg Air Force Base, which will give \nLockheed an opportunity to compete for launches from this critical \nbase. This decision will give the Air Force more flexibility in \nawarding launches in the future.\n  I was pleased by the Air Force's decision. Integrity of the \nprocurement process is essential and nothing less than the highest \nstandards should be expected. Boeing's actions are a major \ndisappointment, and it is my hope that the Air Force's decision will \nserve up as a wake-up call, not just for this company, but for all \ncompanies doing business with the Department of Defense.\n  Boeing must not take measures to ensure that its employees know that \nthis activity is unacceptable. To this end, the hiring of former \nSenator Warren Rudman to review the company's policies and procedures \nregarding ethics and the handling of competitive information was a good \nfirst step. It saddens me to think that a handful of individuals could \nhave caused such problems for the 160,000 hard-working men and women \nemployed by the Boeing Company.\n  We should keep in mind that the Department of Justice is continuing \nits own investigation into the criminal activities of these former \nemployees. I will also be requesting through the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee that the General Accounting Office investigate whether \ndefense consolidation has resulted in a situation where the Federal \nGovernment's ability to punish those companies that violate the \nprocurement process has been limited.\n  To be clear, I continue to support the Air Force's policy of \nsustaining two launch providers for the EELV program. Last February, I \nsent a letter to the Secretary of Defense emphasizing my belief that \nreliance on only one provider could jeopardize our ability to utilize \nspace. Assured access to space requires sufficient launch capability, \nwhich would be lost with the elimination of one launch service \nproviders. And, while redundancy is expensive, I believe we need to \nensure space assets are there for our men and women in the Armed Forces \nwhen they are needed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/29/senate-section/article/S10137-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10137]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    TRIBUTE TO THE NASHUA LIONS CLUB\n\n Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nNashua Lions Club in recognition of their 80th anniversary.\n  Eighty-six years ago, insurance executive Melvin Jones and his fellow \nChicago business associates gathered and formed Lions International.\n  Originally, their objectives were humanitarian service to their \ncommunity. It wasn't until Helen Keller spoke at their 1925 convention \nand challenged them to become her ``Knights of the Blind'' that they \nbegan a service that today has become the largest service organization \nin the world.\n  In mid-1923, a similar group of Nashua business leaders began meeting \nat the old YMCA on Temple Street. A few months later they were \nchartered as the Nashua Lions Club, becoming the second oldest club in \nthe State. Since that time, the men and women of the Nashua Lions have \nanswered the challenge of Helen Keller and have lived by the Lions \nmotto ``We Serve.''\n  In their 80 years of service, the Nashua Lions have raised over $1 \nmillion that has gone to pay for eye examinations, eye glasses, eye \nsurgery, and hearing aid for needy children and adults. Last year, \nNashua Lions tested more children between the ages of 3 months and 4 \nyears than any club in the entire State using the revolutionary \n``KIDSIGHT'' camera that enables doctors to read a laster photo of a \nyoung child's eye and determine whether or not they have any problems \nat an early age.\n  In the early 1950's, the Nashua Lions led by former Major Mario Vagge \nbuilt the friendship club--a place for handicapped Nashua residents to \ngo and socialize--which is still in use today. In 1995, the club was \napproached by a Nashua family with a severely handicapped child at \nhome. ``Melanie's Room'' became a reality and for several years Melanie \nand her family shared in her being with them at home.\n  Besides the usual groups and charities supported by the Lions, many \nclub members throughout the years have given not only their own money, \nbut they have devoted countless hours to the city through service as \nmayors, alderman, fire commissioners, judges, educators, police, and \nfirefighters.\n  Local groups have benefited from having Lions serve on their \norganizations board of directors. Lions are involved with programs such \nas Big Brothers/Big Sister in-school mentors, Juvenile Diabetes \nEducation efforts, Special Olympics, and Lions Club Camp Pride.\n  In addition to their numerous community and charity efforts, the \nNashua Lions have also provided leadership to the entire Lions \nInternational Organization. During their 80-year history, Nashua has \nhad three district governors: Clifford Sloan, 1960-1961, Joseph \nBielawski, 1983-1984, and Edward Lecius, 1998-1999.\n  The Nashua Lions are a true example of the volunteer spirit that \nPresident Bush has asked all Americans to undertake. Their leadership, \ncaring, compassion, and hard work have helped make Nashua a great place \nto live.\n  The countless lives they have touched through their many programs may \nnever be known, however, just think what might have been if there were \nno Nashua Lions Club the past 80 years.\n  I offer my thanks and congratulations to the men and women of the \nNashua Lions Club for their 80 years of dedicated service to the \nresidents of the Gate City.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/29/senate-section/article/S10137-3", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10137-S10138]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO COLONEL DAVID L.

In his brief tenure \nas district engineer, COL Hansen led the Corps in effective disaster \nresponse to many communities, particularly the city of Franklin, in \nhelping them rebuild from the devastating flooding of Hurricane Floyd. \nHe led the Corps in proceeding with the modernization of Hampton Roads \nHarbor with his initiatives that have resulted in the construction of \nthe 50-foot outbound channel so that Virginia remains competitive with \nthe world's leading ports and is ready to serve the next generation of \ncargo vessels.\n  COL Hansen's hallmark has been in executing the Corps mission to \nprotect and restore our environmental resources and he leaves us with a \nsolid foundation to build upon in the years\n\n[[Page S10138]]\n\nahead. Through his unwavering determination, Virginians will soon enjoy \na free-flowing Rappahannock River for 106 miles from the Chesapeake Bay \nto the Blue Ridge Mountains. The removal of the Embrey Dam at \nFredericksburg has been a project that I am dedicated to completing, \nand COL Hansen's leadership has ensured that this will begin next \nFebruary.\n  The Chesapeake 2000 Agreement renewed the Federal-State partnership \nto restore and improve the management of the living resources of the \nChesapeake Bay. Immediately, COL Hansen took the goals of the agreement \nand put them into action. A central feature of the Chesapeake 2000 \nAgreement that I am actively involved with is the tenfold increase in \nnative oyster stocks over the next 10 years. To accomplish this, we \nhave pursued an unprecedented effort to build three-dimensional oyster \nreefs in traditional oyster grounds throughout the bay. COL Hansen has \ntaken up this challenge with unprecedented energy and commitment to \ncoordinate Federal and State policymakers and scientists.\n  These are just a few examples of COL Hansen's leadership in working \nwith private organizations, State and local governments and other \nFederal agencies to ensure the Corps responds effectively to natural \ndisasters, water resource development, and environmental initiatives. \nHe embodies the finest traditions of the Corps of Engineers and the \nprinciples of public service.\n  We thank him for his service to our Nation and Virginia, and wish him \nand his family every success in his new assignment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/29/senate-section/article/S10138-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10138]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   BRIGADIER GENERAL JARED P. KENNISH\n\n Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \naccomplishments of BG General Jared P. Kennish, Assistant Adjutant \nGeneral for the Rhode Island Air National Guard. BG Kennish was awarded \nthe Bronze Star Medal for meritorious achievement while serving as the \ncommander of the 376th Air Expeditionary Wing at Manas Air Base in \nKyrgyzstan from November 16, 2002 to April 16, 2003 in support of \nOperation Enduring Freedom.\n  BG Kennish was recognized by the United States Air Force for \ncontributing ``significantly to the overwhelming success of air and \nground operations against the Taliban and al-Qaeda terrorist networks \nthroughout Afghanistan.'' He led one of the most diverse and \nmultifunctional air wings ever assembled, combining the operations of \nF-16s, KC-135s, KC-10s, C-130s and Puma helicopters from the Air Forces \nof the United States, Denmark, Holland, Italy, Norway and Spain. BG \nKennish was also recognized as a ``true global mobility visionary'' \nwhose selfless efforts in support of joint air operations during \nOperation Enduring Freedom ``will be a model for future \ncontingencies.''\n  BG Kennish's accomplishments throughout Operation Enduring Freedom \nare no surprise to the great state of Rhode Island. Throughout a career \nof exemplary service that has spanned over 37 years in the United \nStates Air Force and the Rhode Island Air National Guard, BG Kennish \nhas left his positive imprint in every job he has performed. From \nservice throughout Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm in 1991, \nto operational deployments in northern Iraq and Mombasa, Kenya, to \ncommand of the 143rd Airlift Wing, Rhode Island Air National Guard, BG \nKennish has been a shining example of professional excellence of whom \nall Rhode Islanders are rightly proud.\n  I echo the praise of the United States Air Force in recognizing BG \nKennish with the award of the Bronze Star Medal. I ask my colleagues to \njoin with me today, July 29, 2003, in thanking BG Kennish on behalf of \na grateful Nation for his selfless service to our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/29/senate-section/article/S10138-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10138]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR. VICTOR WESTPHALL\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a wonderful \nman, Dr. Victor Westphall, who passed away July 22. Dr. Westphall \ndedicated his life to recognizing and celebrating the service and \nsacrifice of our Vietnam veterans.\n  Dr. Westphall's dedication to fallen heroes was not surprising \nbecause he too was a veteran. He entered the United States Navy in 1943 \nas an Ensign and served in the South Pacific during World War II. \nDuring this time, he was responsible for setting up message centers to \nallow front-line communication. After 3 years and two full stripes in \nthe Navy, Dr. Westphall moved with his wife and his two sons to New \nMexico. He earned his doctorate in history at the University of New \nMexico and eventually became a leading author and expert on Southwest \nAmerican history.\n  On a most painful day in May of 1968, Dr. Westphall received word \nthat his son, David, had been killed in Vietnam. David, a Marine \nlieutenant, died with 12 of his men in an ambush near Con Thien. Soon \nafter, Dr. Westphall was determined to draw some good out of this \ntragic event. He decided to use the life insurance payment from his \nson's death to build the Vietnam Veterans Peace and Brotherhood Chapel \nin Angel Fire, NM. Although Dr. Westphall struggled to find financial \nsupport to help build the memorial, he remained dedicated to the \nproject, and in 1971, the first monument to pay homage to Vietnam \nveterans in the United States was formally dedicated.\n  The Vietnam Veterans Peace and Brotherhood Chapel stands as a \nmajestic tribute to our veterans who served in Vietnam. Dr. Westphall \nhired a Santa Fe architect to design a beautiful white chapel with \ngentle curves sweeping 50 feet upward toward the sky. This serene \nmemorial overlooks the sacred Moreno Valley, just below New Mexico's \n13,000 foot Wheeler Peak. It offers visitors the opportunity to \nremember those who served their Nation proudly in the Vietnam War in a \npeaceful and spiritual setting. The Chapel's eternal flame illuminates \nthis hallowed place for quiet meditation.\n  I often remember a touching story that Dr. Westphall occasionally \nrecounted about the Chapel. When the memorial was first opened, the \nChapel would close nightly. However, one morning Dr. Westphall found a \nmessage left by a young veteran on the door: ``I needed to come in and \nyou locked me out.'' Since then, the Chapel remained open every hour of \nevery day.\n  Like the Chapel, Dr. Westphall was always there for our Nation's \nveterans. I salute Dr. Westphall's lifetime of service and devotion to \nour veterans, and I am proud and honored to have had him as a friend. \nHe gave his son, his time, his money, his property, and life to honor \nour fallen heroes.\n  As a fitting tribute, I end with the inscription at the entrance to \nhis son's Chapel, now called the Vietnam Veterans National Memorial:\n\n     The Ultimate Curse\n     Greed plowed cities desolate\n     Lusts ran snorting thru the streets\n     Pride reared up to desecrate\n     Shrines, and there were no retreats.\n     So man learned to shed the tears\n     With which he measures out his years.\n\n  --Victor David Westphall III\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/29/senate-section/article/S10138-3", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10138]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:06 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that pursuant to \nsection 2(a) of the National Cultural Center Act (20 U.S.C. 76h(a)), \namended by Public Law 107-117, and the order of the House of January 8, \n2003, the Speaker appoints the following Member of the House of \nRepresentatives to the Board of Trustees of the John F.

A bill to amend the Buy American Act to increase the \nrequirement for American-made content, to tighten the waiver \nprovisions, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nstrengthen the Buy American Act of 1933, the statute that governs \nprocurement by the federal government. The name of the act accurately \nand succinctly describes its purpose: to ensure that the federal \ngovernment supports domestic companies and domestic workers by buying \nAmerican-made goods.\n  While I a strong supporter of the act, I am concerned that, through \nabuse of its 5 broad waivers, the spirit--if not the letter--of the act \nis being weakened time and again.\n  It only makes sense, Mr. President, for the federal government to \nmake every effort to purchase goods that are made in America. A law \nrequiring this common-sense approach should not be necessary. \nUnfortunately, this law is necessary, and the way in which its many \nloopholes are being used also makes strengthening it necessary.\n  I have often heard my colleagues say on this floor that American-made \ngoods are the best in the world. I could not agree more. This Congress \nshould do more to ensure that the federal government adheres to this \nsentiment by enforcing and strengthening the provisions of the Buy \nAmerican Act.\n  As we all know the United States manufacturing industry is \nhemorrhaging, as jobs and companies move overseas or are lost all \ntogether. According to the AFL-CIO, the United States has lost more \nthan 2.4 million manufacturing jobs since April 1998. This disturbing \ntrend is of particular concern in my home state of Wisconsin.\n  A March 2003 report by the Wisconsin State Department of Workforce \nDevelopment notes that ``a combination of weak domestic and global \ndemand, mergers and consolidations, automation, globalization of \noperations, and uncertainty surrounding war have caused employment in \nWisconsin's manufacturing sector to shrink in recent years.'' The \nDepartment found that there were 594,100 manufacturing jobs in \nWisconsin in 2000, and the Department estimates that this figure had \ndropped to 517,100 jobs by June of this year. More than 77,000 jobs \nlost in just 2\\1/2\\ years, Mr. President. And the people of my state \ncan expect more of the same during the rest of this decade if we don't \ntake action soon.\n  While the Department expects some sectors to experience an upturn by \n2010, it estimates that the people of my state can still expect to lose \nthousands more manufacturing jobs by 2010.\n  Much of this can be blamed on flawed trade agreements that the United \nStates has entered into in recent years. The trade policy of this \ncountry over the past several years has been appalling. The trade \nagreements into which we have entered have contributed to the loss of \nkey employers, ravaging entire communities. But despite that clear \nevidence, we continue to see trade agreements being reached that will \nonly aggravate this problem\n  This has to stop. We cannot afford to pursue trade policies that gut \nour manufacturing sector and send good jobs overseas. We cannot afford \nto undermine the protections we have established for workers, the \nenvironment, and for our public health and safety. And we cannot afford \nto squander our democratic heritage by entering into trade agreements \nthat supercede our right to govern ourselves through open, democratic \ninstitutions.\n  I will be introducing legislation in the near future to address that \nproblem directly by establishing minimum standards for the trade \nagreements into which our nation enters. That measure is a companion to \na resolution that will be introduced in the other body by my colleague \nfrom Ohio [Mr. Brown].\n  Regrettably, some of the blame for the dire situation in which \nAmerican manufacturing finds itself also lies in our own federal tax \nand procurement policies, some of which actually encourage American \ncompanies to move or incorporate abroad. The Buy American law was \nenacted 70 years ago to ensure that Federal procurement policies \nsupport American jobs.\n  Some argue that the Buy American Act has outlived its usefulness in \ntoday's global economy. I argue that it is as relevant today as it was \nwhen it was enacted in 1933. The passage of 70 years has not diminished \nthe importance of this Act for American manufacturing companies or for \nthose who are employed in this crucial sector of our economy. In fact, \na strong argument can be made that this Act is even more necessary \ntoday than it was 70 years ago. With American jobs heading overseas at \nan alarming rate, the Government should be doing all it can to make \nsure that U.S. taxpayer dollars are spent to support American jobs.\n  Some argue that the Buy American Act is protectionist and anti-free \ntrade. I disagree. Supporting American industry is not protectionist--\nit is common sense. The erosion of our manufacturing base needs to be \nstopped, and Congress should support procurement and trade policies \nthat help to ensure that we do not continue to lose portions of this \nvital segment of our economy.\n  The legislation that I introduce today, the Buy American Improvement \nAct, would strengthen the existing Act by tightening existing waivers \nand would require that information be provided to Congress and to the \nAmerican people about how often the provisions of this Act are waived \nby Federal departments and agencies.\n  As I noted earlier, there are currently five primary waivers in the \nBuy American Act. The first allows an agency head to waive the Act's \nprovisions if a determination is made that complying with the Act would \nbe ``inconsistent with the public interest.'' I am concerned that this \nwaiver, which includes no definition for what is ``inconsistent with \nthe public interest'' is actually a gaping loophole that gives broad \ndiscretion to department  secretaries and agency heads. My bill would \nclarify this so-called ``public interest'' waiver provision to prohibit \nit from being invoked by an agency or department head after a request \nfor procurement (RFP) has been published in the Federal Register. Once \nthe bidding process has begun, the Federal Government should not be \nable to pull an RFP by saying that it is in the ``public interest'' to \ndo so. This determination, sometimes referred to as the Buy\n\n[[Page S10143]]\n\nAmerican Act's national security waiver, should be made well in advance \nof placing a procurement up for bid.\n\n  The Buy American Act may also be waived if the head of the agency \ndetermines that the cost of the lowest-priced domestic product is \n``unreasonable,'' and a system of price differentials is used to assist \nin making this determination. My bill would amend this waiver to \nrequire that preference be given to the American company if that \ncompany's bid is substantially similar to the lowest foreign bid or if \nthe American company is the only domestic source for the item to be \nprocured.\n  I have a long record of supporting efforts to help taxpayers get the \nmost bang for their buck and of opposing wasteful Federal spending. I \ndon't think anyone can argue that supporting American jobs is \n``wasteful.'' We owe it to American manufacturers and their employees \nto make sure they get a fair shake. I would not support awarding a \ncontract to an American company that is price gouging, but we should \nmake every effort to ensure that domestic sources for goods needed by \nthe Federal Government do not dry up because American companies have \nbeen slightly underbid by foreign competitors.\n  The Buy American Act also includes a waiver for goods bought by the \nFederal Government that will be used outside of the United States. \nThere is no question that there will be occasions when the Federal \nGovernment will need to procure items quickly that will be used outside \nthe United States, such as in a time of war. However, items that are \nbought on a regular basis and are used at foreign military bases or \nUnited States embassies, for example, could reasonably be procured from \ndomestic sources and shipped to the location where they will be used. \nMy bill would require an analysis of the difference in cost for \nobtaining articles, materials, or supplies that are used on a regular \nbasis outside the United States, or that are not needed on an immediate \nbasis, from an American company, including the cost of shipping, and a \nforeign company before issuing a waiver and awarding the contract to a \nforeign company.\n  The fourth waiver allowed under the Buy American Act states that the \ndomestic source requirements of the Act may be waived if the articles \nto be procured are not available from domestic sources ``in sufficient \nand reasonably available commercial quantities and of a satisfactory \nquality.'' My bill would require that an agency or department head, \nprior to issuing such as waiver, conduct a study that determines that \ndomestic production cannot be initiated to meet the procurement needs \nand that a comparable article, material, or supply is not available \nfrom an American company.\n  The newest Buy American Act waiver, which was enacted in 1994, \nexempts purchases of less than $2,500 from the domestic source \nrequirements of the Act. While this waiver is not addressed in my bill, \nI have requested that the General Accounting Office conduct a study of \nthis so-called ``micro purchase'' exemption, including how often it is \nused and its impact on American businesses.\n  My bill also strengthens the Buy American Act in four other ways.\n  First, it expands annual reporting requirements regarding the use of \nwaivers that currently apply only to the Department of Defense to \ninclude all Federal departments and agencies. My bill specifies that \nthese reports should include an itemized list of waivers, including the \nitems procured, their dollar value, and their source. In addition, \nthese reports would have to be made available on the Internet.\n  The bill also increases the minimum American-made content standard \nfor qualification under the Act from the current 50 percent to 75 \npercent. The definition of what qualifies as an American-made product \nhas been a source of much debate. To me, it seems clear that American-\nmade means manufactured in this country. This classification is a \nsource of pride for manufacturing workers around our country. The \ncurrent 50 percent standard should be raised to a 75 percent minimum.\n  My bill also addresses the crucial issue of dual-use technologies and \nefforts to prevent them from falling into the hands of terrorists or \ncountries of concern. My bill would prohibit the awarding of a contract \nor sub-contract to a foreign company to manufacture goods containing \nany item that is classified as a dual-use item on the Commerce Control \nList unless approval for such a contract has been obtained through the \nExport Administration Act process.\n  Finally, my bill would require the General Accounting Office to \nreport to Congress with recommendations for defining the terms \n``inconsistent with the public interest'' and ``unreasonable cost'' for \npurposes of invoking the corresponding waivers in the Act. I am \nconcerned that both of these terms lack definitions, and that they can \nbe very broadly interpreted by agency or department heads. GAO would be \nrequired to make recommendations for statutory definitions of both of \nthese terms, as well as on establishing a consistent waiver process \nthat can be used by all Federal agencies.\n  I am pleased that this legislation is supported by a broad array of \nbusiness and labor groups including: Save American Manufacturing, the \nU.S. Business and Industry Council, the International Association of \nMachinists and Aerospace Workers, the Milwaukee Valve Company, and the \nNational and Wisconsin AFL-CIO.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1480\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to prohibit the application of the trade authorities \nprocedures with respect to implementing bills that contain provisions \nregarding the entry of aliens; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Congressional \nResponsibility for Immigration Act, a bill to deny fast-track \nprocedures to trade agreements that include immigration provisions. We \nhave witnessed outrage in both parties and in both houses of Congress \nto the inclusion of ``temporary entry'' provisions in the Free Trade \nAgreements (``FTAs''), with Chile and Singapore. Members of the House \nand Senate Judiciary Committees, along with other concerned Members, \nhave stated clearly that they never again want to see trade agreements \nthat include immigration provisions. This bill will allow us to do more \nthan rely on the vague assurances that the Office of the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative has offered in response to our strongly-held concerns--\nit will provide a major deterrent that should prevent this \nAdministration and future Administrations from ignoring Congress' \nauthority over immigration policy. I am pleased that Senator \nFeinstein--who has led the fight against the inclusions of immigration \nprovisions in the Chile and Singapore agreements--Senator Jeffords, and \nSenator Kennedy have joined me in introducing this bill.\n  This bill is simple and straightforward. It states that whenever the \nSenate considers legislation to implement a free trade agreement, any \nSenator could raise a point of order against the bill on the grounds \nthat it includes an immigration provision. If the point of order were \nupheld, the bill would have to be considered under ordinary procedures, \nallowing us to amend it and strike provisions that violated our \nconstitutional authority over immigration. Succeeding Administrations \nhave told us for decades that they simply cannot pursue trade \nagreements without ``fast-track'' authority, and Congress has chosen to \ngive that authority to the Executive Branch. Having surrendered some of \nour power, however, we must be all the more vigilant in ensuring that \nthis surrender remains limited in scope.\n  It has been widely reported that the USTR considers the ``temporary \nentry'' provisions in the Chile and Singapore agreements to be models \nfor future agreements. I have criticized those provisions because I \nshare the concerns expressed by Senators Feinstein, Lindsey Graham, \nSessions and others that the United States Trade Representative should \nnot be in the business of amending domestic immigration laws, as these \ntreaties do. The decision to include immigration provisions was not \nonly unauthorized but also unnecessary to achieve the Administration's \nstated goals. Congress has already created the H-1B program, which \nallows foreign workers with specialized skills to work in the United \nStates. That program was established after a lengthy process of public \nhearings, debate, and negotiation, and it has worked to help meet labor \nshortages and strengthen our economy. If the Administration feels that \nthe program needs to be changed, or a new visa category created, it \nshould have sought to do so through the ordinary legislative process.\n  By including immigration provisions in trade agreements, the \nExecutive Branch not only usurps Congress' authority to create \nprograms, but also to amend them if they prove to be unsuccessful. Any \namendments that Congress makes to immigration policies that are made \nthrough trade agreements are subject to challenge as violations of \nthose agreements. As a result, our hands are tied not just at the time \nof the negotiation, but for all future legislative activity as well. \nThis is simply unacceptable--it was not the purpose of our trade \nagreements and it is neither a wise nor a constitutionally appropriate \nmeans of creating our immigration policy. We must pass this bill and \nrestore our proper separation of powers.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1481\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A point of order described \n     in paragraph (1) is waived only by the affirmative vote of a \n     majority of the Members of the Senate, duly chosen and sworn.\n       (B) Appeals.--After the Presiding Officer rules on a point \n     of order under this paragraph, any Senator may appeal the \n     ruling of the Presiding Officer on the point of order as it \n     applies to some or all of the provisions on which the \n     Presiding Officer ruled. A ruling of the Presiding Officer on \n     a point of order described in paragraph (1) is sustained \n     unless a majority of the Members of the Senate, duly chosen \n     and sworn, vote not to sustain the ruling.\n       (C) Debate.--Debate on a motion to waive under subparagraph \n     (A) or on an appeal of the ruling of the Presiding Officer \n     under subparagraph (B) shall be limited to 1 hour. The time \n     shall be equally divided between, and controlled by, the \n     Majority Leader and the Minority Leader of the Senate, or \n     their designees.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE (for himself, Mr. Stevens, and Mr. Cochran):\n  S. 1482. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal \nthe reduction in the deductible portion of expenses for business meals \nand entertainment; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to repeal \nthe current 50 percent tax deduction for business meals and \nentertainment expenses, and to restore the tax deduction to 80 percent \ngradually over a five-year period. I am joined by my good friends, \nSenators Ted Stevens and Thad Cochran, as cosponsors of this measure. \nRestoration of this deduction is essential to the livelihood of small \nand independent businesses as well as the food service, travel, \ntourism, and entertainment industries throughout the United States. \nThese industries are being economically harmed as a result of the 50 \npercent tax deduction.\n  The business meals and entertainment expenses deduction was reduced \nfrom 80 percent to 50 percent in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act \nof 1993, and went into effect on January 1, 1994. Its results have been \ndetrimental to small businesses, the self-employed, and independent and \ntraveling sales representatives. Research conducted by the National \nRestaurant Association (NRA) indicates that the great majority of \nbusiness meal users are small businesses and of such businesses, one-\nfifth are self employed. On an average, business meal costs for small \nbusinesses is less than $15 per lunch. These groups rely on one-on-one \nmeetings, usually during meals, for their marketing strategy, and the \nreduction of the business meals and entertainment deduction has \nimpacted their marketing efforts.\n  An increase in the meal deduction would have a significant impact on \nthe overall economy. Accompanying my statement is the NRA's State-by-\nState chart reflecting the estimated economic impact of increasing the \nbusiness meal deductibility from 50 percent to 80 percent. The NRA \nestimates that an increase to 80 percent would increase business meal \nsales by $6 billion and create a $13 billion increase to the overall \neconomy.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this important \nlegislation. I ask unanimous consent that the NRA's State-by-State \nchart and the text of my bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as

A bill to amend the Head Start Act to reauthorize that Act, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by my \ncolleague, the ranking member of the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions, Senator Kennedy, and Senators Harkin, Mikulski, \nJeffords, Bingaman, Murray, Reed, Edwards, Clinton, Rockefeller and \nDaschle in introducing the Head Start School Readiness and Coordination \nAct.\n  Let's be clear about one fact: Head Start works. More than 21 million \nchildren have gone through Head Start since the program began in 1965 \nand currently around 900,000 children are enrolled.\n  Head Start has to be one of the most studied of all Federal programs. \nBut, with each study, there is no question about the results--Head \nStart children are learning. Could they learn more? Could they make \ngreater gains? That's what our bill is about.\n  Our bill has four basic points. Our bill will: strengthen the Head \nStart workforce by requiring stronger Head Start teacher credentials \nand wages more comparable to public school pre-kindergarten and \nkindergarten children; improve Head Start's academic focus, \nparticularly instruction in preliteracy; expand Head Start to all \neligible preschool children by 2008, including serving 200,000 infants \nand toddlers through Early Head Start by 2008; and, promote better \ncoordination across all early care and education programs in every \nState.\n  The biggest problem today with Head Start is not the children Head \nStart serves, but the children who are left behind--those who are not \nparticipating in a Head Start program.\n  While the majority of Head Start children enter the program below \nnational language and literacy norms for all children of similar ages, \nabout 25 percent of children entering Head Start are extremely behind \ntheir peers. For these children, Head Start is a particularly important \njump start to build school readiness skills.\n  If our goal is to help Head Start children make even greater gains \nthan\n\n[[Page S10146]]\n\nthey are currently making, then we need to raise the educational \ncredentials of Head Start teachers. We require that within 3 years, all \nnewly hired Head Start teachers must either have an Associate's degree \nor become enrolled in a program leading to an AA degree within a year \nfrom when they're hired. In addition, we require a teacher with a \nBachelor's degree in every classroom over the next 8 years.\n  Currently, over half of State-funded pre-kindergarten programs \nrequire a teacher with a BA. We should require no less for Head Start \nchildren.\n  Unlike the House bill, we provide additional funding to meet this \nstronger teacher requirement--in fact, $3 billion over 5 years. The \naverage Head Start annual salary is about $20,000. The average annual \nsalary for a kindergarten teacher is $43,000. If we do not raise Head \nStart teacher salaries to be more in line with public school pre-\nkindergarten and kindergarten salaries, Head Start programs will never \nbe able to attract and retain a stronger workforce.\n  Next, we improve the academic focus of Head Start. We require Head \nStart programs to align their curriculum and classroom practice with \nlocal school districts and state school readiness standards. We require \nevery Head Start teacher to have on-going training in literacy \ninstruction. And, we provide funds for more books for Head Start \nclassrooms so that each classroom can truly be a literature-rich \nenvironment.\n  While the House bill does not even include enough funding to keep \npace with inflation, our bill expands Head Start to all eligible \npreschoolers by 2008. In addition, we double the current setaside for \nEarly Head Start from 10 percent of Head Start funding to 20 percent. \nTo me, the earlier we can reach these children, the greater the \nlikelihood that they can make even greater gains than current children, \nwho, for the most part enter Head Start as 4 year-olds.\n  Last, this bill will promote better coordination across all early \ncare and education programs in every state--without a block grant. We \nrequire that every state designate or create an advisory council on \nearly care and education. The council will issue a report to serve as a \nroadmap for how States can better coordinate various early childhood \nprograms and services.\n  An expanded State Head Start Collaboration office would work with the \nadvisory council to ensure that Head Start fits into the big picture \nset by the state for early childhood education.\n  Children in Head Start can learn more. But, they can't learn more \nunless we require a stronger workforce and unless we invest the \nresources necessary to attract and retain that workforce. While I agree \nthat we need to strengthen the literacy focus of Head Start, we cannot \ndo it unless every Head Start teacher is provided with literacy \ntraining.\n  The Administration and House Republicans believe that we need a block \ngrant to promote coordination and collaboration. I disagree. The block \ngrant serves only to weaken the comprehensive services offered by every \nHead Start program.\n  Tell the 208,000 children who needed dental treatment, the 71,000 who \nneeded speech and language help, the 21,961 who had developmental \ndelays, the 47,280 who needed treatment for asthma, the 25,869 who had \nvision problems, and the 20,260 who had hearing problems, that they did \nnot need the comprehensive services provided by Head Start.\n  Doctors don't water down medicine that's working, and neither should \nwe when it comes to Head Start. But clearly House Republicans have \nchosen expediency over bipartisanship. That's wrong.\n  Our bill, the Head Start School Readiness and Coordination Act, will \nfurther improve Head Start, without weakening the comprehensive \nservices that Head Start children need.\n  While we look forward to working with House and Senate Republicans in \nan effort to craft a bipartisan bill, we also wish to emphasize that we \nhold certain fundamental beliefs about Head Start that are in our bill \nand should be part of any final bill.\n  Last night my colleague, Senator Alexander, introduced legislation to \npromote better coordination and the creation of Head Start Centers of \nExcellence. His interest and creativity help stake a marker for basic \nprinciples that in addition to my bill should be part of any final \nbill. I agree with my colleague that there is consensus around \nimproving school readiness, improving coordination, and increasing \naccountability. I look forward to working with Senator Alexander and \nSenator Gregg, the Chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee and others who joined with me today in drafting a \nbipartisan bill to promote the strongest start possible for low income \nchildren prior to beginning kindergarten.\n  In the wake of the No Child Left Behind Act, now is not the time to \nleave Head Start children behind.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a short summary of the legislation be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            Head Start School Readiness and Coordination Act\n\n       Brief Summary: Head Start works. The Head Start School \n     Readiness and Coordination Act will help Head Start work \n     better. The Act strengthens the Head Start workforce by \n     requiring stronger education credentials for Head Start \n     teachers and wages more comparable to public school pre-\n     kindergarten and kindergarten teachers; improves Head Start's \n     academic focus, particularly in preliteracy instruction; \n     expands Head Start to more children, including more younger \n     children through the expansion of Early Head Start; and, \n     promotes better coordination across all early care and \n     education programs in the State.\n\n\n                     Expands Head Start Enrollment\n\n       Expands access to all eligible 3 and 4 year olds by 2008.\n       Serves over 200,000 infants and toddlers a year by 2008.\n       Increases funds for migrant Head Start programs from 4 \n     percent annually to 5 percent.\n       Increases funds for tribal Head Start programs from 3 \n     percent annually to 4 percent.\n\n\n                  strengthens the head start workforce\n\n       Within 3 years, requires all newly hired teachers to have \n     an Associate degree, or be enrolled in a program leading to \n     an AA degree within 1 year of hire.\n       Requires a teacher with a Bachelor's degree in every \n     classroom by 2008.\n       Provides the resources necessary to attract and retain a \n     more educated workforce and to enable current Head Start \n     teachers to go back to school.\n\n\n   Strengthens Head Start's Academic Focus, Particularly Pre-literacy\n\n       Requires all Head Start teachers to receive on-going \n     training in literacy.\n       Requires Head Start programs to align curriculum and \n     classroom practice with local school districts and state \n     school readiness standards.\n       Provides funds to increase the number of books in Head \n     Start classrooms, promote partnerships with libraries, and \n     foster books in the homes of Head Start children.\n\n\n          Improves Head Start's Coordination and Collaboration\n\n       Expands State Head Start Quality Improvement and \n     Collaboration offices to better coordinate Head Start with \n     other early childhood programs.\n       Promotes flexibility for Head Start to reach more children \n     from working poor families.\n\n\n   promotes better coordination across All Early care and education \n                                programs\n\n       Requires States to designate or establish an advisory \n     council on early care and education to review a State's \n     overall needs for children from birth to school entry.\n       Allows States to administer Head Start training and \n     technical assistance to better comply with Head Start \n     performance standards and to promote professional development \n     among Head Start teachers and other early care providers, if \n     supplemented by the States.\n       Involves States as a member of the team monitoring and \n     reviewing Head Start Performance and allows States to \n     designate new Head Start agencies.\n\n\n                   Improves head start accountability\n\n       Requires Head Start programs to conduct an annual review, \n     with a team that includes a representative from the local \n     school district, the State, and the HHS regional office.\n       Allows the Secretary of HHS to conduct periodic unannounced \n     monitoring visits.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator Dodd \nand other colleagues in introducing the Head Start Coordination and \nSchool Readiness Act. Our goal is to reauthorize Head Start and \ncontinue this very successful federal program to prepare low-income \nchildren for school.\n  For nearly four decades, Head Start has enabled vulnerable, young \npre-kindergarten children to enter school ready to learn. It provides a \nbalanced educational curriculum to see that children develop early \nskills in reading, writing, and math, and positive social skills as \nwell. It provides visits to doctors and dentists, and nutritious\n\n[[Page S10147]]\n\nmeals to see that children are healthy. It provides outreach to parents \nto encourage them to participate actively in their child's early \ndevelopment.\n  It is clear that Head Start works. A federal evaluation found that \nHead Start children make gains during the program itself, and the gains \ncontinue when the children enter kindergarten. Once Head Start children \ncomplete their kindergarten year, they are near the national average of \n100 in key areas, with scores of 93 in vocabulary, 96 in early writing, \nand 92 in early math.\n  In this legislation, we build on Head Start's proven track record and \nexpand it to include thousands of low-income children who are not yet \nserved by the program. We provide for better coordination of Head Start \nwith state programs for low-income children. We strengthen Head Start's \nfocus on school readiness and pre-literacy. We increase the education \nrequirements and compensation for Head Start teachers. We provide \ngreater accountability, including a high quality assessment of each \nHead Start program.\n  To strengthen Head Start, we have to begin by providing more \nresources for it. The need for Head Start is greater than ever. Child \npoverty is on the rise again. Today, only 60 percent of children \neligible for Head Start participate in it. Over 312,000 three- and \nfour-year-olds are left out because of the inadequate funding level of \nthe program. Early Head Start serves only 3 percent of eligible infants \nand toddlers. It is shameful that 97 percent of the children eligible \nfor Early Head Start have no access to it. It's long past time for \nCongress to expand access to Head Start to serve as many infants, \ntoddlers, and preschool children as possible.\n  Throughout the 1990's, we tripled our investment, and Head Start \nexpanded by 52 percent. But this year, the President's budget fails to \nreach out to a single new child. It provides only $148 million in \nadditional funding for the coming year--only a quarter of the increase \nthat Head Start received in recent years, and barely enough to cover \ninflation.\n  The bill that we introduce today will set a goal of fully funding \nHead Start over the next 5 years, in order to reach all eligible \npreschoolers. Each year, an additional 62,000 three- and four-year-olds \nwould be served by the program. Funding will rise from $6.7 billion in \nthe current fiscal year, to $8.5 billion in fiscal year 2004, and $16.3 \nbillion in fiscal year 2008.\n  Early Head Start is an especially important lifeline for needy \ninfants and toddlers. Research clearly shows its benefit to infants and \ntoddlers and their families. Early Head Start children have larger \nvocabularies, lower levels of aggressive behavior, and higher levels of \nsustained attention than children not enrolled in the program. Parents \nare more likely to play with their children and read to them.\n  This bill will double the size of Early Head Start, providing \nresources to serve an additional 29,000 infants and toddlers each year, \nat an estimated cost of $1 billion in fiscal year 2004, and $3.2 \nbillion in fiscal year 2008.\n  The current Federal-to-local structure of Head Start enables it to \ntailor its services to meet local community needs. Performance \nstandards guarantee a high level of quality across all programs. Yet \neach program is unique and specifically adapted to the local community. \nHead Start is successful in serving Inuit children in Alaska, migrant-\nworkers' children in Tennessee, and inner-city children in Boston. It \nis essential to maintain the ability of local Head Start programs to \ntailor their services to meet local community's needs.\n  To strengthen this coordination with local programs, our bill creates \na Head Start Quality Improvement and Collaboration Office in every \nstate to maximize services to Head Start children, align Head Start \nwith kindergarten classrooms, and strengthen its local partnerships \nwith other agencies. These offices will also work to expand training \nand technical assistance to Head Start grantees to better meet the goal \nof preparing children for school.\n  States will also have an active role in coordinating their early \nchildhood programs and increasing their quality. Our bill designates an \nEarly Care and Education Council in each State to conduct an inventory \nof children's needs in the state, develop unified data collection and \nmake recommendations on coordination, technical assistance and \ntraining.\n  Over the past four decades, Head Start has built up quality and \nperformance standards to guarantee a full range of services, so that \nchildren are educated in the basics about letters and numbers and \nbooks, and are also healthy, well-fed, and supported in stable and \nnurturing relationships. Head Start is a model program, and we can \nenhance its quality even more.\n  One way to do that is to strengthen Head Start's current literacy \ninitiative. We know the key to later reading success is to get young \nchildren excited about letters and books and numbers. Our bill \nemphasizes language and literacy, by enhancing the literacy training \nrequired of Head Start teachers, by continuing to promote parent \nliteracy, and by working to put more books into Head Start classrooms \nand into children's homes.\n  At the heart of Head Start's success are its teachers and staff. They \nare caring, committed persons who know the children they serve and are \ndedicated to improving their lives. They help children learn to \nidentify letters of the alphabet and arrange the pieces of puzzles. \nThey teach them to brush their teeth, wash their hands, make friends \nand follow rules. Yet their salary is still half the salary of \nkindergarten teachers, and turnover is high--11 percent a year.\n  Because a teacher's quality is directly related to a child's outcome, \nour bill sets a goal that every Head Start classroom has a teacher with \na bachelor's degree within 8 years. It provides an additional $650 \nmillion over the next 5 years to see that teachers have the means to go \nback to school to earn a bachelor's degree, and it guarantees $3 \nbillion over that period to see that teachers earn adequate wages to \nkeep them in Head Start once they obtain their degree.\n  Finally, accountability is a cornerstone of excellence in education \nand should start early. Head Start should be accountable for its \npromise to provide safe and healthy learning environments, to support \neach child's individual pattern of development and learning, to cement \ncommunity partnerships in services for children, and to involve parents \nin their child's growth.\n  Head Start reviews are already among the most extensive in the field. \nEvery 3 years, a Federal and local team spends a week thoroughly \nexamining every aspect of every Head Start program. They check \neverything from batteries in flashlights to how parents feel about the \nprogram. Our bill promotes even stronger monitoring of Head Start \nprograms. It calls for periodic visits to programs, and strengthens \nannual reviews and plans for improvement.\n  Assessing outcomes for children is vital in promoting accountability \nand ensuring that the gains promised for Head Start children are \nactually achieved. But these steps have to be taken the right way.\n  Instead of rushing forward, as the Administration suggests, with a \nnational assessment for every four-year-old in Head Start this fall, \nour bill calls on the National Academy of Sciences to guide the \ndevelopment and implementation of a high-quality assessment for Head \nStart children over the next four years. That assessment will be valid \nand reliable, fair to children from all backgrounds, balanced in what \nit measures, and assess the development of the whole child.\n  Unfortunately, the Administration and House Republicans have \npresented plans that would turn Head Start into Slow Start or No Start. \nIt makes no sense to turn Head Start into a block grant to the states. \nTo do so would dismantle the program and undermine Head Start's \nguarantees that children can see doctors and dentists, eat nutritious \nmeals, and learn early academic and social skills. It would undermine \nthe role of parents, who are better parents today, strong advocates, \nand enthusiastic volunteers as a result of Head Start.\n  The Head Start Coordination and School Readiness Act we are \nintroducing today will keep Head Start on its successful path. I urge \nour colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join us in continuing and \nstrengthening this program, and give children the head start they need \nand deserve to prepare for school and for life.\n\n[[Page S10148]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support and \nstatement from the National Head Start Association be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n     Hon. Edward Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: We are writing to voice our strong \n     support for the legislation you plan to introduce today, the \n     Dodd/Kennedy Head Start School Readiness and Coordination \n     Act.\n       This legislation would reauthorize the Head Start program \n     an build on it 38-year record of success in delivering high \n     quality, comprehensive services to low-income children and \n     their families. The Children's Defense Fund is working to \n     ensure that we truly Leave No Child Behind in America. This \n     bill takes an important step in making this promise a reality \n     by proposing to expand Head Start to all eligible preschool \n     children and double the current set-aside for infants and \n     toddlers over the next five years.\n       We applaud the expanded funding as well as your efforts to \n     strengthen and improve Head Start services for the nation's \n     poorest children. Recognizing that teachers are critical to \n     children's learning, the bill promotes advances education for \n     Head Start teachers and guarantees the necessary federal \n     resources to ensure that qualified teachers can afford to \n     stay in Head Start classrooms. The bill also encourages new \n     models for developing a comprehensive, coordinated system of \n     preschool education. While preserving Head Start's existing \n     federal to local funding structure, these strategies will \n     ensure strong collaboration at both the local and start \n     levels.\n       Your legislation is a marked improvement over the injurious \n     bill passed by the House of Representatives last week. It is \n     my fervent hope that the Senator wholesheartedly rejects the \n     House approach in conference.\n       As always, we are deeply grateful for your extraordinary \n     leadership of children and families and we look forward to \n     working with you on this important piece of legislation.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Marian Wright Edelman.\n                                  ____\n\n\n   Statement by Sarah Greene, President and CEO, National Head Start \n                           Association (NHSA)\n\n     Re Kennedy-Dodd Head Start bill.\n       Washington, D.C., July 29, 2003.--Sarah Greene, president \n     and CEO of the National Head Start Association, released the \n     following statement today:\n       ``The National Head Start Association, representing 2,500 \n     local Head Start providers, over 900,000 at-risk children, \n     47,000 teachers and parents and volunteers, is pleased to \n     endorse the ``Head Start School Readiness and Coordination \n     Act'' introduce today by Senators Edward Kennedy (D-MA) and \n     Christopher Dodd (D-CT), ranking members of the Senate \n     Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee.\n       This legislation will strengthen the Head Start workforce \n     by requiring stronger credentials for Head Start teachers and \n     bring wages more into line with public school pre-\n     kindergarten and kindergarten teachers; improve Head Start's \n     academic focus, particularly in pre-literacy instruction; \n     expand Head Start to reach more at-risk children, including \n     more younger children through the expansion of Early Head \n     Start; and promote better coordination across all early care \n     and education programs within the states.\n       NHSA is proud to have been involved in the crafting of this \n     expansive measure that will continue the long history of \n     improving Head Start's program quality and outcomes for our \n     neediest pre-schoolers. The Head Start community will work \n     closely with members of the help Committee to assure passage \n     of this important legislation.''\n\n\n                               about nhsa\n\n       The National Head Start Association is a private not-for-\n     profit membership organization dedicated exclusively to \n     meeting the needs of Head Start children and their families. \n     The Association provides support for the entire Head Start \n     family by advocating for policies that provide high-quality \n     services to children and their families; by providing \n     extensive training and professional development services to \n     all Head Start staff; and be developing and disseminating \n     research, information, and resources that impact Head Start \n     program delivery. NHSA provides a national forum for the \n     continued delivery and enhancement of Head Start services for \n     at-risk children and their families.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor of the Head \nStart School Readiness and Coordination Act.\n  Since 1965, Head Start has provided comprehensive early childhood \ndevelopment, educational, health, nutritional, social and other \nservices to low-income preschool children and their families. I believe \nour goal during the upcoming reauthorization must be to enhance, not \ndismantle, this essential program so it can continue its important and \nnecessary work to lessen the effects of poverty and ensure that \nchildren are ready for school.\n  Head Start serves our poorest children and families but it does not \nreach enough of them. Although Head Start currently serves over 900,000 \nchildren, mainly 3- and 4-year-olds, 40 percent of eligible children, \napproximately 600,000, are currently not served. Early Head Start, \narguably an even more critically important program for infants, \ntoddlers and pregnant women given what we now know about early brain \ndevelopment, serves a mere 3 percent of those eligible.\n  Several measures are needed to improve Head Start while ensuring that \nits many important services are not reduced. We need to fully fund Head \nStart so that many more children can benefit. We need resources to \nimprove the quality of Head Start teachers and adequately compensate \nthem. And we need to improve coordination with child care and State-\nfunded pre-kindergarten programs.\n  Unfortunately, the Administration's proposal and the House bill do \nnone of these things. Instead they would create a block grant for \nStates and, by doing so, eliminate both the program's Federal quality \nstandards and the requirement for comprehensive services. With almost \nall States facing substantial budget deficits and many already cutting \nfunding for early child care and pre-kindergarten programs, a block \ngrant demonstration for one State, eight States, or more would jettison \nthe Head Start guarantee of high quality programs and comprehensive \nservices for our nation's low income children and families.\n  The Head Start School Readiness and Coordination Act preserves both \nthe performance standards that ensure quality as well as the \ncomprehensive services such as health screenings, immunizations, \nnutritious meals, emotional and behavioral supports, and direct support \nto parents of Head Start children. I will work hard to ensure that \nthese important services are not diminished and that the effort to \nimprove Head Start does not come at the expense or sacrifice of other \naspects of the program.\n  A particular focus of mine during the past several education \nreauthorizations has been to ensure that our teachers get the training \nand continued professional development they need to help students \nsucceed.\n  Currently, only 25 percent of Head Start teachers hold bachelor's \ndegrees. A key provision in the Head Start School Readiness and \nCoordination Act would require all newly hired teachers to have a \nminimum of an Associate's degree and all classrooms to have a teacher \nwith a Bachelor's degree by 2008. Importantly, the bill also provides \nfunding for Head Start teachers to meet these requirements and to boost \nHead Start teacher's salaries to alleviate the shortage and turnover \nproblem that currently exists. Head Start teachers typically earn half \nthe salary of kindergarten teachers. If we expect a higher level of \neducation from these teachers, then we must compensate them at higher \nlevels.\n  Unfortunately, the House bill does not provide the means of achieving \neither of these goals. It is questionable whether the House bill even \nprovides enough funding to cover the cost of inflation. It clearly does \nnot provide funding to boost salaries or provide the additional \neducational training to achieve the degree requirements sought. Worse, \nthe House bill reduces the minimum set-aside for training and technical \nassistance from 2 percent to 1 percent and introduces a cap of 2 \npercent. We will never attract and retain highly qualified teachers \nwithout financial support to enable their education and training and \nincentives to keep them in the Head Start program.\n  Another troubling aspect of both the Administration's proposal and \nHouse bill is that both would allow employment discrimination based on \nreligion in Head Start programs run by religious groups.\n  Faith-based organizations are an integral part of Head Start, having \nalready provided such services for years. We should continue to \nencourage their participation without allowing them to discriminate. \nIndeed, during the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee \nhearing, the Administration witnesses were unable to provide any \ninformation on barriers faced by religious organizations in \nparticipating in Head Start, nor could they identify any research \npointing to the efficacy of teaching by unified religious staff. I\n\n[[Page S10149]]\n\nwill fight hard to prevent such discrimination in Head Start as I have \nin other bills moving through Congress.\n  I am pleased that provisions I worked on have also been included in \nThe Head Start School Readiness and Coordination Act.\n  I am particularly pleased about the over-income provision that will \nallow more children to qualify whose families are above the poverty \nline but are still struggling to make ends meet. The parental \ninvolvement provisions will encourage the continuity of their \ninvolvement and improve the academic success of children in Head Start \nactivities. The library and museum provisions will develop and enhance \nclose collaborations of these institutions with Head Start programs to \nstrengthen literacy skills and other educational outcomes for children.\n  I commend Senators Kennedy and Dodd on their work to draft this bill, \nand I urge my colleagues to consider and pass this important piece of \nlegislation.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong \nsupport for the Head Start Readiness and Coordination Act, of which I \nam a proud original co-sponsor. I want to commend Senator Dodd and \nSenator Kennedy for their hard work and commitment to making this bill \nthe best it could be.\n  The Head Start Readiness and Coordination Act presents a clear \ncontrast with what has been proposed by the Administration and what has \nbeen passed by the House of Representatives. What this Administration \nand the Republican Leaders in the House want to do will not provide a \nHead Start for children--it will be a giant step back. A step back from \nall of the great things that Head Start provides: family services, \ndental care, health care, and of course learning. We need to strengthen \nHead Start not weaken it. And we need to expand its reach, not limit \nit.\n  The way we create more opportunities for every child in New York and \nacross the country is to build on our successes. And let met tell you \nHead Start has been a success since 1965. More than 20 million kids \nhave benefited from this program. In this year alone, 50,000 New York \nfamilies will participate.\n  And the trend every time reauthorization has come up is to build a \nprogram that helps even more children and their families. If it's not \nbroken, don't fix it.\n  And that's what our ``Head Start Readiness and Coordination Act'' \nwill do. We double the size of Early Head Start. We expand access to \nall eligible pre-schoolers. We provide better services for families and \nchildren who are still learning English--that's 25 percent of the Head \nStart population. And we improve coordination between the States so \nthat children are ready for school and so that every child who needs it \nto have access to year-round care.\n  This bill builds on the remarkable success of the Clinton \nAdministration in improving Head Start. During my husband's tenure in \nthe White House, enrollment in Head Start increased by almost 30 \npercent and funding increased by 120 percent. In 1994, my husband \ncreated the Early Head program to provide critical care to infants who \nare in one of--if not the most--critical stage of development. And in \nthe 1998 reauthorization, we doubled the Early Head Start program so \nthat today it is serving 62,000 infants and toddlers.\n  The Clinton Administration also introduced outcome measures aligned \nwith the successful performance standards to improve the quality of the \nprogram. And we ensured that 50 percent of all Head Start teachers have \nan Associates degree. At the time, many people said we were setting \nimpossible standards, but today, the performance standards and outcomes \nare the backbone of every Head Start program, and the goal of 50 \npercent of teachers having Associates degrees has been exceeded.\n  So, I know that we can reform and improve Head Start. And that is why \nI will never support dismantling it. Head Start is more than just one \nof this country's most successful anti-poverty programs. It is a great \nequalizer. It is a place where a young girl might have a book read to \nher for the first time; a place where a young boy might have his first \ncheck-up, and a place where a mother or father might learn about \nnutrition, the early signs of lead poisoning, and how to encourage \nlearning at home.\n  Head Start has lived up to its name and then some for millions of \nAmericans. There is bipartisan support to preserve Head Start as we \nknow it, to expand it, and to improve it. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues to make sure that this happens. We can do all of \nthese great things without dismantling one of our greatest national \nendeavors for our children.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN:\n  S. 1484. A bill to require a report on Federal Government use of \ncommercial and other databases for national security, intelligence, and \nlaw enforcement purposes, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I believe the United States can fight \nterrorism ferociously without gutting civil liberties. The point of the \nlegislation I am introducing today is to address concerns that have \narisen about the second part of this equation: an area of privacy that \nhas gotten short shrift. That is the personal financial, medical and \nother data on millions of Americans that today is less than a \nmouseclick away from the computers of thousands of Federal bureaucrats. \nAccess to and the use of that personal information by Federal \nbureaucrats is not protected by any comprehensive law.\n  The power of technology that allows the Federal Government to pry \ninto the personal lives of millions of Americans is only beginning to \nbe understood. It is a breath-taking power, and it has come partly to \nlight through the Defense Department's Terrorism Information Awareness \nProgram (TIA), and through the Transportation Security Administration's \nComputer Assisted Passenger Profiling System II or CAPPSII Program. \nThese and more than two dozen other agencies wield that power with \nlittle or no restraint.\n  The legislation I am introducing with the support of a bipartisan \ngroup of privacy watchdog organizations, the Citizens' Protection in \nFederal Databases Act, will put the breaks on unchecked Federal data \nsweeps. It requires the Federal agencies with law enforcement or \nintelligence authority to share with Congress exactly what they are \ndoing with private or public databases, why they are doing it, and most \nimportantly, what, if any, privacy protections the agencies are \naffording the individuals' whose sensitive information is caught up in \nthose databases.\n  The Citizens' Protection in Federal Databases Act also prohibits \nsearches based on hypothetical scenarios.\n  Apparently, some government agencies are using valuable Federal \nresources chasing hypothetical situations dreamed up without regard to \nactual intelligence or law enforcement information.\n  The TIA Report to Congress in May of this year explained at length \nthe program's intent to construct possible terrorist ``scenarios'' \nbased on ``historical examples, estimated capabilities, and \nimagination.'' These scenarios would then be fed into database searches \nin an effort to substantiate the hypotheticals.\n  This Act bans such searches. This prohibition will promote the \nefficient use of Federal law enforcement time and money and help \nprotect Americans from being subject to ``virtual goose chases.''\n  Since 9/11, there has been an abundance of stories regarding \nAmericans being stopped, searched, or detained due to some mistaken \ninformation. For example, after 9/11, the FBI decided to share with \ncompanies across the country a list with names of people wanted for \npossible association with terrorism. This list, as part of ``Project \nLookout,'' was sent to thousands of corporations, some of whom now use \nthe list in lieu of background checks.\n  Here's the problem--this list is not necessarily accurate. First of \nall, the list quickly became obsolete as the FBI checked people off. \nThat means even if people were cleared by the FBI of suspicion, their \nnames were still on this list. Secondly, the list has been shared so \nmany times, and passed from person to person, group to group--many \nnames have become misspelled and now folks, due to one or two typos, \nare being stopped as suspected terrorists.\n  That story is just one example of what can happen when information is\n\n[[Page S10150]]\n\nmishandled. It is Congress's job to make sure mistakes like these do \nnot happen.\n  The Citizens' Protection in Federal Databases Act is not the end of \nthis issue. After shedding some light on what exactly is happening with \npersonal information--the Congress must then address how to protect \nAmericans from the misuse of this information.\n  I am happy to be working with a strong group of privacy advocates. \nThe group includes the Electronic Privacy Information Center, the \nElectronic Frontier Foundation, the Center for Democracy and \nTechnology, People for the American Way, the Free Congress Foundation, \nand the American Civil Liberties Union, and they have been instrumental \nin getting strong safeguards enacted against abuses in the TIA and \nother programs. I look forward to working with these groups, and my \nSenate colleagues, to see that this bill is enacted into law.\n  When tens of thousands of bureaucrats have at their fingertips all-\ntoo-easy access to such personal information from private and public \ndatabases as the use of passports, driver's licenses, credit cards, \nATMs, airline tickets, and rental cars, the American people want to \nknow what is happening to their information. They want to know who \nwants access to it and why. Their personal information deserves strong \nprivacy protection, and that is what this legislation is all about.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1484\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Citizens' Protection in \n     Federal Databases Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Many Federal national security, law enforcement, and \n     intelligence agencies are currently accessing large \n     databases, both public and private, containing information \n     that was not initially collected for national security, law \n     enforcement, or intelligence purposes.\n       (2) These databases contain personal and sensitive \n     information on millions of United States persons.\n       (3) Some of these databases are subject to Federal privacy \n     protections when in private sector control.\n       (4) Risks to personal privacy are heightened when personal \n     information from different sources, including public records, \n     is aggregated in a single file and made accessible to \n     thousands of national security, law enforcement, and \n     intelligence personnel.\n       (5) It is unclear what standards, policies, procedures, and \n     guidelines govern the access to or use of these public and \n     private databases by the Federal Government.\n       (6) It is unclear what Federal Government agencies believe \n     they legally can and cannot do with the information once \n     acquired.\n       (7) The Federal Government should be required to adhere to \n     clear civil liberties and privacy standards when accessing \n     personal information.\n       (8) There is a need for clear accountability standards with \n     regard to the accessing or usage of information contained in \n     public and private databases by Federal agencies.\n       (9) Without accountability, individuals and the public have \n     no way of knowing who is reading, using, or disseminating \n     personal information.\n       (10) The Federal Government should not access personal \n     information on United States persons without some nexus to \n     suspected counterintelligence, terrorist, or other illegal \n     activity.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to \nprotect the rights of employees to receive overtime compensation; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator Harkin \nand other colleagues on this legislation to protect the right to \novertime pay for millions of working men and women across America. The \nBush administration has just announced new regulations that would deny \novertime protections to more than 8 million hard-working men and women, \nincluding an estimated 200,000 workers in Massachusetts. Firefighters, \npolice officers, military reservists, nurses, retail clerks, medical \ntechnicians, tech workers and many others would be harmed by the new \nrules.\n  In the current failing economy, these workers depend more than ever \non overtime pay to make ends meet and to pay their bills for housing, \nfood, and health care. Overtime pay often constitutes as much as a \nquarter of their total pay, and the administration's proposal will mean \nan average pay cut of $161 a week for them.\n  Our bill states clearly that no worker currently eligible for \novertime protection can be denied overtime pay as a result of the new \nregulations.\n  We know that overtime protections make an immense difference in \npreserving the 40-hour work week. For over half a century, the Fair \nLabor Standards Act has discouraged employers from requiring longer \nhours of work, by making overtime more expensive. Instead of relying on \nfewer workers forced to work longer hours, employers are likely to hire \nadditional workers to meet the employer's needs. That result creates \nmore jobs, and reduces the unfair exploitation of workers.\n  The Bush administration is the first administration in 70 years in \nwhich the number of private sector jobs has declined. Not since \nPresident Hoover have we been hemorrhaging jobs like this. How could \nany fair administration possibly adopt regulations that will increase \novertime working hours, and reduce the need to hire additional workers?\n\n  According to the Congressional General Accounting Office, employees \nexempt from overtime pay are twice as likely to work overtime as those \ncovered by the protection. Americans are working longer hours today \nthan ever before--longer than in any other industrial nation. At least \none in five employees now has a work week that exceeds 50 hours, let \nalone 40 hours.\n  Clearly, workers are already struggling to balance their families' \nneeds with their work responsibilities. Requiring them to work more \nhours for less pay will add an even greater burden to this daily \nstruggle. Protecting the 40-hour work week is vital to protecting the \nwork-family balance for millions of Americans in communities in all \nparts of the nation.\n  Sixty-five years ago, President Roosevelt signed into law the Fair \nLabor Standards Act to establish a minimum wage and maximum work hours. \nIt was the midst of the Great Depression and President Roosevelt told \nthe country that ``if the hours of labor for the individual could be \nshortened . . . more people could be employed. If minimum wages could \nbe established, each worker could get a living wage.''\n  Those words are as true in 2003 as they were in 1938. The economy has \nlost more private sector jobs during this economic decline than in any \nrecession since the Great Depression. What can the administration be \nthinking, to come up with this shameful proposal to weaken the overtime \nprotections on which millions of workers rely? Is the administration so \ndesperate to prop up business profits that it's willing to punish \nworkers to do it?\n  As Senator Harkin says, the President's policy is economic \nmalpractice. Democrats will not sit idly by and watch Americans lose \ntheir jobs, their livelihoods, their homes, and their dignity. We will \ncontinue the fight to restore jobs to the economy, provide fair \nunemployment benefits, and raise the minimum wage. And we will do all \nwe can to preserve the overtime protections on which so many Americans \nfamilies depend. I urge my colleagues to support this essential \nlegislation to keep the faith with the Nation's working families.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CHAFEE (for himself and Mr. Jeffords):\n  S. 1486. A bill to amend the Toxic Substances Control Act and the \nFederal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act to implement the \nStockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, the Protocol on \nPersistent Organic Pollutants to the Convention on Long-Range \nTransboundary Air Pollution, and the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior \nInformed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and \nPesticides in International Trade; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today I introduce the POPs, LRTAP POPs, \nand PIC Implementation Act of 2003, along with Senator Jeffords. This \nlegislation implements the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic \nPollutants (POPs), the Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air \nPollution (LRTAP POPs), and the Rotterdam Convention on Prior Informed \nConsent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in \nInternational Trade (PIC). With advice and consent by the Senate and \nwith passage of this legislation, the United States will appropriately \nbecome an active participant in these important international \nagreements.\n  Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are highly toxic and cause \nadverse health effects, including cancer, reproductive disorders, and \nimmune system disruptions. POPs may not break down for years or \ndecades, can travel long distances through air and water, and are known \nto bioaccumulate in living organisms. PCBs, DDT, and dioxin are \nexamples of POPs. The Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic \nPollutants seeks to globally eliminate or severely restrict the \nproduction and use of 12 of the most dangerous pesticides and \nindustrial chemicals, ensure the environmentally sound management of \nPOPs waste, and prevent the emergence of new chemicals with POPs-like \ncharacteristics. To date, there are 151 signatories and 33 Parties to \nthe Convention.\n  The legislation we are introducing today implements the key provision \nof the POPs Convention which allows additional chemicals to be added to \nthe Convention. The bill amends the Toxic Substances Control Act to \ncreate a process by which the Administrator of the Environmental \nProtection Agency would consider regulating a newly listed chemical to \nthe POPs Convention or to the LRTAP POPs Protocol. Beginning 1 year \nafter a chemical is added by the international body, any person may \npetition the Administrator to commence a rulemaking if one has not been \ncommenced. Providing mechanism to include additional chemicals at a \nfuture date, with opportunities for public involvement, ensures that \nthe United States will fully implement the POPs Convention.\n  This bill includes two titles: the first title amends the Toxic \nSubstances Control Act (TSCA) and the second title amends the Federal \nInsecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). Senator Jeffords \nand I have worked exclusively to forge a compromise on the first title \namending TSCA. The second title amending FIFRA will be considered by \nthe Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry. The language in \nthis bill amending FIFRA is intended to serve as a place holder until \nthe Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry has the \nopportunity to consider that title. It does not represent a compromise \non that title.\n  I believe that this adding mechanism includes appropriate checks and \nbalances, and requires the Environmental Protection Agency to balance \nthe relevant factors when determining how to regulate a newly-listed \nchemical. While\n\n[[Page S10152]]\n\ndifferent parties would craft these provisions differently if starting \nwith a clean slate, I believe that this legislation represents a solid \ncompromise that will allow the United States to fulfill its obligations \nwhen Governor Whitman signed the POPs treaty, and will engage the \nUnited States as a leading member of the international community \nregarding toxic substances.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 1487. A bill to require the Secretary of the Army to award the \nCombat Medical Badge or another combat badge for Army helicopter \nmedical evacuation ambulance (Medevac) pilots and crews; to the \nCommittee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to explain \nbriefly the provisions of legislation I have introduced today that \nwould direct the Secretary of the Army to award the Combat Medical \nBadge, CMB, or a similar badge to be designed by the Secretary of the \nArmy, to pilots and crew of the Army's helicopter medical ambulance \nunits--commonly referred to by their call sign ``DUST OFF''--who have \nflown combat missions to rescue and aid wounded soldiers, sailors, \nairmen, and Marines.\n  The legacy of the DUST OFF mission was recently brought to my \nattention by a group of Pennsylvania constituents who have been sharing \nthe DUST OFF story in an attempt to persuade the Army to recognize the \nservice and sacrifice DUST OFF crews made, especially during the \nVietnam War, in saving the lives of thousands of fallen comrades by \nextracting the wounded from forward positions to bases where they would \nreceive life-saving medical care.\n  The Army began using helicopters to evacuate wounded soldiers during \nthe Korean War. However, because of their smaller size, Korean War \nhelicopters were used solely as a means of transporting the wounded \nfrom the combat zones. It was not until the early 1960's that a group \nof Army aviators envisioned using the newer, larger, UH-1A ``Huey'' \nhelicopters to serve as mobile air ambulances where a medic and crew \ncould provide life-saving treatment en route to the medical aide \nstation.\n  The road to establish air ambulance units within the Army was rocky \nand uncertain. Combat commanders often considered the use of \nhelicopters for this purpose a diversion of valuable resources. \nHowever, through determination, skill, and the American fighting \nspirit, air ambulance crews proved they were a valuable and reliable \nresource in providing support to the combat mission. Indeed, between \n1962 and 1973, DUST OFF crews evacuated more than 900,000 allied \nmilitary personnel and Vietnamese civilian casualties to medical \nassistance sites.\n  Captain John Temperelli, Jr. was the first commander of the 57th \nMedical Detachment, Helicopter Ambulance, who would lead the first DUST \nOFF unit in Vietnam. Army Captain Temperelli is considered the \n``pioneer'' of DUST OFF; however, it was Army Major Charles L. Kelly, \nthe unit's third commander, who would establish the traditions and the \nmotto that DUST OFF crews hold sacred today.\n  Major Kelly, like his predecessors, believed in the mission of \nrescuing fallen comrades--so much so that he gave his life to the \nmission. On July 1, 1964, Major Kelly and his crew received a call to \nevacuate a wounded soldier. When they arrived, Major Kelly was \ninstructed by an American advisor on the ground to leave the area; the \nlanding zone was too ``hot.'' Major Kelly responded with the phrase \nthat would become the DUST OFF motto: ``When I have your wounded.'' As \nMajor Kelly hovered over the battlefield, an enemy bullet struck him in \nthe heart; he was killed. It was with news of Major Kelly's death and \nthe story of DUST OFF's dedication to the wounded that DUST OFF earned \nits permanency in the Army.\n  I recently received a book written by a Pennsylvania native, Army \nChief Warrant Officer 5 Mike Novosel, titled DUSTOFF: The Memoir of an \nArmy Aviator. Mr. Novosel--a Medal of Honor recipient who served two \ntours in Vietnam and was a veteran of two other wars--knows first hand \nthe sacrifice, courage and dedication to duty that DUST OFF crews \ndisplayed in Vietnam and continue to display today. In his two tours as \na DUST OFF pilot in Vietnam, Mr. Novosel flew 2,543 missions and \nextracted 5,589 wounded. In his book, Mr. Novosel shares many amazing \nstories of landing in ``hot'' landing zones to allow his medic and crew \nchief, who were also exposed to enemy fire, to rescue and care for the \nwounded. But as Mr. Novosel has said, his experience as a DUST OFF \npilot was not uncommon. Thousands of brave soldiers risked their lives \nevery day by flying into combat zones to evacuate the wounded.\n  I am honored that Mr. Novosel and others have brought the story of \nDUST OFF to my attention. It is my sincere hope that the Army will \nrecognize DUST OFF pilots and crew with an appropriate badge which \nacknowledges the combat service of these brave individuals. When the \nWar Department created the Combat Medical Badge, CMB, in WWII, as a \ncompanion to the Combat Infantryman Badge, CIB, it did so to recognize \nthat ``medical aidmen . . . shared the same hazards and hardships of \nground combat on a daily basis with the infantry soldier.'' DUST OFF \npilots and crew equally shared the hazards and hardships of ground \ncombat with the infantry soldier. The fact that they were not directly \nassigned or attached to a particular infantry unit--a fact that, under \ncurrent Army policy, makes them eligible to receive a CIB or CMB--\nshould not bar special recognition of their service, service that one \nauthor has characterized as ``the brightest achievement of the U.S. \nArmy in Vietnam.''\n  I had not introduced a bill until today because I wanted to hear \ntestimony from DUST OFF participants about their experiences under \nfire. I also wanted to provide the Army with an opportunity to explain \nits position and, perhaps, rethink its opposition to the awarding of an \nappropriate designation to DUST OFF crew members. Earlier today, the \nSenate Committee on Veterans' Affairs held a hearing on the matter. \nBased on testimony offered today by three Vietnam veterans--Chief \nWarrant Officer, Ret., Michael J. Novosel, M.O.H., Chief Warrant \nOfficer, Ret., John M. Travers, and Mr. William Fredrick ``Fred'' \nCastleberry--I am now more convinced than ever of the worthiness of \nthis legislation. The Army again expressed its opposition today; I do \nhope that it will reconsider.\n  On the Vietnam Veterans Memorial are etched the names of over 400 \nmedics, pilots, and crew that gave their lives so others might live. \nThe forward thinking, enthusiasm, and dedication of DUST OFF crews in \nVietnam are attributes seen in today's DUST OFF crews. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation which would recognize the nature \nof the service these individuals have performed, and continue to \nperform, while serving on DUST OFF crew.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1487\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish the Native American Entrepreneurs \nProgram to provide $3,000,000 in grants annually to qualified \norganizations to provide training and technical assistance to \ndisadvantaged Native American entrepreneurs; to the Committee on Indian \nAffairs.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Native American \nEntrepreneurs Act of 2003. The purpose of this legislation is \nstraightforward: it authorizes grants of $3 million in 2004, $4 million \nin 2005, and $5 million in 2006 to qualified organizations to provide \ntraining and technical assistance to Native American entrepreneurs.\n  In my State of New Mexico and all across the country Native Americans \nstill confront the problem of economic development, this in spite of \nthe many efforts that have been made over time, both by Congress and by \nthe tribes themselves. Over the last decade, some tribes have found a \nway to address this problem by focusing on the creation of gambling \ncenters. But while these clearly have assisted many tribes, from where \nI sit this is at best a short- or medium-term solution that does not \naddress the foremost issue at hand--that being how we help individual \nNative Americans acquire the business skills to become self-sufficient.\n  In the 106th Congress the Senate and the House passed legislation \nthat created a program at the Small Business Administration that was \ndesigned to help disadvantaged individuals gain access to the technical \ntraining and funds. The bill--the Program for Investment in \nMicroentrepreneurs Act of 1999, or PRIME--was drafted by several \nSenators, myself included, who felt it was imperative to encourage \ninvestment in microentrepreneurial activities in the United States. The \nreason for the effort was simple: microenterprise was a proven \nmechanism for enabling individuals on the periphery to obtain the \ncapital and technical training needed to start their own business and \nmove up the economic ladder in their community. It was also a proven \nmechanism for creating jobs, alleviating poverty, and stimulating \neconomic development. It deserved to be pushed to the forefront of our \nlegislative efforts in the Senate.\n  Under the PRIME legislation, organizations that provide technical \nassistance and loans to Native American communities are eligible for \ngrants. But while diversity in grant award are mandated under the \nlegislation, specific amounts mandated for Native Americans are not. \nThe legislation I am introducing today would change that. The \nlegislation provides additional funding to the PRIME Act for \norganizations that work with Native Americans specifically. In other \nwords, the funding does not negate the possibility that further funds \nbe provided to Native Americans under PRIME, nor, because it is \nadditional funds over and above current authorization levels, does it \ncut into the funds that are now available to microenterprise \norganizations under PRIME. But it does ensure that organizations that \nserve only Native Americans get specific funding for their efforts.\n  I will be the first to admit that the authorization levels in this \nbill are modest, but they are feasible given the current budget \nenvironment. I will also admit that the bill carves out a small portion \nof the problem currently facing Native Americans, but I consider it to \nbe a first step. I intend to address others problems in future \nlegislation. The most important thing is that this bill, if enacted, \nwill have an immediate and concrete impact in Native American \ncommunities in New Mexico and the rest of the country. I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/29/senate-section/article/S10153-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10153-S10154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 204--DESIGNATING THE WEEK OF NOVEMBER 9 THROUGH \nNOVEMBER 15, 2003, AS ``NATIONAL VETERANS AWARENESS WEEK'' TO EMPHASIZE \nTHE NEED TO DEVELOP EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS REGARDING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF \n                        VETERANS TO THE COUNTRY\n\n  Mr. BIDEN (for himself, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Allen, Mr. Baucus, Mr. \nBingaman, Mr. Bond, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Campbell, \nMs. Cantwell, Mr. Carper, Mr. Chambliss, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Cochran, Ms. \nCollins, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Dayton, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Dodd, Mr. \nDorgan, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Hatch, \nMr. Hollings, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Johnson, Mr. \nKennedy, Mr. Kohl, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Leahy, Mrs. \nLincoln, Mr. Lugar, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Miller, Ms. Murkowski, Mrs. \nMurray, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Reid, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Rockefeller, \nMr. Sarbanes, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Smith, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Stevens, Mr. \nThomas, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Warner, Mr. Kerry, and Mr. Levin) submitted \nthe following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n                              S.

Bush \n     issued a proclamation urging all Americans to observe \n     November 10 through November 16, 2002, as National Veterans \n     Awareness Week: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1. NATIONAL VETERANS AWARENESS WEEK.\n\n       (a) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the President should designate the week of November 9 \n     through November 15, 2003, as ``National Veterans Awareness \n     Week''.\n       (b) Proclamation.--The Senate requests the President to \n     issue a proclamation--\n       (1) designating the week of November 9 through November 15, \n     2003, as ``National Veterans Awareness Week'' for the purpose \n     of emphasizing educational efforts directed at elementary and \n     secondary school students concerning the contributions and \n     sacrifices of veterans; and\n       (2) calling on the people of the United States to observe \n     National Veterans Awareness Week with appropriate educational \n     activities.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I have the honor of joining with 54 \nof my colleagues in submitting a resolution expressing the sense of the \nSenate that the week that includes Veterans' Day this year be \ndesignated as ``National Veterans Awareness Week.'' This marks the \nfourth year in a row that I have submitted such a resolution, which has \nbeen adopted unanimously by the Senate on all previous occasions.\n  The purpose of National Veterans Awareness Week is to serve as a \nfocus for educational programs designed to make students in elementary \nand secondary schools aware of the contributions of veterans and their \nimportance in preserving American peace and prosperity. This goal takes \non particular importance and immediacy this year as we find ourselves \nagain with uniformed men and women in harm's way in foreign lands.\n  Why do we need such an educational effort? In a sense, this action \nhas become necessary because we are victims of our own success with \nregard to the superior performance of our Armed Forces. The plain fact \nis that there are just fewer people around now who have had any \nconnection with military service. For example, as a result of \ntremendous advances in military technology and the resultant \nproductivity increases, our current Armed Forces now operate \neffectively with a personnel roster that is one-third less in size than \njust 15 years ago. In addition, the success of the all-volunteer \ncareer-oriented force has led to much lower turnover of personnel in \ntoday's military than in previous eras when conscription was in place. \nFinally, the number of veterans who served during previous\n\n[[Page S10154]]\n\nconflicts, such as World War II, when our military was many times \nlarger than today, is inevitably declining.\n  The net result of these changes is that the percentage of the entire \npopulation that has served in the Armed Forces is dropping rapidly, a \nchange that can be seen in all segments of society. Whereas during \nWorld War II it was extremely uncommon to find a family in America that \ndid not have one of its members on active duty, now there are numerous \nfamilies that include no military veterans at all. Even though the \nIraqi war has been prominently discussed on television and in the \nnewspapers, many of our children are much more preoccupied with the \nusual concerns of young people than with keeping up with the events of \nthe day. As a consequence, many of our youth still have little or no \nconnection with or knowledge about the important historical and ongoing \nrole of men and women who have served in the military. This omission \nseems to have persisted despite ongoing educational efforts by the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs and the veterans service organizations.\n  This lack of understanding about military veterans' important role in \nour society can have potentially serious repercussions. In our country, \ncivilian control of the Armed Forces is the key tenet of military \ngovernance. A citizenry that is oblivious to the capabilities and \nlimitations of the armed forces, and to its critical role throughout \nour history, can make decisions that have unexpected and unwanted \nconsequences. Even more important, general recognition of the \nimportance of those individual character traits that are essential for \nmilitary success, such as patriotism, selflessness, sacrifice, and \nheroism, is vital to maintaining these key aspects of citizenship in \nthe armed forces and even throughout the population at large.\n  The failure of our children to understand why a military is \nimportant, why our society continues to depend on it for ultimate \nsurvival, and why a successful military requires integrity and \nsacrifice, will have predictable consequences as these youngsters \nbecome of voting age. Even though military service is a responsibility \nthat is no longer shared by a large segment of the population, as it \nhas been in the past, knowledge of the contributions of those who have \nserved in the Armed Forces is as important as it has ever been. To the \nextent that many of us will not have the opportunity to serve our \ncountry in uniform, we must still remain cognizant of our \nresponsibility as citizens to fulfill the obligations we owe, both \ntangible and intangible, to those who do serve and who do sacrifice on \nour behalf.\n  The importance of this issue was brought home to me three years ago \nby Samuel I. Cashdollar, who was then a 13-year-old seventh grader at \nLewes Middle School in Lewes, DE. Samuel won the Delaware VFW's Youth \nEssay Contest that year with a powerful presentation titled ``How \nShould We Honor America's Veterans?'' Samuel's essay pointed out that \nwe have Nurses' Week, Secretaries' Week, and Teachers' Week, to rightly \nemphasize the importance of these occupations, but the contributions of \nthose in uniform tend to be overlooked. We don't want our children \ngrowing up to think that Veterans Day has simply become a synonym for \ndepartment store sale, and we don't want to become a nation where more \nhigh school seniors recognize the name Britney Spears than the name \nDwight Eisenhower.\n  National Veterans Awareness Week complements Veterans Day by focusing \non education as well as commemoration, on the contributions of the many \nin addition to the heroism and service of the individual. National \nVeterans Awareness Week also presents an opportunity to remind \nourselves of the contributions and sacrifices of those who have served \nin peacetime as well as in conflict; both groups work unending hours \nand spend long periods away from their families under conditions of \ngreat discomfort so that we all can live in a land of freedom and \nplenty.\n  Last year, my Resolution designating National Veterans Awareness Week \nhad 55 cosponsors and was approved in the Senate by unanimous consent. \nResponding to that resolution, President Bush issued a proclamation \nurging our citizenry to observe National Veterans Awareness Week. I ask \nmy colleagues to continue this trend of support for our veterans by \nendorsing this resolution again this year. Our children and our \nchildren's children will need to be well informed about what veterans \nhave accomplished in order to make appropriate decisions as they \nconfront the numerous worldwide challenges that they are sure to face \nin the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/29/senate-section/article/S10154-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10154-S10165]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1410.
