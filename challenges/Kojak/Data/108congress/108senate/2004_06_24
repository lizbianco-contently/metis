A lot of hard \nwork, a lot of good negotiation, brought a very good bill, as reflected \nin the ultimate vote. I do want to thank both the managers who got us \nthrough the bill. That was the authorization.\n  Now we have a Defense appropriations bill ahead of us. Chairman \nStevens is prepared to begin that legislation, and we expect to finish \nthat bill prior to the recess. We will be consulting further with the \nDemocratic leadership, and hopefully we will have that scheduled \nshortly.\n  Immediately this morning we will be proceeding to executive session \nfor the consideration of the nomination of one of our former \ncolleagues, Jack Danforth, to be U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/24/senate-section/article/S7349-7", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7349]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

There are four that will be scheduled for votes with no debate \nnecessary. There are two we will lock in for votes following 1 hour of \ndebate, and I expect to ask that consent momentarily. There is also one \nfurther nomination that will require a longer debate period, and we are \nconsulting with Members as to whether to schedule that debate and vote.\n  In addition to these nominations, there are a number of \nambassadorships we hope to consider prior to adjourning, although we do \nnot anticipate rollcall votes on these.\n\n[[Page S7350]]\n\n  There are other issues, including Burma sanctions, that we will \nlikely address over the course of the day and tomorrow.\n  Finally, I would reiterate the need to finish the Defense \nappropriations measure. It is a priority for completion, and we need to \nwork together to get that bill passed before the July 4 recess. We have \nspent 4 weeks on the Defense authorization where Senators have debated \nthe issues and had ample opportunity to bring issues to the floor on \ndefense and debate those. Thus, we should be able to proceed \nexpeditiously on the Defense appropriations bill.

Danforth of Missouri, to be \nRepresentative of the United States of America to the United Nations, \nwith the rank and status of Ambassador Extraordinary and \nPlenipotentiary, and Representative of the United States of America in \nthe Security Council of the United Nations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 1 hour of debate equally \ndivided on the nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, on behalf of the manager of the \nnomination, the Senator from Indiana, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, it is a privilege to rise today to commend \nto this body the confirmation of an individual whom I have had the \nhonor of calling a colleague for over 30 years, and someone Members of \nthis body have known for a long time. That is our good friend, former \nSenator John C. Danforth. There was something very delicious about the \nfact that the clerk noted he will become Ambassador Extraordinary and \nPlenipotentiary. That kind of sums it up.\n  Jack Danforth is an outstanding individual who will be having great \nresponsibilities serving the United States as Ambassador at the United \nNations.\n  Most of us who are familiar with Jack know of his many \naccomplishments and attributes. But there is one quality that always \ncomes to mind when you ask people what do you know about or what do you \nthink about when you think of Jack Danforth? The people who have worked \nwith him and have had an opportunity to watch him would say one word: \nintegrity. This is a man of great integrity, as well as dedication and \ncompassion, and even a dry sense of humor, when appropriate.\n  Senator Danforth was born in St. Louis County and graduated from St. \nLouis Country Day High School. He graduated from Princeton University \nin 1958, and then Yale University Law School and Divinity School in \n1963. He was admitted to practice in New York in 1963, and that same \nyear he was ordained as part of the clergy of the Episcopal Church. As \nwe all recently saw, he participated in the services honoring our late, \ngreat President Ronald Reagan.\n  I have been to many services conducted by Rev. John C. Danforth. One \nthat particularly affected this body was the memorial service for our \nlate colleague, John Heinz, the Senator from Pennsylvania. I can tell \nyou, when we went to Pittsburgh for those services, there were many \nvery deeply hurt and troubled Senators. There is not much one would \nthink could be said, but Jack Danforth was able to bring us together \nand give us hope and help lighten the burden of that loss.\n  In addition, obviously, to being a clergyman, Jack began his \npolitical career in 1969, serving as Attorney General of Missouri, \nusing his legal background. I had the privilege to serve as an \nassistant attorney general under him and was grateful for the \nopportunity to be there, to learn the high standards he set and \ndemanded not only for himself but for everybody who worked for him.\n  In the Senate, to which he was elected in 1976, he served as chairman \nof the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. He served on \nthe Finance Committee and undertook many important responsibilities. He \nwas a leader in the passage of the civil rights legislation that was \nenacted by the Congress. He went back to Missouri to resume the \npractice of law in St. Louis. Really, I think he went back to spend \nmore time with his wonderful wife Sally, who is a tremendous friend to \nmany of us who have a chance to know her, and his grandchildren, and \nalso to watch Cardinal baseball.\n  Jack was called upon by President Bush to broker peace in the civil \nwar in Sudan that had claimed some 2 million lives. He worked \ntirelessly and committed himself to improving the lives of others. He \ndemonstrated once again to the U.S.--and this time to the world--his \nability to understand and simplify complex political problems.\n  About 2 weeks ago, he called me at my home in Missouri and said: The \nPresident asked me to take on another assignment. I said: Jack, I hope \nit is not as dangerous an assignment as Sudan. He said: No, he asked me \nto be representative to the United Nations. I said: I think that may be \nless dangerous, I am not sure. We certainly hope it will be.\n\n[[Page S7351]]\n\n  But I told him I could not think of someone who is better able to \nserve the United States. When our reputation and status in the world is \nbeing questioned--I happen to think unfairly and incorrectly--it is a \nmatter of fact that we need a man of Jack Danforth's fairness and \nintegrity to represent us in the U.N., to reach out to other nations. \nHe will know when to assert our Nation's sovereignty and how to do so \nwith a spirit of humbleness and cooperation, as he has shown me. I ask \nthis body to confirm him unanimously.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask that the time be charged \nequally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I yield myself as much time as I may \nrequire for this statement from the time allocated to our side.\n  Madam President, today the Senate will have the opportunity to \nconsider many nominations for diplomatic posts of some very talented \nAmericans who have made themselves available for public service--some \nas a career, and others for temporary periods--and who have come before \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee in formal hearings, and whom the \ncommittee has sent to the floor for action by the Senate. It is my hope \nthese nominations will be acted upon favorably today.\n  It is important to our country that these ambassadors and \nrepresentatives to various other international organizations be in \nplace as rapidly as possible. In an often-changing and sometimes \ndangerous world, we need that leadership. Our committee has tried to \nact in an expeditious manner to provide a fair degree of certainty to \nSenators, and a confidence level that these are good nominees who will \nrepresent our country well.\n  Prominent among those whom we recommend today is our former \ncolleague, Senator John Danforth of Missouri. It is a great pleasure \nfor me to address the nomination of Senator Danforth before the Senate \nnow in this specific debate on his nomination. As a result of his three \ndistinguished terms as a Senator from Missouri, he is well known to \nmany Members of the Senate and to the Committee on Foreign Relations. \nIt turns out that eight of us served with Senator Danforth in this \nbody. We were able to identify ourselves during the hearing.\n  I had the privilege of coming into the Senate with Senator Danforth \nafter the election of 1976, sworn in early in January, and had the \npleasure of serving with him throughout the 18 years of his tenure.\n  After entering with Senator Danforth, as did Senator Paul Sarbanes of \nMaryland and Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, in what was a large class of \nSenators--eight Democrats and eight Republicans coming in as new \nSenators from the election of 1976--those of us who had the privilege \nof serving with him can certainly attest to his integrity, his \nintellect, his sound judgment, and his good humor.\n  President Bush has made a very wise choice, in my judgment, for an \nextremely important position. The Committee on Foreign Relations \nsignaled its agreement by voting him out of committee unanimously last \nTuesday.\n  I will mention parenthetically that in a meeting at the White House \nthis morning, President Bush asked specifically for consideration for \nthe leadership on the part of those of us on both sides of the aisle to \nmake certain we are represented at the United Nations as our now-\nAmbassador to the United Nations, Ambassador Negroponte, goes on to \nthese very important responsibilities in setting up the new embassy in \nIraq.\n  The job before Senator Danforth is a daunting one that will require \nall of his talents and his experience. As the Security Council vote 2 \nweeks ago on Iraq demonstrated, critical decisions are being made at \nthe United Nations that have a huge impact on the outcome in Iraq, on \nthe welfare of our troops there, and on peace in the world.\n  Success in Iraq is unlikely to be achieved without the active \ncooperation of many other nations, reinforced by the international \nlegitimacy that can be secured and underlined at the United Nations.\n  Beyond Iraq, that same week, the United Nations Security Council met \nto discuss sanctions on Liberia, the peacekeeping mission in Cypress, \nand weapons of mass destruction generally. Other United Nations bodies \naddressed in that same week issues as divergent as women's rights, the \nneed for greater access to potable water in this world, efforts to \nexpand freedom of expression, and the role that primary education plays \nin childhood development. The United Nations remains the focal point of \nour multilateral diplomacy on so many fronts.\n  Being U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations requires one not only to \ndeal with policies and politics in New York, it requires one to manage \nthese same issues back here in Washington where many in Congress are \nsometimes skeptical of the United Nations procedures.\n  Our U.N. Ambassador must be able to explain to Congress why it is \nimportant to pay our dues and to pay them on time, and why peacekeeping \noperations can benefit the United States. Every U.N. peacekeeper in the \nCongo, Haiti, and East Timor allows U.S. troops to focus on our \nmissions in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere.\n  At the same time, our Ambassador must be a forceful spokesperson for \ngreater efficiency and transparency at the United Nations and an \nintolerance of corruption at the United Nations. The recent revelations \nregarding the Oil-for-Food Program remind us that close oversight must \nbe part of our role at the U.N.\n  Senator Danforth's years of experience in Washington ensure that he \nwill keep Congress informed about U.S. policies at the U.N. His talents \nas a bridgebuilder and a communicator will serve him well as he seeks \nto articulate both to the world and to the Congress the nuances of his \nwork in New York.\n\n  Since leaving the Senate, Senator John Danforth has continued his \ncommitment to public service. From 1999 to 2001, he headed the \nindependent inquiry into the Branch Davidian standoff at Waco, TX. \nSince September of 2001, he has served as President Bush's special \nenvoy for peace in troubled Sudan where he has devoted his time and his \ntalents to reducing the suffering in that troubled nation.\n  In this capacity, he has made seven trips to Sudan and other nations \nin the region. This experience will be particularly useful when the \nUnited Nations Security Council begins debate on whether to send \npeacekeepers to try to maintain the fragile peace framework signed in \nNairobi on June 5. We wish him success in this endeavor and pray this \nframework evolves into a formal peace agreement that finally ends the \ncivil war that has resulted in more than 2 million deaths and over 4 \nmillion displaced persons.\n  The United States and the United Nations must work together in Sudan, \nIraq, Haiti, Afghanistan, and many other trouble spots throughout the \nworld. American credibility in the world, progress in the war on \nterrorism, and our relationships with our allies will be greatly \naffected by what can be accomplished at the United Nations in the \ncoming months and years.\n  Senator Danforth is eminently qualified to meet these and other \nchallenges. We recognize the deep personal commitment necessary to \nundertake this difficult assignment. We are grateful that a leader of \nhis stature is willing to step forward. I recommend Senator John \nDanforth to the full Senate and ask my colleagues to send him on his \nway to New York with a unanimous vote.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I wish to join my colleague, the chairman \nof the full committee, today in support of the nomination of an old \nfriend, Jack Danforth, to be Ambassador to the United Nations. As many \nof us, I have known Jack for a lot of years, and I have an inordinately \nhigh regard for him. The one point I continue to marvel at, but I am \nnot at all surprised at, is that he keeps answering the call. Every \ntough job he is asked to do--in or out of government--he steps up to \nthe plate and he does it. I think having Jack Danforth at the United \nNations is going to be a very positive thing.\n\n[[Page S7352]]\n\n  People say we should have professional diplomats. Jack Danforth is a \nprofessional diplomat. Jack Danforth is the ultimate professional \ndiplomat. Jack Danforth knows how people think. From his years as an \nordained minister, as a Senator, and an attorney general of his State, \nhe knows how people think and feel and move. But, Madam President, do \nyou know what I like best about Jack Danforth going to the United \nNations? He will be absolutely straight--absolutely straight.\n  I have an incredibly high regard for Ambassador Negroponte, for whom \nI voted to become Ambassador to Iraq, probably the toughest job in the \nbag these days. This is not meant as a reflection on Ambassador \nNegroponte. But Jack Danforth has the stature to go to the President \nand say: Mr. President, I disagree; I think you should not. Or ``I \nwould recommend the following.'' He has the stature, just because of \nwho Jack Danforth is--just because he knows. There are some men and \nwomen who just possess it. He possesses it. He has the stature. We know \nthe expression, ``command presence.'' Jack Danforth has command \npresence. What makes me feel good is the President is going to get \nunvarnished advice from Jack. Jack is a team player. Jack is a \nsupporter of the President. Jack feels strongly that the President's \nmission is correct. But Jack will also, if he disagrees, not hesitate \none minute to, in my view, privately tell the President. I think every \nPresident is best served when he has women and men around him with the \nconviction to tell the President honestly what they think.\n  When you walk into that White House, when you walk into that Oval \nOffice, it is an intimidating place if you do not walk in with your \nshoulders back, your head up, and understand what your responsibility \nis. That is the quality in Jack that I am excited about in his going to \nthe United Nations.\n  He also has stature, in my view, to turn to the French or Chinese or \nBritish Ambassadors, for example, and privately say: Look, cut this \nstuff this is what we have to get done. This is how we should try to \nwork this.\n\n  I think stature matters in this job--at this moment, at this time, \nand in this administration. I think Jack Danforth has always stepped up \nto the critical moments in recent history. As the June 30 deadline for \ntransfer of sovereignty in Iraq occurs very shortly, Iraq is one of \nmany urgent issues on the United Nations agenda. There are many others: \nSudan, Afghanistan, Haiti, just to name three.\n  The administration seems to have finally discovered the virtue of the \nUnited Nations. That sounds like a bit of a snide remark for me to \nstand here and say that the administration ``finally discovered.'' But \nliterally, I say ``finally,'' because this administration ran for \noffice and came to office expressing verbally, in writing and in their \nactions--it would be extreme to say ``disdain'' but not a particularly \nhigh regard for the United Nations. However, since then, the President \nhas honored the United Nations by going to it and making clear \nAmerica's position on the most urgent issues of the day.\n  Now the administration is back in the United Nations with both feet \nand is trying to rally international support in a way that, quite \nfrankly, I hoped and wished we had done a year ago, or longer.\n  The reason I mention this is not to highlight when the administration \nshould or should not have done it. I mention returning to the United \nNations because it coincides with Jack Danforth being at the helm \nthere. I think that his being there is good for this country. The \nadministration, in its successful and unanimous vote on Security \nCouncil Resolution 1546 on June 11, moved in a direction in which it \nhad been hesitant to move, in my view, before. That is good news \nbecause we have squandered a number of meaningful opportunities to \nshare the burden in Iraq. I hope we do not miss any more. I know \nSenator Danforth's leadership can make a real difference on that front.\n  Last weekend, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Senator \nDaschle, the Democratic leader from South Dakota, and I traveled to \nIraq, Kuwait, and Jordan. The trip confirmed to me that turning over \nsovereignty on June 30 in Iraq is a starting point. It is not a turning \npoint in the transition to self-government. I remain absolutely \nconvinced that we can still get this right in Iraq and that we have to \ntry because of the profound stakes we have in a successful transition. \nThere is so much to lose if it fails.\n  We have to start leveling with the American people about what is and \nwhat is not happening on June 30. We are handing over sovereignty, but \nwe are not handing over capacity. That is not a criticism. It is not as \nif we should be in a position to be able to hand over capacity. I think \nwe could have been in a position to hand over much more, but it is not \na criticism.\n  By ``capacity,'' I mean the ability of the Iraqis to provide security \nfor themselves, to defend their borders, to defeat insurgency, to \ndeliver services, to run a government, and to begin to set a foundation \nfor economic success. What is so frustrating is that because of a \nseries of very wrong judgments, we lost at least a year in effectively \nbuilding that capacity. As a result, we have made an inherently \ndifficult mission even harder.\n  If there is anyplace where humility is in order, it is in suggesting \nhow we should proceed in Iraq. I remember when the distinguished \nchairman, Senator Hagel, and I visited Iraq last August and we sat with \nAmbassador Bremer. My friend may remember my looking at Ambassador \nBremer in the only room in that whole facility that had air-\nconditioning and saying: Mr. Ambassador, I want to make it clear to you \nI think if the Lord Almighty came down and sat in the middle of this \nconference table and gave you the precise answer to the next 20 \ncritical decisions you have to make, we still only have a 65-percent \nchance of getting this right.\n  Nobody has ever done this before. The Ottomans could not get it done. \nThe Persians could not get it done. The Brits could not get it done. \nAnd they are not even dealing with what the country is today. Iraq is a \npolyglot made up of essentially what was left over in the region of \nthree groups of noble people.\n\n  The fact is, this is a hard job by any standard. The central question \nis what we can do between June 30 when the sovereignty is handed over, \nand December of 2005 when a constitutionally elected Iraqi government \nis supposed to be seated. What can we do in that interim to help build \nthat government that will be seated in December 2005? What can we do to \nhelp build the capacity for it to stand on its own? I think this should \nnot be the sole responsibility of the United States.\n  The international community, through a unanimous vote on Security \nCouncil Resolution 1546, made clear that Iraq is the world's problem. \nAll of the Security Council voted in favor of that. They voted for \nelements of the whole. One of the elements, for example, just to note \nparenthetically, says that there will be provided a brigade, 4,000 \ntroops, to protect the U.N. when they go back in. What was not stated \nis who will provide the troops.\n  There are many other elements that the unanimous resolution laid out \nin the Security Council. The Permanent Five, and other members of the \nSecurity Council signed on. They did not just sign on saying the United \nStates can stay. They signed on saying that Iraq is the world's \nresponsibility.\n  The reason I go into this is to describe that it is going to take a \nman of Jack Danforth's stature--while we are working it from State, \nwhile Negroponte is working it from Baghdad, while the President is \nworking from the White House--to work out the problem of how we get the \nworld's major powers, Iraq's neighbors, and leading international \ninstitutions such as NATO, to pick up empowering the Iraqis to govern.\n  In a nutshell, I believe we are going to have to, and Senator \nDanforth is going to have to play a part in getting other nations to \nhelp us train and equip Iraqi security services--including the police \nand the army--commit to defeat the insurgency, and provide security for \nIraqi elections, which is going to require a surge of forces, not a \nreduction of forces. They should not all be U.S. military forces. The \nrest of the world has to get in on the deal, preferably with NATO and \nother foreign troops.\n  We need civil affairs experts from our allies, and more special \nforces and intelligence assets from America. We\n\n[[Page S7353]]\n\nhave to provide, as called for in UN Security Council Resolution 1546, \na special brigade, ideally from NATO, to protect the U.N. mission in \nIraq, whose presence is critical for successful elections.\n  I know the Presiding Officer knows this but maybe not all of our \ncolleagues have not focused on this: Thousands of polling places are \ngoing to have to open up. There are going to be U.N. people going into \nvillages and going into towns throughout Iraq, over the next 6 months, \nto set up for the first election. That is going to be dangerous \nbusiness. You have Zarqawi and others announcing that they are going to \ntry to kill not only the interim government, but anybody who \nparticipates in making this work. So we need to assist the U.N. in \ndoing its job--which is essential for our ultimate exit strategy--which \nis to support a secure Iraqi government--secure within its borders, not \na threat to its neighbors, and not harboring weapons of mass \ndestruction or terrorists.\n  How do we get from here to there? Jack, Senator Danforth, is going to \nhave his hands full. We have to deploy an army of technical experts, \nprimarily from other countries, to help Iraq run its government, and \ndeliver essential services like electricity, water, and sanitation. By \nthe way, I am not just talking about the major projects. The Russians \npulled back from what seemed to them a pretty good contract, a contract \nto go out there and build electrical power capacity. Their folks were \ngetting shot and killed, so they pulled back.\n  But there are thousands of little projects that are going to \ndetermine whether we succeed or fail in Iraq. One of the most \nimpressive commanders I have met, and I spent a couple of hours with \nhim in a briefing--is the Commander of the First Cavalry, an incredibly \nproud unit.\n  He said to all of us: Senators, look, I leave my tanks back in \nAmerica. My tank drivers are now infantrymen. My infantrymen I had \nassociated with this are now engineers.\n  On his big screen during this briefing he showed us Humvees. He has \nSadr City as his responsibility. He showed Humvees going through sewage \nliterally up to their hubcaps.\n  There is a company out in California that has done a remarkable job. \nIt has created overlays for a number of things, such as utilities, that \nyou would think were disparate and had nothing to do with one another. \nThe overlays show where the greatest physical needs are, in terms of \npollution and water problems, for example. Then the company overlaid, \non top of that grid, a diagram of where the most fighters are coming \nfrom, and where the most terror is coming from.\n  This commander of the First Cavalry said: Take a look. In the places \nwhere we have gone in and done relatively small projects, such as \ngetting potable water to homes, I don't have people coming out of and \nkilling my guys and women. He said, Do you know what I need? I need a \nbetter mix of troops--not better troops but a better mix of troops and \ncapability. He said there is about $450 million worth of projects that \nhe has agreed and laid on, in Sadr City.\n  This is a commander who can shoot straight and kill. This is a \nserious guy. He said: You help me clean up the sewer, I will clean up \nSadr City and I will get us peace in that area.\n  We have a lot of needs. The U.N. resolution, in my view, signs on the \ninternational community. Now it is time for them to sign up to take on \nsome of these responsibilities.\n  The other thing we have to do, in which Senator Danforth is going to \nhave to play a major part, is insist that other countries follow \nthrough on their financial pledges for more assistance, and demand that \nthey provide significant debt relief. As a matter of fact, as my \ncolleague brought up in a very important meeting this morning, we have \nto get money in there quickly. We can't wait to begin these major \nprojects. We voted for about $18 billion for Iraq to rebuild it. We \nhave spent a pittance of that. It has not been spent. None of it has \nhappened. Less than a half billion dollars, less than $500 million of \nthe $18 billion we appropriated, has been spent on projects. That is \ntragic. That is not particularly good management, in my view.\n  Furthermore, Senator Danforth will have to bring other Security \nCouncil members together to develop a viable U.N. strategy for dealing \nwith this great tragedy that is occurring in western Sudan. If our U.N. \nAmbassador doesn't take the lead in the Security Council then, in my \nview, little is going to happen.\n  Senator Danforth was called to get involved, and he did a brilliant \njob in negotiating the north/south crisis in the Sudan. Over the past \nseveral years he has worked very hard as a special envoy to support the \npeace process between the Government of Khartoum and the Sudanese \nPeople's Liberation Movement.\n  With the signing of the last three protocols on May 26, that peace \nprocess is on the verge of a success and it is truly a significant \nachievement for the President and for Senator Danforth. But the impact \nof that agreement has almost completely been undermined by the horrific \nattacks on the civilians in Darfur by the Government of Sudan and its \nallied militias. These attacks have precipitated what the U.N. and U.S. \nofficials call the worst humanitarian crisis in the world today.\n\n  We have already witnessed ethnic cleansing on a massive scale. \nAlready as many as 30,000 people have been killed. Mr. Natsios, the \nadministrator of the Agency for International Development, stated 3 \nweeks ago: ``Under optimal conditions, we could see as many as 320,000 \npeople die'' in Darfur by the end of the year as a result of this \nviolence, disease, and famine.\n  The U.N. factfinding team:\n\n       . . . identified . . . massive human rights violations in \n     Darfur, perpetrated by the Government of Sudan and its proxy \n     militia, which may constitute war crimes and/or crimes \n     against humanity.\n\n  I believe it is genocide.\n  The violations reported by the U.N. include the targeting of \ncivilians during military strikes, the widespread rape of women and \ngirls, destruction of homes, food stores, livestock, crops . . . the \nrazing of villages, forced displacements, and disappearances.\n  The administration has responded with humanitarian aid and raised the \nissue of Darfur repeatedly in Khartoum, and the President told us this \nmorning at breakfast that he raised it at the G-8 meeting as well. The \nU.N. sent teams out to investigate. These are all important steps, but \nthey are not enough. The international community must condemn \nKhartoum's actions unequivocally. It must insist that Khartoum stop \nattacks on civilians by government troops and militia, and provide \nunfettered access to Darfur for humanitarian workers.\n  I will soon introduce legislation that our U.N. Representative, I \nhope, will push for in a U.N. Security Council resolution which \nreimposes sanctions on Khartoum if the attacks in Darfur do not stop. \nThis action may not resolve the situation, but it will help. Senator \nDanforth knows more about this crisis than I do, and do most of us in \nthis place. I hope he will pursue such a resolution as one of his first \nactions as Ambassador to the United Nations.\n  Congress has to do its part. The United States should bring real \nmoney to the table to respond to the crisis, rather than empty promises \nthat the money is on the way. I am working on an amendment to the \nDefense Department appropriations bill that would provide money for \nDarfur which Mr. Natsios pledged earlier this month the United States \nwill provide. But bilateral action by the United States is not enough. \nWe need our international partners to assist in pursuing Khartoum to \nstop the terror campaign in Darfur.\n  There are many other pressing issues facing the United Nations in New \nYork. We have a lot of diplomatic work to do to repair relations. We \nhave a new team at the top in Jack Danforth and, assuming she is also \nconfirmed, his deputy, Anne Patterson. But I think the President has \nchosen very well.\n  By himself, Jack Danforth cannot repair relations between the United \nStates and other nations at the U.N. But he said in the confirmation \nhearing that the reason he finally took the job that he initially \ndidn't want to take is that he saw that as his mission, the single most \nimportant thing he could do. A recognition as to how important that \nbelief is, is in and of itself an important message to be sent around \nthe world.\n  Jack Danforth is the right person at the right moment to help repair \nthe\n\n[[Page S7354]]\n\nbreach, if the administration is committed to do so. And I am confident \nwith Jack's leadership they will be able to do so.\n  In closing, I would like to extend my gratitude to Jack Danforth for \nagreeing to take on this difficult assignment. I thank his wife Sally \nfor supporting him. I know I speak for all of my colleagues on this \nside of the aisle and, I suspect, although I wouldn't presume, the \nentire Senate. I speak for all us when I say, Thank you, Godspeed, \ncount on us. I know you can count on the chairman of this committee, \nSenator Lugar, and me to do all we can to help you make your mission at \nthe United Nations workable and doable.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I would like to yield time to the \ndistinguished Senator from Missouri, Senator Talent. I yield as much \ntime as he might require.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. TALENT. Madam President, I thank my friend from Indiana. I \ncertainly want to associate myself with the remarks made on this floor \non behalf of Senator Danforth. I know they have been uniformly, without \nexception, complimentary to him--not in a typical way we as matter of \ngesture may compliment public figures, but these were remarks by people \nwho knew and who have known and who have worked with Jack Danforth for \nyears and years and know him to be a tremendous public servant of deep \nintegrity, thoughtfulness, and courage.\n  I am proud to say that he hails from the great State of Missouri. \nPresident Bush has simply selected a great man for this post. When he \ncalled me and told me about it, I told him I was thrilled. I could not \nthink of a more qualified person to represent the United States at the \nUnited Nations.\n  Like most of us who have been around politics and government, I have \nknown Senator Danforth and his wife Sally for many years. He served his \ncountry and the people of Missouri with dignity and distinction. It is \nappropriate to take a moment to place on the Record again his \nbackground and his credentials.\n  He served two terms as the attorney general of Missouri; three terms \nin the U.S. Senate; handled, as Senator Biden said, the difficult task \nof trying to bring peace to the Sudan, the difficult and delicate task \nof investigating the tragedy that occurred at Waco and emerged from \nthat job, which could very easily have led to censure and disapproval \nfrom this town because it was a very controversial type investigation, \nwith plaudits from everyone who recognized the thoroughness, the \neffectiveness, and the fairness of that investigation.\n  He knows the importance of bipartisanship. We have seen that from the \ncomments on this floor today. Most recently the Nation appreciated his \neloquence and his thoughtfulness as he said goodbye to President Reagan \nduring his memorial service.\n  He is, in short, a considerate man with character, diligence, and \nwhose abilities qualify him to represent our Nation. The Senate will \nsupport him unanimously and without opposition.\n  As Senator Biden said, he is going to have a very difficult job. The \nUnited Nations is not an easy place. We are engaged in a war on \nterrorism. I want to say that, in my judgment, the United Nations has \nnever really come to grips with the danger we are fighting. That will \ncertainly be one of Senator Danforth's tasks.\n  One of the reasons this transnational movement of thugs we are now \nconfronting grew to be as powerful as it became is because of the \nneglect of the international community and the United Nations. Policies \nof appeasement do not work with this group of people. I am not certain \nthe United Nations realizes that.\n  I harken back to the end 2002 and the speech Prime Minister Blair \ngave to the Parliament, which I had an opportunity to watch, about \nnegotiations within the United Nations about trying to deal with the \nthreat against representative freedom by Saddam Hussein. Prime \nMinister Blair made the point then that after years and years and years \nof negotiations of containment, of watching him violate the obligations \nhe had made after we defeated him in 1991, after a long record of \naggression toward his neighbors, the use of weapons of mass \ndestruction, deception, and the United States and Great Britain asked \nfor one more resolution demanding that he show he had disarmed, with a \nthreat of force if he failed to comply. That was blocked in the United \nNations to which Jack Danforth is going to be an Ambassador.\n\n  The United Nations is, in my judgment, important in reconstructing \nIraq. But it is important that the United Nations understand the threat \nwe are confronting.\n  After Saddam was removed and the United Nations came to assist with \nhumanitarian reconstruction, their headquarters was attacked by the \nterrorists. It was a terrible tragedy. While on one level you can \nunderstand it, on another level it was unfortunate that they lowered \nthe flag and left. But that is what the United Nations did. The \nterrorists took that as a sign of weakness.\n  Senator Danforth is going to represent us in an organization which is \nhighly bureaucratic, which is troubled by its own Food-for-Oil scandal, \nand whose resolve in the face of terrorism has been questionable in the \npast. I know he will do a great job of representing American interests. \nI believe he can help us draw close again to our traditional allies. He \nis the kind of person who knows how to be gracious and courageous at \nthe same time.\n  I wish him well. He certainly has my support. I know the Senate will \nsupport him unanimously as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, it is with a deep sense of honor and \nprivilege that I speak today in support of the nomination of one of our \nformer colleagues, John C. Danforth, to serve as the U.S. Ambassador to \nthe United Nations.\n  While I served in the Congress for many years with Jack Danforth, our \nfriendship was forged long before we arrived in Washington. Dating back \nto the late 1960s, he and I served our respective States as attorneys \ngeneral: no small task given the turbulent times in which we were \nliving. Jack and I, along with a few of our other attorneys general \nwhose names are familiar--Slade Gorton and Warren Rudman--banded \ntogether to find common solutions to problems that our States were \nfacing. Whether it was the threat of rampant development or the upsurge \nin illegal drug use, these problems had the potential to overwhelm our \nindividual States. However, by working together through the National \nAssociation of Attorneys General, we made it through those tough times \nand I believe our States were better served for those relationships we \nforged.\n  Little did we know back then that years later, we would all be \nrepresenting our States in this great Chamber, which Senator Danforth \ndid with distinction from 1976 to 1995. I remember working with Jack \nDanforth on the Civil Rights Act of 1991, where his leadership was \nvital to passing that very important legislation. Through the course of \na summer of seemingly endless meetings, discussions and negotiations \nwith leaders of the contending factions, Jack Danforth was able to \nbring together support for a bill that guaranteed equal opportunity in \nthe work place for all Americans. I stood with Senator Danforth through \nthe entire process in 1991, and to this day remain awed by his ability \nto seek compromise, work in a bipartisan fashion and find common \nground.\n  I was sad when Jack left the Senate, but his departure did not bring \nan end to his hard work. In a move that I believe speaks volumes about \nhis character, he was selected by Attorney General Janet Reno to head \nthe investigation of the FBI's role in the Waco, TX, tragedy. And in \nwhat was undoubtedly one of his toughest assignments, Jack was named \nEnvoy for Peace in Sudan by President George Bush in September 2001.\n  All of his life experience leaves Senator Danforth amply qualified to \nrepresent our country in the United Nations, whose role in the world is \nso critical right now.\n  But perhaps there is one more item on his resume that should be \nmentioned. As we all witnessed at the recent funeral of President \nRonald Reagan, Jack is also an Episcopal minister.\n  As I sat in the National Cathedral and listened to the Reverend \nDanforth deliver the homily on that day, I remembered what great \nadmiration I had\n\n[[Page S7355]]\n\nfor his work in the Senate, and realized how I missed his company.\n  He gave us all comfort that day, and the words he spoke about the \nlate President could be said for Jack Danforth as well. I quote: ``He \nwas not consumed by himself.''\n  I believe Jack Danforth has demonstrated that he is a man of great \ndiplomatic skill who has always put the needs of his nation first. he \nis well suited to be our ambassador to the United Nations.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. WARNER. I rise today in support of the nomination of former \nSenator James Danforth to be U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. I \ncan think of no person better qualified to fill this critical position \nduring the war on terrorism.\n  Senator Danforth is a true statesman, and is one of my closest \nfriends over my 26 years of service in this Chamber. During this time \nin the Senate, our friend was a valued colleague and an even more \nvaluable servant of the people of Missouri. He was first elected in \n1976, 2 years before I came to the Senate, and served 18 years in this \nbody. The fact that he was elected to three consecutive 6-year terms \nfrom the ``Show Me'' State of Missouri illustrates his remarkable \nwisdom and his ability to listen to his constituents in deciding \nimportant issues of the day.\n  After leaving the Senate, our colleague remained in service to his \ncountry, chairing a committee that reviewed the Federal response to the \nBranch Davidian activity in Waco, TX. More recently, Senator Danforth \nserved as special envoy to the Sudan--an area of the world experiencing \na particularly difficult and tragic humanitarian situation. In this \ncapacity, he continued to demonstrate the compassion and goodwill that \nwe became so familiar with in this body.\n  Senator Danforth left the Senate to answer a calling to the Episcopal \npriesthood. Even while he served among us in the Senate, our colleague \nvolunteered on occasion as a pastor at the National Cathedral, where my \nown uncle served as rector in St. Albans Parish nearly three-quarters \nof a century ago. I was baptized and confirmed there on the Cathedral \nclose, and was married at a chapel of that Cathedral just this past \nyear. Senator Danforth and I not only were close friends; we shared a \nspecial bond of affection for that great Cathedral, which played such \nan important role in both of our lives.\n  And most recently, our good friend did such a magnificent job \nofficiating in that same Cathedral at the funeral of President Ronald \nReagan. Hearing our colleague's voice at that historic and difficult \noccasion gave comfort to each of us who were humbled to attend that \nceremony. He did us proud: and we expected no less.\n  Now our dear colleague opens the next chapter of his exemplary career \nin public service. In these most difficult of times, when our relations \nwith our allies are so critical to our fight against a new enemy, I am \nconfident that our good friend will carry himself with the same \ndistinction--the same wisdom and thoughtfulness--that he demonstrated, \nover the years, next to us, in this very Chamber. Mr. President, each \nof us, as Americans, is fortunate that our colleague will once again be \nby our side in this critical public role.\n  I wish our dear friend all the best in his important new post.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I am advised there are no other Senators \nhere wishing to speak on the nominations. I am authorized to yield back \ntime on both sides of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the \nnominations of John C. Danforth to be Representative of the United \nStates of America to the General Assembly, to be Representative with \nthe rank and status of Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary, \nand Representative to the Security Council of the United Nations, en \nbloc?\n  The nominations were confirmed, en bloc.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I know we will be moving to other business \nin a few minutes. We have completed voting on Senator Danforth's \nnomination, but I wanted to come to the floor and speak to that \nnomination.\n  Senator Danforth has had a long and distinguished career in the \nSenate, and he has served this Nation capably, ably, and nobly since \nthe time of that service. In particular, as has been mentioned over the \ncourse of the morning, he has served as President Bush's envoy to Sudan \nand has worked tirelessly to bring peace to that war-torn nation.\n  I focus on the Sudan because it is a country on a continent that \nmeans a lot to me personally. I was in the Sudan in September. I was \nthere the year before that and the year before that and the year before \nthat. I have been to Sudan many times and spent most of my time in the \nsouth of Sudan, a war-torn nation with 2 million people who have died \nand 5 million people displaced by an ongoing, still long-term civil \nwar. I say ``ongoing still,'' and I say that with the qualification \nthat because of Senator Danforth's commitment, his noble service, we \nare much\n\n[[Page S7356]]\n\nfurther along that road to having a long, established peace as we look \nto the future.\n  It has not been an easy mission. Senator Danforth, in spite of it not \nbeing an easy mission, has made huge progress. We are much closer to \nending that terrible conflict of the civil war that has been ongoing \nnow for over two decades than we were before Senator Danforth became \ninvolved.\n  On June 11, the United Nations Security Council endorsed the peace \nprocess and committed to taking those steps outlined to assist the \nparties in implementing a final comprehensive peace package once the \nagreement itself is reached, and that is real progress.\n  During my trips to Sudan, I had the opportunity to not go as a U.S. \nSenator--in fact, I have never been in the country as an official U.S. \nSenator--but as part of a medical mission group where I have had the \nopportunity to interact with the Sudanese people from many different \ntribes in the south of Sudan.\n  I have had the opportunity and the blessing--blessing for me because \nof the understanding it gives me--to have treated patients with war \ninjuries. In fact, even in late August, early September of this year, I \ntreated a patient who suffered a gunshot wound to the upper part of his \nleg. I treated that injury. And the time before that, I treated a \npatient who stepped on a landmine. There are still landmines throughout \nsouthern Sudan. We are making real progress on that issue.\n  But today, as the Sudan works toward a settlement, with the progress \nthat has been made, we face a growing humanitarian emergency that was \nnot thought about a year ago at all, and even today we are struggling \nto put the spotlight on and the purpose on--and it is not entirely a \nseparate issue, but it is a separate issue from the traditional thought \nabout civil war: north versus south, black versus white, or Muslim \nversus Christian, all the ways people have thought about a civil war in \nthe past. This crisis is a relatively new one. It is the direct result \nof the actions taken by the government in Khartoum and their proxies, \nthe government-supported militias against the Fur, Zaghawa, and the \nMasaalit peoples of Darfur. Members of this body have spoken to this \nissue over the last several days. We need to speak a lot more about \nthis crisis.\n\n  Government-sponsored militias systematically attack African Muslim \nvillages but leave Arab Muslim villages untouched. Government planes--\nand these planes are Antinov planes. I do not know how many there are, \nbut they are government-sponsored, government-owned planes that \nhistorically have bombed indiscriminately in the south. In fact, they \nhave bombed the very church and hospital in southern Sudan where I go \neach year.\n  These same planes seem to be bombing indiscriminately in this Darfur \nregion, and these are government-owned planes. Crops are burned and \nwells are being poisoned, irrigation systems destroyed, houses are \nburned, and then the earth is left scorched and barren, and the \npopulation is being decimated.\n  There is an estimated population of about 6.5 million people in \nSudan, and as many as 2.2 million people have been directly affected by \nthis crisis. More than 1 million people have become displaced.\n  That is such a dry word. What does ``displaced'' mean? It means they \nhad a home, and they had to leave that home and struggle to make their \nway in other regions, not having their occupation, their job, their \nland they tilled before. This is 1 million people.\n  Mr. President, 158,000 people have fled to neighboring Chad, and more \nthan 30,000 have lost their lives.\n  The World Health Organization recently reported an alarming \nreemergence of polio in Darfur, a disease that has not been seen in \nyears. Should polio get a foothold there this autumn, the polio high \nseason will see thousands of children who could be struck, and that \nmeans struck with paralysis or even worse.\n  At this point in time, we need to make sure--and it is our \nresponsibility--that Khartoum understands there cannot be peace in the \nsouth at the same time they have an ongoing war--many people have used \nthe word ``genocide''--in the west, which is where the Darfur region \nis. War anywhere in Sudan will lead to war everywhere.\n  Khartoum agreed to a cease-fire on April 11. The cease-fire was \nrenewed on May 22. This agreement committed Khartoum to disbanding the \nJingaweit militias.\n  The agreement included a protocol binding Khartoum to allow \nhumanitarian access. Jingaweit militias continue to ravage the \ncountryside while aid workers are turned away. Until we get aid workers \nin to deliver aid, to shine the spotlight, to report back on the \ntravesty, I see no end to this problem, and that is where the \ninternational community must step up.\n  Khartoum claims to have lifted travel restrictions but, at the same \ntime, Khartoum still places obstacles to the delivery of aid. That aid, \nI am convinced, will flow if those channels are opened.\n  Khartoum places difficulties on obtaining visas for relief personnel. \nKhartoum restricts the movement of relief workers within Darfur. \nKhartoum places obstacles to clearing relief supplies through customs. \nKhartoum interferes with relief workers seeking to protect civilians \nfrom harm.\n  Khartoum's actions simply cannot be tolerated. Khartoum's actions \nwill not be tolerated. The United States must respond. The world \ncommunity must respond. We should continue to pressure Khartoum to see \nthat the government will find itself increasingly isolated in the world \ncommunity if it continues to block the delivery of aid and relief, and \nthat is food and health care supplies.\n  This administration has been working tirelessly over the last year to \ndeliver aid to those in dire need in Darfur. Two more relief flights \nlanded in Nyala last Saturday and Sunday, and a third flight was \nscheduled to land yesterday.\n  Since February of last year, USAID has done other things. It has \ndispatched plastic sheeting to build shelters for more than 160,000 \npeople. It has provided 117,000 blankets, 2 water purification systems. \nThe administration has provided 87,000 metric tons of food. The \nadministration has devoted considerable resources and committed a great \ndeal of political capital to assisting the southern Sudanese.\n  President Bush has played an active role in the peace process. We \nhave engaged the United Nations and will continue to do so, to pressure \nKhartoum into ending its support for the militias in Darfur, to assist \nin the delivery of aid, and to rally the international community to \ncome to Sudan's assistance. It is our responsibility. We must do it.\n  In closing, I do commend Senator Danforth for all of his work to help \nthe people of Sudan. It has been tireless. It has been bold. He has \ndone a superb job in the Senate and in all of his years of public \nservice, especially in Sudan. I am delighted he has accepted and that \nwe have approved his position at the United Nations. He is a great \nfriend to us in the Senate and a great friend to the United States of \nAmerica.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/24/senate-section/article/S7356-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7356-S7357]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am happy that the two leaders are in \nthe Chamber because I wish to make an announcement to the Senate.\n  Previously, I had stated I did not think it would be possible for me \nto make the commitment that when the Defense appropriations bill goes \nto conference this year it would not come back with the provisions in \nthe House-passed bill pertaining to the debt ceiling. I have had a \nseries of conversations through the evening last night and this morning \nand I now believe I can commit that when we come back from this \nconference we will not bring back a bill that contains the provisions \nthat were in the House-passed bill pertaining to the debt ceiling \nissues that we must face sometime this year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I compliment the distinguished chairman \nof\n\n[[Page S7357]]\n\nthe Appropriations Committee for his statement and for the assurances \nthat he is now prepared to give the Senate. He more than anyone--and I \nwant to acknowledge as well our ranking member of the Appropriations \nCommittee and the subcommittee for their extraordinary efforts to move \nthis appropriations process along. They, more than anybody, understand \nhow critical it is that we move these appropriations bills forward. The \ndebt limit would have been extremely counterproductive and would have \nprevented us from completing our work.\n  With the assurances given by the manager and our chairman, I am \nprepared to commit to him that we will do all we can to finish our work \non this bill today. I believe we can finish it today. I would \nanticipate some amendments, but there is no reason why, given what he \nhas just committed in terms of the conference, that we cannot finish \nthis today and look forward to other bills as soon as we come back \nafter the Fourth of July recess.\n  I thank him for that commitment and pledge my support and partnership \nin working with him and our ranking member today to complete our work \non time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, does the Senator from West Virginia wish \nto be recognized? I will be happy to yield to him.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. I thank the distinguished chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. First of all, he is my friend and nothing as far as I am \nconcerned will ever mar that friendship, but I have to say that my \nblood boiled last Monday evening when I learned that the House \nRepublican leadership, with the support of Senate Republican leaders, I \nbelieve, had decided to put a placeholder amendment into the Defense \nappropriations bill that could be used in conference to increase the \n$7.4 trillion statutory debt limit perhaps to a level of $8.1 trillion, \nthe level needed for 2005. That placeholder language meant that the \nHouse and the Senate conferees would be free to slip in language to \nincrease the statutory debt limit by an untold amount, maybe $690 \nbillion, maybe more, without either body of Congress ever having to \nvote in public on the matter.\n  This is a tough vote. I can understand how the Republican leadership \nin the House, the Senate, and downtown, the White House, would like to \nsee that limit slipped into this bill in conference.\n  Again, the chairman of this committee has steadfastly shown great \nknowledge and great determination in his efforts to bring forth to the \nSenate for its consideration all 13 appropriations bills. That has been \ntough for him. I thank him for his commitment with respect to the \nDefense appropriations bill and the conference report which will be \ncoming along. I thank him for that. He is a legislator in the true \nsense of the word.\n  Also, in 2002, when I was chairman of the Appropriations Committee, \nthe House Republican leaders tried this same trick on the fiscal year \n2002 supplemental appropriations bill. I refused. I steadfastly refused \nto include such language in the conference report. Instead, the Senate \ntook up, debated, and passed a freestanding bill to increase the debt \nlimit. The House then voted to approve the measure with a one-vote \nmargin. That is the responsible way to increase the debt limit. We owe \nthis to the American public. We should not cloak the debt increase in \nthe camouflage uniform of a Defense appropriations bill.\n  So I thank Senator Frist and Senator Stevens for making a commitment \ntoday that the Defense appropriations conference report will not \ninclude an increase in the statutory debt limit. The Senate should vote \non this issue on a freestanding bill.\n  I would like to ask the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee--I had hoped the leader would be here so I could ask him--is \nhe making a commitment and is the leader making a commitment that when \nthe Senate considers the debt limit increase it will be on a \nfreestanding bill and that it will not come to the Senate on any other \nappropriations conference report or in any other unrelated conference \nreport? Can the committee chairman make that commitment?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, who has the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). The Senator \nfrom West Virginia has the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I will be back to answer that when I get the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I will respond to my friend from West \nVirginia by saying the so-called Gephardt rule is not within the \ncontrol of this Senator, nor the leaders. If the House chooses to take \nup the Gephardt rule and use it as it was used several times before, \nincluding, I believe, by Senator Mitchell when he was the leader, then \nthat will be an issue that others will have to pursue. I am not in a \nposition to make that commitment, and I do not think the leader is in a \nposition to make that commitment.\n  I do want to proceed with the bill and I would hope my friend would \naccept that as being the position we are in now. I am in the position \nto make the commitment I have made with regard to this bill. I hope we \ncan proceed on this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/24/senate-section/article/S7357-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7357-S7359]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2005\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I now ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nthe consideration of Calendar No. 594, H.R. 4613, the Defense \nAppropriations Committee bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). Is there \nobjection?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I shall \nnot unduly delay the distinguished chairman, let me also thank our \nranking member of that subcommittee, Mr. Inouye. I thank again Senator \nStevens. He has been a great chairman of that committee, and he has \nalways been fair with me. So once this bill is brought up before the \nSenate--and it will be up before the Senate very soon, within the next \nfew minutes--I shall do everything I can to help to get action on this \nbill today.\n  But let me say to the Senate and to the Senate leaders and to the \nRepublican leaders in the House, this matter of extending and \nincreasing the debt limit is a matter which should be brought before \nthe American people. It should be debated; it should be voted upon. I \nshall do my best to see to it, if it is on any appropriations bill or \nany other bill, that we get a freestanding vote, and we are going to \ntry to debate this issue. The American people are entitled to hear the \ndebate on this bill.\n  When I came to the Congress almost 52 years ago, they did not sneak \nthe debt limit into an appropriations bill as the attempt might have \nbeen made here but for the good judgment of Senator Stevens and Senator \nFrist. They didn't sneak it into the bill. The Republicans controlled \nthe House when I first came to the House of Representatives. They \ndidn't do a thing like that. They laid everything on the table and they \ndebated it. I hope we will get back to that point of debating the debt \nlimit so the House Republicans will not be let off the hook. They have \na responsibility to the American people to lay it on the table and to \ndebate it.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from Alaska, the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, for yielding to me. I do not object. I remove \nmy reservation.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator and renew my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4613) making appropriations for the Department \n     of Defense for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2005, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent all after the enacting clause be \nstricken, the text of Calendar No. 593, S. 2559, the Senate committee-\nreported bill, be inserted in the Record in lieu thereof, and that \nbill, as amended, be considered as original text for the purpose of \nfurther amendment, provided no points of order be waived by reason of \nthis agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I just filed this report. It is the \nreport that\n\n[[Page S7358]]\n\npreviously was intended to accompany the Senate bill. I ask it now be \nlabeled as accompanying the House bill as amended by the previous \nmotion.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I do not \nobject, but I say this so the Republican leadership in the House, in \nparticular, understands that sneaking the debt limit in an \nappropriations bill is not going to get by.\n  I thank the Senator. I no longer reserve.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, through the Chair to the distinguished \nchairman of the committee, we have come so far in the last 12 hours. It \nwould not have happened but for the Senator from Alaska and his \nadvocacy, which is unparalleled. His advocacy is in a category all its \nown. The working relationship that the Senator has with Senator Inouye, \nof course, is legend. We look forward to doing what the Democratic \nleader said and finish this bill today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am pleased to present this report and \nthis bill to the Senate today. It reflects the bipartisan approach that \nmy cochairman, Senator Inouye, and I have always maintained regarding \nthe Department of Defense. It is a pleasure to work with him and other \nmembers of the committee. I thank our distinguished ranking member and \nformer chairman, the Senator from West Virginia, for his cooperation in \nhelping us to get to the point we are now.\n  This bill was reported out of our full Appropriations Committee on \nJune 22 by a unanimous vote of 29 members. No member voted against it. \nAs we debate this bill today there are thousands of men and women in \nuniform deployed and serving our country in over 120 countries and \nthroughout these United States. Their bravery and dedication to our \ncountry is extraordinary. Their sacrifices must not go unrecognized. \nThey must be recognized here today.\n  Each year, the Department of Defense faces the critical challenge of \nbalancing the cost of maintaining high levels of readiness, being ready \nto respond to the call wherever and whenever it is necessary to defend \nthe interests of this country. The costs associated with simultaneously \nand adequately investing in transforming our Department of Defense to \nbe ready to meet the threats of tomorrow are also concomitant with this \ncritical challenge of balancing the costs of maintaining high levels of \nreadiness.\n  I believe the bill Senator Inouye and I present today reflects a \nprudent balance among these challenges. It recommends $416.2 billion in \nbudget authority for the Department of Defense, including $25 billion \nof contingent emergency funding for costs associated with operations in \nIraq, Afghanistan, and the war on terror. This amount is $1.7 billion \nbelow the President's amended fiscal year 2005 request but, in our \njudgment, meets the Defense Subcommittee's allocation for both budget \nauthority and outlays.\n\n  The measure we present is consistent with both the objectives of the \nadministration and the Senate National Defense authorization bill for \n2005, which we passed last evening.\n  We sought to recommend a balanced approach, and we do recommend a \nbalanced bill to the Senate. We believe it addresses the key \nrequirements for readiness, quality of life, and transformation of our \ntotal force. It honors the commitment we have to our Armed Forces. It \nhelps ensure that they will continue to have first-rate training, \nmodernized equipment and quality infrastructure, and maintain their \nquality of life. It fully funds key readiness programs critical to the \nglobal war on terrorism. It makes continued progress in supporting our \nmilitary personnel and their families.\n  Key initiatives included in this bill are these: First, an average \nmilitary pay increase of 3.5 percent and full funding for benefit and \nmedical programs; additional funding to pay for the increase of 20,000 \nto our Army end strength and TRICARE for Guard and Reserves. Both of \nthese initiatives were included in the Senate version of the 2005 \nDefense authorization bill, and this bill funds both programs: For the \nArmy, $3 billion for their ongoing transformation initiative, the \nfuture combat system, and the Stryker Brigade combat teams; for the \nNavy, $10.2 billion for shipbuilding, providing additional funding for \nthe DD(X) destroyer and the Marine Corps' amphibious assault ship, \nLHA(R); for the Air Force, full funding for the acquisition of 14 C-17 \naircraft and 24 F-22 Raptor aircraft; $10.2 billion is included for \nmissile defense programs.\n  In light of the contributions of the Guard and Reserve, this bill \nadds $500 million in nondesignated equipment funding for modernization \nshortfall.\n  Again, I thank my cochairman Senator Inouye for support, and for the \nsupport of the whole committee and the invaluable counsel we have \nreceived on this bill.\n  I yield for any statements he may wish to make.\n  I point out the contingent reserve in this bill funds a 5-month \nperiod. We fully anticipate there will be a supplemental again next \nyear. We are talking about the last quarter of this calendar year which \nis the first quarter of fiscal year 2005 and an additional month beyond \nthat after we are back in session and ready to receive the supplemental \nfor that, if necessary.\n  Mr. President, we have a conflict because of Senator Inouye's noon \nevent, which I wish to also attend. It is my hope we will be back on \nthe floor and start considering amendments at 2 p.m. today.\n  Does the Senator wish to comment?\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I fully support the measure before us. I \nwould like to say how proud I am to serve with my colleague from \nAlaska.\n  Once again, he has demonstrated to all of us his extraordinary \nlegislative skill in pressing his case. I can assure my colleagues in \nthe Senate, as I assure my chairman, that I will do my very best to see \nthat his decision is carried out.\n   This bill provides $383.8 billion in new discretionary budget \nauthority, consistent with the subcommittee's target, and another $25 \nbillion in emergency budget authority to cover a portion of the \nanticipated costs for the on-going wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n   The bill provides the necessary funds to support our men and women \nin uniform and their families--to include our Guard and Reserves. It \nrecommends funding for a 3.5 percent pay raise for all service members \nand a 20,000 increase in army end strength as authorized by the Senate.\n   The bill supports the critical modernization programs requested by \nthe Defense Department including the Navy's DDX Destroyer, the Army's \nStryker vehicles and the Air Force's F-22 fighter. It scales back those \nprograms that DoD is trying to advance before the technology is mature \nand those that are experiencing delays or technical problems.\n   The bill increases spending on research and development by nearly $1 \nbillion with significant growth in medical programs, particularly those \nthat directly impact warfighters in the current conflict. These include \nincreased spending on amputee care, new technology bandages, and \nleishmaniasis.\n   Health care programs are fully funded in this measure. In addition, \nthe committee recommends increases for Walter Reed, Madigan, Tripler, \nand other military hospitals and research facilities.\n   The Committee has made a significant effort to see that this bill is \nconsistent with the decisions which have been made by the Senate on the \nDefense authorization bill. Many of my colleagues' amendments that have \nbeen adopted on the floor receive funding in this bill, such as the end \nstrength increase which I already addressed. The committee has also \nincluded enhanced Guard and Reserve benefits as authorized and other \nproposals approved by the Senate.\n   This bill provides the support essential for the coming year and \nalso provides $25 billion which DoD will require to cover its costs \nnext fall and winter for its on-going efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nI am pleased to report to the Senate that the committee has very \ncarefully earmarked the funding for Iraq and Afghanistan to direct \nfunding for the priorities of the military departments. We have also \nrestricted the authorities sought by the administration to ensure \nproper congressional oversight of executive actions.\n   In recent years, the executive Branch has often argued that, as \nCommander\n\n[[Page S7359]]\n\nin Chief, the President has almost unlimited powers in the conduct of \nday-to-day defense matters. It is clear that the Constitution provided \nthe Congress the power of the purse. In drafting this measure the \nCommittee has safeguarded its responsibilities and expects that the \nDefense Department will recognize the constitutional authority of the \nCongress to determine how funding will be utilized in executing this \nbudget. We fully expect that the Defense Department will only fund \nactivities that have been approved by the Congress, and in no case will \nfunding be used to support programs which have been rejected by the \nlegislative branch.\n   I am pleased to have worked with my good friend, our Chairman, \nSenator Stevens on crafting this legislation. It is a very good bill \nand I would encourage all my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, does the Senator wish the floor?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will not take the floor if the Senator \nfrom Alaska has more to say. I was going to speak about one of the \nnominations which is coming up this afternoon.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it is my understanding there will be \nother matters considered.\n  I ask unanimous consent that our bill be set aside until the hour of \n2 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nAlaska and the distinguished Senator from Hawaii.\n  I am going to shortly speak for about 20 minutes on one of these \nnominees. First, if I might, I am going to ask that we go into a quorum \ncall. It will be a matter of a minute or two. When we come out of the \nquorum call, I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized to speak \nregarding the nomination of Peter Hall.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/24/senate-section/article/S7359-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7359-S7360]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NOMINATION OF PETER HALL\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we have heated debates, and we have times \nwhen we are happy and times when we are not here in the Senate. Today \nis a happy day. I am pleased that later I will be able to cast my vote \nin favor of Peter Hall for confirmation to the U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the Second Circuit. I know this will be a nomination that will be \nstrongly supported on both sides of the aisle.\n  Mr. Hall is going to fill the Green Mountain State's seat on the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Second Circuit. He currently serves as the \nU.S. Attorney. He was nominated by President Bush. He has strong \nsupport not only of Governor Douglas but the entire Vermont delegation. \nI commend both the Republican and Democratic leadership for working out \nan accommodation that makes it possible to vote on his nomination.\n  By tradition, there is a Vermont seat on the Second Circuit. It is \ncurrently vacant. The reason it is vacant is because of the sudden and \ntragic death of the last judge to hold the seat, the late Fred Parker. \nJudge Parker was appointed to the U.S. District Court for Vermont in \n1990 by the first President Bush. That was done on the strong \nrecommendation of Senator Jeffords and with my support. He was a well-\nknown Republican in Vermont, and he served as the deputy attorney \ngeneral for the State of Vermont.\n  After distinguished service on the District Court bench, he was \nappointed by President Clinton to the Second Circuit with the strong \nsupport of Senator Jeffords. President Clinton knew that Fred Parker \nwas a well-known Republican, but he also knew of his qualifications and \nof the high esteem in which he was held in Vermont, and so he nominated \nJudge Parker to the Second Circuit, and he was confirmed by the Senate.\n  I mention that because over the years Senator Jeffords and I--and \nbefore that Senator Stafford of Vermont and I--have tried to keep \npartisan politics out of the Judiciary. If you look at the quality of \nthe people we recommended, you will see we have actually been quite \nsuccessful in doing that. Fred Parker was such an example. He was a \ngood man, a good lawyer, and a good judge. We were in Georgetown Law \nSchool together. I knew him from that time. He was in the Marine Corps. \nI knew him from then until his untimely death last year. I knew him to \nbe a man of integrity and intelligence. He served the courts and the \npeople of Vermont with dedication and fairness, and we miss him.\n  Peter Hall has big shoes to fill, but both from what everyone knows \nabout him and from what I know personally in having worked with him, he \nis completely up to the job. He did have a couple strikes against him. \nHe had the nerve to be born in one of those Southern States, \nConnecticut. He went all the way even further south to North Carolina \nfor college, and then he attended law school in New York. But we \ndecided to forgive him for those missteps in his career because he came \nto his senses as soon as he graduated from law school, and then he \nmoved to Vermont. He has been there long enough to be considered a \nVermonter.\n  He clerked for the well-respected Judge Albert Coffrin of the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the District of Vermont.\n  We are a small State. When I first started practicing law, it was in \nJudge Coffrin's law firm, before he became a member of the bench. He \nwas a good friend. His widow still lives in Vermont. He was without a \ndoubt one of the most respected and one of the best trial judges we \nhave had.\n  Peter Hall, showing the wisdom he has demonstrated, stayed in Vermont \nfrom that day forth. His career and the exemplary way he served the \nU.S. Government in the law are admirable.\n  After he completed his clerkship with Judge Coffrin, he joined the \nU.S. attorney's office in Vermont. He was a Federal prosecutor the next \n18 years. He rose to the position of first assistant, later being named \nU.S. Attorney. During those years, he has gained invaluable trial \nexperience so beneficial for any judge. He learned about Federal \ncriminal law.\n\n  I was a prosecutor, so of course I always have a soft spot for \nsomeone who served as a prosecutor.\n  His resume is not limited to Government service. In 1986, he began a \n15-year career in the private practice of law, focusing on civil \npractice, with a particular emphasis on mediation, showing a talent for \nthat. He also used his time during that period to serve the bar. He \nprovided ethics training to Vermont State prosecutors. He held the \noffice of president of the Vermont Bar Association, and in that office \nas former prosecutor, advocated for funding for public defenders for \nequal access to justice.\n  In the best sense of those who make the best judges, he found time \nfor pro bono work, getting involved in the Vermont family court system. \nHe served as guardian ad litem for children caught up in disputes \nbetween their parents.\n  In 2001, President Bush nominated Peter Hall to be the U.S. Attorney \nfor Vermont. His record in that office is one all prosecutors should \nhope to have, a tough but a fair prosecutor. I supported Peter's \nnomination to the U.S. Attorney's office. I support him now.\n  Lest there be any question, let us have no misunderstanding about \nPeter's party affiliation: He is a Republican through and through. From \n1986 to 1993 he was variously a member of the town of Chittenden, \nRutland County, and State of Vermont Republican committees and a member \nof the National Republican Party. He has helped run statewide \nRepublican campaigns, and was an elected Republican official for 5 \nyears, holding one of the most important offices a citizen in Vermont \ncan hold, a member of the Select Board of the Town of Chittenden. \nIncidentally, Chittenden is named after the first Governor of Vermont, \nThomas Chittenden. He was recommended to the President by Vermont's \nRepublican Governor. Governor Douglas noted in his letter of support to \nthis nomination, that Peter is ``a dedicated public servant, a strong \nleader and will be an asset to the Second Circuit.''\n  I ask consent the Governor's letter be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S7360]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             State of Vermont,\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                                   March 10, 2004.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman,\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Ranking Democratic Member, U.S. Senate, Committee on the \n         Judiciary, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: I am writing to express my strongest support \n     for U.S. Attorney Peter Hall for appointment to the U.S. \n     Court of Appeals, 2nd Circuit.\n       Peter's record of service of the people of Vermont is \n     exemplary. As U.S. Attorney, he has been a strong and \n     effective leader in Vermont's anti-terrorism effort. Peter \n     has been a principal organizer in promoting ``Operation Safe \n     Commerce,'' an international initiative aimed to track and \n     monitor cargo shipments that could be susceptible to \n     terrorist attacks.\n       In addition, Peter has been an active leader in promoting \n     the President's ``Project Safe Neighborhoods'' initiative \n     designed to make our streets safer by taking guns out of the \n     hands of convicted felons.\n       I unequivocally support Peter for the judgeship. He is a \n     dedicated public servant, a strong leader, and will be an \n     asset to the 2nd Circuit.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 James H. Douglas,\n                                                         Governor.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Equally clear, however, is Peter's commitment to the law, \nto fair judging, to leaving any partisan label or interest at the \ncourthouse door. Unless somebody knew his background, they would have \nno idea whether he is Republican or Democrat. He is a committed officer \nof the court, totally fair to both sides. In fact, he is the type of \nnominee every President should send up. I wish we would see more like \nhim. He is universally respected. He has proven himself over long years \nof Federal service and private practice to be a straight-shooting, \nfairminded person. Any litigant in a Federal courtroom can be confident \nthey will get a fair hearing and a fair shake from him, no matter what \ntheir political affiliation is or whether they have any. I am pleased--\nI am more than pleased, I am proud--to support his confirmation.\n  One example of the fairness and lack of bias litigants in the Second \nCircuit can expect is seen in his answers to one of the questions I \nasked him at his nomination hearing before the Judiciary Committee. I \nasked him what his practice would be if a case came to the Second \nCircuit, a case that had been in the U.S. Attorney's office when he was \nthere, even if he had not been the attorney handling the case. His \nanswer, which I commend to all nominees, is a model of fairness, and \nwas also a model of simplicity. He told me he would recuse himself from \nany case that had been before his office while he was there. No ifs, \nands, or buts. That is one of the reasons why the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, which sometimes can be divided on issues, voted unanimously \nto support his nomination.\n  His qualifications, experience, and support across the political \nspectrum make him the kind of consensus nominee that proves when there \nis thoughtful consideration and collaboration, this process works as it \nshould. That is why I will be pleased to vote to confirm him today.\n  Actually, an interesting sidebar on this, when he is confirmed to the \nSecond Circuit, President George W. Bush will call his father, former \nPresident George Herbert Walker Bush, and say, I beat your record for \njudicial confirmations. During the 4 full years of the 41st President's \nadministration, former President Bush managed to have 192 judicial \nnominees confirmed by the Senate. With today's vote, the Senate will \nhave confirmed, even before the year is over, 193 of President George \nW. Bush's judicial nominations. That allows him to say he has had more \njudges confirmed with bipartisan cooperation by the Senate than \nPresident Reagan did in his first term of office, or his father did, or \nPresident Clinton in his last term of office.\n  I mention these statistics being of interest.\n  I am one lifelong Vermonter who is very proud of another Vermonter, \nPeter Hall. This is one of those things in our very special little \nState that will bring everybody together across the political spectrum. \nWe have tried not to tell Peter he does have to spend some time in New \nYork City each month because the Second Circuit sits there, but I think \nhe will be able to work a great deal of his time in Vermont. Like me, \nthat is one of the best of all possible worlds. You can be home on \nweekends.\n  I understand from the leadership we will vote on this and another \njudicial nomination later this afternoon.\n  Although I know the Presiding Officer is hanging on every word I \nmight be saying, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/24/senate-section/article/S7360-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7360-S7366]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF DIANE S. SYKES TO BE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE \n                            SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask that the Senate now proceed in \nexecutive session to consider Executive Calendar Nos. 591 and 604 as \nprovided under the previous order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the nomination.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Diane S. Sykes, of \nWisconsin, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Seventh Circuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 60 minutes evenly divided for debate \non this nomination.\n  Mr. HATCH. I do not intend to take all of our time, and I hope the \nother side will not take all of its time.\n  I rise to support the nomination of Justice Diane S. Sykes to the \nSeventh Circuit Court of Appeals, and to urge my colleagues to support \nher. There is no doubt that she is well prepared to join the Federal \nbench. A graduate of Marquette University School of Law, Justice Sykes \nserved as a law clerk to the Honorable Terrence T. Evans in the Eastern \nDistrict of Wisconsin. As a litigator in private practice, she \nspecialized in civil litigation in State and Federal court.\n  Justice Sykes will bring almost 12 years of judicial experience to \nthe Seventh Circuit. Since 1999, when she was appointed by Governor \nTommy Thompson to fill a mid-term vacancy, she has served on the \nWisconsin Supreme Court. She won election for a ten-year term on the \ncourt in 2000 with 65 percent of the vote. Judge Sykes appealed to so \nmany of her State's voters because she is a careful, qualified jurist \nand not an activist.\n  Before coming to the Wisconsin Supreme Court, Justice Sykes served as \na trial judge on the Milwaukee County Circuit Court, winning election \nto a 6-year term in 1992. Prior to her service as a State judge, \nJustice Sykes practiced commercial litigation for 7 years at one of \nWisconsin's most prestigious law firms. She also clerked for Judge \nEvans, district judge for the Eastern District of Wisconsin after her \ngraduation from Marquette University Law School.\n  Not surprisingly, the ABA rated her well-qualified for appointment to \nthe Seventh Circuit. She has also received broad support, including \nthat of both Wisconsin Senators.\n  Despite her strong credentials and the level of support she enjoys, \nthere continues to be some misinformation and distortions regarding her \nrecord. First, of course, is the suspicion by some that she might be \npro-life and thus presumptively unqualified for service on the Federal \nbench. Opponents cite one 1993 case on which she ruled while she served \nas a county judge in Milwaukee. She was then accused of declaring \nadmiration for pro-life protestors and issuing jury instructions \nfavorable to those protestors.\n  The Milwaukee newspaper that printed these accusations issued a \nformal retraction and apology less than a month later. The apology \nnoted, among other things, that the language of Justice Sykes' jury \ninstruction was specifically recommended for use by the Wisconsin \nCriminal Jury Instructions Committee, and was used by judges throughout \nthe State. The apology further noted that Justice Sykes sentenced the \nprotestors to \\2/3\\ of the maximum sentence permitted by law. The \nrecord is clear that Justice Sykes, during sentencing, stated ``whether \nyou\n\n[[Page S7361]]\n\nlike it or not, [an abortion clinic] is a legal, legitimate business, \nand it has the same right to be free from interference of this sort as \nany other business.''\n  Justice Sykes also clarified, in answers to written questions that \n``my favorable comment about the goal [those] defendants sought to \nachieve was a reference to their underlying goal of reducing the number \nof abortions, as is clear from the following statement from my \nsentencing remarks: `I think that people on both sides of the abortion \nissue would probably agree with you that reducing the number of \nabortions in this country is a desirable goal.' My sentencing remarks \nalso reflect extensive consideration of the seriousness of the offense \nand criticism of the defendants' conduct and tactics. . .  [A]nd the \n60-day jail sentence I imposed, at two-thirds of the maximum, could not \nbe characterized as unduly lenient or a `validation' of the defendants' \nbeliefs.''\n  I hope it is not the argument of those who are concerned about Judge \nSykes that any judge who at any time suggests that fewer abortions is a \ndesirable goal is disqualified from the Federal judiciary.\n  I know also that some Senators are concerned about some of Justice \nSykes' other answers to post-hearing written questions. A careful \nreading of her answers will show that Justice Sykes answered her \nwritten questions as completely and accurately as the Wisconsin Code of \nJudicial Conduct allows. Specifically, Wisconsin Supreme Court Rule \n60.06(3) prohibits sitting judges from engaging in extra-judicial \ncommentary with respect to particular cases or legal issues that would \nappear to commit the judge in advance or suggest a promise or \ncommitment of a certain course of conduct regarding particular cases or \nlegal issues. As her answers point out quite eloquently, ``there is a \nrange of opinion in the legal community regarding the scope of so-\ncalled `commitments' clauses in judicial ethics codes. To the extent \nthat [others] disagree, I must keep my own counsel and abide by my \ninterpretation of the obligations of my oath, the duties of my office, \nand the requirements of the Code, which are binding on me.''\n\n  In those same written questions Justice Sykes was asked whether she \nbelieved that the Supreme Court's decisions in Roe and Griswold \nconstituted ``judicial activism'', whether they were ``unprincipled'' \nand whether they were consistent with ``strict constructionist'' \nphilosophy.\n  Justice Sykes avoided criticizing these cases out of a good faith \nbelief that to do so would violate her ethical obligations under \nWisconsin law. Her answers followed the same path as at least four of \nPresident Clinton's Circuit Court nominees who refused to give their \npersonal views or criticize Supreme Court precedent on various issues, \nprecisely because those issues might come before them as sitting \njudges.\n  Justice Sykes did state as follows: ``I can unequivocally state, \nhowever, that I believe that Roe and Miranda are the law of the land, \nand if I am confirmed to the Seventh Circuit, I would be duty bound to \nfollow and would follow these and all other precedents of the United \nStates Supreme Court.'' She further stated that she believes ``that Roe \nand Griswold constitute binding precedent,'' which she would follow \n``without hesitation'' if confirmed to the Seventh Circuit.\n  Justice Sykes has also been labeled as pro-prosecution and anti-\nMiranda, implying that she would not be a fair judge. Contrary to the \nmisrepresentations of her opponents, she has often ruled in favor of \ncriminal defendants in Fourth Amendment and other cases involving \nquestions of constitutional criminal law, siding against government \nactors many times. Justice Sykes' real record shows that she reaches \noutcomes by applying the law to the facts, as she should.\n  For example, in the State v. Knapp case, Justice Sykes agreed with \nthe majority in a case involving a custodial interrogation that the \nstatements made by a suspect in custody were not in compliance with the \ndictates of Miranda and could not be used by the prosecution against \nhim. In the State v. Church case, she overturned an increased sentence \nof an individual convicted of criminal assault, concluding that the \nincreased sentence was presumptively vindictive, in violation of the \ndefendant's right to due process, and that the presumption was not \novercome by adequate, objective new factors in the record justifying \nthe increase.\n\n  Also, in the State v. Schwarz case Justice Sykes ruled in favor of a \nprobationer in a Fifth Amendment case because his probationary officer \nduring offender treatment compelled him as a condition of probation to \nadmit to the crime of which he was convicted. She specifically held \nthat a probationer cannot be compelled to admit to the crime of \nconviction before the time for a direct appeal has expired or an appeal \nhas been denied because the Fifth Amendment privilege extends to those \nalready convicted, whether in prison or on probation.\n  There is another argument against Justice Sykes which I have heard, \nregarding her dissent in State v. Carlson, which needs to be set \nstraight. She stands accused of improperly finding harmless error in a \ntrial court's seating of a non-English speaking juror in a criminal \ncase. At first blush this does seem like harmful, not harmless, error. \nAgain, a careful reading of her response to this issue illuminates the \ntruth of this matter. She clarified that there was significant evidence \nin the trial court record that the juror in question did understand \nEnglish. He had lived in the country for 20 years and passed a \ncitizenship test. He held a driver's license and a fishing license. He \nwas employed as a factory worker, where presumably he had to comply \nwith various State and Federal safety procedures, and he had previously \ntestified, without an interpreter, at a post-conviction hearing. \nJustice Sykes stated, properly, that ``when there is competing \nevidence, it is the job of the trial court--not the appellate court--to \nevaluate and weigh it, and make findings of fact. . . . Under well-\nestablished rules of appellate review, factual findings of the trial \ncourt are reviewed deferentially, and are not disturbed unless clearly \nerroneous, that is, factually unsupported. . . . The majority in \nCarlson disregarded this deferential standard of review and substituted \nits own view of the facts for that of the trial court; it was this \nfailure to follow the applicable legal standard that I objected to in \nmy dissent.''\n  I thought we all wanted judges who understand their role and not \npursue an activist agenda. I think we should be pleased that a nominee \nto a Federal appellate court properly understands her appellate role. \nIt is quite unfortunate that some would misrepresent Justice Sykes' \nprincipled dissent in this case as evidence of activist tendencies. It \nis precisely the opposite. It demonstrates restraint and respect for \nher role as an appellate judge.\n  Justice Sykes' record represents the antithesis of the activism that \nI have heard all of my colleagues say they do not want to see from \njudges nominated to our Federal courts. The Senate should be in the \nbusiness of approving judges who have demonstrated that they respect \nthe judicial role and will not substitute their own policy preferences \nfor those expressed by the legislature. Judge Sykes' record in this \nregard is impeccable, and I will be pleased to vote with Senators Kohl \nand Feingold to confirm her to the Seventh Circuit. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote with us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to rise today in support \nof the nomination of Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Diane Sykes to the \nFederal judiciary. She has been nominated to fill one of the Wisconsin \nseats on the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals to replace retiring Judge \nJohn Coffey.\n  Justice Sykes brings an impressive background to this important \nposition. She is a lifelong resident of Wisconsin. She was born in \nMilwaukee, attended Marquette University Law school, clerked for \nFederal Judge Terry Evans in Milwaukee, and practiced law for a top \nWisconsin law firm. Justice Sykes left private practice in 1992 to \nserve as a Milwaukee County circuit judge, a position she held until \n1999. She was then appointed to the Wisconsin Supreme Court in 1999, \nand she won reelection to a 10-year term in the year 2000. She is to be \ncommended for her devotion to public service and praised for her \nqualifications for the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  We are not the only ones to recognize her abilities. A bipartisan \nWisconsin\n\n[[Page S7362]]\n\nFederal Nominating Commission, which has been screening judicial \ncandidates for Wisconsin Senators of both parties for 25 years, \nselected Justice Sykes and three others from an impressive list of \napplicants for this position. All four finalists were well qualified \nand all deserved to have their names forwarded to the President for his \nselection. Wisconsin's process should be a model because it finds \nqualified applicants and takes much of the politics out of judicial \nselection.\n  The American Bar Association agrees with our evaluations as well. A \nsubstantial majority of the committee rated her ``well qualified.''\n  It is worth discussing, if only briefly, that some have expressed \nopposition to Justice Sykes' nomination. We will likely hear some of \nthat dissent during that debate today. The primary argument against her \nis she was not totally forthcoming in her answers to questions asked \nduring her hearing. We do not find that argument compelling. Rather, \nshe would not have received the support of our bipartisan nominating \ncommission without answering their questions. Further, she would not \nhave received my endorsement had she not answered in a forthright and \ndirect manner the questions we asked of her during our interview with \nJustice Sykes.\n  Justice Sykes has earned a reputation as a fine lawyer and as a \ndistinguished jurist during her career in Wisconsin. Lawyers throughout \nthe State, regardless of their political persuasion, echo this \nsentiment.\n  We expect Justice Sykes to not only be a credit to Wisconsin, but \nalso to administer fair justice for all who come before her. We look \nforward to her confirmation today, and to her taking a seat on the \nSeventh Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, for 25 years, the bipartisan Wisconsin \nFederal Nominating Commission has been recommending high-quality \ncandidates for Federal judgeships in our State. First created in 1979 \nby Senators William Proxmire and Gaylord Nelson, the Commission is an \nindependent panel selected by Wisconsin elected officials and the State \nBar of Wisconsin to review applications for Federal District Court and \nCourt of Appeals vacancies in Wisconsin, as well as U.S. attorney \nvacancies. The composition of the Commission assures that selections \nfor these important positions will be made based on merit, not \npolitics. Senator Kohl and I have worked hard to maintain and \nstrengthen the Commission throughout our time in the Senate, and I am \nvery proud that it has survived for the past quarter century, under \nPresidents and Wisconsin Senators from both political parties.\n  I am pleased to put the spotlight on the Commission today, on the \noccasion of the floor vote on Justice Diane Sykes, who is the latest \nproduct of this bipartisan process. I am pleased that Justice Sykes' \nnomination has proceeded swiftly, thanks to the collaborative nature of \nthe Commission process. Despite some initial resistance, the Bush \nadministration agreed to have candidates for this Seventh Circuit \nvacancy go through the Commission process. Under the joint leadership \nof Dean Joseph Kearny of the Marquette University Law School and \nProfessor Frank Turkheimer of the University of Wisconsin Law School, \nthe Commission worked extremely hard under a very tight deadline. It \nrecommended four qualified candidates, including Justice Sykes. Senator \nKohl and I, working with Representative Sensenbrenner, the senior \nRepublican officeholder in the State, decided to forward all four names \nto the White House, and the President selected Justice Sykes from the \nfour.\n  I met with Justice Sykes late last summer after the Commission had \nrecommended her along with the other three candidates. I had a chance \nto question her about her background, her qualifications, and her \njudicial philosophy. There are a number of topics on which we do not \nsee eye to eye, but I believe Justice Sykes is well qualified to fill \nthis seat on the Seventh Circuit. In particular, I have great respect \nfor her commitment to public service. Talented young lawyers have many \nmore remunerative options that they can pursue. She has been a judge in \nour State since 1992.\n  I have always maintained that with cooperation and consultation \nbetween the President and home State Senators, the judicial nomination \nprocess can be far less contentious and, frankly, far less frustrating, \nthan it has been over the past several years. Recognizing that \nideological differences are inevitable in this process as control in \nthe Senate and in the White House change hands, it would serve those \nwho choose and confirm Federal judicial nominees well to follow the \nexample of the Wisconsin Federal Nominating Commission.\n  Mr. President, it is my hope that the work of the Wisconsin Federal \nNominating Commission, the nomination of Justice Sykes, and her smooth \nconfirmation will send a signal to the White House, to my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle, and to the country, that we can, in fact, work \ntogether in a bipartisan way to fill judicial vacancies. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this nomination.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today we are turning to the nomination of \nJustice Diane Sykes to a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nSeventh Circuit. She has been nominated to a seat which is actually not \neven vacant yet. Justice Sykes is nominated to replace Judge John \nCoffey, who has not yet retired. Her confirmation vote today shows how \nfast the administration is moving to pack the courts, including future \nvacancies, with its ideological nominees.\n  Justice Sykes comes before us with the support of my colleagues, \nSenator Kohl and Senator Feingold--two Senators whose opinions I value \nvery much. She also comes before us with a 12-year judicial record--\nboth at the trial court level and with the Supreme Court of her home \nState of Wisconsin. I have looked closely at her record and although I \ngreatly value the opinion of my colleagues from the State of Wisconsin, \nI have made my own judgment regarding her fitness for this important \nlifetime appointment.\n  After reviewing Justice Sykes' written record, I was disturbed by the \nclear patterns that emerged. I worry that, if confirmed, Justice Sykes \nwill continue to be an activist judge for a lifetime on the Federal \nbench. For this reason I voted against her nomination in committee and \nwill oppose her confirmation today.\n  I share Justice Sykes' own concerns, which she described to the \nFederalist Society last year in a speech she delivered about the \n``politicization of the judiciary.'' As Members of the Senate we must \nensure that we confirm nominees who will be impartial arbiters of \njustice. With today's vote we have confirmed 192 of this President's \njudicial nominations. These nominees have been from a variety of \nbackgrounds. A significant percentage of them had been very active in \nthe Republican Party and in ideological groups such as the Federalist \nSociety. I voted to confirm nominees when I am confident that as judges \nthey would be able to shed their historical advocacy and act \nimpartially once they take their oath of office.\n  Unfortunately, Justice Sykes' record on the State court bench \ndemonstrates that she has had difficulty separating her personal views \nfrom her judicial decisions. In civil cases, she consistently rules \nagainst workers and injured plaintiffs in favor of big business. In \ncriminal cases, she routinely rules against the rights of criminal \ndefendants in favor of broad rights for the Government.\n  Justice Sykes has repeatedly taken a very narrow approach to \ninterpreting the fourth amendment, upholding broad exceptions to allow \nwarrantless police searches. She continuously questions Miranda--a \nbedrock precedent of constitutional law. For example, Justice Sykes was \nthe lone dissenter from the Wisconsin Supreme Court's decision to \nexclude evidence gained as the result of an interrogation that clearly \nviolated a defendant's Miranda rights. Her rulings have jeopardized \nother constitutional rights of criminal defendants, as well. In one \ncase, in a decision that was later reversed, Judge Sykes ruled that a \nlawyer's advice to a defendant to lie on the witness stand was not \nsufficient to conclude that the defendant was deprived of his right to \neffective counsel. Justice Sykes was also the lone dissenter on the \nWisconsin Supreme Court arguing that a defendant had no right to a new \ntrial when one of the jurors did not speak or understand English. \nJustice Sykes' pattern of\n\n[[Page S7363]]\n\ngoing to great lengths to reduce the protections for criminal \ndefendants enshrined in our Constitution is greatly disturbing.\n  In addition to what I was able to learn from her judicial record, I \nwas equally disappointed by her testimony before the Judiciary \nCommittee. Our distinguished colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin, \nsubmitted thoughtful questions to Justice Sykes following her hearing. \nShe refused to answer many of his questions, including whether she \nbelieved that Roe and Griswold were ``unprincipled decisions'' or were \n``consistent with strict constructionism,'' whether the existence of \nthe right to privacy was a ``feat of judicial activism,'' and whether \nthe Warren court went too far in creating individual rights. Her reason \nfor not answering those questions was that she was precluded by \nWisconsin's code of judicial conduct. However, that code only prohibits \na judge from commenting on ``particular cases or legal issues that \nwould appear to commit the judge in advance or suggest a promise or \ncommitment of a certain course of conduct in office regarding \nparticular cases or legal issues.'' Her blanket refusals to respond to \nquestions by members of the Judiciary Committee are unacceptable.\n  I am seriously concerned about the type of Federal judge Justice \nSykes would be if confirmed and I vote against her nomination to the \nSeventh Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. We are prepared to yield the remainder of our time and I \nbelieve the remainder of the time for the other side of the aisle, \nexcept for 20 minutes which should be reserved for Senator Durbin on \nboth nominees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in a short period of time, we are going to \nconsider the nomination of Diane S. Sykes to be U.S. Circuit Judge for \nthe Seventh Circuit.\n  I take this opportunity on the floor of the Senate to express \nspecifically why I will vote against this nomination.\n  This is my home circuit, the Seventh Circuit, which includes \nIllinois, Wisconsin, and Indiana, so I believe I have a special \nresponsibility to bring extra scrutiny to this nomination. I \nacknowledge that Judge Sykes has the support of her home State \nSenators, and I do not take that support lightly. Senators Feingold and \nKohl have worked hard to establish a bipartisan nominating commission \nin Wisconsin, both for district and circuit court nominations, and I \nknow they have a special obligation to support the nominee who is the \nproduct of that process.\n  I was initially inclined to defer to my Wisconsin colleagues and \nsupport the nomination, but after taking a close look at Justice Sykes' \nbackground and many of her answers to my questions, I now regret to say \nI have serious doubts about her fitness for a lifetime appointment to \nthe bench.\n  Let me be specific. First, let me address Justice Sykes track record \nregarding the criminally accused. As a member of the Wisconsin Supreme \nCourt, Justice Sykes has not always treated criminal defendants fairly. \nWe expect those who are guilty of crimes to be treated fairly and \nfirmly. We understand the presumption of innocence and we understand \nthat those who have committed terrible crimes must pay a price.\n  Listen to what Justice Sykes has said about her own judicial \ntemperament. When she ran for reelection to the supreme court in \nWisconsin in the year 2000, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel said the \nfollowing about Justice Sykes:\n\n       In her five years on the felony bench, Sykes developed a \n     reputation as one of the heaviest sentencing judges in \n     Milwaukee County in recent memory.\n\n  Then the Wisconsin State Journal, Justice Sykes admitted:\n\n       I have a reputation as a hanging judge, that's true.\n\n  I ask my colleagues, do these statements sound like the judicious \nstatements of a person seeking a lifetime appointment to a position \nwhere she will be asked repeatedly by those who are presumed innocent \nto be treated fairly?\n  During her 2000 campaign for the Wisconsin Supreme Court, Justice \nSykes ran radio ads stating that she was such a tough sentencer that \ndefense lawyers tried to avoid her court. She also told a reporter that \nin light of her tough sentences, a wing of the Wisconsin maximum \nsecurity prison was informally named after her.\n  Do these sound like temperate statements by a person who will be \nasked to honor the presumption of innocence and treat all persons in \nher court fairly?\n  Let me mention a specific case which troubles me greatly in which \nJustice Sykes anticriminal defendant bias reared its ugly head. In the \ncase of State v. Carlson, the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled 6 to 1 to \noverturn a conviction and permit a new trial--not to exonerate a \ndefendant but to permanent a new trial--because one of the jurors in \nthis criminal case did not speak or understand English. Justice Sykes \nwas the lone dissenting vote. The juror in this case, whose native \nlanguage was Lao, received a questionnaire which asked if he could \nunderstand the English language well enough to serve on the jury. The \njuror checked the box ``no.'' He did not understand English well enough \nto serve on a jury. Under Wisconsin law, the clerk was required at that \npoint to strike the juror from the jury pool. The trial judge, \nnevertheless, allowed that juror who did not understand the English \nlanguage to remain on the jury and the defendant was convicted.\n  Justice Sykes, seeking a lifetime appointment to the second highest \nFederal court in the land, was the only member of the Wisconsin Supreme \nCourt to vote to uphold the conviction, and concluded this was a \nharmless error, that a juror could sit in judgment in a criminal trial \nincapable of understanding the language being spoken in the courtroom. \nShe was the only Wisconsin Supreme Court justice to conclude that such \na juror was no obstacle to justice.\n  Would any one of us in the Senate or any of us following this debate \nwant our fate decided by a juror who could not even understand the \nwords spoken in our defense?\n  In another case in which she was the trial judge, State v. Fritz, \nJudge Sykes denied the defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel \nclaim when the defendant's own attorney advised him to lie on the \nwitness stand. Judge Sykes was unanimously reversed. The court of \nappeals wrote the overwhelming weight of authority is to the contrary; \nindeed, the sixth amendment of the Constitution is one such authority.\n  Let me speak to another concern about Justice Sykes. I have great \nconcern about her candor. I believe she made misleading statements to \nthe Senate about a 1993 case in which she was the trial court judge. \nThe case involved the prosecution of two abortion clinic protesters who \nshut down a Milwaukee clinic by welding their legs to the front of a \ncar parked at the clinic entrance. It took blowtorches and firefighters \nto remove them.\n  These defendants had a long history of anti-abortion activity. One \nhad been arrested 80 times in abortion protests; another, 20 times. The \ndefendants had injunctions against them for their protests. As the \nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel reported just this week, they had companion \ncases in front of Judge Sykes for other anti-abortion crimes they had \ncommitted. One of the defendants had appeared before her six times in \none of those cases. They were leaders, well known in Milwaukee's anti-\nabortion community, at a time when that city was one of the Nation's \nhubs for that activity.\n  In a statement submitted to Judge Sykes just days before the \nsentencing, one of the defendants equated abortion with the Holocaust \nand slavery. He called abortion clinics ``death camps.'' He called \ndoctors ``hired killers.'' At the sentencing hearing, Judge Sykes \npraised these defendants. She told them:\n\n       I do respect you a great deal for having the courage of \n     your convictions and for the ultimate goals that you sought \n     to achieve by this conduct.\n\n\n[[Page S7364]]\n\n\n  She also said:\n\n       As far as your character and history and background, \n     obviously, you possess fine characters. I agree with \n     everything that's been said on that basis. It's a unique case \n     in that respect, that you have otherwise been exemplary \n     citizens. Your motivations were pure.\n\n  I asked Justice Sykes in writing why she heaped this praise on the \ndefendants, given the fact they had been arrested 100 times for anti-\nabortion protests. She responded that she was unaware of their arrest \nrecords and that, in any event, there was no evidence in the record of \na history of arrests in connection with their protest activity.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of my \nwritten questions to Justice Sykes and her written answers.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n       9. You were the trial judge in a 1993 case involving two \n     anti-abortion activists, Michael Scott and Jack Lightner, who \n     were convicted of blocking a door to a Milwaukee abortion \n     clinic. The protesters blocked the doorway by binding their \n     legs with welded pipes to the front of a car; they were \n     removed by firefighters with blowtorches. You sentenced the \n     protesters to 60 days in prison with work-release privileges \n     but not before praising their motives. You told the \n     defendants: ``I do respect you a great deal for having the \n     courage of your convictions and for the ultimate goals that \n     you sought to achieve by this conduct.'' You also stated: \n     ``As far as your character and history and background, \n     obviously you possess fine characters'' and are ``exemplary \n     citizens.'' And you told the defendants, ``Your motivations \n     were pure.''\n       A. There are 3 factors that you considered in sentencing: \n     (1) the nature of the offense, (2) the character, history, \n     and background of the defendants, and (3) the interests of \n     the community. With respect to the second factor, you stated \n     that the defendants had ``fine characters'' and were \n     ``exemplary citizens.'' According to press reports, one of \n     the defendants in this case had been arrested 80 times in \n     abortion protests, and the other had been arrested 20 times. \n     Why did you believe that they possessed ``fine characters'' \n     and were ``exemplary citizens''?\n       Answer: It is axiomatic under Wisconsin law that defendants \n     have a right to be sentenced upon facts that are of record. \n     McCleary v. State, 49 Wis. 2d 263, 277, 182 N.W.2d 512 \n     (1971). The press reports referenced in your question, and \n     the arrests which the question attributes to the press \n     reports, were not facts of record in the case; I was, to the \n     best of my recollection, unaware of these reports. Even if I \n     had been aware of the press reports, it would have been \n     legally improper for me to consider them as they were outside \n     the record in the case.\n       The case in question was a 1993 misdemeanor disorderly \n     conduct prosecution of two individuals arising out of an \n     abortion clinic protest. Most disorderly conduct prosecutions \n     in Milwaukee County involve acts of domestic violence, bar \n     fights, and the like, and defendants in misdemeanor court are \n     often recidivists with recent criminal records for offenses \n     such as battery, theft, prostitution, drunk driving, and so \n     forth. At sentencing in this case, the prosecutor took the \n     unusual step of standing silent, choosing not to make a \n     sentence recommendation. The defense attorneys and the \n     defendants urged a sentence of community service.\n       Judges are required under Wisconsin sentencing law to take \n     into account mitigating and aggravating factors regarding the \n     gravity of the offense, the character and background of the \n     offender, and the interests of the community. McCleary, 49 \n     Wis. 2d at 276. At the sentencing in this case, the facts of \n     record about the defendants' backgrounds demonstrated that \n     they were atypical misdemeanor defendants: they were \n     generally law-abiding, educated, employed individuals with \n     stable families, no drug or alcohol problems, and no \n     rehabilitative needs. Although one defendant had a couple of \n     extremely old, minor convictions from the mid-1970s and a \n     more recent disorderly conduct fine, this conduct was so \n     remote and/or inconsequential as to not be relevant to that \n     defendant's current status before the court. While both \n     defendants admitted to active, continued involvement in anti-\n     abortion protests, this was the first criminal conviction of \n     this type for both defendants, and there was no evidence in \n     the record of a history of arrests in connection with their \n     protest activity. As I noted in my sentencing remarks, the \n     offense was not committed out of any sort of self-interest, \n     the defendants were not violent, assaultive or threatening, \n     and they did not resist arrest in the case. Accordingly, none \n     of the usual criminal motivations or sentence aggravating \n     factors was present.\n       As a result, both defendants stood before the court, based \n     upon the facts of record, as exemplary citizens with fine \n     characters, which I was required to note as a mitigating \n     factor separate and apart from the seriously disruptive and \n     disorderly conduct they engaged in at the abortion clinic. I \n     took substantial note of the seriousness of the offense \n     during my sentencing remarks, including the following: ``the \n     community has a right to expect that the public order and \n     that legitimate businesses will not be disrupted and \n     interfered with in a way that rises to criminal dimensions, \n     and this would be true even where the people who are engaging \n     in this kind of conduct are exercising their free speech \n     rights and free assembly rights and are in pursuit of goals \n     that are not in and of themselves illegal.'' And further: \n     ``The community obviously . . . has a strong interest in \n     deterring this type of conduct both by you and by others.'' \n     And further: ``What especially concerns me about this case is \n     . . . your willingness and expressed intention to go beyond \n     mere peaceful picketing to clinic blockades and other types \n     of more dramatic methods to stop abortions from taking place, \n     and these methods over time have the potential to cause the \n     community even more serious harm, and to the extent that it \n     can, my sentence has to protect the community at least for an \n     interim period from these kind of tactics.''\n       The options for sentencing in the case included community \n     service, a fine, probation--or up to 90 days in jail. Based \n     upon a balance of the mitigating and aggravating factors, I \n     sentenced the defendants to 60 days in jail, which \n     represented two-thirds of the potential maximum jail sentence \n     for this crime.\n       B. Please explain what you mean when you told the \n     defendants that you had a great deal of respect for ``the \n     ultimate goals you sought to achieve by this conduct.''\n       Answer: The evidence in the case established that the goal \n     the defendants sought to achieve by their protest was \n     reduction of the number of abortions in our community. As I \n     noted in my sentencing remarks: ``I think that people on both \n     sides of the abortion issue would probably agree with you \n     that reducing the number of abortions in this country is a \n     desirable goal.'' It was that ultimate goal that I respected.\n       C. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel wrote that you gave the \n     defendants in this case ``unusual leeway to argue that the \n     social value of their protest outweighed their violation of \n     the law.'' However, during your campaign for the Wisconsin \n     Supreme Court, you stated that you were ``a firm believer in \n     personal responsibility and individual accountability, and \n     I'm well known that that.'' Why, in the case involving \n     abortion protestors, did you give ``unusual leeway'' to the \n     defendants?\n       Answer: There was nothing ``unusual'' about my handling of \n     the case, as later admitted by The Milwaukee Journal. The \n     newspaper properly corrected the record in a retraction dated \n     April 8, 1993, in which the editors noted that applicable law \n     and a well-accepted jury instruction allowed the jury to take \n     into consideration any social value or contribution to the \n     public interest of the defendants' conduct in determining \n     whether it constituted disorderly conduct. I have attached a \n     copy of that retraction. The jury instruction is based upon \n     Wisconsin case law involving disorderly conduct prosecutions \n     in the context of political protests. See WI Jury \n     Instructions--Criminal, 1900, n.4. The abortion protester \n     case, therefore, was unusual only in the sense that there are \n     not very many disorderly conduct prosecutions arising out of \n     political protests. My handling of the case did not, \n     therefore, represent ``unusual leeway'' to the defendants in \n     this context.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, while it is true that there was no mention \nof the 100 arrests in the record of the case, this fact was well known \nbecause the Milwaukee Journal ran a story about this the day the \ndefendants were convicted.\n  As to her claim there was no evidence in the record of the \ndefendant's arrest history, that is just wrong. I reviewed the record \nof the case and it tells a totally different story than what Justice \nSykes told the Senate. There are at least four different references in \nthe record to the defendant's arrest history.\n  For example, the defendant's sentencing statement said:\n\n       I have been in jail before for similar activities to the \n     one in question before you today.\n\n  Another example, a statement by the assistant district attorney at \nthe sentencing hearing. The prosecutor said:\n\n       Here there is no evidence that these defendants have made \n     any effort to conform their conduct to the requirements of \n     law. Instead, both have been charged since this case has been \n     pending with additional criminal violations.\n\n  The prosecutor noted that:\n\n       [defendant Michael] Skott has also engaged in conduct which \n     has precipitated his arrest and subsequent criminal hearing.\n\n  Now, when I asked Justice Sykes in her follow-up written questions to \nexplain the discrepancies between her earlier statements and the actual \nrecord in court, she dissembled. She said her definition of ``history \nof arrests'' did not include arrests that stem from civil violations \nnor arrests that occurred during the pendency of the case.\n  These distinctions by Justice Sykes are completely artificial. An \narrest is an arrest. But rather than admit she made a mistake in her \ninitial answer, she persisted in her contradictory and confusing \nportrayal of the case.\n\n[[Page S7365]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of my \nfollow-up written questions to Justice Sykes and her written answers.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Additional Questions of Senator Richard J. Durbin to Justice Diane \n Sykes, Nominee for the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals--April 5, 2004\n\n       1. You were the presiding judge in a 1993 abortion case \n     involving the conviction of two anti-abortion activists, \n     Michael Skott and Jack Lightner, who were convicted of \n     disorderly conduct for cementing their legs to a car in order \n     to block the door to a Milwaukee abortion clinic.\n       In a previous question I posed to you, I asked why you \n     called the defendants convicted in this case ``fine \n     characters'' and ``exemplary citizens'' at their February 9, \n     1993 sentencing in light of the fact that one defendant had \n     been arrested 80 times in abortion protests and the other 20 \n     times. Although a January 22, 1993 Milwaukee Journal article \n     about the defendants' conviction reported that Mr. Skott had \n     been arrested 80 times in abortion protests and his co-\n     defendant Jack Lightner had been arrested 20 times, you have \n     stated that you were unaware of the press reports. You also \n     stated that, in any event, ``there was no evidence in the \n     record of a history of arrests in connection with their \n     protest activity.''\n       However, a sentencing statement filed with the Court on \n     February 4, 1993 by one of the defendants, Michael Skott, \n     indicates otherwise. Mr. Skott wrote: ``Now it is your job as \n     en elected representative of this county to sentence me, \n     Judge Skyes. I have been in jail before for similar \n     activities to the one in question before you today.'' At the \n     sentencing hearing, held on February 9, 1993, you stated: ``I \n     have reviewed carefully the sentencing statement by Mr. \n     Skott.''\n       Additionally, the Assistant District Attorney stated at the \n     sentencing hearing: ``Here there is no evidence that these \n     defendants have made any effort to conform their conduct to \n     the requirements of law. Instead, both have been charged \n     since this case has been pending with additional criminal \n     violations.'' The prosecutor also stated that ``Mr. Skott has \n     also engaged in conduct which has precipitated his arrest and \n     subsequent criminal charging under the same--purview of the \n     same issue,'' and ``I understand and I know that he [Skott] \n     has been many times found guilty in municipal court and has \n     on occasion served time in the House of Correction for his \n     failure to pay fines on commitments.''\n       A. How do you reconcile your statement that ``there was no \n     evidence in the record of a history of arrests in connection \n     with their protest activity'' with Mr. Skott's statement that \n     ``I have been in jail before for similar activities to the \n     one in question before you today''?\n       See below.\n       B. How do you reconcile your statement that ``there was no \n     evidence in the record of a history of arrests in connection \n     with their protest activity'' with the Assistant District \n     Attorney's statement that ``Here there is no evidence that \n     these defendants have made any effort to conform their \n     conduct to the requirements of law. Instead, both have been \n     charged since this case has been pending with additional \n     criminal violations''?\n       See below.\n       C. How do you reconcile your statement that ``there was no \n     evidence in the record of a history of arrests in connection \n     with their protest activity'' with the Assistant District \n     Attorney's statement that ``Mr. Skott has also engaged in \n     conduct which has precipitated his arrest and subsequent \n     criminal charging under the same--purview of the same \n     issue''?\n       See below.\n       D. How do you reconcile your statement that ``there was no \n     evidence in the record of a history of arrests in connection \n     with their protest activity'' with the Assistant District \n     Attorney's statement that ``I understand and I know that he \n     [Skott] has been many times found guilty in municipal court \n     and has on occasion served time in the House of Correction \n     for his failure to pay fines on commitments''?\n\n\n                                 answer\n\n       In misdemeanor sentencing hearings in Milwaukee County \n     Circuit Court during this time period, the prosecutor would \n     typically advise the court of a defendant's prior criminal \n     history as a part of the State's sentencing argument and \n     recommendation. Unlike today, there were no computers on the \n     bench and judges relied upon the prosecutor to present \n     evidence of a defendant's prior criminal record at \n     sentencing. Newspaper articles are outside the record and \n     therefore not a proper source of sentencing information. A \n     prior criminal record is an aggravating factor for sentencing \n     purposes, and the lack of a prior criminal record is \n     generally considered to be a mitigating factor. As I \n     indicated in my earlier responses, the prosecutor in this \n     case took the unusual step of standing silent at sentencing, \n     making no record of the defendants' history in this regard \n     and making no sentencing recommendation on behalf of the \n     State.\n       After the defense attorneys made their sentencing \n     arguments, the prosecutor belatedly requested an opportunity \n     to address the court, which was granted. She stated, ``I can \n     inform the court I have no knowledge of Mr. Skott having any \n     prior criminal conviction. I may be incorrect. I understand \n     and know that he has been many times found guilty in \n     municipal court and has on occasion served time in the House \n     of Correction for his failure to pay fines on commitments. \n     However, I am not aware of any criminal convictions. I see \n     he's shaking his head no, so that's a correct statement.'' \n     The prosecutor then noted that the other defendant, Mr. \n     Lightner, had been convicted of two offenses nearly twenty \n     years before (which, as I indicated in my earlier \n     responses, was too remote and insignificant to the conduct \n     before the court to have much bearing upon sentencing), \n     and had more recently been fined for disorderly conduct \n     (circumstances unspecified.) The prosecutor did not \n     mention any history of municipal citations for protest \n     activity on the part of Mr. Lightner. In his written \n     sentencing statement Mr. Skott indicated only very \n     generally that he had been in jail for his protest \n     activities; as indicated above, he confirmed that the case \n     before the court constituted his first criminal \n     conviction.\n       I concluded from this very generalized record information \n     that Mr. Skott's prior protest activity had generated only \n     municipal citations rather than criminal arrests and charges. \n     Municipal court in Milwaukee handles only local ordinance \n     matters--traffic tickets and citations for ordinance \n     violations punishable by civil forfeiture--not state crimes. \n     Municipal violations are non-criminal and do not ordinarily \n     involve arrests. Rather, they usually involve the issuance of \n     a ticket or citation, which requires the defendant's \n     appearance in municipal court or payment of a forfeiture in \n     lieu of appearing in court. Occasionally, when a municipal \n     forfeiture is imposed and remains unpaid, the defaulting \n     defendant may be ordered to serve a few days in jail on a \n     ``commitment'' for nonpayment of the forfeiture. The matter \n     remains civil in nature. Accordingly, having been found \n     guilty in municipal court and having served time in jail on \n     municipal ``commitments'' does not equate in our system to \n     having a history of arrests or criminal convictions. As I \n     have previously noted, the arrest histories mentioned in the \n     newspaper article were not part of the sentencing record \n     before the court.\n       The prosecutor in this case also made a generalized \n     statement about a new charge that apparently had been issued \n     against the defendants for protest-related conduct that \n     occurred after the case then before the court had been \n     charged. I did not construe this as a constituting a history \n     of arrests, although the record reflects that I certainly \n     took it into consideration for sentencing purposes, together \n     with the information about the municipal court matters and \n     the other relevant facts in the record. In my sentencing \n     remarks I noted that the defendants ``obviously have a \n     history of this kind of behavior . . . and I need to take \n     that into consideration.'' I also stated that \n     ``rehabilitation in the conventional sense in this case is \n     unlikely to occur. I suppose it is possible that you would \n     learn a lesson from this case and not continue in these \n     activities if you view the trial as I do, and that is as \n     a rejection by the community of these kinds of tactics.'' \n     I concluded that ``[b]ased on the record, however, and \n     based on what I've heard of your intentions, I don't have \n     a great deal of confidence that you will take that message \n     to heart, and my sentence has to reflect that fact.'' As I \n     indicated in my earlier responses, I imposed a sentence of \n     60 days in jail, two-thirds of the available maximum. In \n     light of the record evidence regarding the seriousness of \n     the offense, the defendants' character and backgrounds, \n     and the interests of the community, this sentence was \n     neither too harsh nor unduly lenient.\n       The trial and sentencing hearing in this case took place \n     more than 11 years ago. My responses to these and your \n     earlier questions are based primarily on my review of the \n     pertinent parts of the case file, most notably the transcript \n     of the sentencing hearing, a copy of which is enclosed. I \n     have a generalized independent recollection of this case, but \n     have relied on the enclosed transcript for the details, and \n     have attempted to place those details in the context of the \n     law and general sentencing practices in Wisconsin.\n       2. In his sentencing statement, Mr. Skott equated abortion \n     with the Holocaust and slavery, and he called abortion \n     clinics ``death camps'' where ``a hired killer contracts out \n     to end what has been labeled a problem.'' At the sentencing \n     hearing, you told Mr. Skott and his co-defendant that \n     ``obviously you possess fine characters,'' ``you have \n     otherwise been exemplary citizens,'' ``your motivations were \n     pure,'' and ``I do respect you a great deal for having the \n     courage of your convictions and for the ultimate goals that \n     you sought to achieve by this conduct.'' Can you understand \n     why some people would view your favorable comments about the \n     defendants as a validation of their beliefs?\n\n\n                                 answer\n\n       I do not believe that my sentencing remarks, when read in \n     their entirety and not out of context, could be considered a \n     ``validation'' of the defendants' beliefs or rhetoric. My \n     more favorable remarks about the defendants' ``motivations,'' \n     ``courage of conviction'' and ``character'' were not directed \n     at the validity of their beliefs, but, rather, represented \n     the legally-required evaluation of the defendants' character \n     and motivations to determine whether any of the usual \n     aggravating criminal motivations or background\n\n[[Page S7366]]\n\n     factors were present in the case. Also, my favorable comment \n     about the goal the defendants sought to achieve was a \n     reference to their underlying goal of reducing the number of \n     abortions, as is clear from the following statement from my \n     sentencing remarks: ``I think that people on both sides of \n     the abortion issue would probably agree with you that \n     reducing the number of abortions in this country is a \n     desirable goal.'' My sentencing remarks also reflect \n     extensive consideration of the seriousness of the offense and \n     criticism of the defendants' conduct and tactics, as I have \n     previously discussed. My sentencing remarks were fair and \n     even-handed, and the 60-day jail sentence I imposed, at two-\n     thirds of the maximum, could not be characterized as unduly \n     lenient or a ``validation'' of the defendants' beliefs.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. In light of Justice Sykes' statements in the case, I have \nserious concerns about whether she recognizes the fundamental right of \nprivacy and about her ability to rule fairly in cases involving \nconstitutionally protected rights to privacy.\n  But let me be clear. My opposition to this nominee is not because I \nam pro-choice on the abortion record and Justice Sykes may be pro-life. \nI and my Democratic colleagues have voted for over 95 percent of \nPresident Bush's nominees--191 judges as of today. It is likely that \nthe vast majority of them were pro-life on the abortion issue.\n  Deborah Cook, now a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth \nCircuit, was endorsed by the Ohio Right to Life organization. Lavenski \nSmith, a judge on the Eighth Circuit, sought to make all abortions in \nArkansas illegal except to save the life of the mother. Michael Fisher, \nnow on the Third Circuit, advocated that abortion is wrong and should \nbe illegal even in cases of rape and incest. I voted for all three of \nthese pro-life nominees.\n  I voted for James Browning, a judge we recently confirmed to the \ndistrict court in New Mexico. Judge Browning had spoken at pro-life \nrallies and called the pro-choice position ``the tyranny of the \nmajority over the minority.'' He called on people who are pro-choice to \n``make the choice of life, not holocaust.'' Despite his passionate \nfeelings, I voted to confirm him.\n  Why? Because unlike Justice Sykes, these judicial nominees--all of \nthem I have mentioned, who do not share my views on this important \nissue--were honest and candid and open in their dealings with the \ncommittee. I think that is the bottom line. Even if I disagree with the \nnominee's point of view, I expect them to be honest and candid.\n  I have appointed in the district courts of Illinois men and women who \ndo not share my views on critical issues. But I do not ask that of \nthem. I do not come to any nominee with a litmus test, nor do I come to \nJustice Sykes with such a test.\n  I am also disappointed that Justice Sykes chose not to answer some \nbasic questions I asked about some fundamental constitutional rights. \nInstead, she tried to hide behind the Wisconsin Code of Judicial \nConduct.\n\n  Justice Sykes' refusal to answer my questions is in stark contrast to \nan Ohio Supreme Court justice whom the Senate confirmed with my vote \nlast year: Sixth Circuit nominee Deborah Cook.\n  I asked both nominees the exact same questions: whether they thought \nRoe v. Wade and Miranda v. Arizona--two landmark Supreme Court cases--\nwere consistent with strict constructionism. I have asked this question \nover and over. Justice Cook answered my question with painful but \ndirect honesty. This is what Justice Cook said:\n\n       If strict constructionism means that rights do not exist \n     unless explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, then the \n     cases you mention likely would not be consistent with that \n     label.\n\n  That is a candid answer. I am certain it is an answer Justice Cook \nknew I did not agree with personally, but she was honest, and I \nrespected her for it.\n  When Senator DeWine of Ohio came to me and said, ``I believe she is a \ngood and fair person,'' I said: ``I will give her the benefit of the \ndoubt. I will support her nomination because of her candor and \nhonesty.''\n  Now, contrast that with the answer I received from Justice Sykes to \nthe exact same question. She said:\n\n       This question requests a critique of certain United States \n     Supreme Court cases that I am or will be required to \n     interpret and apply as a judge in individual cases before the \n     court. The Wisconsin Code of Judicial Conduct prohibits \n     judges from engaging in extra-judicial commentary with \n     respect to particular cases or legal issues that would appear \n     to commit the judge in advance or suggest a promise or \n     commitment of a certain course of conduct in office regarding \n     particular cases or legal issues.\n\n  This is a major-league evasion. If judicial nominees could each hide \nbehind the local code of ethics in their State and say they could not \neven tell us where they stand on landmark Supreme Court decisions, such \nas Miranda and Roe v. Wade, and whether these decisions are consistent \nwith a certain judicial philosophy, then the Senate Judiciary Committee \nshould turn out its lights and the Senate should walk away from any \nrole in advising and consenting to judicial nominees. But that is not \nwhat I swore to uphold when I took the oath of office to serve in the \nSenate.\n  What Justice Sykes sent to me in response to that question was \nevasion with a capital ``E,'' and I do not believe the Senate should \naccept such responses.\n  Justice Sykes' refusal to answer my questions was not only evasive \nbut erroneous. I contacted Steven Lubet, an expert on judicial ethics \nand a law professor at Northwestern University Law School in Chicago. I \nshowed him Justice Sykes' responses to my questions, and he wrote a \nletter stating that the Wisconsin Code of Judicial Conduct does not \nprevent Justice Sykes from answering my questions.\n  So this is my conclusion, having considered these three elements: \nfirst, that Justice Sykes has taken pride in the fact that she is known \nas a hanging judge and is extreme in her sentencing procedures; second, \nthat she was not open and honest with me in the sentencing of a case \nwhich involved people who were well known to be serial, at least, \narrestees, if not criminals, because of their conduct; and, third, that \nshe would not answer the most basic questions about her judicial \nphilosophy, which I think goes to the core of our responsibility in the \nSenate Judiciary Committee.\n  Time and again, Justice Sykes has demonstrated she does not possess \nthe qualities necessary to inspire the confidence we should expect from \na Federal judge. She has been nominated to serve for the rest of her \nnatural life on the second highest court in America. I do not believe \nshe can provide the good judgment, candor, or fairmindedness that we \nmust demand of each person seeking such an important appointment. I \nwill vote ``no'' on this nomination.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER.

Mr. President, Monday, I came to the floor to outline \nwhat we needed to see accomplished in Darfur, Sudan, where tens of \nthousands have died, hundreds of thousands are currently in peril, and \nmillions more have lost their homes and their livelihoods. My last \nspeech focused on what the government of Sudan needed to do. Today I \nwant to focus on what we need to do, what the U.S. Government and the \nAmerican people need to do.\n  Today, I am offering an amendment to the fiscal year 2005 Department \nof Defense appropriations bill, together with Senators Leahy, \nBrownback, Alexander, Frist, and McCain. This critical amendment will \nprovide $95 million in emergency funding to help address the current \ncrisis in Darfur and eastern Chad. The House included the same $95 \nmillion in their bill this past Tuesday, and I hope we will do the \nsame.\n  Specifically, the amendment would add $70 million to USAID's \nInternational Disaster and Famine Assistance programs in Darfur, as \nwell as $25\n\n[[Page S7368]]\n\nmillion to the Department of State for refugee assistance in eastern \nChad. This type of crisis is exactly why we created these accounts. Now \nwe need to use them.\n  Mr. President, we simply need to do this. Ten years ago, we failed to \nact when close to a million people were slaughtered in Rwanda. We \ncannot go back now and change that, much as we would like to. But we \ncan do something different today. What is occurring today is genocide. \nHundreds of thousands of people are dying, and we can prevent it. To \nignore this crisis would be a tragic mistake. To deny this funding \nwould be to deny children the right to live and people the right to \nsurvive. We are not responsible for the genocide, but we will be \nresponsible if we do not do something today to prevent these people, \nthese children, men and women, from dying.\n  Many times, we come to the floor and talk about emergencies. \nSometimes the word is almost debased. But if ever there was an \nemergency, this truly is an emergency. This truly is a crisis.\n  If this situation weren't so serious, we could wait and offer this \namendment to another bill. Members of the Senate, time does not allow \nus to do that. Time is not on our side. Using this bill as the vehicle \nwill make the emergency funding available as soon as we pass it, and it \nis signed into law. That is why we must act on this bill.\n  Every major humanitarian organization in the world has recognized \nDarfur as the worst humanitarian crisis in the world today. But a quote \nby the U.N. World Food Program Deputy Director in Chad captures it \nbest:\n\n       There will be a tragedy if nothing happens. I don't think \n     any of the children under the age of 5 will make it [if \n     nothing happens], and the pregnant women, too. For those who \n     are under 5, there is no chance. They will simply die from \n     starvation.\n\n  The U.S. Agency for International Development is also increasing \ntheir mortality figures, their estimates. They now say their original \nestimate that at least 350,000 people could die of disease and \nmalnutrition over the next 9 months is conservative. That is because \nthe violence that started all of this has not stopped, and because the \nconditions those individuals are facing are getting worse with the \noncoming rains. Hundreds of thousands are now in shantytowns around the \nregional capitals or in refugee camps in eastern Chad. The conditions \nare quickly deteriorating because aid groups simply cannot accommodate \nthe large numbers. The United States is currently meeting about 25 \npercent of the food needs. But that means that 75 percent of the food \nneeds are not being met; 75 percent of the people face starvation.\n\n  Malnutrition and disease are our biggest enemies in a crisis such as \nthis. The polio epidemic hitting Africa has spread to Darfur, and only \n50 percent of the children are immunized. The race against the clock is \nwell underway and we need to make sure that USAID and the State \nDepartment have the money they need to respond, and respond now. I have \nno doubt in my mind that the long-term needs in Darfur and eastern Chad \nexceed what this amendment calls for, but for now at least this will \nallow our aid agencies to begin to meet their immediate needs this \nyear. The children cannot wait and, therefore, we cannot delay these \nfunds any longer.\n  That is why I join my colleagues and ask my colleagues to join me in \npressing, also, for a U.N. security resolution authorizing peacekeeping \ntroops to monitor the cease-fire in Darfur and ensure, by force if \nnecessary, that humanitarian aid is not obstructed. According to the \nU.S. Ambassador to Sudan, there is no evidence yet that the Government \nof Sudan is serious about addressing the militias which have caused so \nmuch of this problem. If the Government of Sudan refuses to address the \nethnic cleansing that we have seen, then we should make sure the United \nStates will.\n\n  Senator Durbin and I have a letter that we are now circulating that \nwe will send to Secretary Powell. This letter addresses this issue, and \nI invite my colleagues to sign this letter.\n  Finally, I want to alert my colleagues to another crisis that is \nbeginning to emerge in Africa. We do not have time today to speak in \ndetail about it, but we should watch for this crisis because we will \nhave to address this crisis as well, and the world needs to address \nthis crisis, and that is the crisis in the Congo.\n  Militant groups who escaped from Rwanda after the genocide there are \nnow destabilizing the Congo. Mr. President, 3.3 million people are \nwithout humanitarian aid.\n  If we do not pay attention to the Congo, then the Congo is, in a \nshort period of time, going to also look like Darfur, and we will have \nfailed again and the world will have failed again.\n  The world must pay attention. We must learn to stop these events \nbefore they become crises. That is why our response to Darfur today in \nthis amendment is so important. We need to set the precedent that we \nfailed to set in Rwanda: that the U.S. Government will be watching for \nethnic cleansing and genocide, and no matter where it is found, we will \nrespond, and those responsible will be held accountable.\n  We simply cannot tolerate crimes against humanity, and we must speak \nout. If we fail in this effort, we doom not only the people of Darfur \nbut the victims of future conflicts as well. We need to make ``never \nagain'' a promise of the U.S. Government that is enforced by our \nactions. I, therefore, urge my colleagues to support this amendment and \ncontinue to call attention to what is happening in Darfur.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I join my colleague from Ohio in \nsupporting this amendment that will put forward $95 million in \nemergency aid to the Sudan. I thank him for bringing this forward. I \nthank the Chair for holding a hearing on this recently to highlight \nwhat is taking place. He outlined what is occurring. This is happening \nbefore our very eyes.\n  I associate myself with my colleague's statement that we need to say \nto people around the world that when genocide occurs, we will respond. \nThere will be consequences on governments that conduct genocide in \ntheir nations.\n  What we are seeing taking place today is something on a massive scale \nbefore our very eyes. We had satellite photographs appearing today. We \nsee vast sections of communities wiped out, burned out. We see militias \ngoing in, backed by the government, burning communities, poisoning \nwells, putting dead animals down in the bottom of wells so they are not \nusable.\n  This is a marginal region in the first place, where, if you push \npeople out of their homes and away from their encampments, it is \ndifficult to survive. We now have by estimates about 1 million people \non the move in this region. We have, by estimates, the capacity to feed \n300,000 people, with 1 million people on the move. One can see that if \nthe situation does not improve, we are going to have a large group of \npeople who are not going to get fed, housed, and are vulnerable. Many \nwill die. Many will perish. We are going into the rainy season in this \nregion.\n  There are a couple of items we need to do. No. 1, we need to get this \naid passed. I thank the chairman for allowing us to bring up this \namendment, and I urge my colleagues to adopt it. We need to get the \ninternational community engaged with the international observers, the \nAfrican Union, the United Nations, with observers and peacekeepers in \nthis region. We need to force the Sudanese Government to stop their \nsponsorship of the Jingaweit. This is the Arab militia that is going \ninto the region and burning communities and attacking communities with \nmachine guns.\n  We need to stop the Sudanese Government from using helicopter \ngunships for aerial bombardments, from going into these communities and \ndriving people out, killing them with bombings or by military attacks. \nWe need to speak very clearly and then act decisively.\n  Time is of the essence. We need to act now for us to be able to save \nthe lives in this region that are so vulnerable and will be lost if we \ndo not act.\n  I applaud the Secretary of State for announcing today that he will be \ntraveling next week to the Darfur region in the Sudan. Congressman Wolf \nand I will be traveling there shortly as well to view this situation \nand to put pressure on the Sudanese Government to stop this and to put \npressure on the international community to effectively respond.\n  We can act, and we can stop this if we act now. Mother Teresa, when \nshe\n\n[[Page S7369]]\n\ncame to this country and people were asking her what can they do to \nhelp the poor, to help those in trouble, responded by saying: We all \nhave our Calcuttas. There are things each of us can do. We all have our \nCalcuttas.\n  Here is a situation to which we can respond. We can do something. We \nneed to adopt this amendment. We need to put pressure on the \ninternational body and the Sudanese Government, and we can save lives \nby doing so. I urge the adoption of this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be added as a \ncosponsor of this important amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I particularly wish to thank my colleague, \nSenator DeWine from Ohio, for his leadership, Senator Brownback from \nKansas, and the Presiding Officer, Senator Alexander, for their \nleadership on this amendment.\n  In my hometown of Springfield, IL, my wife and I live next door to \nthis family--we have lived in the neighborhood for over 25 years--and \none of the young women in that family, after serving several years in \nthe U.S. Air Force, left to work for the World Food Program, and then \nwork for USAID. As we speak, she is in Sudan trying to bring necessary \nrelief in this horrible situation.\n  It is in Robin May's honor that I am happy to add my name as a \ncosponsor to this important amendment.\n  I also acknowledge with gratitude the helpfulness of Senator Stevens \nand Senator Inouye in allowing us to offer this amendment.\n  If one reads the history of the last 10 years, one will be struck by \nthe fact that at least in the situation of Rwanda, if not in other \ntimes, we in the United States turned a blind eye to genocide, to the \nmassive killing of innocent people. We are not going to let that happen \nin the Sudan and Chad.\n  This commitment of funds, though modest in relation to the problems, \nshows that the United States is willing to step up and try to show \nleadership with the rest of the world in helping these poor innocent \nvictims.\n  We are constantly defining ourselves to the world. Those definitions \ncome out many times in photographs that are not complimentary and \nsometimes in photographs that are. I hope the world, in viewing this \nsmall but important effort, will understand that America does care, and \ncares for those who are suffering in the most remote regions of the \nworld and in Africa, of course.\n  I am happy to add my name as a cosponsor to this amendment. I hope it \nis adopted with overwhelming support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Ohio and the \nSenator from Illinois for their remarks. The Senator from Kansas has \nspent a great deal of time in Africa and has been a good teacher to the \nrest of us on this subject. The majority leader, Senator Frist, has \nvisited the Sudan many times. All of us are deeply concerned about what \nis happening in Darfur. Just at the time when we were starting to \ncelebrate the beginning of a solution to a north-south conflict which \nhas gone on for years and years, suddenly we are hit, literally in the \nface, with this terrible genocide in the western part of Sudan.\n  It is important to this body that we show that in the midst of all of \nthe other things that are going on in the world that we recognize this \nsituation.\n  We recognize the importance of it. We recognize that by our speaking \nout, by our actions, by visits by representatives of our \nadministration, and by the Congress, we can make a difference in this \ngenocide.\n  As the Senator from Ohio remarked, we all look back 10 years to a \ntime in Rwanda when we were thinking that we cannot be a policeman \neverywhere in the world, we cannot deal with every problem, but at the \nsame time that problem ballooned to such a massive size we are all \nembarrassed about the fact that as a country we did not do more.\n  That does not always mean we send troops into a country. It does not \nalways mean we send ships nearby a country. But it does mean there are \na number of things we can do, and with this bipartisan act today in the \nmidst of perhaps the most important bill we have to discuss, which is \nthe proper support for the men and women who are fighting to defend our \ncountry, we are taking a few minutes to say there is a terrible event \nhappening in the western part of Sudan that could stop immediately if \nthe Government in Khartoum would stop it. We ask them to do it in a \nbipartisan way and we further ask the United Nations, which in this \ncase has more of a capacity than we do, to influence that government \nand to get busy and do its job. That is what we are asking today. The \namendment of the Senator from Ohio appropriates $95 million to help in \nthat effort.\n  Last week I chaired a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee on the situation in Sudan. The alarm could not have been \nsounded more loudly. I chaired that hearing because I am chairman of \nthe African Affairs Subcommittee. One of our witnesses, John \nPrendergast of the International Crisis Group, told the committee the \nfirst phase of the genocide in Darfur is already complete. The \nGovernment of Sudan, largely through its Janjaweed militia, has pursued \nan active campaign of ethnic cleansing. Over 30,000--maybe 50,000--have \nalready been killed by direct attacks on villages in Darfur. They have \nleveled hundreds of villages. Other Senators have spoken of the \ndetails, but that is what is happening.\n  So now the second phase of the genocide is underway. The Government \nof Sudan and its militias are forcing the starvation and death of \nhundreds of thousands of people. As the Senator from Kansas explained, \nthese are people living on the margin. When they are moved away from \ntheir huts, when dead animals or dead people are thrown down their \nwells, they have very little ability to survive. As the rainy season \ncomes, it makes it worse.\n  On top of that, the Government of Sudan, in addition to tolerating \nthe killing of these people, is putting obstacles in the way of our \nefforts and the efforts of others in the world to provide food and aid \nto people who are starving and dying. It is an unconscionable set of \nactions by that government.\n  When we think of Sudan, we usually think of a conflict between a \nMuslim and Arab government, and an African and Christian insurgency. \nThat is not the case here. This is Muslim against Muslim, but still \nArab against African. Ethnicity, not religion, is the primary factor.\n  Another of our witnesses, Julie Flint of Human Rights Watch, was \nthere writing a report this spring, travelling by horse and camel \nthrough the area. She talked about refugees who fled to neighboring \nChad, about 200,000 of them, family members being raped and killed in \nfront of loved ones. She said the region is now largely empty. Where \nvillages were, only rubble remains. The Sudanese Government claims the \nJanjaweed forces in Darfur are acting on their own and the government \nwants to stop them. The evidence suggests otherwise.\n  Our administration has been a strong voice in this case, but the \ninternational community has failed to respond. The U.N. Human Rights \nCommission, which is supposed to confront flagrant abuses of human \nrights, especially when they occur on such a mass scale, failed to \nadopt a U.S. resolution condemning the atrocities. That body has become \na travesty, condoning the very activity it was intended to prevent.\n  The Bush administration, this Government, has had remarkable success \nin the peace process between the north and the south. We are proud of \nthat. Protocols addressing all the major outstanding issues in that \nprocess were signed in May. Senator Danforth, who was the President's \nspecial envoy, has been a real leader. Other nations have joined in \nthat effort: Great Britain, Norway, Kenya.\n  Some of our friends are concerned if we confront the government in \nKhartoum, Sudan, too directly about the atrocities in the west, Darfur, \nthat will jeopardize any prospect for lasting peace in southern Sudan. \nThey may be right. But if hundreds of thousands of lives are the price \nof peace in southern Sudan, the price is too high.\n  So the amendment of the Senator from Ohio, which I am glad to \ncosponsor, will enable the United States to\n\n[[Page S7370]]\n\nstep up to this crisis quickly, providing relief to those in need.\n  Other nations are also contributing. I hope they will join the United \nStates in condemning the actions of the Sudanese government in the U.N. \nSecurity Council and demand full humanitarian access to Darfur now. I \ncongratulate the Senator from Ohio on this amendment. I am proud to \nsupport it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to lend my strong support to \nthe amendment offered by the Senator from Ohio. I would also like to \nrecognize the leadership that the Senator from Kansas, Mr. Brownback, \nand the Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold, have shown on the issue \nof Sudan throughout the years.\n  This amendment mirrors efforts in the House of Representatives \nappropriations bill to add $95 million to address the humanitarian \ncrisis in Darfur, Sudan and across the border in Chad.\n  It is a good start and I commend the chairman and ranking member of \nthe Defense Subcommittee for accepting this amendment. However, it is \nonly a start, and a modest one at that.\n  We should be providing at least double this amount to address what is \nthe worst humanitarian crisis that exists in the world today. I hope \nthat by the time we conclude debate on this bill the Senate will have \nagreed to additional funds for Sudan.\n  The Senate needs to act. The situation is abysmal. The situation is \nhorrendous. The situation is intolerable.\n  Sudanese military forces and government-backed militia forces have \nleft tens of thousands dead, over a million displaced, and hundreds of \nthousands at immediate, urgent risk. USAID has warned that without full \nhumanitarian access, 350,000 displaced civilians may die or hunger and \ndisease in the coming months.\n  The massacres and widespread rapes, the destruction of villages, \nmosques and farms--all of this violence and horror have given rise to a \nsecond, even more costly wave of suffering, as civilians are left with \nno capacity to sustain themselves as the rainy season approaches.\n  On top of this, the Sudan-Chad border is heavily patrolled to keep \nsome of the most vulnerable civilians from fleeing to refugee camps in \neastern Chad.\n  What is happening is appalling, it is an affront to all humanity, to \nall faiths, and we cannot stand by and simply watch this unfold.\n  The Sudanese government claims to have granted humanitarian access to \nDarfur. This is a sham. The government of Sudan has done virtually \neverything it can to prevent the international community from \neffectively addressing the crisis in Darfur. The government has stalled \nand delayed permission to travel, prevented the use of vehicles and \nradios in certain areas, and looked the other way as militias have \nattacked and threatened humanitarian workers.\n  Hundreds of thousands of people are at risk. We have a responsibility \nto act to address this terrible situation. I urge my colleges to \nsupport the DeWine amendment and I will be looking for ways to do more \nto help the catastrophe unfolding in Sudan.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the \namendment introduced by Senator DeWine to provide humanitarian \nassistance for the refugees in Darfur, Sudan. Of all the places on \nEarth, where killing and deaths are rampant, Darfur, Sudan leads the \nlist.\n  The DeWine amendment will provide $95 million to respond to the \ncrisis, including $70 million for International Disaster and Famine \nAssistance and $25 million for Migration and Refugee Assistance.\n  In response to attacks by rebel groups in the Western region of \nDarfur, Arab militias, known as Jangaweed, armed and aided by the \ngovernment of Sudan, launched a brutal campaign of ethnic cleansing \nagainst non-Arab residents, including murder, rape, forced \ndisplacement, and looting. Over 30,000 have been killed and more than 2 \nmillion displaced.\n  The situation is dire. While the United Nations Security Council \nrecently endorsed the peace process to end Africa's longest running \ncivil war, USAID Administrator Andrew Natsios estimated that 300,000 \nrefugees from Darfur may perish due to a lack of basic food and \nmedicine. He added that that number could reach as high as one million.\n  Secretary of State Colin Powell has stated that the Administration is \ncurrently studying whether or not the rampage in Darfur can legally be \ndefined as ``genocide''.\n  Whatever the legal conclusion--and in this Senator's mind the \nkillings most certainly can be characterized as genocide--the United \nStates and the international community have a moral obligation to \nprovide assistance to the refugees and compel the government of Sudan \nto put a stop to the death squads.\n  It is past time for the U.N. Security Council to pass a resolution \nauthorizing a robust monitoring and peacekeeping force and demanding \nthat the government of Sudan disarm the Jangaweed and allow \nhumanitarian assistance to reach the refugees.\n  Sadly, it appears that debate over such a resolution could take weeks \nand put countless lives at risk. Inaction will also threaten the peace \nprocess that so many people, including the new U.S. Ambassador to the \nUnited Nations, John Danforth, have worked so long to put in place.\n  While the Security Council waits, the U.S. Senate can act now. \nEarlier this month, Mr. Natsios pledged an additional $188.5 million in \nemergency assistance to address the humanitarian crisis in Darfur. \nWhile this amendment does not match that amount, it is a start and it \nwill give the refugees some hope.\n  Ten years ago the world remained silent and stood by as the genocide \nunfolded in Rwanda. In the wake of hundreds of thousands of deaths, we \ncommitted ourselves to not make the same mistake twice.\n  The situation in Darfur is now testing the United States and the \ninternational community's will to fulfill that pledge. We must not fail \nthose who are now facing displacement, starvation, and death. We must \nrise to the occasion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent that this amendment be \ntemporarily set aside so I can send to the desk an amendment which has \nbeen agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3497\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I send an amendment to the desk for the Senator from \nVermont, Mr. Leahy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for Mr. Leahy, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3497.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To set aside an amount for procurement of aircrew bladder \n                          relief (ABRD) kits)\n\n       On page 112, between lines 13 and 14, insert the following:\n       Sec. 8121. Of the amount appropriated by title under the \n     heading ``Other Procurement, Air Force'', up to $2,000,000 \n     may be used for aircrew bladder relief device (ABRD) kits.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask for adoption of the amendment. This is an \namendment earmarking specific funds for a specific project for our \ncrews.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3497) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent the order for the quorum call be \nrescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent Senator Dole be added as a \ncosponsor to amendment No. 3493.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S7371]]\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I urge Senators to come present their \namendments.\n  We will be pleased to yield the floor to the distinguished Senator \nfrom South Dakota, the Democratic leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me again compliment our two managers. \nWe want to encourage Senators to come over and offer their amendments. \nI hope over the course of the next couple of hours we can dispose of \nwhatever pending amendments there are.\n  Mr. President, I understand the pending legislation is an amendment \noffered by the Senator from Ohio regarding Sudan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the history of the world's response to \ngenocide is one of long memory and poor eyesight.\n  Each of us have, at one time or another, looked back upon the \nterrible history of the Holocaust and made a commitment, in public or \nin our hearts, not to stay silent should the first signs of a potential \ngenocide come into view.\n  Every one of President Bush's six immediate predecessors gave voice \nto this common commitment. And yet each saw during their tenure a \ngenocide somewhere in the world.\n  In the last quarter of the twentieth century, 1.7 million Cambodians \nwere murdered by the Khmer Rouge; 100,000 Kurds were massacred by \nSaddam Hussein; 200,000 Bosnia Muslims were killed by Serb militia; and \n800,000 Rwandan Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed at the hands of \nHutu mobs in just 100 days.\n  As these dangers gathered, and the cry for help went out to the \nworld, the world stood by, each time.\n  Our failure has not been one of moral understanding. Our failure, \nsimply, has been one of moral courage.\n  Today, a tragedy of all too familiar dimensions appears to be \ngathering in the Darfur region of Western Sudan.\n  Armed and protected by the Sudanese military, ethnic Arab militiamen \nhave brought a plague of terror down on the African residents of \nDarfur.\n  Villages have been razed, crops destroyed, and cattle slaughtered. \nWomen have been raped and enslaved.\n  More than 15,000 Sudanese men, women, and children have been killed, \nand a million more have been driven from their homes in fear.\n  As they torch villages, the Arab militia have been heard to shout, \n``We will not allow blacks here. . . . This land is only for Arabs.''\n  On May 6, the Senate passed a resolution condemning the Sudanese \ngovernment's complicity in the terrorizing of the civilian population \nof Darfur and warning of a potential crisis.\n  Since then, however, no real progress has been made either to stop \nthe bloodshed or to bring sufficient aid to the refugees.\n  Humanitarian assistance has not been allowed to reach all of those in \nneed.\n  Meanwhile, the annual rainy season is now beginning, making \ntransportation more difficult, and making the health of the vulnerable \neven more precarious.\n  Most ominously, the people of Darfur are about to miss their planting \nseason, raising the specter of a famine of epic proportions and \nrendering otherwise productive men and women dependent for at least \nanother year.\n  Already, USAID predicts 320,000 have been effectively sentenced to \ndeath. Unless action is taken, 1 million Sudanese men, women, and \nchildren will die this year alone.\n  I repeat, 1 million people face death in Sudan.\n  Let's also be clear on this point. Most of these deaths are \npreventable, but only if the world chooses to act.\n  Genocide is a crime against humanity. And all humanity shares a \ncommon responsibility to respond.\n  Our revulsion at genocide joins all people, in all cultures \nthroughout the world. Unilateral action in this sense would not be \nsufficient.\n  There are few clearer cases for the need to rally the world. America \nhas both the opportunity and the obligation to unite the world \ncommunity in trying to prevent yet another genocide.\n  My friends from Ohio and Vermont, Senators DeWine and Leahy, are \nurging us to take the first important step in stopping this gathering \nstorm. This additional assistance will help thousands of people avert \nhunger.\n  But we also must ensure that we do everything possible to end this \ncrisis.\n  The most effective tool against a potential disaster in Sudan is the \nUnited Nations.\n  The Bush administration must equip our new ambassador to the United \nNations with the authority and support required to provide effective \nleadership on Sudan.\n  The administration should take the following steps in order to make \nsure that Senator Danforth is able to mobilize international action on \nDarfur:\n  First, the Administration must insist that Khartoum provide complete, \nunrestricted access for all humanitarian operations and aid workers.\n  Second, we must demand that the Sudanese government take verifiable \nsteps to ensure that the militia forces are restrained, by allowing for \nthe unrestricted movement and operations of observers deployed by the \nAfrican Union.\n  In addition, the Sudanese government must stop providing arms and \nlogistical support to the Janjaweed militia.\n  Third, we should require that Khartoum initiate, with U.N., African \nUnion, and regional support and involvement, a dialogue with political, \nrebel, and civil society representatives in Darfur in order to achieve \na long-term resolution of the political crisis and agreement on a plan \nfor disarming militia forces and rebels.\n  Fourth, the administration should invest Senator Danforth with the \nauthority to start work immediately on a Security Council resolution \nincluding each of these steps and establishing verifiable benchmarks \nfor compliance.\n  In the event of noncompliance, we must call for Security Council \nsanctions, including freezing the assets and restricting the travel of \nSudanese government officials.\n  In order to be effective, however, it is vital, that these sanctions \nbe multilateral and the world community share fully in their \nimplementation.\n  Fifth, Senator Danforth should also be empowered to put Khartoum on \nnotice, in the strongest terms, that international support for \nimplementation of the North-South peace agreement does not represent \nendorsement of Khartoum's actions in Darfur.\n  The agreements reached between warring parties in the North and South \nof Sudan, which could not have been accomplished without the leadership \nof Senator Danforth and the administration, are nonetheless just the \nfirst steps to bringing stability and peace to the entire country.\n  In no way does the Sudanese government's commitment to end \nhostilities with rebels in the South justify or compensate for its \nactive support for Janjaweed militia in Darfur.\n  Sixth, in order to clarify Senator Danforth's authority, the State \nDepartment should make its final determination on whether the crisis in \nDarfur meets the legal definition of genocide.\n  Testimony from the victims in Darfur make it very clear that it does.\n  In order to remove any ambiguity or ambivalence from America's moral \nleadership, the State Department should make its determination quickly, \nso that we can bring together an appropriate response from the world \ncommunity.\n  Finally, Senator Danforth should be empowered to initiate discussions \nwithin the Security Council on planning for an intervention force, if \nthis should be required to ensure that lives are saved and a genocide \nprevented.\n  Consideration should be given to non-U.S. troops including from \nEurope and Africa; the Security Council should consult with the African \nUnion.\n  The main point here is that the planning must be done now--even if \nthe decision is delayed--both to make clear to Khartoum that the \ninternational community is serious and to be ready if it is necessary \nto intervene.\n  The history of genocide teaches us that this crisis needs to be \naddressed on several different levels.\n  First, on the humanitarian level, we need to provide immediate aid to \nrefugees and to the internally displaced.\n  Second, we must insist on full accountability for all perpetrators of \ncrimes against humanity.\n  In order to keep Sudan from spiraling downward into a cycle of \nretributive\n\n[[Page S7372]]\n\nviolence, all those responsible must be brought to justice.\n  Finally, a long-term resolution demands that the world focus on \nbringing about a political solution to the instability and violence of \nSudan.\n  President Bush has spoken with force and eloquence on the need to \nmatch American action to American words and values.\n  Never is that more important than in the case of genocide when the \nlives of hundreds of thousands hang in the balance.\n  President Bush, like his predecessors, understands the moral \nimperative to take action to stop genocide.\n  Speaking after a tour of the Holocaust Museum in 2001, President Bush \nreaffirmed ``America's commitment to the memory of 6 million who died \nin the Holocaust [and] our commitment to averting future tragedies.''\n  The future has arrived. A tragedy stands at the world's doorstep. \nThese words are engraved upon the conscience of the world: Never Again.\n  In the months ahead, we will learn what they mean to us.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask that amendment No. 3493, which is \nthe Sudan amendment, be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3493) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator from Virginia has an amendment, and I \nunderstand the Senator from South Dakota, the distinguished minority \nleader, wishes to have a discussion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n\n                                Tricare\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am available for the colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the Senator from South Carolina is not on \nthe Senate floor, but I do not think he would mind, given the fact----\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, he spoke to me about it, and I expressed a \nwillingness to indicate to both colleagues that the Senate bill \ncontains a provision coauthored by my two distinguished colleagues on a \nsubject that is of great importance to the men and women of our \nmilitary. And it is the intention of the Senator from Virginia, as a \nconferee, to support the Senate positions as we proceed through the \nresolution of such differences as the House and the Senate may have.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate the statement of support \noffered by the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee. \nIt had been our intention to offer an amendment to provide full 12-\nmonth funding, on this particular bill, for reservists' TRICARE.\n  I thank the distinguished chairman of the committee and our \nremarkable ranking member for their efforts and the acknowledgment of \nthe need to address health care concerns among members of our Guard and \nReserve. They have done so in this bill in a way that allows Guard \nmembers and reservists to obtain this health care coverage for 5 \nmonths, up until that time next year when we expect a supplemental to \nbe brought again before the Senate, which would then afford us an \nopportunity to review the current program and extend it for the balance \nof the year. It would be in consultation with Senator Graham.\n  We have concluded that a far better and more productive and long-\nlasting approach would be to complete our work in the bill where it \nbelongs, the Defense authorization bill, the legislation we completed \njust last night, thanks to the able leadership of Chairman Warner.\n  Our concern, of course, has been that even though TRICARE for \nreservists enjoyed the support of more than 70 Members, there may not \nbe the degree of support in conference that will be required to sustain \nthe Senate position. So it is our hope that will happen. The chairman's \nacknowledgment of his interest in protecting the Senate position is \nappreciated, and we will work with him to see that we are successful in \nthat effort in committee.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, as always and customary with the \ndistinguished Senator from South Dakota, you have spoken to the \nsituation factually. Historically, that is the way we have dealt with \nthose matters in the Senate. I appreciate you respect my position as a \nconferee. I cannot make ironclad commitments, other than I have always \ngone into a conference to try to support the position as taken by this \ncollective body in its decisionmaking process.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I again thank the chairman. Simply \nstated, it is our expectation that we will succeed in conference this \nyear. This issue has overwhelming bipartisan support not only in the \nSenate but the House as well. And, obviously, it will keep coming back \nyear after year unless we do resolve it. It would be my hope this would \nbe the year we do so successfully.\n  So, again, I thank my colleagues, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3498\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof the Senator from Virginia, Mr. Warner.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for Mr. Warner, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3498.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To increase amounts for certain Navy shipbuilding and \n   conversion programs, projects, and activities; and to provide an \n                                offset)\n\n       On page 112, between lines 13 and 14, insert the following:\n       Sec. 8121. (a) Of the amounts appropriated by title III \n     under the heading ``Shipbuilding and Conversion, Navy''--\n       (1) the amount provided under that heading specifically for \n     the Carrier Replacement Program (AP) is hereby increased by \n     $140,900,000;\n       (2) the amount provided under that heading specifically for \n     CVN Refuelings (AP) is hereby increased by $110,000,000; and\n       (3) the total amount provided under that heading is hereby \n     increased by $250,900,000.\n       (b) The amount of the reduction provided in section 8062(a) \n     is hereby increased by $250,900,000.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I state to the Senate that this amendment \nhas been cleared on both sides, and it is revenue neutral, as I \nunderstand it.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished managers of the \nbill. I appreciate that. This is a matter that is of great importance \nto the U.S. Navy. I am happy to do it.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nAllen of Virginia be added as a cosponsor to the amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I join in that request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, has the amendment been adopted?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3498) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INOUYE.

It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) any request for funds for a fiscal year for an ongoing \n     military operation overseas, including operations in \n     Afghanistan and Iraq, should be included in the annual budget \n     of the President for such fiscal year as submitted to \n     Congress under section 1105(a) of title 31, United States \n     Code; and\n       (2) any funds provided for such fiscal year for such a \n     military operation should be provided in appropriations Acts \n     for such fiscal year through appropriations to specific \n     accounts set forth in such Acts.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, last year, the Senate overwhelmingly \napproved an amendment that I offered to urge the President to budget \nfor ongoing military operations. Mr. President, 81 Senators agreed that \nthe administration should include in its budget request, which is sent \nto Congress in February each year, an estimate of the funds needed to \nsupport our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  The sense-of-the-Senate amendment that I authored was included in the \nfiscal year 2004 Defense Appropriations Act, as signed into law by the \nPresident on September 30, 2003. But there was no request for funds for \nour troops deployed overseas in the budget that came to Congress on \nFebruary 2, 2004. That budget was stone-cold silent about our troops in \nIraq and in Afghanistan.\n  It was as if the White House had no plan for how to pay our troops \noverseas, or how to pay for their fuel and ammunition. We sometimes \nhear Korea described as the forgotten war, but the President's budget \nforgot about the wars ongoing in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Senators on both sides of the aisle realized the folly of ignoring \nthe massive costs of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In an act of \nfiscal responsibility, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee \nincluded in his mark of the fiscal year 2005 budget resolution an \nadditional $30 billion reserve fund for the costs of the wars. The \nHouse of Representatives went even further by including a $50 billion \nreserve fund in its version of the budget resolution. Again, these \nfunds were not requested by the President, but Congress decided to \ninclude them for the sake of fiscal sanity.\n  The Defense appropriations bill before the Senate today includes $25 \nbillion to pay for our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. The White House \nrequested these funds literally at the last minute. The Armed Services \nCommittee had completed its markup of the Defense authorization bill \nthe week before the administration submitted its request for these \nmoneys. Talk about hiding the ball, the administration stiff-arms \nCongress by not making any budget estimate for Iraq and Afghanistan \nuntil after the markup of the Defense authorization bill is completed.\n  Does anyone think this $25 billion will cover the cost of the wars \nfor the next 12 months? Not a chance, Mr. President. According to the \nDepartment of Defense, the cost of operations in Iraq now averages $4 \nbillion per month. The cost of operations in Afghanistan is up to $900 \nmillion-plus per month. At that rate of spending, the President's $25 \nbillion reserve fund will not even last half a year.\n  Talk about short-changing our troops.\n  That is why, for better or worse, the White House is planning on \nspringing a supplemental budget request of $50 billion or more on \nCongress and the American taxpayer sometime next year.\n  Tragically, all of these funds are being financed by deficit \nspending.\n\n[[Page S7374]]\n\nSince the administration refuses to send Congress an estimate of how \nmuch the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan will cost, much less any plan for \nhow to pay for those costs, each last-minute emergency request for \nfunds that the President sends to Congress sends our country deeper \ninto red ink.\n  Congress has already devoted $122 billion to Iraq, and every single \ndollar of that amount is going to have to be paid off by the sweat and \ntoil of our children and grandchildren for decades to come, because it \nis the taxes the future generations will pay that will be used to \nfinance the deficit spending of today. What kind of wars are we running \nwhen we saddle our children, and their children yet to be born, with \nthe responsibility of paying for them?\n  I have heard all of the tired excuses about why the administration \ndoes not want to estimate the cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nI wish I had a nickel for every time I have heard someone say that the \ncost of the war is ``unknowable.''\n  For example, on July 9, 2003, at a hearing of the Armed Services \nCommittee, I asked Secretary Rumsfeld for an estimate of how much is \nbeing spent in Iraq and Afghanistan. His response? ``I would not want \nto venture a guess and be wrong.'' I wouldn't accept that answer. I \ntold Secretary Rumsfeld to go call the Pentagon and find out. That's \nexactly what he did, and he finally reported back that we were spending \n$4.8 billion in Iraq and Afghanistan every month.\n  That's why I just don't buy it when the administration says it has no \nidea what it might cost to finance ongoing military operations. It is \nan open secret that the Defense Department is well able to produce an \nestimate of the cost of its operations. The only problem is that \nCongress has been continually stiff-armed in our attempts to learn \nabout those estimates.\n  I have also heard time and again that the United States never budgets \nfor the cost of wars in advance. That is just not true. The \nCongressional Research Service does state that ``since 1990, Congress \ngenerally has funded combat operations with supplemental \nappropriations.'' However, the Congressional Research Service also \nconcludes that as military operations become more predictable, such as \nin peacekeeping operations, Congress begins to fund those operations by \na combination of regular budget appropriations and supplemental \nappropriations and, eventually, by regular appropriations alone.\n  Aside from the last decade, there is a long history of Presidents \nrequesting funds in regular appropriations bills for ongoing military \noperations. CRS has reported that President Roosevelt requested regular \nappropriations for the conduct of World War II in fiscal years 1943, \n1944, 1945, and 1946. Presidents Johnson and Nixon received funding for \nthe Vietnam War in every Defense Appropriations Act from fiscal year \n1966 through 1973. In fact, there were no supplemental appropriations \nbills for the Vietnam War after 1969.\n  Even in more modern times, ongoing military operations in Bosnia, \nKosovo, and the patrol of the no-fly zones over Iraq were made part of \nthe regular budget and appropriations process. The amendment that I \noffer to urge the President to budget for the wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan isn't a break with how our government pays for wars. My \namendment says that the President should stick with historical \nprecedent and fiscal responsibility in budgeting for the wars that we \nare now in.\n  The amendment that I offer today is precisely the same amendment that \nI offered to last year's Defense Appropriations bill, which was \nsupported by 81 Senators. The amendment simply states the sense of the \nSenate that the President should request funds for ongoing military \noperations in his regular budget request, and that such funds should be \nappropriated in regular accounts.\n  The administration's practice for paying for the ongoing wars in Iraq \nand Afghanistan must change. This week, Deputy Defense Secretary \nWolfowitz acknowledged to a House committee that our troops could be in \nIraq for years to come. If that is true--and I hope that it is not--now \nis the time for Congress to get serious about making the President \nfigure out a budget plan for paying for the massive cost of a long-term \nmilitary presence in Iraq.\n  The alternative is to continue with the current administration \npolicy: more last minute spending requests, more reports that our \ntroops are running out of money, and more deficit spending. This is a \nrecipe for a fiscal disaster. Current White House policy on paying for \nthe war perpetuates an ongoing budgetary crisis for our troops \noverseas: rather than planing for their needs, we force our troops to \nbounce from one stop-gap spending measure to another. This is just \nplain wrong.\n  Congress should not allow itself to be streamrolled. It should not \nallow the President to send up an emergency supplemental, and then \ndemand immediate action by the Congress. That is now mistakes are made. \nLast year, the President failed to request sufficient funds for body \narmor for our troops. Last year, the President failed to request \nsufficient funds for armor for Humvees. Last year, the President failed \nto request sufficient funds for locating and destroying conventional \nweapons in Iraq. Now all Americans know what tragic mistakes those \nwere. Congress must insist on receiving a detailed budget request for \nthe wars in Iraq and Afghanistan so that mistakes like those are not \nrepeated.\n  The Byrd amendment tells the President that he should budget for the \nwars in Iraq and Afghanistan. This is a simple, common-sense approach \nthat promotes fiscal responsibility. The Senate already endorsed this \napproach last year in an overwhelming vote, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport my amendment again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we would be pleased to recommend the \nadoption of the amendment offered by Senator Byrd. I believe, if he \nwould permit, we would be willing to adopt it on a voice vote. It was \nadopted last year, the same amendment, as the Senator said, by a \nsubstantial number of Senators. We see no reason not to support the \namendment this year. If the Senator wishes to offer it, we would be \npleased to have it.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished friend. I really \nwish to have a rollcall vote on this amendment. It was a very popular \namendment last year. I thank the distinguished chairman for his \nwillingness to proceed on a voice vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We would be happy to have a vote, but could we agree to \na later time? There are a series of Senators in committee meetings \nright now, and they asked not to be disturbed for at least another half \nhour.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Could we ask for the yeas and nays and have a time \nagreed upon between yourself and the two managers of the bill?\n  Mr. BYRD. That would be very satisfactory.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent that it be in order to request \nthe yeas and nays on this amendment at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The yeas and nays are ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nBiden, Corzine, and Feingold be added as original cosponsors of \namendment No. 3493.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, for Members of the Senate, we are very \nclose to the end of the amendments that we know of, and we would \nprobably be proceeding to third reading after the Byrd amendment, \nunless Members come forward and offer their amendments.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3503\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have an amendment from the two Senators \nfrom Mississippi, Senators Lott and Cochran. I ask that it be presented \nto the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Improving the \nalready-high quality of training is one of the Committee's highest \npriorities and, of course, this includes the Navy's training and \nleadership programs.

Mr. President, the Republican manager, the chairman of the \ncommittee, suggested that I move forward with my amendment, which will \nnot take long at all. I can do this in less than 5 minutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3520\n\n  Mr. President, I send my amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Biden] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3520.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To appropriate funds for bilateral economic assistance)\n\n       On page 118, between lines 4 and 5, insert the following:\n\n                                TITLE X\n\n                     BILATERAL ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE\n\n                  FUNDS APPROPRIATED TO THE PRESIDENT\n\n           United States Agency for International Development\n\n              International Disaster and Famine Assistance\n\n       For an additional amount for ``International Disaster and \n     Famine Assistance'', $188,000,000, to remain available until \n     expended: Provided, That funds appropriated by this paragraph \n     shall be available to respond to the humanitarian crisis in \n     the Darfur region of Sudan and in Chad: Provided further, \n     That such amount is designated as an emergency requirement \n     pursuant to section 502 of H. Con. Res. 95 (108th Congress).\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I know it is getting late in this process, \nand I will try to make this as quick as possible. There has already \nbeen a significant amount of discussion on this floor, in this town, \nand actually, quite frankly, this morning in the meetings some of us \nhad with the President of the United States on the situation in Darfur \nin the Sudan.\n  I want to begin by saying I respect the effort made by my friend, \nSenator DeWine. I understand the managers are going to accept a \nproposal for $90 million or thereabouts to deal with this problem. \nThere are already as many as 30,000 dead. Mr. President, 1.2 million \npeople have been chased from their homes, and 200,000 refugees have \nfled to Chad. The civilians have been bombed from planes and \nhelicopters by the Government of Sudan. And there are continued reports \nof systematic rape, murder, and torture by the Sudanese Government as \nwell as by allied militia troops.\n  Now, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights issued a report in \nwhich the U.N. investigators indicate they believe that crimes against \nhumanity have been committed in Darfur.\n  Secretary of State Colin Powell has said that the State Department is \ncontemplating whether Khartoum is engaged in the genocide. I think when \nthey, in fact, finish they will conclude clearly that it is.\n  The Agency for International Development and its leader, Andrew \nNatsios, as well as U.N. officials, have said that what has happened in \nDarfur is the ``worst humanitarian crisis in the world today.''\n  They point out that under the best circumstances--not the worst, the \nbest circumstances--according to Mr. Natsios, 320,000 people will die. \nThat is the best they hope for. If everything turns around, there are \ngoing to be 320,000 dead. And he made that public statement on June 3. \nHe said ``more resources are desperately needed.''\n  Now, to have to respond in a manner that is commensurate with the \nsuffering seems to me to be our obligation. The President of the United\n\n[[Page S7378]]\n\nStates said he brought this to the attention of the G-8. We had this \ndiscussion this morning in the Cabinet Room, and he, quite frankly, \nindicated that he was not getting the kind of response that was \nwarranted. Some of us suggested--and I was not one because others spoke \nfirst--that this is of an urgent need, and we have to lead.\n  Now, I know that my friend from Ohio has called our attention to this \nand, in fact, has gotten roughly $90 million appropriated or agreed to. \nBut the fact is, Mr. Natsios pledged, in Geneva, in the first week in \nJune, that the United States would come up with $188 million. That is \nthe pledge this administration made in Geneva in June.\n  Now, the reason I bother to mention that is, the President pointed \nout this morning that the G-8 nations and the rest of the world do not \nseem seized with the same sense of urgency as we are, and that we have \nto lead.\n  If we have announced we are going to do $188 million, and we are \ntrying to get the rest of the world in on the deal, and then we come \nout of here with less than half of that, it seems to me it undercuts \nthe very point that is trying to be made by the President of the United \nStates.\n  Now, I am not speaking for the President and implying that he is for \nor against this $188 million. I do not know. I assume he must have been \nfor it or the head of his AID, under his administration, would not have \npledged $188 million.\n\n  Now, this is $188 million as emergency money in this fiscal year. \nMost of the money Natsios pledged was 2005 money that has yet to be \nappropriated. In other words, he pledged money he does not have and may \nnot get for quite some time for what he calls the ``worst humanitarian \ncrisis in the world today,'' where, if things go well, 320,000 will \ndie.\n  The House bill gives less than half the money, only $70 million. I \nunderstand that--again, I am not being critical of my friend from Ohio, \nbut as he said to me, he got what he could. That is good. It is better \nthan nothing.\n  But keep in mind, the $188 million pledge was made, according to AID \nofficials, in advance of the U.N.--in advance of the U.N.--issuing the \nrevised numbers about how many people will be affected. Those numbers \nhave increased.\n  So the House bill provides less than half of what might be an \ninadequate pledge to begin with.\n  I was asked not to offer this amendment because we give about half. \nApparently that is going to be agreed to by the managers. But the \nSenate has the power to do a lot more than that. So let's give the \nadministration what it said it will need to provide an emergency \nresponse in Darfur. If we do not, make no mistake about it, no one else \nis going to step to the plate.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield for a request?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be added as \na cosponsor. This is a good amendment.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my friend from \nVermont, Senator Leahy, be added as a cosponsor of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I might add, this is an unusual position to \nbe in. I do not usually come to the floor on matters and try to lead an \ninitiative on which I am not the guy who has done the most work. I have \nnot done the most work on it. There are others, including Senator Leahy \nand others, who have been out in front on this issue. But I do not want \nto see us go through this wrap-up without us actually facing up to the \nfacts.\n  Let's know what we are doing. Mr. President, $90 million is better \nthan nothing, but it is not the $188 million, which is probably too \nlittle anyway, that we already pledged. I am worried about the impact \nthat will have on the rest of the world as we try to generate support \nbecause we need support.\n  Now, look, our former colleague, Senator Danforth, who we just \nconfirmed today, played a leading role in the Sudan in helping settle \none of the real difficult issues, which was the north-south \nproblem. Now we have an east-west problem.\n\n  The fact is, he got the international community to step up and come \nforward in order to deal with this incredibly humanitarian crisis. It \nseems to me that notwithstanding the fact Mr. Natsios was forced to \nmake the pledge for money to get the first piece done, the north-south \npiece, it is not going to inspire any contributions from our partners \nand donor communities. The Congress has to provide these emergency \nfunds. This money will not stop the attacks. It will not do all we need \nto do. But it will give essential assistance to the victims of \nKhartoum's atrocities.\n  How many times have we stood around this floor, those who have been \nhere for the better part of the last decade, and lamented our failure \nto act in the last catastrophic African crisis with the Hutus and the \nTutsis? How many times have we talked about it? Bill Clinton writes \nabout it: We wish we had done more. President Bush talks about it.\n  Let's not do this. Let's not step back. Let's not be here 5 years \nfrom now, 10 years from now saying: If we only had acted.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. At the \nappropriate time, I will ask for the yeas and nays. The chairman of the \ncommittee indicated he had a very important commitment that required \nhim to be off the floor but wanted me to make my statement and get it \nmoved on. I will not engage in anymore debate on this issue.\n  At the appropriate time, when the chairman or whoever is going to \nrespond to this amendment makes that response, I am ready for a vote.\n  In the meantime, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3520, As Modified\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am going to send a modification to the \ndesk in a moment. I will take 60 seconds to explain it. My staff had \ndrafted the amendment for $188 million, which was a pledge by Mr. \nNatsios, before Mr. DeWine's $90 million was accepted. So I am not \nasking for $188 million on top of that. The amendment I am sending to \nthe desk asks for an additional $118 million above the 90 which, in \nfact, apparently the committee has already accepted.\n  So I send a modification to the desk and ask unanimous consent that \nthe amendment be so modified to say $118 million instead of $188 \nmillion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To appropriate funds for bilateral economic assistance)\n\n       On page 118, between lines 4 and 5, insert the following:\n\n                                TITLE X\n\n                     BILATERAL ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE\n\n                  FUNDS APPROPRIATED TO THE PRESIDENT\n\n           United States Agency for International Development\n\n              International Disaster and Famine Assistance\n\n       For an additional amount for ``International Disaster and \n     Famine Assistance'', $118,000,000, to remain available until \n     expended: Provided, That funds appropriated by this paragraph \n     shall be available to respond to the humanitarian crisis in \n     the Darfur region of Sudan and in Chad: Provided further, \n     That such amount is designated as an emergency requirement \n     pursuant to section 502 of H. Con. Res. 95 (108th Congress).\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Chair and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask that I be permitted 15 minutes to \nspeak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Akaka are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S7379]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask that this amendment be temporarily \nset aside so I can take care of some amendments we are prepared to \noffer. We will come right back to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3522\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Of the amount appropriated by title III under \n     the heading ``Aircraft Procurement, Air Force'', up to \n     $7,000,000 may be available for F-16 Theater Airborne \n     Reconnaissance System upgrades.\n  Mr. STEVENS. This earmarks up to $7 million for a project the Senator \nsupports from funds available within the bill. It does not increase \nfunds. I ask for its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3540) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nBurns be added as an original cosponsor of amendment 3490.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3541\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of Senator \nKohl, which relates to authorizing the reprogramming of funds available \nto the Secretary for industrial technical services and ask that it be \nconsidered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for Mr. Kohl, for \n     himself, and Mr. Reed, proposes an amendment numbered 3541.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To ensure the availability of sufficient fiscal year 2004 \n  funding for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership program of the \n            National Institute of Standards and Technology)\n\n       On page 112, between lines 13 and 14, insert the following:\n       Sec. 8121. For the purposes of applying sections 204 and \n     605 of the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the \n     Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2004 \n     (division B of Public Law 108-199) to matters in title II of \n     such Act under the heading ``National Institute of Standards \n     and Technology'' (118 Stat. 69), in the account under the \n     heading ``industrial technology services'', the Secretary of \n     Commerce shall make all determinations based on the \n     Industrial Technology Services funding level of $218,782,000 \n     for reprogramming and transferring of funds for the \n     Manufacturing Extension Partnership program and may submit \n     such a reprogramming or transfer, as the case may be, to the \n     appropriate committees within 30 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3541) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3520, as Modified\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, with the exception of two items we may \nreceive, that is the last of the amendments that have been called to \nour attention. I would inquire whether it would be in order for the \nmanagers of the respective sides of the aisle to return to the Biden \namendment now and ask for a vote on the Biden amendment.\n  Is there any impediment to having a vote now, may I inquire of staff?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Is the amendment now pending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Today, the Senate approved $70 million for disaster \nassistance and $25 million for refugee assistance, a total of $95 \nmillion to Sudan. This is an amount the House approved and the level \nthe State Department informed our staff was necessary to carry the much \nneeded food and other support for Darfur through spring of next year. \nThis is the amount they efficiently execute and use in this year. In \nthe spring, the State Department, with USAID and the U.N., will \nreassess the situation and determine if additional emergency funds are \nrequested.\n  We have already declared an emergency for Sudan for $95 million. If \nwe approved Senator Biden's amendment, this will be above the $188 \nmillion that State and USAID have already pledged for the 2005 funds. \nThese funds will be allocated in the 2005 Foreign Operations bill, not \nthis bill. In other words, we have added $95 million for disaster \nassistance from this Defense appropriations bill on an emergency basis \nto the Sudan. There already are requests before our Appropriations \nCommittee under the Foreign Operations bill, a request for $188 \nmillion, which will come before the Senate in due course.\n  It is my request to our colleagues to stand by the $95 million we \nhave added to the disaster assistance and refugee assistance provisions \nof our basic funding for the State Department. We have added to it \nalready in the Defense bill. We approved that today. That is the amount \nthat is in the House bill, and I do not believe we should go beyond the \nemergency level we have already agreed to, which was supported by both \nof our leaders.\n  I point out further that the U.N. appeal for Darfur for 2004 has led \nto $307 million as of June 3 of this year. That is now being revised \nupward to an estimated $349 million available. Excluding the U.S. \nGovernment, other donors pledged $134 million in Geneva. The U.S. \nGovernment pledge was for the remainder of fiscal year 2004 and 2005, \nand we have already exceeded that pledge. There is $245 million pledged \nfrom all the above donors, in addition to the contribution of the \nUnited States.\n  We have an enormous program going on on behalf of our Government. We \nhave added $95 million to the $188 million. We are already ahead of the \nrest of the world, and we think we should not go further on this bill. \nIf there are further emergency funds that are necessary, they should be \nadded to the foreign assistance bill or the State Department bill when \nthose bills come before the Senate but not to the Defense bill. This \nDefense bill is already amended at the request of both the majority \nleader and minority leader, the Senator from Ohio, and many others, to \nadd $95 million. It is my position that we should not go further at \nthis time. We should wait for the consideration of the other bills as \nfar as additional emergency funds, if they are needed.\n\n  These funds cannot be needed before we will consider the supplemental \nafter the first of 2005. Besides that, we still have to consider the \n2005 regular bill for both State-Justice-Commerce and the foreign \nassistance bill. This is no place for this item. It is not an emergency \nto go beyond $95 million.\n  Does the Senator from Hawaii wish to make any statement?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I wish to associate myself with the statement of the \nSenator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to table the Biden amendment, and \nI ask that we have a time for other Senators to become aware of the \nfact that we will have a vote. I ask unanimous consent that the vote \ncommence at 5:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent that it be in order at this time \nfor me to have the yeas and nays on my motion to table this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3542\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have been informed there is another \namendment that has been cleared. This is an amendment on behalf of \nSenator DeWine, pertaining to a report on mental health services \navailable to the armed services. I ask this amendment be considered at \nthis time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I beg the indulgence of the Chair. If \nI may, on rollcall No. 148, I voted ``aye''. It was my intention to \nvote ``nay''. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to \nchange my vote since it will not affect the outcome.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The foregoing tally has been changed to reflect the above order.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nBurns be removed as a cosponsor of amendment No. 3490.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have a list of the members of the \nsubcommittee staff for the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee who have \nworked so hard on this bill. So often, Senator Inouye and I as the \ncochairmen of the committee get credit for what is done, but I think we \nhave the hardest working staff in the Congress. They have done an \nadmirable job, and we have a fair and balanced bipartisan bill. I ask \nunanimous consent that the list of their names be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       Defense Subcommittee Staff\n\n       Charlie Houy, Betsy Schmid, Nicole Diresta, Kraig Siracuse, \n     Tom Hawkins, Alycia Farrell, Lesley Kalan, Jennifer \n     Chartrand, Brian Wilson, Brian Potts, Kate Kaufer, Mazie \n     Mattson, Janelle Treon, Steve Wacakaski, Bob Henke, and Sid \n     Ashworth.\n\n\n                   funding embassy-baghdad operations\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. I understand the State Department expects to fund the \nEmbassy-Baghdad operations using emergency spending in Fiscal Year \n2005. It is also my understanding that Senate Appropriations Committee \nagrees with the State Department on this issue.\n  The House version of the Fiscal Year 2005 Defense Appropriations bill \nincludes $665 million in emergency spending for the Department of State \nto fund Embassy-Baghdad operations, IT costs, logistical support, and \nsecurity requirements. Chairman Stevens and Senator Gregg, and I \nunderstand that the Senate Defense Appropriations Committee will accept \nthe House position on funding Embassy-Baghdad operations, IT costs, \nlogistical support, and security requirements during the upcoming \nconference. I appreciate the support from Chairman Stevens and Senator \nGregg on this matter.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I agree with the Senator from Nebraska. The State \nDepartment has traditionally administered the funds necessary for \nembassy operations. Although the Senate bill does not allocate the \nfunds to the State Department, we will do our most to support the House \nlanguage in conference on this matter to ensure the State Department \nretains the authority to obligate the subject funds.\n  Mr. GREGG. I agree with Chairman Stevens. We will do our most to \nsupport the House language. We are both aware of the significant \nfunding needs the State Department is facing in the construction of a \nU.S. Embassy in Baghdad. I hope the Secretary of State will act \nexpeditiously to address this funding need.\n\n\n                         RAPID equipping force\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I commend the chairman and the committee \nstaff for their outstanding work in bringing this legislation to the \nSenate for consideration.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator for his kind comments.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I note that the committee included funding in the \nDefense Appropriations bill to address the threat of Improvised \nExplosive Devices, IEDs, in the Iraq theater. Specifically, I am \nreferring to the inclusion in Title IX of the bill which appropriates \n$25,000,000 for a force protection initiative using the Rapid Equipping \nForce concept.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. It is my understanding that the money is to be used to \nhelp our deployed soldiers fight the current IED threat that we hear so \nmuch about in the war in Iraq.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is the purpose of the appropriation.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Would this money also be used to address the force \nprotection issues of counter-fire and detection techniques that exist \nin the technology base, such as sensor technologies that have \ndemonstrated real-time detection, classification and location of enemy \nfire?\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator's understanding is correct. These funds are \nalso envisioned to be used for these types of force protection \ninitiatives.\n\n[[Page S7385]]\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Senator for his clarification of this issue.\n\n\n                      m1a2 sep tank modernization\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nthank Chairman Stevens for his leadership in ensuring the rapid \nmodernization of our land combat forces both in the FY 2005 Defense \nAppropriations bill as well as the Contingent Emergency Reserve Fund. I \nwould also like to take a moment to address the urgent need to fund \ncontinued modernization of the M1 Abrams main battle tank fleet.\n  It is encouraging that this Committee has taken a leadership role in \nresourcing the modernization of the Army's armored forces with the M1A2 \nSEP tank, the most modern battle tank in the world. As proven in its \ndeployment to Iraq, the M1A2 SEP is designed for decisive combat and \nnet-centric warfare; indeed, it represents a revolution in armored \nwarfare. Is the Chairman aware of the capabilities afforded by the M1A2 \nSEP tank?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am aware of the M1A2 SEP and its capabilities.\n  Mr. SPECTER. We have encouraged the Army to pure fleet its first-to-\nfight armored units with M1A2 SEP tanks primarily to ensure \noverwhelming lethality and survivability but also to reduce the \nlogistics burden on our soldiers. However, it has come to my attention \nthat the Army does not intend to pure fleet its armored forces with \nM1A2 SEP tanks. In fact, under the Army's current plan, the 3rd \nInfantry Division--which spearheaded Operation Iraqi Freedom--will \ncontinue to cope with M1A1 tanks that were produced 20 years ago. Is \nthe Chairman aware of this fact?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Senator. I would also point out that 3rd \nInfantry Division is the first division to transform to a new force \nstructure the Army calls modularity and also is likely to be called \nupon to return to Iraq within the next year. It strikes me as ironic \nthat the Army's premier armored unit lacks the combat punch and network \ncapability of the rest of the Army's major armored forces. Finally, \nthere is the issue of the tank industrial base. In the next few months, \nthe last Abrams Upgrade tank will roll off the production line, \nrepresenting the end of significant tank work in this country. In late \n2006, the last M1A2 SEP Retrofit tank--a less complex upgrade--will be \nproduced for the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment. Absent funding in FY \n2005 for continued tank production, the U.S. tank industrial base will \ncease to exist. We ignore the implications of this action at our own \nperil.\n  Mr. President, I urge the Chairman to consider the modernization of \nthe 3rd Infantry Division with M1A2 SEP tanks.\n\n\n                      future tactical truck system\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today we have before us S. 2559, the Fiscal \nYear 2005 Defense Appropriation bill. Included in this bill is \nimportant funding for a variety of tactical wheeled vehicle programs \nincluding the Future Tactical Truck System, FTTS. FTTS is an important \nprogram supported by the Army's National Automotive Center that will \ndevelop technologies that can increase the range, durability and \nsurvivability of our military tactical wheeled vehicle fleet. These \nadvances will ensure that as the Army transforms itself it will have a \ntechnologically advanced tactical wheeled vehicle fleet that can best \nmeet our Nation's security needs. I would ask my good friend, the \nChairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, if he is aware of this \nimportant program?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I join my good friend from Michigan in \nhis support for this program and the National Automotive Center. I \nunderstand the Army and the Office of the Secretary of Defense have \nconfirmed that the FTTS program is on track and possesses a transition \npathway that will enable the insertion of new technologies into the \nArmy's tactical wheeled vehicle fleet. These technologies will enable \nthe Army to field a lighter, more mobile and more effective fighting \nforce.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend from Alaska, and agree with his \ncharacterization. I believe that this program is making important \ntechnical advances that will greatly benefit the Army. I am \nparticularly appreciative of the committee's recommendation to increase \nthe investment in the Army's Heavy Tactical Vehicles program, in order \nto support the transition of these types of technologies into Army \nsystems, consistent with the Army's Tactical Wheeled Vehicle Strategy. \nHowever, I am concerned that the bill we are considering this program \nby $5 million. Such a cut would undermine this program and hinder \nefforts to further develop revoluntary technologies while defining the \nfuture scope of this program.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I concur with the Senator from Michigan. This is an \nimportant program, and I support investing in the FTTS science and \ntechnology efforts at the National Automotive Center at the level \nrequested by the President. I assure him that I will work in conference \nto fund this program at the President's Budget request.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the distinguished Chairman for this support.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, the Department of Defense appropriations \nbill for FY 2005, S. 2259, as reported by the Senate Committee on \nAppropriations, provides $384.012 billion in budget authority and \n$401.785 billion in outlays in FY 2005 for the Department of Defense. \nOf these totals, $239 million is for mandatory programs in FY 2005.\n  Additionally, the bill provides $7.158 billion in budget authority \nand $7.054 billion in outlays in FY 2005, which are designated as \nemergency requirements.\n  The bill further provides $25 billion in budget authority in FY 2004, \nwhich is also designated as an emergency requirement. This budget \nauthority generated $18.798 billion in outlays in FY 2005.\n  The bill provides total discretionary budget authority in FY 2005, \nincluding emergencies, of $390.931 billion. This amount is $1.684 \nbillion less than the President's request and equal to the 302(b) \nallocation adopted by the House of Representatives.\n  I commend the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee \nfor bringing this legislation before the Senate, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that a table displaying the Budget committee scoring of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                S. 2559, 2005 DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS--SPENDING COMPARISONS--SENATE-REPORTED BILL\n                                         [Fiscal year 2005, $ millions]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                      General\n                                                                      purpose        Mandatory         Total\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill: \\1\\\n    Budget authority............................................         383,773             239         384,012\n    Outlays.....................................................         401,546             239         401,785\nHouse 302(b) allocation: \\2\\\n    Budget authority............................................         390,931             239         391,170\n    Outlays.....................................................         415,987             239         416,226\n2004 enacted:\n    Budget authority............................................         431,218             226         431,444\n    Outlays.....................................................         423,935             226         424,161\nPresident's request:\n    Budget authority............................................         392,615             239         392,854\n    Outlays.....................................................         418,639             239         418,878\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                Senate-Reported bill compared to:\nHouse 302(b) allocation:\n    Budget authority............................................          -7,158               0          -7,158\n    Outlays.....................................................         -14,441               0         -14,441\n2004 enacted:\n    Budget authority............................................         -47,445              13         -47,432\n\n[[Page S7386]]\n\n \n    Outlays.....................................................         -22,389              13         -22,376\nPresident's request:\n    Budget authority............................................          -8,842               0          -8,842\n    Outlays.....................................................         -17,093               0         -17,093\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

Mr. President, breast cancer is the second leading cause \nof cancer death in the United States today, and about 40,000 women will \ndie from the disease this year. It is important that we maintain \nfunding in 2005 for the Department of Defense's Breast Cancer Peer \nReviewed Research Program.\n  The program has funded groundbreaking research, including the \ndiscovery of the drug Herceptin, which prolongs the lives of women with \na particularly aggressive type of advanced breast cancer. This drug \ncould not have been developed without research that was funded in part \nby the DOD Breast Cancer Research Program. This is a program, I should \nadd, in which 90 percent of the funds go directly to research.\n  An overwhelming, bipartisan majority in the Senate supports this \nprogram every year. This year 66 Senators signed a letter to \nappropriators urging the continuation of the DOD Breast Cancer Peer \nReviewed Research Program earmark at a funding level of $150 million \nfor FY '05.\n  Mr. President, as we proceed to conference on the Department of \nDefense Appropriations bill, I urge my colleagues to maintain this \nlevel of funding for breast cancer research.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to bring attention to an \nimportant program that could be facing fiscal shortfalls if we do not \nmake necessary corrections. I am referring to my support for the \nDepartment of Defense Peer-Reviewed Breast Cancer Research Program. \nThis program is a proven success and I support a $150 million earmark \nfor the DOD Peer Reviewed Breast Cancer Research Program for fiscal \nyear 2005.\n  The American Cancer Society estimates that in 2004 there will be \n668,470 women diagnosed with cancer. Of this overall estimate of cases, \n32 percent will be breast cancer. The 2004 estimated deaths from breast \ncancer will be 15 percent. These statistics only reemphasize the \nimportance of cancer research, and our continued need to fund efforts \nthat will ultimately eliminate the number of deaths from breast cancer.\n  Department of Defense Peer-Reviewed Breast Cancer Research Program is \na one-of-a-kind research program that uses an innovative grants \nstructure which brings scientists and consumers together to make key \npolicy decisions about breast cancer research. Since its inception 12 \nyears ago, this far-reaching, influential program has literally changed \nthe way breast cancer research is done. The program has funded \ngroundbreaking research, including the discovery of the drug Herceptin, \nwhich prolongs the lives of women with a particularly aggressive type \nof advanced breast cancer. This drug could not have been developed \nwithout research that was funded in part by the DOD Peer Reviewed \nBreast Cancer Research Program. New approaches and innovations in \nresearch, such as these, are the keys to finding a cure.\n  Not only is this program on the cutting edge of breast cancer \nresearch, but also is extremely streamlined. Every penny spent by this \nprogram and the researchers who receive funding are accounted for at a \npublic meeting every 2 years. Ninety percent of the funds go directly \nto research and only 10 percent are used for administrative costs. I \napplaud this type of fiscal efficiency and hope that more research \nprograms will be able to learn from the structure of this program.\n  An overwhelming, bipartisan majority in the Senate supports this \nprogram every year. This year, 66 Senators, including myself, signed a \nletter addressed to the Senate Appropriations Committee urging the \ncontinuation of the DOD Breast Cancer Peer Review Research Program \nearmark with level funding of $150 million for FY '05.\n  Unfortunately, the language in the Senate Department of Defense \nAppropriations Act for fiscal year 2005 threatens the funding and \nunique structure of the Breast Cancer Peer Reviewed Research Program. \nThe Senate bill combines all of the congressionally directed cancer \nresearch programs into one account and reduces the total funding \navailable to all.\n  As written, the Senate bill seriously threatens the integrity of the \nDOD breast cancer research program and will dismantle its one-of-a-kind \npeer review process involving patients and consumers that makes the \nprogram so successful and unique. The proposal will force cancer groups \nto compete with one another for reduced funding. And, a particularly \ndangerous component of the proposal is that it transfers funding to \nother cancer projects that are not recommended by a scientific peer \nreviewed process.\n  Mr. President, we cannot afford to cut any cancer research programs, \nespecially when the President's budget is planning to only increase the \nNational Institutes of Health by $728 million, and increase the \nNational Cancer Institute budget by only $100 million, which both fall \nshort of previous years' requests. In addition the President's budget \ncuts funding to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by $408 \nmillion. This proves troublesome for CDC programs, such as the National \nBreast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program which assists in \nfunding State programs that help uninsured women undergo screenings for \nbreast and cervical cancer. These inadequate funding requests fall \ndrastically short of what the Institutes and CDC need in order to carry \nout their cancer research and assistance. This only reiterates why we \nmust preserve critical programs such as the Department of Defense Peer-\nReviewed Breast Cancer Research Program. I therefore call upon \nconferees to support the language passed in the House version of the \nFiscal Year 2005 Department of Defense Appropriations Act.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Department \nof Defense, DOD, Peer Reviewed Breast Cancer Research Program. Almost \n12 years ago, when I looked into the issue of breast cancer research, I \ndiscovered that barely $90 million in Federal funds was spent on breast \ncancer research. So I joined with Senator Alfonse D'Amato, R-NY, on \nlegislation to dedicate specific money from the DOD budget for breast \ncancer research. The legislation passed and overnight it doubled \nFederal funding for breast cancer research. Since then, funding for \nbreast cancer research has been included in the Defense Department \nbudget every year.\n  Unfortunately, the language in the Senate Department of Defense \nAppropriations Act for fiscal year 2005 threatens both the existing \nfunding and the current structure of the Breast Cancer Peer Reviewed \nResearch Program. The Senate bill combines all of the congressionally \ndirected cancer research programs into one account and then reduces the \ntotal funding available. This will inevitably lead to a major cut in \nfunding for this important program.\n  The DOD Peer Reviewed Breast Cancer Research Program has been an \nunqualified success in providing innovative approaches to breast cancer \nprevention, detection and treatment. Over the past several years, we \nhave made a great deal of progress against breast cancer, but there is \nstill a long way to go.\n\n[[Page S7387]]\n\n  More than 258,000 women are expected to be diagnosed with breast \ncancer and another 40,000 deaths are likely to result from this deadly \ncancer. Now is not the time to jeopardize a successful program that is \ncritical to winning the battle against breast cancer.\n  As the Department of Defense Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2005 \ngoes to conference, I plan to work to preserve the current structure \nand funding for this critical breast cancer research program. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the language passed in the House and support a \n$150 million earmark for the DOD Peer Reviewed Breast Cancer Research \nProgram for fiscal year 2005.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I support the Department of Defense, DoD, \nPeer-Reviewed Breast Cancer Research Program. This program is a proven \nsuccess and I support a $150 million earmark for the DoD Peer Reviewed \nBreast Cancer Research Program for fiscal year 2005.\n  This one-of-a-kind research program uses an innovative grants \nstructure that brings scientists and consumers together to make key \npolicy decisions about breast cancer research. Since its inception 12 \nyears ago, this far-reaching, influential program has literally changed \nthe way breast cancer research is done. It has become a model that \nother research programs have sought to replicate.\n  The program has funded groundbreaking research, including the \ndiscovery of the drug Herceptin, which prolongs the lives of women with \na particularly aggressive type of advanced breast cancer. This drug \ncould not have been developed without research that was funded in part \nby the DoD Breast Cancer Research Program.\n  Not only is this program on the cutting edge of breast cancer \nresearch, but also is extremely streamlined. Every penny spent by this \nprogram and the researchers who receive funding are accounted for at a \npublic meeting every 2 years. Ninety percent of the funds go directly \nto research and only 10 percent are used for administrative costs. This \nkind of efficiency and prudence in spending is unheard of in other \nfederally funding research programs.\n  An overwhelming, bipartisan majority in the Senate supports this \nprogram every year. This year, 66 Senators signed the letter addressed \nto appropriators urging the continuation of the DoD Breast Cancer Peer \nReview Research Program earmark with level funding of $150 million for \nfiscal year 2005.\n  Unfortunately, the language in the Senate Department of Defense \nAppropriations Act for fiscal year 2005 threatens the funding and \nunique structure of the Breast Cancer Peer Reviewed Research Program. \nThe Senate bill combines all of the congressionally Directed Cancer \nResearch Programs into one account and reduces the total funding \navailable to all.\n  Because the Senate version lumps all the cancer programs into one \npot, rather than maintaining separate earmarks, the proposal will have \nmultiple, negative outcomes. As written, the Senate bill seriously \nthreatens the integrity of the DoD breast cancer research program and \nwill dismantle its one-of-a-kind peer review process involving patients \nand consumers that makes the program so successful and unique. The \nproposal will force cancer groups to compete with one another for \nreduced funding. And, a particularly dangerous component of the \nproposal is that it transfers funding to other cancer projects that are \nnot recommended by a scientific peer reviewed process.\n  We should ensure that all of the DoD's cancer research programs are \nfully funded. These programs play a critical role in the development of \ntreatments and potential cures for cancer.\n  As the Department of Defense Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2005 \ngoes to conference, I urge my colleagues to support the language passed \nin the House and preserve this critical program for breast cancer \nresearch.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the tradition \nof line-item funding for cancer research programs in the Department of \nDefense, DOD, appropriations bill. This practice has been abandoned in \nthe fiscal year 2005 legislation before us now, and I fear that this \ncould do great damage to the advances in cancer treatment that our \nscientists are working so hard to achieve every day.\n  The DOD Peer-Reviewed Research Programs provide funding for critical, \nlife-saving research on breast cancer, prostate cancer, and ovarian \ncancer. Each of these is a devastating illness that challenges hundreds \nof thousands of new patients and their families every year. The Peer-\nReviewed Research Programs are essential to bringing these families \nhope and new opportunities in cancer treatments.\n  The prostate cancer research program uses an innovative grants \nstructure that brings scientists and consumers together to make key \npolicy decisions about prostate cancer research. Since its inception 8 \nyears ago, this far-reaching, influential program has literally changed \nthe way prostate cancer research is done. It has become a model that \nother research programs have sought to replicate.\n  In recent years, the DOD breast cancer program funded groundbreaking \nresearch, such as the discovery of the drug Herceptin, which prolongs \nthe lives of women with a particularly aggressive type of advanced \nbreast cancer. This drug could not have been developed without research \nthat was funded in part by the DOD breast cancer research program.\n  Like its counterparts for prostate cancer and breast cancer, the \nOvarian Cancer Research Project fosters collaborative efforts and long-\nterm institutional commitments to ovarian cancer research focusing on \nprevention and early detection, which are key to the development of a \nsustained commitment to ovarian cancer research.\n  Not only am I deeply disturbed by the cuts to these programs in the \nSenate bill, but it is my belief that given the Department of Defense's \nproven track record in conducting effective, efficient research to \ncombat cancers and find new cures, the Department's efforts should \ninstead be expanded to include desperately-needed research on other \nforms of the disease, including kidney cancer.\n  For a disease that has received very little research funding to date, \nkidney cancer affects a surprisingly large number of people. In 2003, \n36,000 new cases were diagnosed, an increase of 12 percent over the \nprevious year, while more than 12,000 individuals died of the disease. \nSupplementing current kidney cancer research funding with additional \nmoney from the Department of Defense would be a significant step toward \nproviding meaningful treatments for kidney cancer patients.\n  My colleagues on both sides of the aisle have shown broad support for \nthese programs in the past, urging the Senate to continue its support \nof each individual program. Many of us signed letters requesting that \neach program continue to receive at least the same amount of funding it \nreceived last year, which would have been consistent with the bill \npassed earlier this week by the House of Representatives.\n  The House language is not ideal. It funds each of the three Peer-\nReviewed Research Programs at last year's levels, ignoring inflation \nand the increased cost of research. However, the House provision is far \nsuperior to a Senate version that forces cancer research programs to \ncompete for a decreased amount of funding.\n  As the Department of Defense Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2005 \ngoes to conference, I urge my colleagues to support the language passed \nin the House and preserve the integrity of each of these critical Peer-\nReviewed Research Programs.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, as ranking democrat on the Committee \non Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I want to discuss two \namendments that were included in the Defense Department Fiscal Year \n2005 authorization bill, which passed yesterday. These amendments will \nensure that small businesses are included in the analysis of policies \nthat affect the procurement strategies or affect the technology and \nindustrial base of this Nation. Before I discuss these amendments, \nhowever, I would like to thank the committee's chair, Senator Olympia \nSnowe, for her leadership, and for working hand-in-hand with me on \nthese amendments that are vital to ensuring that small businesses \ncontinue to have a voice in the Federal procurement arena.\n  The Department of Defense is the largest purchaser of goods and \nservices\n\n[[Page S7388]]\n\nin the Federal Government. As a result, they are the driving force \nbehind Federal agencies' ability to meet the Government-wide small \nbusiness contracting goal of 23 percent. The Defense Authorization Act \nof 2004 included a provision requiring the administrator of the Office \nof Federal Procurement Policy, OFPP, to establish an advisory panel to \nreview the laws and regulations regarding the use of commercial \npractices, performance-based contracting, the performance of \nacquisition functions across agency lines, and the use of Government-\nwide acquisition contracts, also known as GWACS.\n  Many small businesses have contacted my office regarding the negative \nimpact these GWACS have been having on their ability to compete for \nFederal contracts. They are concerned that GWACS are being \ndisproportionately awarded to larger firms, denying small business \ntheir fair share of contracts. The amendment, offered by Senators \nSnowe, Coleman and myself, expands the authority of the advisory panel \nto include a report on the impact these tools have on small business \nconcerns. It also allows the panel to offer recommendations regarding \nlaws, regulations and policies they believe would afford small \nbusinesses increased opportunities to participate in the Federal \nprocurement arena.\n  With respect to the second amendment, I want to commend Senator Byrd \nfor taking the initiative to develop an amendment to ensure that small \nbusinesses have a voice with respect to Federal Government work on the \nfuture of the national technology and industrial base.\n  The DoD Authorization bill includes a provision establishing a \nCommission on the Future of the National Technology and Industrial \nBase. The duties of this 12-member, Presidentially-appointed commission \ninclude studying the issues associated with the future of the national \ntechnology and industrial base in the global economy. This study is \nparticularly important with respect to the effect of our national \ntechnology and industrial base on United States national security and \nfor assessing the future ability of meeting the objectives outlined in \nthe bill. This amendment adds a provision to the study that will \nrequire that the role of small business concerns in strengthening \nthe national technology and industrial base is incorporated in the \nreport, due no later than March 1, 2007.\n\n  Small businesses have proved time and time again that they can \nprovide the goods and services needed by the Federal Government, often \nmore efficiently and more cost effectively than their large \ncompetitors. Unfortunately, they are consistently treated as an \nafterthought or completely ignored when the Federal Government \nconsiders procurement policies outside of the Small Business \nAdministration. While the SBA is essential for providing access to \ncapital, training and counseling, and for assistance in gaining access \nto the Federal marketplace, the vast majority of contracts for goods \nand services come from other agencies, such as the Department of \nDefense.\n  Small businesses should be provided the greatest opportunity to \ncompete. When our national defense is in the process of regeneration \nand transitioning into a military of the future, as it is now, small \nbusinesses should be tapped to maximize the innovation, cost savings \nand efficiency they can contribute to the effort. Small businesses are \ncritical to maintaining and strengthening the overall economy of the \nNation and are the cornerstone of the Government's policy of ensuring a \ndiverse supplier base. They should be included when the Government is \ndeveloping industrial policy and considered in the analysis of policies \nthat affect the procurement strategies or affect the technology and \nindustrial base of this Nation. These amendments do just that. Again, I \nthank Senators Snowe and Byrd for their leadership and my colleagues \nfor their support for this Nation's small businesses. I would also like \nto thank Chairman Warner and my colleague on the Senate Committee on \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship, Senator Levin, the Ranking Member \nof the Senate Committee on Armed Services for working closely with us \nand for making these amendments a part of this legislation.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, it is well recognized that mail sent from \nfamilies and loved ones to U.S. forces based overseas has a tangible \neffect on troop morale. Concomitantly, mail that is delayed \nunnecessarily undermines morale and furthermore endangers the ability \nof absentee military voters to have their votes counted. Additionally, \nvoting assistance programs that are ineffective undermine the ability \nof the absentee military voter to cast a vote. In an effort to improve \nthese respective programs I have encouraged the Department of Defense \nto evaluate the effectiveness of the Military Postal Service Agency and \nthe Voting Assistance Program to determine if these programs are \nsufficient in scope to resolve the problems that have been identified \nrepeatedly in past reports and audits.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, late last night, after several weeks of \nfloor debate, the Senate completed action on the Defense Authorization \nAct. Both that legislation and the pending measure, S. 2559, the \nDefense Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2005, will enable us to make \ngreat strides towards providing our men and women in uniform with the \nequipment, benefits, and programs they need to carry out their critical \nmissions. I would like to applaud the efforts of both committees to \nensure that these brave men and women are provided for.\n  Even though it passed just last night, the Appropriations Committee \nworked to provide funding levels that are generally commensurate with \nthe authorization bill. This is very important, and it will enable us \nto continue to meet our obligations to support service members in the \nfight against terror. The bill includes many critical funding \nprovisions to which I lend strong support, such as the funding to \nincrease Army end strength by 20,000 soldiers.\n  Unfortunately, and not surprisingly, the bill also includes a large \nnumber of unauthorized and unrequested provisions. I hope that the \nsponsors will carefully reconsider these damaging provisions as the \nbill works its way through the legislative process. While I appreciate \nthe hard work and the laudable intentions of the members of the \nCommittee, we must all be alarmed at these appropriations earmarks. \nThey limit the ability of our Defense Department to expend needed \nresources according to its funding priorities.\n  With Americans deployed across the globe fighting terror, and with \nlooming budget deficits at home, the Senate faces some tough choices. \nWe must find a way to maintain our fiscal responsibility while fully \nproviding for our military needs. The costs that go along with the \nconflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq demand now, more than ever, a new \nfiscal sanity in approaching our appropriations bills. A half-a-\ntrillion dollar budget deficit means we simply cannot afford business \nas usual. We simply cannot continue the binge of pork barrel spending \nthat consumes an ever growing proportion of our Federal budget. While \nthe cost of an individual project may get lost in the fine print of \nlengthy bills, together, they all do real damage. Collectively, these \nearmarks significantly burden American taxpayers.\n  Not surprisingly, along with the growth in deficit spending over the \npast few years, there also has been a significant growth in earmarks \nand pork barrel spending. In fact, according to information compiled by \nthe Congressional Research Service, the total number of earmarks has \ngrown from 4,126 in Fiscal Year 1994 to 14,040 in FY 2004. That's an \nincrease of 240 percent in 10 years. In dollar terms, the earmarking \nhas risen from $26.6 billion to $47.9 billion over the same period.\n  Mr. President, based on the calculations of my office, the Fiscal \nYear 2002 Defense Appropriations Act contained $3.7 billion in pork. \nThe conference report to the Fiscal Year 2003 Defense Appropriations \nAct contained $8.1 billion in pork, while the Senate version included \n$5.2 billion. The Fiscal Year 2004 Senate-passed Defense Appropriations \nAct contained well over $4 billion of pork. This year $6.9 billion was \nadded in the bill and the report, a number which is much greater than \nlast year's Senate version of the legislation. This is real money. \nEvery year, countless important military and domestic programs go \nunfunded or underfunded. I find it hard to understand why we find the \nmoney to pay for member add ons, but then have to battle to fund \nimportant programs such as AmeriCorps.\n\n[[Page S7389]]\n\n  Projects that appear on the Defense Appropriations Member Add-ons \nList are items that are requested by Senators but were not included in \nthe President's budget request. They did not appear on the Joint \nChiefs' Unfunded Priority List, and they were not authorized in the \nDefense Authorization bill. These criteria have been useful in \nferreting out programs of questionable merit, and in determining the \nrelative priority of projects requested by members for strictly \nparochial reasons, often at the expense of the readiness of our armed \nforces. But, the fact remains that throughout the years in which I have \nbeen identifying these add-ons, no offsets have been provided for any \nproject. In a time when some of our soldiers and sailors still receive \nfood stamps, or live in inadequate housing, we somehow found a way to \nprovide over $4 billion in unnecessary spending to the Defense \nAppropriations bill. For example, the Joint Chiefs provided a list of \ncritical requirements above what was provided for in the President's \nBudget Request. That list totaled nearly $18 billion for fiscal year \n2005. We should provide additional funding for defense for items and \nprograms which the Joint Chiefs need, not for programs that are \nimportant because of the state that they come from or because of the \nseniority of the Member of Congress.\n  Mr. President, this is an election year and, once again, the members \nof the Appropriations Committee are touting their earmarks on their \nwebsites and in their press releases. One committee member listed \n$102.6 million in earmarks spread over 16 different projects, while \nanother member lauds funding for the Lewis and Clark Bicentennial. What \nis missing from these releases is the story about the authorized \nprograms that will not receive full funding because there is not enough \nmoney to go around. Wouldn't it be more responsible to spend this money \non pay raises or other important morale boosters instead of on \nparochial interests?\n  Earlier this week, I spoke at length on the Boeing 767 Tanker Lease \nProgram so I will not take up much more of the Senate's time again now, \nexcept to say, that the amendment that was passed by the Senate in the \nNational Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 is critical \nbecause Congressional guidance is needed. The Air Force's conduct on \nits Tanker Lease Program has, to date, been unacceptable. With regards \nto the Boeing 767 Tanker Lease Program, the Department of Defense and \nthe Air Force leadership have obfuscated, delayed, and withheld \ninformation from Congress and the taxpayers.\n  Equally as unacceptable, the Appropriations Committee added $110 \nmillion in this report in--a table, under the heading ``Tanker \nReplacement, Advance Procurement.'' There was no money for the tanker \nprogram in the President's defense budget submitted to Congress in \nFebruary. The Senate Armed Services Committee did not authorize any \nfunding for tanker recapitalization for fiscal year 2005. The Chief \nStaff of the Air Force, General John P. Jumper, USAF, did not request \nadvance procurement for tanker replacement in his ``Fiscal Year 2005 \nUnfunded Priority List,'' which he submitted to Congress in March 2005. \nThe reason is simple--tanker replacement money is not needed NOW.\n  This latest procurement earmark is disturbingly similar to the $30 \nbillion line item included in the Fiscal Year 2002 Defense \nAppropriations Act which gave rise to this entire controversy to begin \nwith. The Air Force's proposal to acquire 100 Boeing KC-767A tankers \nwas flawed from the beginning. Everything, including a complete \ninvestigation of possible Air Force misconduct, should be done to \nassure that this doesn't happen again.\n  Aspects of that deal, ranging from how the original proposal passed \nthrough Congress to the improper conduct of senior executives at the \nBoeing Company, have been exhaustively reviewed and fundamentally \ncriticized by the Senate Committee on Armed Services; the Senate \nCommittee on Commerce, Science and Transportation; the Department of \nJustice; the Defense Department's Office of the Inspector General; the \nDefense Science Board; the Congressional Budget Office; the General \nAccounting Office; the Congressional Research Service; the Office of \nManagement and Budget; the Defense Department's Office of Programs, \nAnalysis and Evaluation; the Institute for Defense Analyses; the \nIndustrial College of the Armed Forces, National Defense University and \nothers. Notably, White House Chief of Staff Andy Card and former \nDefense Department Comptroller General Dov Zakheim have also weighed in \nwith serious concerns about various aspects of the tanker program.\n  Critically, the Defense Science Board task force found ``there is no \ncompelling material or financial reason to initiate a replacement \nprogram prior to the completion of the Analysis of Alternatives, AoA, \nand the Mobility Capabilities Study, MCS.'' Moreover, the task force \nobserved that the Air Force overstated both the amount of corrosion \nthroughout the KC-135 fleet and the KC-135's operation and support cost \ngrowth. It also found that the KC-135E can fly to 2040. In other words, \nthe `dominating rationale' cited by the Air Force to Congress for \nhaving taxpayers pay billions of dollars more for leasing Boeing's KC-\n767A tankers than they would for buying them outright, has been \nconclusively shown to be without merit. The Air Force's representations \non this issue remains a matter of continuing investigative concern. The \nlikelihood that the analysis of alternatives, AOA, and mobility \ncapabilities study, MCS, if done properly, will recommend an \nacquisition method for these tankers now known to be wholly unsuitable \nhere, is probably minimal. So, the Secretary's decision appears fatal \nto at least the lease component of the proposal.\n  Now what matters is that the AOA and MCS are conducted properly and \nobjectively, and a new validated capabilities document, ORD, is \ncompleted that reflects, for the first time, the requirements of the \nwarfighter. The Air Force's conduct to date in this matter has been \negregious. The participation of the Air Force's FFRDC in the AOA is \nproblematic. RAND has recently been receiving as much as $50 million \nper year from the Air Force and apparently prejudged the AOA in a \nrecent report. Therefore, both should be disqualified from the process. \nThe process going forward will remain an issue of continuing interest \nto me.\n  The bottom line here is this. The amendment adopted in the Fiscal \nYear 2005 National Defense Authorization Act will do much to inject \nneeded sunlight on a program whose development has been largely \ninsulated from public scrutiny. The tanker amendment attempts to make \nsure that any effort by the Air Force to replace its fleet of tankers \nis done responsibly. We should expect no less from the Air Force.\n  Some of the egregious examples of Defense pork for FY 2005, either in \nthe bill or in the accompanying report, include:\n  Section 8063 of the General Provisions. The text states that, ``each \ncontract awarded by the Department of Defense during the current fiscal \nyear for construction or service performed in whole or in part in a \nState which is not contiguous with another State and has an \nunemployment rate in excess of the national average rate of \nunemployment as determined by the Secretary of Labor, shall include a \nprovision requiring the contractor to employ, for the purpose of \nperforming that portion of the contract in such State that is not \ncontiguous with another State, individuals who are residents of such \nState and who, in the case of any craft or trade, possess or would be \nable to acquire promptly the necessary skills.'' I am not making this \ntext up. Let's call a spade a spade. This provision directly protects \nthe jobs of only Hawaiians and Alaskans.\n  As previously mentioned, $1.8 million, for the Lewis and Clark \nBicentennial celebration. You don't need to have the exploration skills \nof Lewis and Clark to see that this is a path to higher deficits.\n  $120 million for the Advanced Procurement of F-15s. The Air Force has \ndecided to procure the F-22 to replace the F-15. Yet this earmark keeps \nthe F-15 production line open, so I question the necessity of the F-22 \nprocurement in the numbers of aircraft and at the funding levels \nrequested by the Air Force. Apparently we just decided to pay for both.\n  $1 million for the Center for Political Logic Devices. I am the first \none who would pay for logic if we could insert some into our political \nprocess, but this earmark won't do it.\n\n[[Page S7390]]\n\n  $11 million for the Chameleon Miniaturized Wireless System. \nChameleons change colors, but one thing does not change is the \nunrequested provisions in this bill.\n  $2 million for the Air Battle Captain program at the University of \nNorth Dakota. This provision sends students from West Point to North \nDakota for their flight lessons. Instead of letting flight schools \ncompete for the ability to train these cadets, we have earmarked their \ntraining to North Dakota. We are putting parochial interests over the \nnecessity to provide the best training possible for the best price to \nour Army cadets.\n  $6 million for the LISA inspector. Who is this Lisa, and why does it \ncost $6 million to inspect her?\n  $4 million dollars for Project Albert. Hey Hey Hey. Seems like Albert \ncould get pretty fat off all the pork in this bill.\n  $4 million for Hibernation Genomics. Looking around the Senate, I see \na few tired people, so maybe we a little hibernation is in order. But \nI'd prefer not to pay $4 million for it.\n  $5.5 million for the C-135 Improved Waste Removal System. We need to \nimprove the way we remove waste from this bill.\n  $700,000 for the United States Army Reserve Citizen Soldier Memorial \nPark.\n  Mr. President, I use humor in describing these earmarks, but the \ndamage they do is deadly serious. They pull money away from legitimate \nfunding priorities and they waste taxpayer dollars. Each year, many of \nthe same earmarks appear in appropriations legislation, and each year I \ncome to the floor and point them out to my colleagues. Some of the \nappropriators' perennial favorite projects include:\n\n  $5 million for the Smart Truck. This provision, which directly lines \nthe pockets of the auto industry in Detroit, is not exactly smart.\n  $10 million for the 21st Century Truck. This program has been around \nfor years and not once has the Department of Defense requested funding \nfor it. While I'm sure we all would love to jump into a truck that \ncould be in a James Bond movie, I'm not sure it is appropriate for the \nDepartment of Defense to pay for it.\n  $8.0 million for the New England Manufacturing Supply Chain. This is \nabove and beyond the $14 million earmarked for them over the last two \nyears.\n  $9 million for the Medical Free Electron Laser. The electrons might \nbe free, but the laser sure isn't. This project was developed by the \nscientists at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee. The budget \njustification used by the DoD in previous years spelled out the plan to \nhave this program funded through NIH by FY2003. Why hasn't this \nhappened yet?\n  $44 million for the Maui Space Surveillance System. Arizona is home \nto the Lowell Observatory. Why should we provide $44 million to Maui, \nwhen there are many observatories in the United States, such as Lowell, \nthat offer many of the same benefits as the Maui site?\n  $1 million for the Brown Tree Snakes. Once again, the brown tree \nsnake has slithered its way into our defense appropriation bill. I'm \nsure the snakes are annoying--maybe even frightening to children and \nadults alike, but this funding does not belong in the Defense \nAppropriations Act.\n  Mr. President, there are many earmarks that funnel dollars to worthy \nprograms, such as breast cancer research, but there is no compelling \nnational defense reason for these items to be on this piece of \nlegislation. This type of critical research should be funded through \nthe Labor/HHS Appropriations bill. Our soldiers and sailors need to be \nprovided with the best equipment, housing, and support possible. Scarce \ndefense dollars should be used for these defense purposes, not others. \nSome examples of these inappropriate earmarks include:\n  $200 million for Peer Reviewed Cancer Research Program.\n  $50 million Peer Reviewed Medical Research Program.\n  $25 million for Hawaii Federal Health Care Network.\n  $2.5 million for the Alaska Federal Health Care Network.\n  $5 million for Pacific Island Health Care Referral.\n  I could go on and on--and on and on and on--listing all of the \nexamples of pork in this legislation. We simply need to reassess our \npriorities.\n  This year's bill also includes a number of ``Buy America'' \nprovisions. For example, it prevents the foreign purchase of welded \nshipboard anchor and mooring chain four inches in diameter and under. \nAnother provision ensures that all carbon, alloy or steel plates are \nproduced in the United States. Whew. I know we'll sleep better at night \nknowing that all of our carbon plates are manufactured in the U.S. Yet \nanother section prohibits the Department of Defense from purchasing \nsupercomputers from a foreign source.\n  Mr. President, I continue to be very concerned about the potential \nimpact on readiness of our restrictive trade policies with our allies. \nEvery year, Buy America restrictions cost the Department of Defense and \nthe American taxpayers $5.5 billion. From a philosophical point of \nview, I oppose these types of protectionist policies, and from an \neconomic point of view they are ludicrous. Free trade is both an \nimportant element in improving relations among nations and essential to \neconomic growth. From a practical standpoint, ``Buy America'' \nrestrictions could seriously impair our ability to compete freely in \ninternational markets and also could result in the loss of existing \nbusiness from long-standing trade partners.\n  Some legislative enactments over the past several years have had the \neffect of establishing a monopoly for a domestic supplier in certain \nproduct lines. This not only adds to the pressure for our allies to \n``Buy European'' but it also raises the costs of procurement for DoD, \nand cuts off access to potential state-of-the-art technologies. In \norder to maintain our troop strength and force readiness, the DoD must \nbe able to be equipped with the best technologies available, regardless \nof country of origin. This would ensure both price and product \ncompetition.\n  Defense exports improve interoperability with friendly forces--\nincreasingly necessary as we operate in coalition warfare and \npeacekeeping missions. These exports also increase our influence over \nrecipient country actions, and, in a worse case scenario, allow the \nU.S. to terminate them. Exports lower the unit costs of systems to the \nU.S. military, and provide the same economic benefits to the U.S. as \nall other exports--well paying jobs, improved balance of trade, and \nincreased tax revenue. These are really issues of acquisition policy, \nnot appropriations matters. We had a floor debate on this a few days \nago during consideration of the Defense Authorization Act. There is no \njustification for including these provisions in the Appropriations Act.\n  Finally, one of the more egregious ``Buy America'' provisions in this \nlegislation is a section in which we dictate that we must buy only \nAmerican seafood. While this provision has been included in a previous \nyear's funding, I must ask: What is the compelling Department of \nDefense need to protect the American seafood industry? Why is an entire \nindustry singled out for protection?\n  Mr. President, this bill spends money on Lewis and Clark and funnels \ncash to a center on ``political logic devices.'' It protects the \nmooring chain industry and ensures that we only buy American seafood. \nIf there is any food that should be mentioned in this bill, Mr. \nPresident, it is that Other White Meat. There is enough pork in this \nbill to feed an army--if only that we used our defense appropriations \nto do that. I suppose it is more important to pay Project Albert.\n  I wish it were not necessary for me to come to the Senate floor with \nevery appropriations bill to criticize the amount of unrequested \nspending in the legislation. I do so because I believe it is critical \nfor American taxpayers to understand where the money in their pockets \nis really going. I urge my colleagues to stop ``porking up'' our \nappropriations bills. In a time of huge spending deficits and scarce \ndollars, it is long past time to stop feeding at the trough.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/24/senate-section/article/S7390-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7390-S7392]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             ARMY END STRENGTH AND FY05 DOD APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, last week, the Senate by a vote of 94 to 3, \npassed the Reed-Hagel-McCain amendment to increase the Army's end \nstrength by 20,000.\n\n[[Page S7391]]\n\n  This overwhelming vote was an acknowledgement that the administration \nhas consistently underestimated and tried to avoid publicly admitting \nthe real number of troops needed to win the peace in Iraq. That \namendment was one step to bring our Iraq policy in line with the \nrealities of Iraq.\n  However, the Defense authorization bill and the Defense \nappropriations bill before us today both continue to sidestep the \nbudgetary realities of our military involvement in Iraq. Just 2 days \nago, Deputy Defense Secretary Wolfowitz testified that ``it's entirely \npossible'' that U.S. troops could be stationed in Iraq for years.\n  If a long-term deployment of U.S. troops is ``entirely possible'', \nthen the administration and Congress have a duty to properly budget for \nit.\n  When we know we are adding more troops and we know that we have \nsignificant commitments in Iraq, Afghanistan, Korea, Colombia, and \nelsewhere, we should put those costs into the annual Defense \nappropriations bill, not a supplemental appropriations bill or a \ncontingency fund as the administration calls it.\n  By making these known costs subject to supplemental appropriations, \nwe not only pretend that these costs are not long term, we also create \nan ongoing budget problem for the Army. This situation is all the more \nshocking when one considers the consistent claims from both sides of \nthe aisle that we will provide our military with whatever it needs to \nwin the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. Indeed, since the Iraq war began, \nthe Army has had to continuously cobble together the resources to pay \nfor more troops out of its regular budget. So instead of replacing or \nrepairing destroyed equipment, buying HUMVEEs or body armor, or \nfulfilling other obligations, the Army has had to eat its seed corn.\n  It is true that the Army has also gotten supplemental funds on \noccasion to pay for additional soldiers, but only after it has \nexhausted all of the reprogramming options I just mentioned.\n  In the short run, reprogramming and supplemental appropriations are \nan option, but Iraq, Afghanistan and Korea are not options. They are \nreal, and the pressure on the Army's budget is real. Unless, we \nincrease the size of the Army's regularly appropriated budget to \ninclude the costs of the Army's real personnel levels, I fear that the \nArmy will continue to delay needed expenditures, put off necessary \ninvestments, all so the administration can attempt to minimize the \ncosts of the war on terror.\n  I want to be clear, this is not the fault of the Appropriations \nCommittee. It has done its job well and has continually worked to make \nthe Army whole. But, the committee and the bill before us are \nconstrained by the administration's inflexibility and demands that \nknown, long-term costs must be hidden in contingency reserve accounts \nand other budgetary maneuvers.\n  It would be my desire to increase the size of the Army's personnel \nbudget by moving the $2 billion in supplemental funds for this very \npurpose into the Army's annual fiscal year 2005 appropriation. I \nbelieve it would be more appropriate to take the $2 billion we know \nwe'll spend out of the supplemental section of this bill and put it \ninto the Army's regular budget just like all of the Army's other long \nterm costs.\n  In deference to the chairman and ranking member and the fact that \nsuch a proposal would likely require waiving the Budget Act as well as \nthe Senate's endorsement of my amendment and Senator Levin's amendment \nthat calls on the administration to put the true costs of Army end \nstrength in its fiscal year 2006 budget request, I did not offer this \namendment.\n  However, if the administration persists in trying to sweep these \ncosts under the rug, Congress must act to include these funds in the \nregular budget of the Army.\n  I am also concerned that this year's bill has consolidated the Peer \nReviewed Cancer Research Program under a single line item. While the \npeer review programs are united in their goal of improving detection, \ntreatment and hopefully one day, prevention of deadly diseases such as \nleukemia, prostate, ovarian and breast cancer, they are each unique in \ntheir design, focus and stage of development. However, there is a valid \nconcern that placing these programs under a single line item may \ninevitably pit them against one another. The fledgling Ovarian Cancer \nResearch Program, which was only established in 1997 and has been level \nfunded at $10 million per year, will be competing with the much larger \nbreast cancer program that has been in operation for over 12 years and \nis funded at a healthy $150 million.\n  I hope that I and other Senators can work with the Chairman and \nranking member to find a way to protect the critical and specific \nhealth research on cancer that the Department of Defense has been able \nto support in the past.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Department \nof Defense--DOD--Peer-Reviewed Breast Cancer Research Program. This \nprogram is a proven success and I support a $150 million earmark for \nthe DOD Peer Reviewed Breast Cancer Research Program for Fiscal Year \n2005.\n  This one-of-a-kind research program uses an innovative grants \nstructure that brings scientists and consumers together to make key \npolicy decisions about breast cancer research. Since its inception 12 \nyears ago, this far-reaching, influential program has literally changed \nthe way breast cancer research is done. It has become a model that \nother research programs have sought to replicate.\n  The program has funded groundbreaking research, including the \ndiscovery of the drug Herceptin, which prolongs the lives of women with \na particularly aggressive type of advanced breast cancer. This drug \ncould not have been developed without research that was funded in part \nby the DOD Peer Reviewed Breast Cancer Research Program.\n  Not only is this program on the cutting edge of breast cancer \nresearch, but also is extremely streamlined. Every penny spent by this \nprogram and the researchers who receive funding are accounted for at \npublic meeting every 2 years. Ninety percent of the funds go directly \nto research and only 10 percent are used for administrative costs. This \nkind of efficiency and prudence in spending is unheard of in other \nfederally funding research programs.\n  An overwhelming, bipartisan majority in the Senate supports this \nprogram every year. This year, 66 Senators, including myself, signed \nthe letter addressed to appropriators urging the continuation of the \nDepartment of Defense Breast Cancer Peer Review Research Program \nearmark with level funding of $150 million for fiscal year 2005.\n  Unfortunately, the language in the Senate Department of Defense \nAppropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2005 threatens the funding and \nunique structure of the Breast Cancer Peer Reviewed Research Program. \nThe Senate bill combines all of the Congressionally Directed Cancer \nResearch Programs into one account and reduces the total funding \navailable to all.\n  Because the Senate version lumps all the cancer programs into one \npot, rather than maintaining separate earmarks, the proposal will have \nmultiple, negative outcomes. As written, the Senate bill seriously \nthreatens the integrity of the Department of Defense breast cancer \nresearch program and will dismantle its one-of-a kind peer review \nprocess involving patients and consumers that makes the program so \nsuccessful and unique. The proposal will force cancer groups to compete \nwith one another for reduced funding. And, a particularly dangerous \ncomponent of the proposal is that it transfers funding to other cancer \nprojects that are not recommended by a scientific peer reviewed \nprocess.\n  I have heard the success stories that have manifested as a result of \nresearch that has come out of this program. I regularly meet with women \nand men alike, from my Commonwealth of Virginia, who commend the \npositive and innovative advances that this program produces. Just last \nmonth, I met with the Virginia Breast Cancer Foundation. Let me tell \nyou, I believe Virginia is a model for other States on many issues, but \nI must say that the Virginia Breast Cancer Foundation is a leader in \nits advocacy for this issue.\n  As the Department of Defense Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2005 \ngoes to conference, I urge my colleagues to support the language passed \nin the House and preserve this important program for breast cancer \nresearch. I understand that we are fighting a war on\n\n[[Page S7392]]\n\nterror, but many individuals on our home front are fighting for their \nlives. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask for third reading of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment of the \namendments and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read a third time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We have already ordered the yeas and nays. This is final \npassage, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass? The yeas and nays have been \npreviously ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

This is the largest Defense appropriations bill in \nhistory, but it takes into account the needs of our men and women in \nuniform throughout the world. As I said, some 120 different countries \nhave our men and women in uniform. It takes care of the great problems \nfor those men and women in harm's way.\n  We thank all of our colleagues for their support and for their \nconfidence in this bill.

Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. What do these resolutions do?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, last year, the Senate passed a \nresolution imposing sanctions on the thug regime that has been running \nBurma for the last 25 years. It comes up for annual renewal, much like \nthe most-favored-nation procedure we used to apply to China. This is \nthat resolution renewing the sanctions for another year.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator. I thought there was another resolution \nthe Senator mentioned.\n  Mr. REID. We are going to do that one next.\n  Mr. BYRD. That was all, Mr. President, this one resolution?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am sorry, I did not hear.\n  Mr. BYRD.

That is perfectly acceptable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. There \nwill be a 10-minute vote on this resolution.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (S. J. Res. 39) approving the renewal of \n     import restrictions contained in the Burmese Freedom and \n     Democracy Act of 2003.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the joint resolution.\n  The joint resolution was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading \nand was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the joint resolution \nwill be returned to the calendar.\n  The clerk will report H. J. Res. 97.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (H. J. Res. 97) approving the renewal of \n     import restrictions contained in the Burmese Freedom and \n     Democracy Act of 2003.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to support S.J. Res. 39, \napproving the renewal of import restrictions contained in the Burmese \nFreedom and Democracy Act of 2003. I am a cosponsor of this resolution, \nand I believe that these sanctions must be renewed.\n  The resolution states that the State Peace and Development Council, \nSPDC, the military junta of Burma, has failed to make substantial \nprogress toward implementing a democratic government and that import \nsanctions and other restrictions against the SPDC must remain in force \nuntil ``Burma embarks on an irreversible path of reconciliation that \nincludes the full and unfettered participation of the National League \nfor Democracy and ethnic minorities in the country.''\n  The situation in Burma remains disturbing. The military junta in \nBurma continues to commit egregious human\n\n[[Page S7393]]\n\nrights abuses against its population. Human rights organizations have \ndocumented the systematic rape of Shan women on a massive scale by \nBurmese military forces and the recruitment of children, as young as \n11, into the Burmese national army. Torture, extra judicial executions, \nforced labor and widespread political repression all characterize the \nBurmese political landscape. Aung San Suu Kyi, leader of the National \nLeague for Democracy, NLD, and other senior NLD members remain under \nhouse arrest. Approximately 1,300 political activists, including \nelected members of parliament, languish in Burmese prisons, as \npunishment for their nonviolent pursuit of democracy.\n  Despite the SPDC's announcement of a new political initiative, a \n``roadmap'' to democracy, they continue to break their promises of \npolitical reform. On May 17, 2003, the junta opened a constitutional \nconvention that the junta promoted as being a first step toward \ndemocracy and democratic elections. The NLD boycotted this convention, \nafter the junta refused to free Aung San Suu Kyi. The SPDC's \ncontinuation of the convention without the key political parties of the \nNLD and the United Nationalities Alliance, a group of ethnic parties \nthat participated in the 1990 elections, demonstrates the emptiness of \nthe SPDC's commitments to reform.\n  The military junta not only creates hardship for the Burmese people, \nbut threatens stability in the region and beyond. Reports have emerged \nthat Burma and North Korea have reestablished military and trade links \nafter a termination of diplomatic relations in 1983. The U.S. State \nDepartment accused North Korea of seeking to sell surface to surface \nmissiles to Burma's government and reported that Washington was aware \nthat the Burmese regime is interested in acquiring a nuclear research \nreactor.\n  In addition, Burma continues to be a primary source of narcotics in \nAsia, as one of the world's largest trafficker of methamphetamine and \nsecond largest producer of opium. In their International Narcotics \nStrategy report for 2003, the U.S. State Department reported that major \nWa traffickers, of the ethnic Wa group in northeastern Shan State, \ncontinue to operate with apparent impunity. In addition, in the Annual \nPresidential Determinations of Major Illicit Drug-Producing and Drug-\nTransit Countries for 2003, the President designated Burma as having \n``failed demonstrably'' to make substantial counter-narcotics efforts. \nAccording to U.S. State Department, the government of Burma continued \nto be deficient in dismantling drug organizations, attacking drug-\nrelated corruption and addressing money-laundering issues. Officials in \nChina, Thailand and India have expressed serious concerns about illicit \ndrugs flooding into their countries from Burma and the increase of drug \naddiction among their youth.\n  Human trafficking in Burma is also of enormous concern. In the State \nDepartment's Trafficking in Persons report for 2004, Burma was placed \nin Tier 3, a category for those countries which are not in compliance \nwith the minimum standards of the Trafficking Victims Protection \nReauthorization Act of 2003 and are not making significant efforts to \nbring themselves into compliance. According to the State Department, \nnot only is Burma a source country for persons trafficked for forced \nlabor and sexual exploitation, but government officials and the \nmilitary are complicit in trafficking. Human Rights Watch states, \n``recruiters for Burma's army frequently apprehend boys at train and \nbus stations, markets and other public places, threatening them with \njail if they refuse to join the army. . . . After brutal training, \nchild soldiers are deployed into units, where some are forced to fight \nagainst ethnic armed opposition groups.''\n  Adding to regional instability, over 1.6 million person have fled \nBurma due to persecution and violence. In addition, it is estimated \nthat there are between 600,000 and 1 million internally displaced \npersons within the country.\n  The United States and its international partners, including the \nUnited Nations, ASEAN and the European Union must persist in their \ndemands for political reform in Burma. The renewal of these sanctions \nsends a powerful message to Burma that the United States is not \nsatisfied with their facade of democratization. I also strongly urge \nthe European Union to strengthen their existing sanctions on Burma. The \nSPDC must take immediate steps to release Aung Sang Suu Kyi and other \npolitical prisoners and to create a broad-based democratic government \nthat respects human rights and the rule of law.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I commend Senators McConnell and Feinstein \nfor their efforts to renew sanctions contained in last year's Burmese \nFreedom and Democracy Act. I am proud to be an original cosponsor.\n  The world's democracies have a common moral obligation to promote \nhuman rights. In few places is the lack of freedom and justice more \nappalling than in Burma, a country in which a band of thugs, led by \nGeneral Than Shwe, controls the population through violence and terror. \nThe Burmese regime has a record of unchecked repression. It has \nmurdered political opponents, used child soldiers and forced labor, and \nemployed rape as a weapon of war. Last year, the Burmese military junta \nlaunched an orchestrated, violent attack against democracy leader Aung \nSan Suu Kyi and hundreds of her supporters. Since then, the regime has \nkept more than 1,000 political activists imprisoned, including elected \nmembers of parliament.\n  Aung San Suu Kyi remains a captive. Because she stands for democracy, \nthis heroic woman has endured attacks, arrest, captivity, and untold \nsufferings at the hands of the regime. The junta fears Aung San Suu Kyi \nbecause of what she represents--peace, freedom, and justice for all \nBurmese people. The thugs who run Burma have tried to stifle her voice, \nbut they will never extinguish her moral courage. Her leadership and \nexample shines brightly for the millions of Burmese who hunger for \nfreedom, and for those of us outside Burma who seek justice for its \npeople. She recently celebrated her 50th birthday, under house arrest.\n  Last month, the National League for Democracy courageously boycotted \nthe junta's so-called ``National Convention.'' The government portrayed \nthis sham convention as the first step in a ``roadmap to democracy,'' \nbut it is clear that it is intended to blunt international pressure, \nrather than as a serious step in a democratic process. No ``roadmap to \ndemocracy'' will have any credibility so long as Aung Suu Kyi remains \nin confinement.\n  The work of Aung San Suu Kyi and the members of the National League \nfor Democracy must be the world's work. We must continue to press the \njunta until it is willing to negotiate an irreversible transition to \ndemocratic rule. The Burmese people deserve no less.\n  In recognition of this, last year the Congress overwhelmingly passed \nthe Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act. In doing so, we took active \nsteps to pressure the military junta, and we sent a signal to the \nBurmese people that they are not forgotten--that the American people \ncare about their freedom and will stand up for justice in their \ncountry.\n  For this reason I stand in support of the joint resolution that will \nrenew the import restrictions contained in last year's legislation--\nsanctions that are supported by the National League for Democracy. \nThese restrictions must remain until Burma embarks on a true path of \nreconciliation--a process that must include the NLD and Burmese ethnic \nminorities. I note, however, that while the American people have spoken \nwith one voice in support of freedom in Burma, it is past time that the \nleaders of other nations do the same. No other country has yet \nimplemented U.S.-style economic sanctions. The Europeans should reject \nhalf measures and join the United States in targeted sanctions against \nthe military regime. China, Thailand, India, and other Asian nations \nuncomfortable with a tougher response to the junta's crimes must \nunderstand that diplomatic obfuscation and obstruction on Burma will \nprofoundly affect their broader bilateral relationship with the western \ndemocracies.\n  The picture today in Burma is tragically clear. So long as a band of \nthugs rules Burma, its people will never be free. They will remain \nmired in poverty and suffering, cut off from the world, with only their \nindomitable spirit to keep them moving forward. With our action today, \nwe will support this spirit.\n\n[[Page S7394]]\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I speak about Burma and U.S. sanctions \npolicy. Last year, thugs working for the illegitimate Burmese \ngovernment attacked opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and her \nsupporters with clubs and sharpened sticks, killing as many as 70 pro-\ndemocracy activists.\n  The government then held Suu Kyi in what it cynically called \n``protective custody.'' Those events prompted international outrage and \nled the United States to pass the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of \n2003.\n  That Act banned all imports to the United States from Burma. Chairman \nGrassley and I worked hard to ensure that these sanctions would be \neffective--and that Congress would continue to play a key role in their \nimplementation.\n  I did not want Congress to impose trade sanctions on Burma without \nany opportunity to review the policy and revise it if it wasn't \nworking. So the act requires that Congress debate and vote on whether \nto renew the import ban every year. That is why we are here today.\n  What has the import ban accomplished? In 2002, the last full year \nwithout a ban, Burma exported $356 million to the United States, mainly \nin garments and apparel products.\n  Since the U.S. blocked all imports from Burma, more than 100 garment \nand apparel factories have closed, throwing 50,000 to 60,000 people, \nmainly young women, out of work.\n  And according to the State Department, many of these young women, \nlacking jobs and opportunities are, in desperation, quote, ``turning to \nwork in the sex industry or being forced or duped into prostitution by \ntraffickers.''\n  On the other hand, Burma's military rulers are doing just fine. The \nState Department notes that ``the military leaders personal power and \nwealth have little connection to the well-being of the country. The \ncountry's economic and military elite derives its greatest earning \npower from the trade of natural resources with neighboring states and \ncountries in the region.''\n  I have long been critical of unilateral sanctions. They almost never \nwork. They may be an effective expression of our rage, but as a rule, \nthey do not destabilize oppressive regimes, and they often hurt the \nunfortunate people they are intended to help.\n  The ban on imports from Burma is no exception to this rule. \nMultilateral sanctions can be effective. That's why I insisted that the \nact require the administration to work toward making the sanctions \nmultilateral. But to date, no country in the world has joined the \nUnited States in banning imports from Burma--not one.\n  Now, let me emphasize that Burma's government is despicable by any \nmeasure. Security forces commit murder, use rape as a weapon of war \nagainst ethnic minorities, and utilize forced labor. Democracy \nactivists are arrested and dissent punished. Conscription of child \nsoldiers is widespread.\n  There is no dispute that Burma's actions require a response. The \nquestion is whether unilateral trade sanctions are the proper response.\n  This is not an easy question. I hope that my colleagues have thought \nhard about the consequences. I hope they have made an honest assessment \nof the merits of maintaining the import ban.\n  We cannot forget that the votes we cast have real consequences. Those \nthousands of young women being forced into prostitution should serve as \na harsh reminder.\n  After struggling with the issue for some time, I decided to support \nrenewing the import ban for another year.\n  On balance, I believe we should allow the administration more time to \ntry to convince other countries to join in sanctioning the outlaw \nregime in Burma. But I would urge the administration to make this more \nof a priority. Their efforts so far have produced little result.\n  If I am to find any consolation in this state of affairs, it comes \nfrom the fact that Congress has a say in whether the trade sanctions on \nBurma continue. We have retained our Constitutional authority over \ninternational commerce.\n  This is consolation to me because it is hard to evaluate any \nunilateral sanctions program without looking back on our failed \nsanctions against Cuba.\n  Since 1960, when the Cuban embargo was first put in place, the United \nStates has pursued a unilateral policy of driving the Castro regime out \nof power. Even as the rest of the Soviet bloc collapsed, the Castro \nregime has retained its control on the Cuban island.\n  The U.S. embargo has failed. In fact, it is obvious to me that the \nembargo actually shelters Castro, and has directly contributed to the \nstrength of his regime.\n  But the unilateral embargo has remained in place for more than forty \nyears. Had Congress originally required an annual vote on the Cuban \nembargo, as we have now done with the Burma sanctions, the embargo \nwould have been eliminated long ago.\n  Instead, the Cuban sanctions were created without any end in sight, \nwithout any exit strategy, without any plan for its removal. So, here \nwe are, thirteen years beyond the fall of the Soviet Union, with the \nlast vestige of the Cold War alive and well 90 miles from our shores.\n  That's why Senators Roberts, Enzi and I have introduced legislation \nto give Congress a voice on Cuba sanctions. This legislation mirrors \nthe legislation on Burma that we are discussing today.\n  It would allow sanctions against Cuba to continue--but would require \nboth Houses of Congress to vote annually to renew the sanctions. Absent \nsuch a vote, the sanctions would end.\n  This is a reasonable approach to Cuba, and to sanctions more \ngenerally. Of course, that's also why this legislation won't pass this \nyear. The Administration and Congressional leadership are well aware \nthat Cuba sanctions would not survive a Senate vote.\n  In fact, last year, overwhelming majorities in the Senate and House \nvoted to suspend enforcement of the travel ban. Everyone here remembers \nthat those votes were ignored by the leadership in both chambers, and \nthe travel ban remained in place.\n  I hope that Congress can learn from the mistakes we have made--and \nare still making--in Cuba. I hope that Congress will work toward a more \nresponsible sanctions regime. I stand ready to work with my colleagues \nto make that happen.\n  Let me close by thanking Senators McConnell, Feinstein, and Grassley \nfor their work on the Burma legislation. Senators McConnell and \nFeinstein have been tireless advocates for democracy in Burma. They \ndeserve to be commended.\n  I would also like to acknowledge some of the staff who have worked \nhard on this issue--Paul Grove, Michael Schiffer, Everett Eissenstat, \nand Stephen Schaeffer.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from \nKentucky, Senator McConnell, in support of the joint resolution \nrenewing the sanctions against Burma. The House has overwhelmingly and \nin a bipartisan manner passed this resolution, and I urge the Senate to \ndo likewise.\n  Last year, following the brazen attack against the motorcade of Nobel \nPeace Prize winner and National League of Democracy leader Aung San Suu \nKyi, the United States took a firm stand on the side of human rights \nand democracy for the Burmese people by passing the Burmese Freedom and \nDemocracy Act and imposing a complete ban on Burmese imports.\n  One year later, Suu Ky remains under house arrest and the military \njunta, the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), has failed to \nmake ``substantial and measurable progress'' towards a true dialogue on \nnational reconciliation and recognition of the results of the 1990 \nparliamentary elections, decisively won by the NLD.\n  As a result, the Senate has no choice but to support renewing the \nsanctions for another year.\n  Let me be clear. I do not believe sanctions are a panacea for every \nforeign policy dispute we have with another country.\n  I have long supported the reform of our sanctions policy, and, in my \nview, Congress should have the opportunity to revisit sanctions imposed \non other countries on a case-by-case basis and in a timely fashion.\n  I am cosponsor of Senator Baucus's legislation to allow Congress to \nvote up or down on the sanctions imposed on Cuba for that very reason.\n  It seems clear to me that 40 years later, those sanctions have not \nachieved our foreign policy goals. Yet, under different circumstances \nand conditions, sanctions can be effective.\n\n[[Page S7395]]\n\n  Burma, in my view, is such a case. One year is not a sufficient \nperiod of time to judge the effectiveness of the sanctions, and there \nis reason to believe that the international community is coming \ntogether to put additional pressure on the military regime.\n  I was disappointed that the European Union and the Association of \nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN) did not follow the United States' lead \nlast year and impose tough sanctions on the military junta.\n  Nevertheless, the EU, for one, is beginning to realize that \nengagement with Rangoon has failed to achieve the desired results.\n  Last week, the EU refused to include Burma in two lower-level \nmeetings with ASEAN representatives and, in response to ASEAN's demand \nthat all of its members be allowed to attend, the EU canceled the \nmeetings.\n  Supporters of freedom and democracy in Burma should welcome this move \nand continue to urge our allies to put additional pressure on the \nmilitary regime.\n  There is also some positive movement within ASEAN itself, including \nMalaysia, the country that sponsored Burma's entry into the Association \nand has supported ``non-interference'' in domestic affairs of other \nmembers.\n  Earlier this month, a group of Malaysian parliamentarians--from the \ngovernment and the opposition--formed a committee to press for \ndemocracy in Burma. The group called on the SPDC to immediately and \nunconditionally release all political prisoners and restore democratic \ngovernment.\n  The parliamentary group stated: ``The caucus also calls upon the \n(Burma) government to respect ASEAN and international opinion and \nreturn to the mainstream of responsible international norms and \nbehavior.''\n  Of course, we would all like to see ASEAN, the EU, and others to take \nadditional steps to put pressure on Rangoon to respect human rights and \nrestore democracy. But we must continue to take the lead.\n  I believe that by passing this resolution and renewing the sanctions \non imports from Burma for another year, we will enhance our leadership \nin this area and rally the international community to our cause. Now is \nnot the time to weaken our resolve.\n  Some may argue that the sanctions do no harm to the members of the \nmilitary junta and instead place additional hardships on the Burmese \npeople.\n  The military junta itself cynically suggested that the reason why \nhuman trafficking is a rampant problem in Burma--as cited in the latest \nState Department report--is due to the desperate economic conditions \ncaused by the sanctions imposed by the United States.\n  Let us not forget that for over 15 years the military junta has \nbrutalized its won citizens, engaged in numerous human rights abuses \nincluding rape, forced labor, and human trafficking of young boys and \ngirls, and run the Burmese economy into the ground.\n  And the consequences of the regime's repressive rule extend far \nbeyond its borders. As Senator McConnell and I pointed out in an op-ed \nthat appeared in the Wall Street Journal, the spread of narcotics, HIV/\nAIDS, and refugees across the region can be traced back to Rangoon.\n  As South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu stated earlier this year: \n``To dismantle apartheid [in South Africa] took not only commitment, \nfaith, and hard work, but also intense international pressure and \nsanctions. In Burma, the regime has ravaged the country, and the \npeople, to fund its illegal rule. Governments and international \ninstitutions must move past symbolic gestures and cut the lifelines to \nBurma's military regime through well-implemented sanctions.''\n  We cannot say for certain these sanctions will work. But we can be \ncertain that if we do nothing and allow these sanctions to expire, the \nmilitary junta will strengthen its grip on power and the day of Suu \nKyi's release from house arrest and the re-birth of democracy in Burma \nwill be put off further into the future.\n  We simply cannot afford to make that mistake and turn our backs on \nthose who are looking to us for hope and inspiration.\n  I urge my colleagues to renew their support for freedom and \ndemocracy, Suu Kyi and the Burmese people and support this resolution.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Shall the joint resolution pass? The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Res. 393) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 393\n\n       Whereas the Road Map, endorsed by the United States, \n     Israel, the Palestinian Authority, the European Union, \n     Russia, and the United Nations, remains a realistic and \n     widely recognized plan for making progress toward peace;\n       Whereas, on April 14, 2004, President Bush welcomed the \n     plan of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to remove certain \n     military installations and all settlements from Gaza, and \n     certain military installations and settlements from the West \n     Bank;\n       Whereas under the Road Map, Palestinians must undertake an \n     immediate cessation of armed activity and all acts of \n     violence against Israelis anywhere, all Palestinian \n     institutions, organizations, and individuals must end \n     incitement against Israel, the Palestinian leadership must \n     act decisively against terror (including sustained, targeted, \n     and effective operations to stop terrorism and dismantle \n     terrorist capabilities and infrastructure), and Palestinians \n     must undertake a comprehensive and fundamental political \n     reform that includes a strong parliamentary democracy and an \n     empowered prime minister;\n       Whereas Prime Minister Sharon noted Israel's \n     responsibilities under the Road Map include limitations on \n     the growth of settlements, removal of unauthorized outposts, \n     and steps to increase, to the extent permitted by security \n     needs, freedom of movement for Palestinians not engaged in \n     terrorism;\n       Whereas there likely will be no security for Israelis or \n     Palestinians until they and all states join together to fight \n     terrorism and dismantle terrorist organizations;\n       Whereas the United States remains committed to Israel's \n     security, and well-being as a Jewish State, including secure, \n     recognized, and defensible borders, and to preserving and \n     strengthening Israel's capability to deter enemies and defend \n     itself against any threat;\n       Whereas Israel has the right to defend itself against \n     terrorism, including to take actions against terrorist \n     organizations that threaten Israel's citizens;\n       Whereas, after Israel withdraws from Gaza and parts of the \n     West Bank, existing arrangements regarding control of \n     airspace, territorial waters, and land passages relating to \n     the West Bank and Gaza are planned to continue;\n       Whereas, as part of a final peace settlement, Israel must \n     have secure and recognized borders, which should emerge from \n     negotiations between the parties in accordance with United \n     Nations Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338;\n       Whereas, in light of realities on the ground, including \n     already existing major Israeli population centers, it is \n     unrealistic to expect that the outcome of final status \n     negotiations will be a full and complete return to the \n     armistice lines of 1949, but realistic to expect that any \n     final status agreement will only be achieved on the basis of \n     mutually agreed changes that reflect these realities;\n       Whereas Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has stated: \n     ``the barrier being erected by Israel is a security rather \n     than political barrier, is temporary rather than permanent, \n     and should therefore not prejudice any final status issues \n     including final borders, and its route should take into \n     account, consistent with security needs, its impact on \n     Palestinian communities'';\n       Whereas an agreed just, fair, and realistic framework for a \n     solution to the Palestinian refugee issue as part of any \n     final status agreement will need to be found through the \n     establishment of a Palestinian state, and the settling of \n     Palestinian refugees there, rather than in Israel;\n       Whereas the United States supports the establishment of a \n     Palestinian state that is viable, contiguous, sovereign, and \n     independent, so that the Palestinian people can build their \n     own future;\n       Whereas the United States will join with others in the \n     international community to assist in fostering the \n     development of Palestinian democratic political institutions \n     and new leadership committed to those institutions, the \n     reconstruction of civic institutions, the growth of a free \n     and prosperous economy, and the building of capable security \n     institutions dedicated to maintaining law and order and \n     dismantling terrorist organizations; and\n       Whereas in order to promote a lasting peace, all states \n     must oppose terrorism, support the emergence of a peaceful \n     and democratic Palestine, and state clearly that they will \n     live in peace with Israel: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) endorses the above-mentioned principles and practices \n     of United States policy in the Middle East, and ongoing \n     actions to make progress toward realizing the vision of two \n     states living side by side in peace and security, as a real \n     contribution toward peace, and as important steps under the \n     Road Map;\n       (2) reaffirms its commitment to a vision of two states, \n     Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and \n     security as the key to peace; and\n       (3) supports efforts to continue working with others in the \n     international community, to build the capacity and will of \n     Palestinian institutions to fight terrorism, dismantle \n     terrorist organizations, and prevent the areas from which \n     Israel has withdrawn from posing a threat to the security of \n     Israel.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, in the world of diplomacy, some things are \nbetter left unsaid. For that reason, I would have preferred that \nPresident Bush not send the April 14, 2004 letter to Prime Minister \nSharon.\n  Nevertheless, I gave my qualified support to S. Res. 393 because \nIsraeli withdrawal from Gaza has the potential to jumpstart the \nIsraeli-Palestinian peace process. There have been too many missed \nopportunities already. It would be a shame to miss another one.\n  My vote for S. Res. 393 is subject to two understandings. First, \nPrime Minister Sharon's disengagement plan should not be a substitute \nfor bilateral negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians; and \nsecond, all final status issues should be mutually agreed upon by both \nparties.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, after the following judge vote, we are \nscheduled to consider another five additional judges this evening. Of \nthe ones after this one--looking at those five--the next two are \ncircuit judges, to be followed by three district judges.\n  It has been cleared on this side to have voice votes on all of those \nfive judges.\n  I ask the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee if we could, out \nof consideration of the many different schedules tonight, voice vote \nthe remaining nominations after the next rollcall vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Well, Mr. President, in response to my friend from \nTennessee, normally I would say: Have rollcall votes. I also know with \nthe Defense authorization bill we had some very late night schedules. \nThis is pushing up against the Fourth of July recess. I think the \nSenator from Tennessee, the Senator from South Dakota, and the \nrespective whips have the hardest jobs\n\n[[Page S7397]]\n\nin the world trying to please everybody.\n  I will tell my friend from Tennessee, if that would make his life \neasier, I would be happy to accommodate him.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I very much appreciate that.\n  On behalf of our colleagues, I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I say to the majority leader, he has made a few other \npeople happy.\n  Mr. President, is it my understanding on the first one there is a \nrollcall vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

HALL TO BE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE \n                             SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the nomination.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Peter W. Hall, of \nVermont, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Second Circuit.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor the confirmation of Peter W. Hall, who has been nominated to the \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.\n  Mr. Hall is an exceptional nominee and well-prepared for the Federal \nbench. A graduate of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill \nand a cum laude graduate from Cornell Law School, he served as a law \nclerk for United States District Court Judge Albert W. Coffrin in the \nDistrict of Vermont. He then served in the United States Attorney's \nOffice for the District of Vermont, first as an assistant U.S. \nAttorney, then as first assistant U.S. Attorney. From 1986 to 2001, Mr. \nHall was a partner in the law firm of Reiber, Kenlan, Schwiebert, Hall \n& Facey, P.C. He then returned to the U.S. Attorney's Office--this time \nunanimously confirmed by the Senate--to be the United States Attorney \nfor the District of Vermont, a position he holds today.\n  Mr. Hall has been very active very in his community. He served as \nPresident of the Vermont Bar Association from 1995-96, on the Federal \nDistrict Court Advisory Committee for the United States District Court \nin Vermont as a Citizen Board Member of the Vermont Criminal Justice \nTraining Council, and on the Board of the Vermont Karelia Rule of Law \nProject. From 1989-1994, he was a nonpartisan elected member of select \nboard for the town of Chittenden, VT, and in 1995, he was the elected \nJustice of the Peace for Chittenden. He has also been involved in the \nlay leadership of his church.\n  Mr. Hall has overwhelming bipartisan support, including both of his \nhome State Senators, Patrick Leahy and Jim Jeffords. The ABA \nunanimously rated him ``well qualified.'' He is an outstanding \ncandidate who has been nominated to fill a vacancy that has been \ndesignated by the National Judicial Conference as a judicial emergency. \nI urge my colleagues to join me in supporting his nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, shall the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Peter W. Hall, of Vermont, to be United \nStates Circuit Judge for the Second Circuit.\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/24/senate-section/article/S7403-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7403-S7405]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n NOMINATION OF WILLIAM DUANE BENTON TO BE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE \n                         FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will state the next nomination.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of William Duane Benton, of \nMissouri, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Eighth Circuit.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, it is a pleasure to speak in support of a \ndistinguished Missourian, my good friend Duane Benton, to serve on the \nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. Judge Benton is \na respected jurist and committed public servant. I am very pleased the \nSenate is taking action on Judge Benton for this important position. \nThe Members voting on this nomination, after reviewing his many \naccomplishments, will find Judge Benton to have an impressive record of \npublic service and an exemplary judicial record and conclude that he \nwill make an excellent addition to the federal judiciary.\n  Judge Benton currently serves on the Supreme Court of the State of \nMissouri. Judge Benton was appointed to the court in 1991, and also has \nserved as its chief judge. Judge Benton has earned a reputation as a \njudge with a distinguished intellect who has a skill for uniting his \ncolleagues on difficult questions. His work ethic, approach and \nreasoning are highly regarded by the lawyers of Missouri.\n  In addition to his service on the judiciary, Judge Benton brings an \nimpressive breadth of experience to this position. His experience \ncoupled with his judicial record give him a command of a wide range of \nlegal matters. Judge Benton is a Certified Public Accountant--the only \nCPA serving on any supreme court in the United States. Judge Benton was \nMissouri's chief tax expert, serving as director of the Missouri \nDepartment of Revenue. Judge Benton was member of the United States \nNavy, serving as a judge advocate for a number of years.\n  Judge Benton earned his degree at Northwestern University; his law \ndegree at Yale University School of Law, where he also served as editor \nof the Yale Law Journal; a Masters of Business Administration at \nMemphis State University and a Masters of Law at the University of \nVirginia.\n  Judge Benton has also found time to be active in the communities in \nwhich he has lived. While his activities are too numerous to name, he \nhas given his time from coaching baseball to serving on the Board of \nRegents for Central Missouri State University.\n  He retired from the U.S. Naval Reserve as a captain, after 30 years \nof active and reserve duty. He is a Vietnam veteran, a member of the \nVeterans of Foreign Wars, the American Legion, the Navy League, the \nVietnam Veterans of America and the Missouri Military Advisory \nCommittee.\n  The U.S. Court of Appeals is truly the second most important court in \nthe land. Nearly every Federal case ends up before the court in some \nmanner. Its decisions impact every aspect of society. To these \npositions, I believe it is imperative that the President nominate \npeople of distinguished intellect and character with a breadth of legal\n\n[[Page S7404]]\n\nexperience. This standard has been far surpassed with the nomination of \nJudge Benton. With his knowledge and experience, he will make an \noutstanding addition to the Federal judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor the confirmation of William Duane Benton, who has been nominated to \nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.\n  Judge William Benton is an ideal nominee and is well suited for the \nFederal bench. He is currently a judge on the Supreme Court of \nMissouri, where he has served for 13 years, including two years as \nchief justice of the court. He is highly respected by his peers, has \nbroad bipartisan support, and received a unanimous ``Well Qualified'' \nrating from the American Bar Association. Both of Judge Benton's home \nState senators, Senators Bond and Talent, enthusiastically support his \nnomination to the Eighth Circuit.\n  Before I go on, I want to note here that Judge Benton is the only \ncertified public accountant serving on any State supreme court in the \nUnited States.\n  I would also note Judge Benton's military career. From 1975 to 1979, \nhe served with the U.S. Navy as a judge advocate. A Vietnam veteran, \nJudge Benton retired from the U.S. Naval Reserve at the rank of Captain \nfollowing 30 years of active and reserve service.\n  Judge Benton has an outstanding academic record and I want to list a \nfew of his accomplishments: He graduated summa cum laude from \nNorthwestern University, where he became a member of Phi Beta Kappa. He \nthen attended Yale Law School, where he distinguished himself as both \nan editor and managing editor of the Yale Law Review. While on active \nduty in the Navy, he attended business school at night at the \nUniversity of Memphis and received his master's in business \nadministration--with highest honors. And in 1995, he received an L.L.M. \nfrom the University of Virginia.\n  Judge Benton has been a dedicated public servant throughout most of \nhis career, serving in all three branches of the Government at the \nState or Federal level. He was confirmed by the Missouri Senate for \nmany of those positions: Director of Revenue for the Missouri \nDepartment of Revenue; the Chair of the Board of Trustees for the \nMissouri State Employees' Retirement, and Member of the Board of \nRegents for Central Missouri State University. Additionally, the \ngovernor of Missouri appointed Judge Benton to the Multistate Tax \nCommission prior to his service on the bench. The Missouri Senate also \nconfirmed him for that position, and members from 32 other states \nelected him chair of the commission. Judge Benton also served as chief \nof staff to Missouri Congressman Wendell Bailey in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives.\n  In addition to his many years as a public servant, Judge Benton \nmaintained a law practice. During the 1980s, he had a general civil \npractice representing clients such as statewide associations and \ngroups, small businesses, and local governments. He also represented \nseveral Federal inmates on a pro bono basis.\n  Judge Benton has the support of both home State senators. \nFurthermore, he has wide support from members of the Missouri bar, as \nwell as community organizations such as the Jefferson City Branch of \nthe N.A.A.C.P.\n  Judge Benton has a solid reputation for possessing a high level of \nintegrity, and for being personable and engaging. I'm sure that my \ncolleagues will agree that Judge Benton brings unmatchable expertise, \nas well as experience to the Federal bench.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, a little more than a month ago we were able \nto obtain a firm commitment from the White House that there would be no \nfurther judicial recess appointments for the remainder of this \npresidential term. That undertaking led immediately and directly to the \nSenate vitiating a cloture vote and proceeding to confirm a district \ncourt nominee from Florida. Since that time I have been urging the \nRepublican leadership to schedule consideration and votes on the other \ntwo dozen nominees to be considered. They started slowly but last week \nwe were able to confirm nine of the judicial nominees. Today we will \nact on several more.\n  It is unfortunate that the Republican leadership did not schedule the \ndebate that they know will be required before a vote on the Holmes \nnomination. There remains no Democratic hold on that nomination. The \nproblem has been the failure of the Republican leadership to build that \ndebate into the Senate schedule.\n  I am working with the Democratic leader and all Senators to complete \naction on all the other judicial nominees subject to the understanding. \nIn order to accommodate Senators, we will proceed with some of the \nnominees by voice vote.\n  The facts are that Senate Democrats have been much more cooperative \nwith this President than Republicans were when President Clinton was in \nthe White House. Democrats in this Senate have shown great restraint \nand extensive cooperation in the confirmation of nearly 200 of this \nPresident's judicial nominations. We have reduced circuit court \nvacancies to the lowest level since the Republican Senate leadership \nirresponsibly doubled those vacancies in the years 1995 through 2001. \nWe have already reduced overall Federal court vacancies to the lowest \nlevels in 14 years, and after today we may hit a level of vacancies \nachieved only once in the last 20 years with less than 30.\n  Today we consider William Duane Benton, the fifth of President Bush's \nnominees to a circuit court we will have confirmed this year. This \nshould be contrasted with the number of circuit court nominees \nconfirmed in the 1996 session, the last year of President Clinton's \nfirst term. That session not a single circuit court nominee was \npermitted by the Republican majority to proceed to confirmation, not \none. That year only 17 judges were allowed to be confirmed and all were \nto district court vacancies.\n  Judge Benton, who currently serves on the Supreme Court of Missouri, \nis an example of the sort of nominee that President Bush ought to send \nfor the appellate courts. He has a reputation as a conservative, but \nfair-minded judge. As an attorney he had experience in a variety of \nareas of law, and on the State Supreme Court he has handled complex \ncriminal and civil cases. He has written a number of excellent \nopinions, laying out the facts and the law with no hint of any personal \nbias. Judge Benton shows a willingness to listen to all litigants and \nto be fair.\n  I was especially struck by his fairness in death penalty cases. Far \ntoo often judges, especially elected judges, yield to the pressure of \nthose who would sacrifice important constitutional principles in \ncapital cases. As I look at his record, I see that of the 21 published \nopinions Judge Benton has written in death penalty cases, he has \naffirmed 12 and reversed nine. I think it is telling that he is willing \nto see beyond what are always terrible facts in these cases to ensure \nthat justice and important constitutional safeguards are preserved.\n  I hope that my praise for his work in death penalty cases will not \nhurt Judge Benton's chances for confirmation. I remember not so long \nago when another judge on the Supreme Court of Missouri, now-Chief \nJustice Ronnie White, was before the Senate as a nominee to a seat on \nthe Federal bench. Sadly, Judge White's willingness to uphold the \nConstitution and ensure fair process in death penalty cases led to his \nbeing defeated by an unprecedented party-line vote of Republican \nSenators. His record was twisted and distorted for purposes of partisan \npolitics.\n  Judge White was twice nominated by President Clinton to fill a seat \non the U.S. District Court. The Judiciary Committee held two hearings \non his nomination. Judge White was introduced enthusiastically by \nSenator Bond, and after each of these hearings the committee voted \nfavorably to report his nomination to the full Senate. Despite this \nbipartisan support, however, his nomination was delayed for months and \nthen years. When the time finally came for a vote on the Senate floor, \nJudge White was ambushed, and he was rejected in a party-line vote \nduring which Republicans who had supported his nomination previously \nreversed position to scuttle it before the Senate.\n  The biggest distortions of Judge White's record were in death penalty\n\n[[Page S7405]]\n\ncases. His record on the whole compares favorably to Judge Benton's. \nAccording to testimony at Attorney General Ashcroft's confirmation \nhearing, Judge White voted to affirm the death penalty in 69 percent of \nthe cases he heard. Looking just at the opinions Judge Benton has \nauthored, we see him writing to affirm the death penalty 58 percent of \nthe time. If we factor in cases in which he did not write the opinion \nbut voted to affirm a capital sentence, I am sure the percentage is \nhigher, and approaches Judge White's record.\n  For opposing a capital sentence in dissent in a small minority of the \ncases he heard, Judge White was vilified. Then-Senator Ashcroft took to \nthe Senate floor and pointed to Judge White's record in death penalty \ncases as evidence that he was ``pro-criminal,'' further describing \nRonnie White as a judge, ``with a tremendous bent toward criminal \nactivity or with a bent toward excusing or providing second chances or \nopportunities for those who have been accused in those situations.'' \nThese were outrageous things to say about a man who had devoted his \nlife to the law, who had served many years on the State's highest \ncourt, and who had voted to reverse a small number of death sentences \nin order to preserve the integrity of the Constitution. When Judge \nWhite came to testify at Attorney General Ashcroft's confirmation \nhearing, Senator Specter offered him an apology for the way in which he \nwas treated.\n  I mention all of this, as I said, because it provides such a stark \ncontrast to the treatment that Judge Benton has gotten throughout his \nconfirmation process. I doubt anyone will look at the nine cases in \nwhich he wrote to reverse a death penalty--50 percent more cases than \nthose Judge White voted to reverse--and accuse him of being ``pro-\ncriminal''. I will be surprised if, because he has found reversible \nerror in the imposition of nine different death sentences, each one \ninvolving terrible crimes and horrific facts, any Member of this Senate \nwill accuse him of having a ``tremendous bent toward criminal \nactivity.'' I will be shocked if, because he exercised his best \njudgment and followed the law as he understood it, he will be vilified \nand humiliated in a sneak attack in the manner that Judge Ronnie White \nwas treated.\n  Of course, none of that should happen to Judge Benton, just as none \nof that should have happened to Judge White. I hope that one day Judge \nWhite's name can come back before the Senate and that he can be treated \nwith the integrity and respect he deserves, just as we treat Judge \nBenton. I will vote in favor of Judge Benton's confirmation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Shall the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of William Duane Benton, of Missouri, to be \nUnited States Circuit Judge for the Eighth Circuit?\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/24/senate-section/article/S7405-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7405-S7407]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   NOMINATION OF DORA L.

The clerk will state the next set of \nnominations, en bloc.\n  The legislative clerk read the nominations of Dora L. Irizarry, of \nNew York, to be United States District Judge for the Eastern District \nof New York;\n  George P. Schiavelli, of California, to be United States District \nJudge for the Central District of California;\n  Robert Bryan Harwell, of South Carolina, to be United States District \nJudge for the District of South Carolina.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the \nconfirmation of Dora Irizarry, who has been nominated to the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of New York.\n  Judge Irizarry has an impressive record of academic achievement and \npublic service. She is a cum laude graduate of Yale University and a \ngraduate of Columbia University School of Law. She has spent the great \nbulk of her career in public service, including 16 years as an \nassistant district attorney prosecuting complex narcotics cases. In \n1995, then-Mayor Rudolph Guiliani appointed her to the New York City \nCriminal Court. Two years later, she was elevated by Governor George \nPataki to the New York Court of Claims, where she served as an acting \njustice on the New York Supreme Court. After seven years of service as \na judge, she left the bench in 2002 to campaign as the Republican \ncandidate for State Attorney General. She is currently in private \npractice with the New York law firm of Hoguet Newman & Regal.\n  In acknowledging the questions that some of my colleagues have about \nJudge Irizarry, let me just say I have done my best to ensure her \nnomination is treated with fairness and respect, and I believe we've \nsucceeded. During the confirmation hearing for Judge Irizarry, we heard \nfrom the ABA and we also heard from three distinguished members of the \nNew York legal community. We heard from New York Supreme Court Justice \nMichael Pesce, the presiding justice, and New York Supreme Court \nJustice Lewis Douglass, as well as James Castro-Blanco, immediate past \npresident of the Puerto Rico Bar Association. They praised her legal \naptitude and experience, her integrity, and, most notably, her judicial \ntemperament.\n  Furthermore, the Committee received a number of letters in support of \nJudge Irizarry's nomination from those who were unable to attend her \nhearing, as well as a strong letter in support from the Congressional \nHispanic Caucus.\n  When I look at the full record in this case, including the impressive \ntestimony on behalf of Judge Irizarry from her judicial colleagues and \nformer associates, the endorsements of the Brooklyn, Asian American and \nPuerto Rican Bar associations, and her own answers to the questions \nthat have been raised, I am persuaded that she is prepared to be a fine \nFederal judge. I support her confirmation, and I ask my colleagues to \ndo the same.\n  Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, we are asked to consider the \nnomination of Dora Irizarry to the United States District Court for the \nEastern District of New York. There was some controversy with her \nnomination stemming from interviews conducted by the American Bar \nAssociation. A majority of the ABA Standing Committee members concluded \nthat Judge Irizarry was ``not qualified'' for the Federal bench. I \nbelieve we must give considerable weight to such peer reviews.\n  Unfortunately, Judge Irizarry is one of 28 judicial nominees of this \nPresident to receive a partial or majority rating of ``not qualified'' \nfrom the ABA committee that conducts a peer evaluation of judicial \nnominees. When the ABA advises us that even a minority of the members \nof its review committee consider a nominee to be ``not qualified,'' \nthat is cause for concern. I know that the ABA representatives take \ntheir work very seriously.\n  Last October, the Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the \nnomination of Judge Irizarry, with the consent of both of the Senators \nfrom her home-state of New York. The senior Senator from New York, \nSenator Schumer, served as the ranking member at the hearing. On behalf \nof the Democratic minority, I worked with Chairman Hatch to allow that \nhearing to be scheduled on shorter notice than would normally be \nrequired under Senate rules. That was one of a series of accommodations \nDemocrats have made to the Republican majority and to this \nadministration without receiving acknowledgment or credit. At the \nhearing, the committee explored the nomination and the unfavorable \nrecommendation of the ABA. We heard from the nominee, Judge Dora \nIrizarry, ABA representatives, and the witnesses speaking in support of \nher qualifications.\n  The Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee look very closely \nat the peer review ratings provided by the ABA. Nevertheless, we \nconsider the views of the ABA an important but not a dispositive piece \nof information as part of our evaluation. We may not always agree with \nthe recommendation.\n\n[[Page S7406]]\n\nThe Senate proceeded to confirm nominees with majority ``Not \nQualified'' ratings from the ABA, and during the course of this \nadministration the Senate has confirmed a number of nominees with \npartial ``Not Qualified'' ratings.\n  There are other factors that are critical considerations for these \nlifetime positions in the Federal judiciary beyond a favorable ABA \nrating. For example, in the judgment of some Members of the Senate, \nsome of this President's judicial nominees do not have records that \ndemonstrate that they will be fair judges and, instead, their \nbackgrounds suggest precisely the opposite: that they were chosen with \nthe hope that they would prejudge areas of constitutional law in order \nto move the law in a certain direction in tune with the political views \nof the right wing of the Republican party.\n  I have no concerns about the impartiality of the ABA member, Pat \nHynes, who conducted the interviews in connection with the nomination \nof Judge Irizarry. Ms. Hynes, who is of counsel at Milberg Weiss, \nchaired the ABA standing committee during the beginning of the Bush \nadministration and also served as the ABA's Second Circuit \nrepresentative from 1995 to 2000. She is currently Chair of the Merit \nSelection Panel for Magistrate Judges for the Southern District of New \nYork and serves on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals Rules Committee. \nShe was chosen as a Fellow of the American College of Trial Lawyers and \nhas been named one of the Top 50 Women Litigators in the United States \nand one of the 50 Most Influential Women Lawyers in America.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee's practice has been to invite the \nABA's testimony in connection with a nomination when a circuit or \ndistrict court nominee has earned a majority or unanimous rating of \n``not qualified.'' In providing such testimony, I know that the ABA \ntakes pains to preserve the confidentiality of the attorneys and judges \nthey interview as part of their review. I do wish the ABA would provide \nsimilar information, informally or formally, about other ratings they \nprovide. Before President Bush ejected the ABA from the process of \nproviding an informal rating before a nomination was made, the fact \nthat temperament or ethics concerns were raised was conveyed, and \nsometimes past White Houses chose not to proceed after making further \ninquiry into such concerns. Additionally, when the ABA was involved in \nthe process before nomination, I am confident that members of the legal \ncommunity were more candid before a judicial candidate was given the \nimprimatur of the President.\n  I understand that in connection with the nomination of Judge \nIrizarry, the ABA heard a number of candid assessments from the lawyers \nand judges Ms. Hynes interviewed, some very positive and some troubling \nin the area of judicial temperament.\n  Judge Irizarry, who was born in Puerto Rico, is an attorney with the \nNew York firm of Hoguet, Newman & Regal. A 1979 graduate of Columbia \nLaw School, she was appointed to the Bronx County Criminal Court in \n1996, and then served on the New York County Criminal Court, on the New \nYork Supreme Court, which, despite its name, is a trial level court, in \nNew York County and Kings County, and on the New York Court of Claims. \nShe served as a judge until May 2002, when she resigned to run an \nunsuccessful campaign for State Attorney General against Eliot Spitzer. \nAs I mentioned, based on concerns about temperament, a majority of the \nABA committee found her to be ``not qualified'' for a Federal judgeship \nand a minority voted to find her ``qualified.'' The New York City Bar \nAssociation's Judiciary Committee also found Judge Irizarry to be \nunqualified for a position on the Federal bench, citing a lack of \nFederal experience and complaints about her judicial temperament.\n  I have concerns about the serious temperament allegations that were \nmade to the ABA standing committee but I trust the judgment of the \nsenior Senator from the State of New York and I am prepared to support \nJudge Irizarry's confirmation to this lifetime position. I trust that \nshe will conduct herself on the Federal bench in a way that is above \nreproach.\n\n\n                    Nomination of George Schiavelli\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased today to speak in support of \nGeorge P. Schiavelli to be United States District Judge for the Central \nDistrict of California.\n  Judge Schiavelli has exceptional qualifications for the Federal \nbench. After graduating first in his class from UCLA Law School in 1974 \nhe joined the law firm of O'Melveny & Myers LLP as an associate where \nhe worked on litigation, labor, corporate and entertainment issues with \nan emphasis on commercial litigation. In 1976, Judge Schiavelli joined \nthe litigation department of Ervin, Cohen & Jessup LLP. Ten years \nlater, he was hired as a partner at Horvitz & Levy, LLP, an appellate \nlaw firm.\n  Judge Schiavelli began his distinguished career in public service by \njoining the Los Angeles Superior Court in 1994 where he served until \n2000. Since that time, he has practiced principally in the area of \nalternative dispute resolution, ADR, acting as a mediator, arbitrator, \nreferee, and special master. In addition to his ADR activities, Judge \nSchiavelli has been Of Counsel to the Appellate Group of Reed Smith \nLLP.\n  Judge Schiavelli's impressive credentials are reflected in his \nunanimous American Bar Association rating of Well Qualified. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting his nomination.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Senate considers the nomination \nof George Schiavelli to the U.S. District Court for the Central \nDistrict of California. He is currently of counsel at Reed Smith LLP in \nLos Angeles, where he has worked since 2000. Prior to joining Reed \nSmith, he served as a judge on the Los Angeles Superior Court from \n1994-2000. He has significant litigation and judicial experience and I \nsupport his nomination.\n  Mr. Schiavelli's nomination is the product of a bipartisan judicial \nnominating commission maintained with the White House by Senators \nFeinstein and Boxer. The State of California is well-served by its \nbipartisan judicial nominating commission, which recommends qualified, \nmoderate nominees on whom members of both parties can agree. It is \ndifficult to understand why President Bush has opposed similar \nbipartisan selections commissions since they clearly help Democrats and \nRepublicans work together to staff an independent judiciary.\n  I thank Senators Feinstein and Boxer for their steadfast efforts in \nmaintaining the commission. It is a testament to their diligence that \nwe have such well-qualified nominees heading to California's Federal \ncourts. With this confirmation, the Senate will have confirmed 15 \nnominees to the district courts in California.\n  The Senate will now have confirmed more than two dozen judicial \nnominees of President Bush this year alone. Only 17 judges were \nconfirmed under Republican leadership in the entire 1996 session and no \ncircuit court nominees were confirmed that entire time. That was the \nlast year in which a President was seeking reelection. We have far \nexceeded the number of judges confirmed, including circuit judges, that \nyear.\n  With today's votes, the Senate will have confirmed nearly 200 \njudicial nominees of President Bush. In this Congress alone, the Senate \nhas confirmed more Federal judges than were confirmed during the 2 full \nyears of 1995 and 1996 when Republicans first controlled the Senate and \nPresident Clinton was in the White House. We have also exceeded the 2-\nyear total at the end of the Clinton administration, when Republicans \nheld the Senate majority in 1999 and 2000. I would note, however, that \nthe Republican-controlled Senate has not confirmed in 25 months quite \nas many as the 100 the Democratic-led Senate confirmed in our 17 months \nin the majority in 2001 and 2002.\n  With nearly 200 confirmation of President Bush's judicial nominees, \nthe Senate has confirmed more lifetime appointees for this President \nthan were allowed to be confirmed in the most recent four-year \npresidential term--that of President Clinton from 1997 through 2000. We \nhave confirmed more judicial nominees than the first President Bush \nappointed in his presidency and more than during President Reagan \nappointed during his entire term from 1981 through 1984.\n  I congratulate Mr. Schiavelli and his family on his confirmation \ntoday.\n\n\n                    nomination of robert b. harwell\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I join Lindsey Graham in supporting \nBryan\n\n[[Page S7407]]\n\nHarwell to be a Federal judge in the Low Country. I support nominees \nfrom both parties no matter who is President, but I don't believe this \nNation's courts should be filled with judges who are advancing a \npolitical agenda. We need to stay above politicizing the courts for \nshort-term political gain. I have been disturbed by a few of the \nPresident's nominees, who have been outside the judicial mainstream, or \nare only marginally qualified, or are tainted by conflicts or their \npast political work for Kenneth Starr. We should not use the Federal \nbench to reward our political operatives.\n  Bryan Harwell has distinguished himself as a trial lawyer with a law \nfirm in Florence and Marion, representing individuals and small \nbusinesses in general civil, criminal, workers compensation and family \ncourt matters. In particular, he has developed expertise in torts and \ninsurance, product liability, malpractice and other negligence cases. \nHis Martindale-Hubbell Rating is AV, the highest possible rating. As a \nveteran, I appreciate Mr. Harwell's service for a number of years in \nSouth Carolina's Army National Guard, during which he rose to the rank \nof JAG Captain. He has also contributed to his community as a Trustee \nof the Florence Darlington Technical College and as a business law \nprofessor there. Bryan Harwell will be a fine Federal judge.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, I have had the pleasure \nof knowing Bryan Harwell for a very long time. I have always respected \nhis character as well as his legal abilities. Upon hearing of Judge \nHouck's intention to take Senior Status, I immediately thought of \nBryan. He has distinguished himself in private practice since 1984, \nserving as a pillar of the Florence, SC legal community. Everyone I've \ntalked to about his nomination has been unanimous in their admiration \nfor him and his family.\n  As most of you know, I have based my judicial recommendations to the \nPresident on character, ability, and temperament. Bryan Harwell \nfulfills all of these criteria with a large measure to spare. Indeed, \nhe has displayed excellence in all of these categories for as long as I \nhave known him. Upon graduation from the University of South Carolina \nSchool of Law, where he finished his degree in just over 2 years, Bryan \nclerked for one of our most respected state Circuit Judges, Rodney \nPeeples. Finishing his clerkship with Judge Peeples, he then went on to \nclerk for one of our most accomplished Federal judges, U.S. District \nJudge G. Ross Anderson. Both have had high praise for Bryan's time in \ntheir service.\n  After his clerkships, Bryan entered private practice with the law \nfirm of Harwell, Ballenger, Barth & Hoefer, where he currently \npractices. His practice has involved the complete spectrum of South \nCarolina's laws and he has argued cases before our State Supreme Court \nas well as the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. He has augmented his \nlitigation practice with a thriving mediation and arbitration practice, \nan area I personally believe has great promise for addressing a number \nof our legal system's problems. Last, but certainly not least, he has \nserved his country as a Judge Advocate General officer in the South \nCarolina National Guard.\n  In short, like many lawyers in South Carolina, he has represented the \nworking man and the small businessman and he has served his country as \nwell. I have a tremendous amount of respect for that type of lawyer, \nhaving been one myself.\n  While he has excelled in private practice, Mr. Harwell has also shown \nhis deep commitment to his community. He has opened his practice to \nthose who are less fortunate and who need a helping hand by serving as \na referral attorney for Carolina Regional Legal Services. He has served \nas an adjunct business law instructor at Francis Marion University. \nBryan has participated in the South Carolina Bar's Ask-a-Lawyer \nproject, an important link between our legal community and our \ncitizens, which often serves as the only opportunity many of our \ncitizens have for knowledgeable advice regarding some of life's most \nimportant matters. And, reflecting his varied interests, he has also \nserved on the Board of Trustees at Florence Darlington Technical \nCollege.\n  Bryan Harwell has also gone out of his way to serve South Carolina's \nlegal community. He has served as a lecturer on arbitration and \nmediation law on a number of occasions for our South Carolina Bar.\n  In recognition of his accomplishments and service, I am proud that \nMr. Harwell received a unanimous ``Qualified'' rating from the American \nBar Association. I am certain that he will be an excellent addition to \nthe Federal bench.\n  I am pleased that the Senate has voted to confirm Mr. Harwell today.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor the confirmation of Robert Harwell, who has been nominated to the \nU.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina.\n  Mr. Harwell is an exceptional nominee. A graduate of the University \nof South Carolina School of Law, he brings more than 20 years of legal \nexperience to the Federal bench. After graduation, he clerked \nconsecutively for South Carolina Circuit Judge Rodney A. Peeples and \nU.S. District, South Carolina, Judge G. Ross Anderson, Jr.\n  Let me just say that Mr. Harwell, like my distinguished colleague \nfrom South Carolina, Senator Lindsey Graham, has served as judge \nadvocate general in the South Carolina Army National Guard. I note that \nSenator Graham served in the Air National Guard.\n  After his clerkships, Mr. Harwell entered private practice with the \nlaw firm of Harwell, Ballenger & DeBerry, now known as Harwell, \nBallenger, Barth & Hoefer, LLP, where he currently practices. In \naddition to practicing law, he often serves as a mediator or \narbitrator, skills that will undoubtedly serve him well on the bench.\n  I think my colleagues will agree that Mr. Harwell is a well-qualified \nnominee and will make a fine jurist.\n  Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today we vote on the nomination of Robert \nHarwell to the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina. \nMr. Harwell is the name partner of a litigation firm in South Carolina, \nHarwell, Ballenger, Barth & Hoefer, LLP, where he has practiced law \nsince 1984. He has significant litigation experience, and I support his \nnomination.\n  The Senate will now have confirmed more than two dozen judicial \nnominees of President Bush this year alone. Only 17 judges were \nconfirmed under Republican leadership in the entire 1996 session and no \ncircuit court nominees were confirmed that entire time.

We \nhave confirmed more judicial nominees than his father got confirmed and \nthan during President Reagan's entire term from 1981 through 1984. \nRepublicans should stop their false claims of obstructionism given \nthese broken records.\n  With this confirmation, we have filled every vacant seat in South \nCarolina. It is a pleasure working with both of the Senators from South \nCarolina. I congratulate Mr. Harwell on his confirmation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I voted against the Frist-Daschle resolution \non the Middle East. My constituents are entitled to an explanation. I \nopposed the resolution, and I know the leaders, and indeed all of the \nMembers of this body, are genuinely committed to advancing the cause of \npeace in the Middle East, but no one should be naive enough to think \nthis resolution will move the process forward one centimeter. If \nanything, the lopsided pro-Israel slant of this resolution will serve \nonly to strengthen the growing distrust of moderate Arab States toward \nthe United States.\n  This resolution is a blatantly unfair reading of the current status \nof the Israel-Palestinian conflict. It claims that the President's \nroadmap for peace is still relevant, even though it has been completely \nstalled for more than a year. The resolution wholeheartedly endorses \nPrime Minister Sharon's view of the barrier wall being built in West \nBank, without so much as a mention of the wide opposition to its \nconstruction from moderate Arab countries, such as Jordan.\n  The resolution contains language that could easily be construed to be \nin support of the controversial, and some claim illegal, practice of \nthe targeted assassinations carried out by the Israeli Armed Forces. \nThe United States is completely right to condemn the violence carried \nout by Palestinian terrorists, but we cannot turn a blind eye to the \nunwarranted excesses of the Israeli Government under Mr. Sharon. If our \ncountry truly wants to push both sides toward the negotiating table, we \nshould condemn all violence arising from the Israeli-Palestinian \nconflict, including that which has claimed the lives of innocent \nPalestinians. There is blame to be shouldered by both sides. If we are \nto regain our credibility--let me say that again. If we are to regain \nour credibility as honest brokers in the Middle East, we need to \nacknowledge that fact. Progress will only be made in resolving the \nMiddle East violence when the United States weighs in with a fair, \nevenhanded position that points out the wrongdoings of both sides.\n  Resolutions such as this one are a far cry from being fair, \nobjective, or even-handed.\n  Besides the specific provisions of this resolution, I oppose the \nthrust of the resolution, which is intended to express ``the Sense of \nthe Congress in Support of United States Policy for a Middle East Peace \nProcess.'' The United States has been completely disengaged from the \nIsraeli-Palestinian peace process for far too long, and the number of \nvictims on both sides is growing far too fast. I cannot support a \npolicy that boils down to a benign neglect of the violence in the \nMiddle East.\n  Resolutions such as the one the Senate has taken up today may serve \nas a useful platform for a press release or a stump speech, but they do \nnothing to advance the cause of peace in the Middle East. I would jump \nat the chance to vote for a meaningful resolution that articulated the \nSenate's support of a viable policy to resolve the conflict between the \nPalestinians and the Israelis. But this administration has abandoned \nany pretense of promoting such a policy. To voice the Senate's support \nfor what amounts to a set of empty promises and incendiary rhetoric is \na foolish exercise of which I want no part.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I find it troubling that the war in Iraq is \nnot being equated to the overall war on terror. Polls have shown \nevidence that Americans are not making the connection. So the question \nat hand is, Was removing Saddam's government a positive step in the \noverall war on terror?\n  Our ability to turn over control to a peaceful and sovereign Iraqi \ngovernment is an integral part of the overall war on terror. \nCollaboration of Iraq's former regime with terrorist groups and its \nfunding of them have not been in question. Yet few critics and \nnaysayers have passed up the chance to undermine a link between Iraq \nand al-Qaida.\n  Despite recent media reports that have clouded, or even \nmisrepresented, the facts, there is compelling evidence that al-Qaida \nand Iraq have been linked for more than a decade. Democratic cochairman \nof the 9/11 Commission, former Representative Lee Hamilton of Indiana, \ntold reporters there were connections between al-Qaida and Saddam \nHussein's government.\n  In a speech earlier this afternoon, former Vice President Al Gore \naccused President Bush of lying about a connection between al-Qaida and \nIraq. This is the same Al Gore who was a member of the same Clinton \nWhite House that first made charges about the dangers of Iraq passing \nchemical or biological weapons to al-Qaida. Those charges formed the \nbasis for the missile strikes against alleged terrorist targets in \nSudan in August 1998, according to on-the-record statements from no \nfewer than six top Clinton administration officials.\n  Documents discovered recently by U.S. forces at Saddam's hometown of \nTikrit showed that Iraq gave Abdul Rahman Yasin both a home and a \nsalary. Yasin was a member of the al-Qaida cell that detonated the 1993 \nWorld Trade Center bomb. Is this not a clear example of Iraq not only \nhaving a relationship with al-Qaida but also harboring and rewarding a \nterrorist, a person who was directly involved in a terrorist attack on \nour soil?\n  Let me highlight the case of Zarqawi, arguably the most dangerous \nterrorist in the world today. He and his men trained and fought with \nal-Qaida for years. Zarqawi's network helped establish and operate an \nexplosives and poison facility in northeast Iraq. Not only was Zarqawi \nin Baghdad prior to Saddam's ousting, but nearly two dozen members of \nal-Qaida were there as well. One al-Qaida associate even described the \nsituation in Iraq as good and stated that Baghdad could be transited \nquickly.\n  Let me be clear. Mistakes have been made in Iraq, and this operation \nhas been far from perfect, as evidenced by the fact that Zarqawi and \nother terrorists continue to wreak havoc throughout Iraq. But those who \nundermine the rationale for our mission in Iraq for political gain make \nour mission even more difficult and certainly do not boost the morale \nof our men and women in uniform.\n  Many of these young men and women are from my home State of North \nCarolina. They seek to assist the Iraqi people in transforming a \ncountry that harbored and gave safe haven to terrorists, a country to \nwhich terrorists traveled to consort with one another about how to \nproduce weapons and how to inflict them on a common enemy. The \nterrorists know what is at stake, which is why they are pulling out all \nthe stops to derail our efforts. They understand that a free and \ndemocratic Iraq is a serious blow to their interests.\n  I want our men and women in uniform to know that this Senator \nunderstands and appreciates the importance and the magnitude of the \ngreat work they are doing in Iraq. As my colleague, Senator Lieberman, \nstated very succinctly this morning, the war in Iraq is the central \nbattleground in the war on terror. Because of the efforts and eventual \nsuccess of many brave men and women, the American people and the world \nare much safer.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nKentucky is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/24/senate-section/article/S7408-4", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7408-S7409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RENEWAL OF SANCTIONS AGAINST BURMA\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, a few moments ago, the Senate voted to \nrenew sanctions against one of the worst regimes in the world, the \nregime\n\n[[Page S7409]]\n\nthat runs Burma. The situation in Burma is dire. Suu Kyi and the other \nNLD prodemocracy leaders remain in prison; a crackdown on democracy \nactivists continues; and the SPDC's--that is the name the military \nthugs who run the country have given themselves--inhumane policies of \nchild and forced labor, rape as a weapon of war, narcotics, human \ntrafficking, and the use of child soldiers remains unchanged.\n  The swift passage of this resolution, which we did a few moments ago, \nmatches words of support for freedom in Burma with concrete actions. It \nis past time to judge the military regime in Burma not by what it says \nbut by what it does. The junta misled governments throughout the region \ninto thinking that the May 17 constitutional convention would be a step \nforward in the reconciliation process, but it was not. The convention \nwas nothing more than a summer camp for the sycophants of the military \nregime.\n  I am pleased our allies are increasing pressure on the junta. The \nEuropean Union recently cancelled the Asia-Europe meeting because of \nBurma. It is an important step in the right direction. The EU should \nconsider additional sanctions against the military regime.\n  More must be done. The U.N. Security Council should take up Burma for \na discussion and for sanction and ASEAN should abandon the outdated \npolicy of noninterference in member states' affairs.\n  One common subject must remain and that is the full and unfettered \nparticipation of Suu Kyi and the NLD, her political party, and ethnic \nminorities in a meaningful reconciliation process. I have two words for \nthe regional neighbors of Burma: ASEAN 2006. That is the year Burma \ntakes over chairmanship. That is 2 short years from now, which would \nresult in a tremendous loss of face for that association.\n  Despite their worst efforts over the past 14 years, the SPDC has \nfailed to smother the flames of freedom in Burma. I continue to be \ninspired by reports of activists who bravely and nonviolently defy the \njunta's illegitimate rule, like the handful arrested last month for \ndistributing pamphlets in several Burmese townships marking the 1-year \nanniversary of the Depayin massacre.\n  It would be wise for the SPDC to accept the time-tested fact that Suu \nKyi and the NLD are not going anywhere. They, and the ethnic \nminorities, are an integral part of the solution to the Burmese \nproblem.\n  To wit, the NLD and their supporters made the courageous and correct \ndecision to boycott the sham SPDC-orchestrated constitutional \nconvention last month. I am pleased that international condemnation by \nthe United States, United Nations, European Union and regional \nneighbors of the hollow convention was rightly aimed at the SPDC. The \ngenerals in Rangoon made any number of assurances to foreign diplomats \nthat the process would be inclusive. It clearly was not.\n  This only underscores the imperative to judge the SPDC not by what it \nsays but by what it does.\n  The convention turned out to be nothing more than a summer camp for \nSPDC sycophants. According to the Washington Times, the junta required \ntheir handpicked delegates to ``bathe at reasonable times, avoid junk \nfood and live in self-contained camps where they can enjoy karaoke, \nmovies and golf.''\n  Import sanctions by the United States alone will not help facilitate \na meaningful reconciliation process in Burma. We need the U.N., E.U., \nand regional neighbors to fully commit to the cause. This was made \nclear by the NLD in a recent plea to U.N. General-Secretary Kofi Annan \nto ``take this matter to the Security Council''.\n  The U.N. should help the NLD and the people of Burma by examining the \nclear and present danger Burma poses to the region. This must include \nnarcotics production and trafficking, the spread of HIV/AIDS throughout \nthe region, the gross human rights violations of the SPDC, the plight \nof Burmese refugees and IDPs, and alarming reports of the junta's \ninterests in North Korean missiles and Russian nuclear technology.\n\n  The E.U. should help the NLD and the Burmese people by examining its \nsanctions regime and imposing further punitive measures against the \njunta. I am pleased that our allies in the E.U. recently canceled the \nupcoming Asia-Europe Meeting, ASEM, dialogue in Brussels over the \nattendance of the SPDC. The junta has no place at this multilateral \ntable.\n  Regional neighbors should help the Burmese people buy reconsidering \nthe Association of Southeast Asian Nation's, ASEAN, outdated policy of \nnoninterference in the internal affairs of member states.\n  Asian leaders must recognize the regime for what it is, wholly \nillegitimate to the people of Burma, the international community and \nthe region. The SPDC's export of illicit drugs and HIV/AIDS is, \nliterally, burying the children of Asia. All of Asia's youth, not only \nthose in Burma, face a future that is undermined by Burmese-spread \ndrugs and disease.\n  The region cannot ignore the fact of the junta's chairmanship of \nASEAN in 2006. There could be no greater loss of face for that \nassociation than being under the guidance of the SPDC.\n  Let me close by thanking all 53 of my colleagues who joined me in \nsponsoring the sanctions resolution. I want to recognize in particular \nthe efforts of Senators Feinstein and McCain and their respective \nstaffs to support freedom and justice in Burma. The Burmese people have \nno greater friends in the Senate, or in Washington. I also appreciate \nthe efforts by Senators Grassley and Baucus and their respective staffs \nto expedite consideration of the legislation.\n  I would be remiss if I did not note the words of support of the NLD \nmade by former Mongolian Prime Minister Tashika Elbegdorj, the Same \nRainsy Party in Cambodia, and the cross-party Burma Caucus formed by \nMalaysian parliamentarians. Although they are engaged in their own \nefforts, and, in some cases, struggles, for democracy and human rights \nin their respective countries, they stand in solidarity with the people \nof Burma.\n  I encourage other neighbors to find their voice in support of the Suu \nKyi and the NLD during these troubling times.\n  I thank the 53 cosponsors of this resolution, in particular Senators \nFeinstein and McCain. Burma has no better friends in Washington than \nDianne Feinstein and John McCain.\n  I also appreciate the efforts of Senators Grassley and Baucus and \ntheir respective staffs to move the bill in an expeditious manner.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from Secretary of State Colin \nPowell indicating the State Department's support for the continuation \nof the sanctions we earlier today imposed with our vote in the Senate \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       The Secretary of State,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 30, 2004.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, Committee on \n         Appropriations, United States Senate.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to reaffirm the State \n     Department's support for the continuation of the restrictions \n     on imports from Burma, as I stated in my testimony before the \n     Senate Appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations on \n     April 8. Our sanctions represent a clear and powerful \n     expression of American disapproval of the developments in \n     Burma. This action is a key component of our policy in \n     bringing democracy and improved human rights to Burma, as \n     well as supporting the morale of Burmese democracy activists.\n       I support wholeheartedly passage of the Joint Resolution \n     you introduced along with Senator Feinstein. Thank you for \n     your leadership on this issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Colin L.

Mr. President, almost a century and a half ago, the \nabolitionist Frederick Douglass spoke:\n\n       The whole history of the progress of human liberty shows \n     that all concessions yet made to her august claims, have been \n     born of earnest struggle . . .\n       If there is no struggle, there is no progress. Those who \n     profess to favor freedom, and yet deprecate agitation, are \n     men who want crops without plowing up the ground, they want \n     rain without thunder and lightning.\n       They want the ocean without the awful roar of its many \n     waters.\n\n  We could find no wiser counsel as we approach the historic \ntransitioning of\n\n[[Page S7410]]\n\nIraq to self-rule on June 30. Mr. Douglass' words which rang true in \n1857 continue to do so through 2004. As one dark chapter closes and a \nnew, brighter one is set to open in Iraq, we recall his words that the \nfreedom of man has not yet been fully attained, nor is it freely \nconceded. There is a price to freedom's struggle that tragically \nincludes loss.\n  In short, freedom is not free. As Iraq struggles to transition from \ndictatorship to democracy, we all suffer with the loss of each soldier. \nWe all bear the pain of Iraqi men, women, and children suffering from \nterrorist attacks and Hussein holdovers. But not all shrink back from \nfreedom's struggle upon hearing, feeling, and understanding its price.\n  The risks and travails of securing freedom are too easily forgotten \nby a complacent humanity. Yet, we do not need to leap back centuries to \ncomprehend the expense of freedom's attainment. Just a few years ago, \nwe understood that freedom has a price.\n  In 1983, the head of Solidarity in Poland, Lech Walesa, spoke of \nfreedom's price when receiving his Nobel Prize:\n\n       With deep sorrow I think of those who paid with their lives \n     for the loyalty to ``Solidarity''; of those who are behind \n     prison bars and who are victims of repressions. I think of \n     all those with whom I have traveled the same road and with \n     whom I shared the trials and tribulations of our time.\n\n  Nor did the struggle for freedom end with the cold war. In his 1999 \naddress to NATO, Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia stated:\n\n       The fact that a former powerful strategic adversary has \n     disappeared from the scene does not, however, mean that in \n     the world of today, human lives, human rights, human dignity, \n     and the freedom of nations are no longer in danger. They are, \n     unfortunately, still being threatened, and collective defence \n     of the democratic states of the Euro-Atlantic sphere of \n     civilization, therefore, still remains a valid concept.\n\n  History did not end with the end of the cold war. Yet, despite the \nattack of 9/11, some want to believe that history has ended, or that \nstruggling for freedom is unnecessary or obsolete. They believe either \nthat mankind enjoys all the freedom that it is due, or that freedom \ncannot be preserved or expanded by means of force or combat.\n  In either case, any would-be leader of the Free World cannot both \nprofess such beliefs and still claim the determination to protect \nfreedom in the post-9/11 world.\n  Not for this Nation, not for this time, and not for this struggle.\n  President Bush believes otherwise. He understands what Frederick \nDouglass meant when he said:\n\n       Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and \n     it never will . . .\n\n  While we have not yet witnessed the conclusion of this most recent \nstruggle for freedom, we have seen the trials and tribulations this \nPresident faces.\n  I believe President Bush is trying to wage the War on Terrorism \nagainst unprecedented and incredible words and deeds of disunity here \nat home. Every citizen is ensured the right to dissent. Every President \nwho volunteers to serve in that high office understands and is sworn to \nuphold that right to dissent. While this Nation has had great leaders \nwho have stood at the helm through many challenges to our national \nsecurity, I wonder if they could have been successful without the \nsupport of those who put the best for their Nation ahead of the best \nfor their party. For such is the unique challenge to victory this \nPresident confronts. Consider a historical comparison of the challenges \nthis President faces now against those of a President in our recent \npast.\n  In World War II, President Roosevelt stated the national goal of \n``unconditional surrender.'' In the War on Terrorism, President Bush \nsimilarly outlined the national goal of ``regime change'' in Iraq. The \nparamount national goal in wartime should be a unifying force in any \nnation. In World War II, it was. Republicans echoed President \nRoosevelt's demand for the ``unconditional surrender,'' not just of \nJapan, but of Germany and Italy as well.\n  In the War on Terror, Democrats have echoed President Bush's call for \n``regime change,'' but not in Iraq. Instead, they called for ``regime \nchange here at home.'' Democrats contend it is the President of the \nUnited States, not the dictator of Iraq, that's the ``regime'' that \nneeds toppling for the world to be safe.\n  Perhaps this is just political sloganeering, but can anyone imagine \nthe Republican candidate for President in 1944 calling for \n``unconditional surrender'' here at home? That would have spurred a \nfirestorm of criticism and probably doomed the candidate. In 2004, it \nhas helped a candidate secure his nomination for President. Many of \nthese critics justify cries of ``regime change at home'' because they \nbelieve the war was unnecessary. They believe that after the terrorist \nattack of 9/11, the war on Iraq was a diversion from the ``real'' war \non terrorism.\n  Shortly after Pearl Harbor, President Roosevelt announced a ``Germany \nFirst'' strategy. In his judgment, Germany was a greater threat than \nJapan because of its wealth, location, and advanced weaponry. It became \nthe theatre of World War II that commanded most of the attention and \nresources in that war.\n  Shortly after 9/11 and the opening operations against al-Qaida's \npuppet government in Afghanistan, President Bush announced that Iraq \nwas a grave and gathering threat because of its wealth, location, and \nadvanced weaponry.\n  It therefore has become the theatre in the war on terrorism that \ndemands our greater attention and resources. If today's critics had \nexisted then, President Roosevelt's ``Germany First'' strategy would \nhave been roundly criticized. Today's critics would have claimed \nRoosevelt had always wanted to ``get'' Germany. They would have claimed \nthat his War Department had been planning war against Germany ever \nsince the previous war. They would claim Roosevelt was engaging in a \npersonal anti-fascism campaign that ignored and diverted attention from \nthe search for the attackers of Pearl Harbor. He would be charged with \nmaking America less safe as he failed to focus all resources solely \nupon Japan. And if Roosevelt had listened to these critics, Britain \nwould have fallen, and likely the Soviet Union too, and the Third Reich \nwould have covered the better part of three continents--Europe, Asia, \nand Africa. A new Dark Age would have descended.\n  For those who might have felt the ``Germany First'' strategy in World \nWar II was misplaced or that the entire Germany effort was an \n``unnecessary war,'' one overwhelming discovery confirmed it was the \nright thing to do.\n  The horrific evidence of a holocaust was exposed at the end of the \nwar. That gruesome discovery of wholesale genocide granted finality to \nthe righteousness and sanctity that belonged to those who led and \nfought in the war against the Nazis. But the difference between now and \nthen is that the Iraq holocaust does not justify our action; in fact, \nby many critics, it is not even noted. Think of that. Mr. President, \n300,000 dead in Iraq and that is not a consideration for most critics \nof the war effort.\n  I defy anyone to show me where these critics devote even one sentence \nto this holocaust in the paragraphs and pages attacking this war as \nwrong, unnecessary, immoral, and unjust.\n  When did life become so cheap as to be irrelevant?\n  Thankfully, Roosevelt ignored his few misguided critics and this \nPresident should follow his lead. America needs the will of Churchill, \nnot the waffling of Chamberlain. America needs leaders like Roosevelt \nand Reagan who recognized evil and were willing to call it by its \nrightful name. They knew the time to talk was over and the time to act \nwas now, rather than never. Upon such will, such resolve, and such \nsimple honesty lies the strength and endurance of our Nation and its \nprecious freedoms. President Bush is a man of such mettle.\n  No one here or abroad doubts this President will act. He does not \nwaffle, he does not double-talk, and he does not hide behind the \ntimidity of others. Nor is he guided by his critics and their partisan \nagenda. He is a man for this time. Now, because of his leadership, on \nthis June 30, the time has come for liberty to emerge from struggle and \nstrife, and to again stride forward.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n\n[[Page S7411]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the hour is late, and I know we will be \nwrapping up in about 30 minutes or so. There is a lot of business with \nthe recess tomorrow--and we will be in tomorrow--and we will be \nwrapping up tonight. It will take a while to wrap up. We will be doing \nthat in about 30 minutes or so.\n  Thus, I would like to take a few minutes to come to the floor and \ntake advantage of the time to talk about the fascinating trip I had the \nopportunity and the privilege to take about 3 weeks ago. I had the \nprivilege of traveling to Normandy, France, to celebrate the 60th \nanniversary of the D-day landings.\n  That same week, as my colleagues know, we suspended business on the \nfloor of the Senate to pay tribute to President Ronald Reagan--again, a \nwonderful week in that the messages were delivered and the tributes \nwere shared.\n  In the midst of that, however, I did not have the opportunity to \nshare with my colleagues some of my experiences from the D-day \ncelebration in Normandy, France, and thus I would like to take this \nopportunity to do that.\n  This particular journey took with two of our colleagues, Senator Bob \nBennett and Senator John Ensign. The three of us had a truly \nextraordinary experience. We spent the previous 2 days in Baghdad, \nIraq, and in Kuwait, and then flew from Baghdad to the U.S.-French \nbinational ceremony at Omaha Beach.\n  Back in 1944, in the thick of war, Fortress Europe was the strongest \nat this point, reinforced with layers of obstacles, mines, and gun \npositions with hardened bunkers. Some of those structures are still \nthere today. You can see the remnants of others. These remnants stand \ntoday almost as ghostly reminders of those battles that I had the \nopportunity to hear described firsthand by the veterans who had come \nback for the celebration.\n  At Normandy, Nazi forces were commanded, as we all know, by none \nother than Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, the ``Desert Fox'' of North \nAfrica fame who was regarded as the finest, the very best field \ncommander in the German Army. He won practically every battle he \nenjoined. His defenses were considered impenetrable.\n  In the early morning of June 6, 1944--of course, that was the day so \nmany years later that we were there--American soldiers, mainly from the \n1st Infantry Division and 29th Infantry Division, landed at that beach \nwe visited now several weeks ago. They were supported by the Army Air \nForce flying over and Naval gunfire. They struggled forward inch by \ninch, out of boats up the beach, as fellow soldiers were literally cut \ndown one by one, wounded, and killed in this hail of enemy gunfire.\n  We have all read about what went on at that beach, but to have that \nopportunity to hear firsthand, as we walked along the ridge above that \nbeach, from people who were there. Many of them had not talked a lot--\nat least they said they had not talked a lot about their experience. \nThey seemed to open up as we were there. Many of them were there at the \nage of 16, 17, 18, or 19 years of age. And they all described the \nbattle raging. Body counts swelled, and many expressed doubt that they \nwould succeed--they described it as such--that every second seemed like \nan eternity.\n  It was clear that in spite of all this, soldiers, through boldness \nand through courage, persevered.\n  Further down the beach, the U.S. Army Rangers had scaled the cliffs \nat Pointe du Hoc and knocked out the German artillery positions that \nwere there to disrupt any invasion force.\n  By the end of that blood-soaked day, our American boys had pierced \nthat Atlantic wall. They seized their objectives. And, as history would \nprove, because we had the opportunity to celebrate, they launched the \nliberation of Europe.\n  Thousands of American soldiers perished in those few hours. Their \nheroism today is marked by the familiar pictures today with television \nand C-SPAN and video--the familiar pictures of all of those white \ncrosses against that green grass and the Stars of David, all in very \nneat rows. Wherever you stand, you see them lined up parallel, \nhorizontally and vertically, or diagonally. Wherever you stand, the \nsymmetry jumps out at you. It goes on for acres and acres. I have no \nidea how big it is. But these crosses go on for acres.\n  There is a little path where the beach is right below. You can walk \nalong these winding paths of the cemetery. As you do so--especially, I \nthink on this day, when the sky was bright blue, the white crosses, the \ngreen grass--there were veterans by the hundreds and, indeed, by the \nthousands with their family members, with, obviously, their daughters, \nsons, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren huddling around them as \nthey walked along those paths. One could not help but admire their \nbravery, their boldness at a time in their life when they were very \nyoung, at a time they had to be uncertain; they were far away from \nhome, fighting a ruthless enemy. Each cross and each star, obviously, \nrepresents a young man, a young person who died on June 6th, 1944, \ndefending his country.\n\n  The crowds would gather as we were there. A lot of people had come \nin. There was a lot of security at the gathering to hear President Bush \nand President Chirac. As the crowd gathered, we were seated amidst the \nsea of veterans. Usually they put the officials in one or two rows, \nseparated, but, no, you would sit in the audience surrounded by scores \nand scores of veterans.\n  A few minutes ago I called Congressman Charlie Rangel to talk about \nanother bill we will be talking about later tonight. In that \nconversation I was reminded of the fact that 2 weeks ago he was there. \nHe called me over to meet several veterans from New York. There was \nanother woman, Grace Bender, a neighbor of mine in Washington, DC. I \nhad no idea I would see her there. She was there a few rows away with \nher father, of whom she was clearly so proud.\n  The veterans were gathering with their buddies and with their family \nmembers, with their shipmates, with their fellow crewmen. Even after 60 \nyears, they clearly regarded these colleagues, these comrades in arms, \nas brothers, bonds forged over that period of a day, weeks, and those \nmonths in the midst of this war.\n  I vividly remember standing for the national anthem. As we all stood \nup, the first people on their feet were those veterans, the ``greatest \ngeneration.'' They were the first to stand. I also noted, they were the \nones who would be singing the loudest. They seemed to stand the \ntallest. Their love of country clearly had even grown over time.\n  President Bush spoke and delivered captivating remarks. President \nChirac also delivered stirring remarks. They both recounted specific \nmoments and acts of heroism on D-day. We honored those who gathered and \nwe paid tribute to those who were no longer with us, the soldiers and \nthe sailors and the airmen who had made that ultimate sacrifice for the \ncause of freedom.\n  The ceremony ended with a ceremony of honor guards. Again, my heart \nfilled with awe and admiration to be able to walk with those veterans \non that D-day celebration. They were then, and they clearly remain \ntoday, true heroes.\n  After the ceremony, my colleagues and I boarded a bus to the town of \nBayeaux, a small French village that was spared the heavy fighting and \nbombing on D-day and of the weeks that followed. As we rode the bus \nthrough the countryside, we passed through beautiful green fields, \nhedgerows, and small towns of the French countryside that were showered \nin 1944 by the American paratroopers of the 101st and the 82nd Airborne \nDivisions, the night before those Normandy landings.\n  I specifically mention the 101st because this past weekend I had the \nopportunity to be in Clarksville, TN, and Fort Campbell, KY, and had \nthe opportunity to witness an air show in which the 101st Airborne \nparticipated. You can see dramatically their training exercises.\n  While I was in Kentucky last week, again, I was thinking back to what \nhappened in 1944 when these paratroopers of the 101st and 82nd Airborne \nDivisions paratrooped in the night before. Thousands of those \nparatroopers, as we all know, were killed. Many of them drowned. Many \nwere wounded that night. Many were wounded on the\n\n[[Page S7412]]\n\njump itself. The mission was specifically to jump behind enemy lines to \ndistract the Nazis and seize important strategic or key terrain and to \ndisrupt the Nazi reinforcements. Their heroism and success were \nultimately crucial to the allied victories at Omaha Beach, at Juno, at \nSword, and at Gold.\n\n  When we arrived in Bayeaux, we were greeted by the President of the \nFrench Senate. We had the opportunity to have lunch there with 33 \nmembers of their Senate. We also met with the town mayor, and many of \nthe town citizens came out to speak of this. I don't speak French, but \nas I went over to the side and shook hands and introduced myself to an \ninterpreter, immediately a smile came on their faces with an expression \nof appreciation and thanks.\n  Among the people we had the opportunity to meet were many survivors \nof war who had been small children at the time of the occupation. They \ndid recall D-day and the American GIs who liberated their villages.\n  They treated us to a wonderful luncheon that day and, once again, \nrepresenting America as officials, U.S. Senators from America, we were \nshowered with praise and thanks, as well as a promise of continued \nfriendship and alliance. This was a group of French Senators, so I did \nnot expect that at the time, but that is what we received.\n  Our final event for the day was also very special. It was the \nmultinational ceremony at Arromanches. We were joined by gatherings of \nheads of state from around the world, senior officials from countries \naround the world, and a number of our allied nations. We watched a \nwhole range of demonstrations by various multinational military \nmarching units. We had flyovers occur where a number of these nations \ndemonstrated the very best of their aircraft in precision flights \noverhead. They had a wonderful multimedia presentation that combined \nthe best of dance and video and audio to recount that history of World \nWar II with a very special focus on Normandy.\n  During the final ceremony of the day, in which President Chirac \ndelivered remarks, we did have the opportunity to reflect on those \nlarger contours of the war and how America and her allies united to \ndefeat tyranny and oppression.\n  As we sat among the survivors of D-day and as we listened to \nAmerica's veterans recount their fears and exploits, I could not help \nbut draw comparisons between the veterans of World War II and our proud \ntroops serving abroad today, the very same troops which 2 days prior my \ncolleagues and I had the opportunity to visit in Baghdad and in Kuwait. \nThe parallel is there, not just because of the temporal relationship, \nbut because of both groups' commitment to freedom and democracy and to \na better life for others.\n  America was blessed in World War II on that June 6th, so long ago, \nyet so close, as it is now, to have the very same soldiers who have \nthat strong character, who have that courage, that boldness, and that \ndetermination. Young patriots, then, as now, answered the call of duty, \nand through their bravery and through their selfless determination, \nthey fought and they won the battle for freedom and security.\n  It was these traits that inspired a whole succession of American \nPresidents, including the late President Reagan to whom we paid tribute \n2 weeks ago. He believed in a Europe and a world whole and free of the \nshadow of communism. The ``greatest generation'' threat involved nazism \nand fascism. For nearly 50 years, America confronted another hegemonic \nideology, that being communism. Under the leadership and vision of \nPresident Reagan, we emerged from the cold war victorious and, as \nMargaret Thatcher rightly reminds us, without firing a single shot.\n  Today, we do fight a different enemy, but one that is no less \nruthless, no less determined, no less uncompromising than our enemies \nof those wars past.\n  Once again, we must stay the course. Once again, we must have faith \nin our Armed Forces. Once again, we must hold tightly to the belief \nthat freedom will prevail. That is our challenge. That is our calling. \nAnd I truly believe, like generations before us, we will look evil \nsquarely in the eye, and we will not flinch, we will not run. We will \ngather up our courage to press forward. We will gather up our courage \nto press forward and defeat the forces of terror and secure the \nblessings of democracy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/24/senate-section/article/S7412-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7412-S7413]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AFRICAN GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITY ACT\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, on a separate issue, I want to comment on \nan issue I mentioned this morning in opening the U.S. Senate, an issue \nthat centers on something very close to my heart, and that is the \ncontinent of Africa.\n  I have had the opportunity to travel to Africa this year, to a number \nof African countries, and the year before that, and the year before \nthat, and the year before that. Indeed, I have had the opportunity to \ntravel to the continent of Africa yearly for the last several years.\n  In each case, with maybe one or two exceptions where I went as an \nofficial, I have had the opportunity to travel to Africa as part of a \nmedical mission group, where I have the real privilege of being able to \ninteract with the peoples of Africa--whether it is in Kenya, or \nTanzania, or Uganda, or the Sudan; the Sudan is where I usually go--by \ndelivering health care and medicine, and performing surgery, which is \nwhat I happen to do when I visit with peoples who might not otherwise \nhave access to that health care.\n  I mention that only because it allows me to be able to talk to real \npeople, not just as an official or a VIP coming in, not as somebody \nwearing a suit from the United States of America, but to have the \nopportunity to interact with real people in that doctor-patient \nrelationship. I say doctor-patient relationship; really it is a friend-\nto-friend relationship. You hear stories, and you really cut through \nsuperfluous aspects of people's lives and go right to the heart of what \naffects them in their lives.\n  It really comes down to how they can provide for their families, how \nthey can get a job, how they can earn an income, and how they can, in a \nvery primitive way but a very real way, make the lives of their \nchildren better than theirs--the same desires we all have as Americans.\n  I am talking about people in the bush, people in the heart of Africa, \npeople 1,000 miles south of Khartoum and 500 miles west of the Nile \nRiver, way in the bush. When you talk to people, you realize they \nstruggle with the exact same things we do, and that is, dignity; that \nis, a concept of self-worth.\n  Also, I had the opportunity to travel to Uganda and Kenya and \nthroughout East and Central Africa. What people will tell you is that \npolicy in the United States makes a difference in their lives; that is, \npolicy over the last several years. You may ask them: How do you know \nwhat we do? They know that a bill that was passed on the floor of the \nSenate and the House of Representatives not too many years ago, signed \nby President Clinton, called the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act, has \nmade a difference in their lives.\n  Indeed, that particular act, passed by the Senate, has created at \nleast 150,000 jobs. When President Museveni from Uganda was here, he \nsaid, no, it is more than that. It is 300,000 jobs. But the point is, \nthousands and thousands of jobs have been created in Africa because of \nlegislation that passed on this floor. And a little bit later tonight, \nhopefully in a few minutes, it will be passed on this floor once again.\n  I mentioned a few minutes ago I called Congressman Charlie Rangel. I \ndid that to congratulate him because he has spearheaded, along with \nmany of his colleagues in the House of Representatives, this particular \nbill, a bill that is called H.R. 4103, the AGOA Acceleration Act of \n2004. AGOA simply stands for African Growth and Opportunity Act.\n\n  The bill we will be addressing here tonight extends the AGOA \npreference by 7 years, from 2008 to 2015, and, more importantly, it \nextends the third country fabric provisions that were due to expire \nthis year for another 3 years.\n  The African Growth and Opportunity Act authorizes the President to \nprovide duty-free treatment for certain articles imported from sub-\nSaharan African countries. It also provides duty- and quota-free access \nto the U.S. market for apparel made from U.S. fabric, yarn, and thread.\n  The program has been a huge success for U.S. policy toward sub-\nSaharan Africa. AGOA has helped expand African\n\n[[Page S7413]]\n\ntrade. It has created jobs, as I mentioned. It has brought about \nimprovements in economic conditions that will be realized in a very \nsustained way throughout Africa. Expanded trade, as we all know, not \nonly helps sub-Saharan African countries develop this sustainable \neconomic base, but it also leads to efficient government practices, to \ntransparency, and to political stability.\n  U.S. exports to sub-Saharan Africa increased 13 percent from 2002 to \n2003. It has created jobs. The United States, today, is sub-Saharan \nAfrica's largest single export market, accounting for 26 percent of the \nregion's total exports in 2001 alone. U.S. imports under AGOA have \nalmost doubled between 2001 and 2003--up to the 2003 level of over $13 \nbillion.\n  One African leader described the program as ``the greatest friendship \nact'' by the U.S. Government towards Africa. In fact, the program has \nbeen so well received and effective in Africa that the European Union \nis now reexamining its preference program for Africa in light of AGOA's \nsuccess.\n  So, Mr. President, I am pleased that we are going to address this \nlegislation tonight. Again, having spent so much time in Africa, it is \nwith great pride that I congratulate my colleagues for addressing this \nimportant issue tonight.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/24/senate-section/article/S7413-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7413]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THIS WEEK IN THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I want to talk, if I can, about another \nmatter to which I have given a great deal of thought. I would like to \nshare some thoughts with my colleagues on it this afternoon.\n  I would like to begin by referencing a trip I took last weekend. I \ntraveled to Kuwait, Jordan, and Iraq with Senators Biden and Graham. We \nwent to Baghdad to talk with coalition and Iraqi leaders as they \nprepare for the historic transfer of sovereignty to Iraq 6 days from \ntoday. We went to thank our troops who are making enormous sacrifices, \nbraving extraordinary risks every minute of the day. We wanted to \nassure them they have the support and respect of every Member of the \nSenate and all Americans.\n  Our trip was especially productive because of the experiences and \ninsights of the Senators with whom I traveled. Senator Joe Biden, the \nranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has been a \nleading voice in the Senate on foreign policy issues for now almost a \nquarter century.\n  Senator Lindsey Graham has quickly established himself as one of the \nmost authoritative and independent voices on the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee. Senator Graham, as we all know, is a colonel and a Reserve \njudge in the Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals. He and I have been \nworking together for more than a year to improve health care benefits \nto National Guard members and their families. I know from working with \nhim on the TRICARE bill that he is fiercely committed to American \ntroops and American veterans.\n  Lindsey Graham is a proud Republican. Joe Biden and I are proud \nDemocrats. But we are all, first and foremost, proud Americans. We are \nall committed to the safety of our troops. We all want the Iraqi people \nto succeed in building a stable, free, and pluralistic Iraq. It is in \ntheir interest, but it is also in America's interest and, I would \nargue, the world's interest.\n  Our trip to Iraq reminded me again how much this Senate and the \nAmerican people benefit when we are able to focus on the problems that \nunite us.\n  No one who saw it will ever forget the cloudless, deep blue sky on \nthe morning of September 11. Pilots have a term for visibility \nconditions on days like that--they call it ``severe clear.''\n  We all saw it clearly that day. We saw horrific acts of inhumanity, \nbut we also saw, with equal clarity, countless acts of nobility and \ncompassion. We saw beyond the labels of race, income, gender, and the \nother distinctions that too often divide us.\n  We are more alike than we are different. All Americans want to live \nin a world that is safe and secure and just. Whether we're Republicans \nor Democrats, or don't care one whit about politics, all Americans want \nto be able to earn enough to care for our families' basic needs. After \na lifetime of working hard, all Americans want to be able to retire \nwith dignity and security. All Americans need affordable health care. \nAll Americans want to be able to send their children to good schools; \nthat is not simply a Democratic or Republican aspiration, it is a \nnecessity for our children's future and the economic, political, and \nsocial well-being of our Nation.\n  These are dangerous and challenging times, but Americans have faced \ndanger and challenges before, and we must always remember that we have \nemerged stronger when we have faced those challenges together. We are \nstronger together than separately.\n  This afternoon, I want to talk about how I believe the Members of the \nSenate can work together more constructively to solve the big \nchallenges facing our country today.\n  The result of all-or-nothing politics is too often nothing. We owe \nthe American people better than that.\n  I believe in what I like to call the Politics of Common Ground. \nPracticing the Politics of Common Ground does not mean betraying one's \nprinciples. We can bend on details without abandoning our basic \nbeliefs. The Politics of Common Ground is pragmatic, not dogmatic. It \nrecognizes there can be different ways to reach the same goal. It puts \nour common interests ahead of personal or partisan interests. Instead \nof narrow ideological victories, the politics of common ground seeks \nbroad, principled compromise.\n\n  I recognize some people may think this timing is strange, to talk \nabout searching for common ground now in the midst of campaign season. \nBut I actually believe it is exactly the right time.\n  The truth is, no one knows which party will control the Senate next \nyear, or the House, or the White House, so neither party can be accused \nof embracing these ideas for partisan advantage.\n  The Politics of Common Ground rests on four fundamental commitments. \nObviously it takes at least two to seek common ground. Neither party \ncan make these principles work alone. If Democrats hold the majority in \nthe next Senate, these are the four fundamental principles by which we \nwould seek to govern:\n  First, deal in good faith with the executive branch, regardless of \nwhich party holds the majority.\n  Second, preserve and fulfill the historical role of the Senate \nregarding budgetary responsibilities, oversight, and advice and consent \non nominees, regardless of which party holds the majority.\n  Third, respect the rights of the minority and seek to work in good \nfaith with them.\n  Fourth, end the cycle of partisan retaliation.\n  This week marks the 40th anniversary of the passage of the 1964 Civil \nRights Act, one of the greatest common ground victories in our Nation's \nhistory.\n  It was a Democratic President, Lyndon Johnson, who signed the Civil\n\n[[Page S7414]]\n\nRights Act, but it was a courageous Republican leader, Senator Everett \nDirksen, who provided the political leadership that finally ended the \nyears of opposition and put the civil rights bill on the President's \ndesk.\n  There are some today who believe the only way to move America forward \nis to ignore or change the rules of the Senate. What their arguments \nfail to recognize is the Founding Fathers deliberately designed this \nSenate to protect the rights of the minority. They did so because they \nunderstood that the only way to make just and lasting change in a \ndemocracy is to first build broad support for it. They also understood, \nas Everett Dirksen said in calling for the vote on the Civil Rights \nAct, that nothing can stop an idea whose time has come.\n  Finding common ground requires that we follow the rules of the \nSenate, not ignore or rewrite them.\n  It requires that all Senators--whether they are in the majority or \nminority--be treated fairly. That means safeguarding the rights of \nevery Senator. It means establishing fair representation on all Senate \ncommittees. And it means observing the traditional procedures for \nconference committees concerning the appointment of conferees, and the \nright of all conferees to participate fully in all meetings. A closed \nmeeting that is a conference committee in name only is no place to look \nfor common ground.\n\n  Finding common ground also means listening to each other.\n  Someone who was a good friend to many of us, Senator Pat Moynihan, \nused to blame television for what he saw as a decline in cross-party \ncooperation in the Senate. Before TV, he said, Senators from both \nparties used to spend their evenings talking to each other. It helped \nto see things from the other person's perspective.\n  I would like to see the Senate create more opportunities to increase \ncross-party understanding.\n  Next year, I would like to see the Senate hold bipartisan leadership \nmeetings every 2 months at least, and bipartisan joint caucus meetings \nat least every quarter.\n  I would like to see us hold periodic, bipartisan policy forums for \nall Senators in the Old Senate Chamber, where the Missouri Compromise \nand other historic agreements were reached.\n  When Senator Lott was majority leader, he established the Leaders \nLecture Series to draw on the wisdom of former Senate leaders, from \nMike Mansfield and Senator Byrd to Robert Dole and George Herbert \nWalker Bush.\n  The Leaders Lecture Series represents one of the most insightful \nseminars ever taught on common ground politics.\n  I would like to see us build on that success next year by inviting \nformer Senate leaders to a summit where they can share their ideas with \nus, and with each other.\n  Senators Dorgan and Kyl had a good idea recently to hold occasional, \nthoughtful, Lincoln-Douglas style debates here on the Senate floor on \nthe most important issues of the day. Let us build on those debates \nnext year.\n  President Reagan was as ideological a President as any of us have \never seen. But he understood that political adversaries don't have to \nbe enemies.\n  He and Tip O'Neill had a rule: after 6 o'clock, they were always \nfriends.\n  Something as simple as just getting our families together once in a \nwhile for a barbecue or a potluck supper--or even choosing an annual \ncharity to which all Senators could contribute--could help Senators \nfind common ground, I think, and may strengthen the bonds of friendship \nand trust between our two parties.\n  In addition, I would like to see the Senate reward the search for \ncommon ground solutions by giving special consideration to bills with \nstrong bipartisan co-sponsorship.\n  There are questions of enormous consequence facing our Nation today--\nquestions that will define what kind of Nation we are, and what sort of \nfuture we will leave for our children.\n  How de we balance freedom and security in a post-September 11 world?\n  How do we keep the good jobs we have and create more of them in a \nglobal economy?\n  How do we craft a national budget that reflects our national values?\n  How can we reduce our over-reliance on imported oil so the fate of \nour Nation is not tied so directly to the stability of some of the most \ndangerous and volatile places on Earth?\n  Last year, I got a note from a father in South Dakota who had lost a \ngood-paying job as a machinist 2 years earlier when his employer moved \nout of state. He was working as a handyman, earning a fraction of his \nold income. The only health insurance he and his wife could afford had \nsuch a high deductible that they tried never to use it. He hadn't seen \na doctor in 15 years or a dentist in 10 years. He felt ashamed. The \nworst part, he said, was having to tell his children, when they got \nsick, that there was no money for a doctor.\n  Because Republicans and Democrats in Congress had the courage to \npractice the Politics of Common Ground 7 years ago, I was able to tell \nthat father about the Children's Health Insurance Program.\n  Today, if his children are sick, he takes them to the doctor. As he \nputs it, ``I show the people in the doctor's office that card and I'm \ntreated like a human being. It's the greatest thing in the world.''\n  Across America today, the CHIP program is providing health insurance \nfor nearly 4 million children from low-income families, and peace of \nmind for their parents. More than 9,300 children in South Dakota have \nhealth coverage through CHIP.\n  How can we now build on this common ground success? How do we make \nhealth care more affordable so that exploding health care costs don't \nbreak family budgets and eat up corporate profits that could be better \nused to create new jobs and invest in new plants and equipment?\n  We can chose to shrug our shoulders and say that the divisions in \nCongress simply reflect the increasing polarization in our society--and \nlet it go at that. But I believe we have a higher responsibility. If \nsociety is divided, it is the responsibility of leaders to try to \nbridge the divide, not simply mirror or exploit it.\n  The Politics of Common Ground is the Politics of Common Good. It is \nmore than a political challenge; it is a moral imperative.\n  Last weekend in Iraq, Senators Biden and Graham and I met with \nmembers of the new Iraqi government, with Paul Bremer, the head of the \nCoalition Provisional Authority, and with senior military leaders. They \nwere all impressive.\n  But the people who inspired me most were the soldiers.\n  We were helped by National Guard members from Minnesota, Kansas, \nIllinois and Texas, and we met troops from Mississippi, South Carolina, \nDelaware and other states. In fact, we met extraordinary people from \nalmost every state. Every one of them deserves our profound \nappreciation.\n  I was especially moved by the dozens of South Dakotans I met.\n  One of those South Dakotans is a member of the South Dakota National \nGuard's 153rd Engineer Battalion. Home for him is a small family farm \nin South Dakota. But these days, his unit is deployed to Baghdad \nInternational Airport. He and his unit provided security for our \ndelegation in Baghdad. When we left, he handed me a letter that reads, \nin part, ``I am very proud to fight and to serve my country, like so \nmany of my relatives before me.''\n  He went on, in that letter, to talk about the challenges he and his \nfamily face today. He didn't want his wife and their teenage children \nto have to bear the burden of caring for the family's cattle while he \nwas gone, so he sold the entire herd when he was deployed. When he \nreturns--which may not be until sometime next year--he will buy the \nherd back. But he and his family will still be out 2 years' worth of \nincome they would have earned from their cattle. He wasn't complaining. \nHe just wanted us to know.\n  I met another soldier from South Dakota who is with the Army's First \nCavalry Division. They have a dangerous mission: securing Baghdad. But \nhe and the other members of the First ``Cav'' aren't complaining, \neither.\n  I met a family practice doctor who grew up in Rapid City. Today, she \nis healing the bodies and saving the lives of U.S. troops and Iraqi \ncivilians at the Combat Support Hospital in Baghdad.\n  Finally, I got to eat supper in Kuwait on Saturday with a group of \nmen and women whose families I have been\n\n[[Page S7415]]\n\nworking with for months: the members of the South Dakota National \nGuard's 740th Transportation Unit.\n  Two months ago, the members of the 740th had already packed their \nbags when they got word that their tour was being extended. It was \ntheir second extension.\n  They have now been deployed for 14 months--2 months longer than they \nwere told was the longest they would be gone when they left South \nDakota.\n  When I asked one soldier at super if they had been given a new date \nto return home, he told me ``the second.'' I thought he meant their \ntour was ending on July 2nd. Then he explained, they will know when \nthey are coming home the second they get on the plane.\n  Even these soldiers were not complaining--just trying to find a \nlittle humor in a tough situation.\n  Pride in one's party and the principles for which it stands is \nadmirable. But there are causes that matter more than political \nparties.\n  There the values and hopes that transcend party labels and unite us \nall as Americans--so eloquently again related to me in conversations I \nhad with those soldiers.\n  During campaigns, candidates and parties should be clear about where \nwe stand on the issues and how we differ with our opponents so that \nvoters can make a choice. That is part of the campaign. That is an \nessential part of democracy.\n  But we also have a responsibility to work together constructively, \nwhere we can, to find common ground.\n  Making the principled compromises necessary to make democracy work \ntakes effort. It takes patience and trust and, often, a little \nhumility.\n  It requires that we listen to others and admit that someone else just \nmight have a better idea sometimes.\n  It's not simple or easy. But if our troops can give the extra measure \nof devotion and risk their lives because our Nation asks them to, \nsurely we can make the extra effort to find solutions to the problems \nfacing these soldiers' families, and all Americans--both in times of \npeace and war.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I echo the sentiment and the words of the \nminority leader today. I applaud him for bringing up this initiative, \nthe politics of common ground. When I think about the term ``common \nground,'' sometimes I think about the concept of compromise. When we \nthink about compromise, we know that means finding common ground \nwithout sacrificing your principles.\n  One thing the distinguished Senator from South Dakota is talking \nabout is that we all have our differences. Lord knows, we have a lot of \ndifferences just on this side of the aisle. Trying to get on one page a \nlot of times is nearly impossible.\n  Certainly we have our differences in this body. That is OK. If you \nthink about it, that is exactly the way the Founding Fathers intended \nit to be. They wanted Members to come here and do battle in the Senate \nand talk about ideas and concepts and policies that we all believe are \ngood for our Nation. We may have different approaches on different \nissues, but certainly at the end of the day we should all work \ntogether, shake hands, and move on to the next issue.\n  When I was running for the Senate, one thing I heard from people all \nover my State, the State of Arkansas, was: There is too much partisan \nbickering in Washington. In fact, they would tell me when I traveled \naround the State, it looks a lot like trench warfare in Washington. The \ntwo sides are dug in, shooting at each other, but at the end of the \nprocess not a lot gets done, although there are a lot of casualties. \nPeople all over the country sense that. They know that.\n  As a Democrat in this Senate, I felt aggrieved by some things the \nother side has done. I have no doubt they feel aggrieved about some of \nthe things we have done. It is incumbent upon Senators to put the past \nbehind us, put all that aside, move forward, do what is right and do \nwhat is best for this Nation.\n  I hope this Senate will return to the best traditions of our \ndemocracy. I hope we will find it within ourselves to wipe the slate \nclean and accept today as a new day, with this initiative, the politics \nof common ground as our guiding principle.\n  One thing I love about the statement by the minority leader, he used \nwords such as ``good faith'' and ``respect,'' words that we need to \ntake to heart as Senators. He talks about ending the cycle of partisan \nretaliation. Is there ever a time in our history more than today that \nwe should do that? I don't think so. We need to end that cycle of \npartisan retaliation. We do not only owe it to our Founding Fathers who \nfounded this democracy--and we occupy the seats they established--we \nnot only owe it to the history of this Nation; we owe it to our \nchildren and our grandchildren. We also owe it to the people we work \nfor, the people who sent us to Washington, to do their work for them.\n  There are many core principles in our democracy, principles that are \nindispensable. One of those principles is the idea of representation. \nLike it or not, the people of Arkansas sent me to Washington to \nrepresent them in this great body. Like it or not, people sent all 100 \nof us to represent them in this great body. I certainly hope each and \nevery Senator will find it in their heart, find it in their mind to \nrespect the will of the people from other States and respect the office \neach Senator has and the responsibility he or she has to represent his \nor her people to the best of his ability.\n  To make things better in this Senate and in this Congress and in this \nGovernment, quite frankly, it has to start with the majority party. We \ndo not know in 7 months which will be the majority party in the Senate \nor in the House. We do not know who will be in the White House. But it \nis incumbent upon us that whoever is in the majority party should lead \nby example. They should demonstrate their leadership by demonstrating \nforgiveness. We need to say no to the politics of revenge. We need to \nreturn to our first principles, turn back to the things that make this \ncountry great.\n  We talk about respecting the rights of the minority in the politics \nof common ground. This body definitely, certainly, absolutely should \nrespect majority rule but also we should respect minority rights. In \nfact, this body was created at the foundations of this country. This \nbody was created to protect the minority. That is why small States such \nas Delaware and New Hampshire get equal representation in the Senate, \nas equal as much larger States such as New York and Virginia. We are \nall equal in this body, all 100 of us, all 50 States.\n  I hope we will follow this politics of common ground. In essence, it \ncan be summarized by one thing, and that is to do right. That is what \nwe need to see more of around here.\n  One thing I like about the minority leader's proposal is that we \nacknowledge we cannot change the world. We know that. We cannot raise a \nmagic wand and make it better. My grandmother, Susie Pryor, said you \ncannot clean up the whole world but you can clean up your little \ncorner.\n  I hope today Democrats, Republicans, and Independents will take the \nresponsibility to clean up our little corner of it. Let's clean up the \nSenate and return to politics of common ground.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the distinguished Senator from Arkansas for his \neloquent statement for being part of the inspiration for this proposal \ncreating the Politics of Common Ground.\n  I will tell my colleagues, as I began thinking through many of these \nparticular ideas and the suggestions we have now made, it was the \nSenator from Arkansas who was extraordinarily helpful and who had many \ncreative ideas and thoughts on how we might discuss this matter and \nmake these proposals.\n  I acknowledge the Senator's important contribution and thank him for \nhis statement and appreciate the tone he has helped create virtually \nsince he has arrived in the Senate. He believes in the Politics of \nCommon Ground--but for him it is more than just words; it is deeds. He \nhas again demonstrated that this afternoon. I am grateful.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/24/senate-section/article/S7416-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7416]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S7416]]\n                   DEBT BURDENS AND PREDATORY LENDING\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to focus on the challenges \nfacing America's working families. Rising health care costs, increases \nin gasoline prices, and the lack of affordable housing have contributed \nto making the lives of working families more difficult as they strain \nto meet their day-to-day needs. The ability of these families to meet \ntheir increasing financial obligations is hampered by their significant \ndebt burdens, particularly credit card debt, and by predatory lending \npractices such as refund anticipation loans.\n  Mr. President, too many families are becoming overwhelmed by their \ndebts. In 2003, consumer debt increased for the first time to more than \n$2 trillion, and continued to increase in March, 2004, for the 12th \nstraight month according to the Federal Reserve. A key component of \nhousehold debt can be attributed to the use of credit cards. Revolving \ndebt, mostly comprised of credit card debt, has more than doubled from \n$313 billion in January 1994 to $756 billion in March 2004. These debt \nburdens will increase as interest rates rise. Bankruptcy filings have \nsurged to record levels. In 2003, more than 1.6 million consumers filed \nfor bankruptcy, increasing by 2.8 percent in the 12 months ending on \nMarch 30, 2004. Many of these are middle class Americans who continue \nto work hard to make ends meet.\n  It is imperative that we make consumers more aware of the long-term \neffects of their financial decisions, particularly in managing their \ncredit card debt. Obtaining credit has become easier. Students are \noffered credit cards at earlier ages, particularly since credit card \ncompanies have been successful with aggressive campaigns targeted \ntowards college students. Universities and alumni associations across \nthe country have entered into marketing agreements with credit card \ncompanies. For example, the University of Oklahoma will receive $13 \nmillion over 10 years in exchange for the exclusive ability to market \ncredit cards to students, alumni, and employees, and to issue cards \nwith the university's name. In this agreement, the school also receives \n0.4 percent of every credit purchase. More than 1,000 universities and \ncolleges have affinity cards which are made as attractive as possible \nthrough the opportunity to earn various benefits and discounts. College \nstudents make up a very ripe market for such credit and to boot are \nconsidered by some very good customers for lenders based on their \npayment patterns. Nina Prikazsky, Nellie Mae's Vice President of \nOperations, was quoted in the Chronicles of Higher Education as saying, \n``Banks will take risks on young people the way they never would a \ndecade ago, because they've discovered that students have become their \nbest customers because they tend to make the minimum payments.'' Thus, \ncollege students, many already burdened with educational loans, are \naccumulating credit card debt. Forty-five percent of college students \ncarry credit card debt, with the average debt over $3,000.\n  While it is relatively easy to obtain credit, especially on college \ncampuses, not enough is being done to ensure that credit is properly \nmanaged. Currently, credit card statements fail to include all of the \ninformation necessary to allow individuals to make fully informed \nfinancial decisions. Mr. President, I recently introduced S. 2475, the \nCredit Card Minimum Payment Warning Act, along with Senators Durbin, \nLeahy, and Schumer. Our legislation will make it very clear what costs \nconsumers incur if they make only the minimum payments on their credit \ncards. The personalized information consumers will receive for each of \ntheir credit card accounts will help them to make informed choices \nabout the payments that they choose to make towards their balance.\n  The bill also requires that credit card companies provide useful \ninformation so that people can develop strategies to free themselves of \ncredit card debt and have access to a toll-free number so that \nconsumers can access trustworthy credit counselors. My bill represents \nsound legislation that aims to protect middle income and other families \nin this country.\n  Mr. President, the ability of families to survive financially is also \nhampered by predatory lending. Earned income tax credit, EITC, benefits \nintended for working families are increasingly being reduced by the \ngrowing use of refund anticipation loans, which typically carry triple \ndigit interest rates. According to the Brookings Institution, an \nestimated $1.9 billion intended to assist low-income families was \nreceived by commercial tax preparers and affiliated national banks to \npay for tax assistance, electronic filing of returns, and high-cost \nrefund loans in 2002. The interest rates and fees charged on refund \nanticipation loans are not justified for the short length of time that \nthese loans cover and the minimal risk they present. These loans do not \ncarry much risk because of the Debt Indicator program. The Debt \nIndicator is a service provided by the Internal Revenue Service that \ninforms the lender whether or not an applicant owes Federal or State \ntaxes, child support, student loans, or other Government obligations, \nand this assists the tax preparer in ascertaining the applicant's \nability to obtain their full refund so that the RAL is repaid. The \nDepartment of the Treasury should not be facilitating these predatory \nloans that allow tax preparers to reap outrageous profits that result \nfrom the exploitation of working families. More needs to be done to \ncrack down on abusive refund anticipation loans and to provide \nadditional opportunities for EITC families to access free tax \npreparation services. I appreciate the efforts of the Senate Finance \nCommittee for incorporating several provisions of S. 685, the Low \nIncome Taxpayer Protection Act, which Senator Bingaman and I \nintroduced, into S. 882, the Tax Administration Good Government Act. \nOne provision of special importance to me is an authorization for a \ngrant program to link tax preparation services with the establishment \nof a bank or credit union account. Having a bank account allows \nindividuals to receive their tax refund check faster than waiting for a \npaper check and without the need for using refund anticipation loans or \ncheck cashing services. It is important these provisions to provide \nadditional consumer protections and expand opportunities of taxpayer \nassistance be enacted into law. We must work to provide alternatives to \nRALs and crack down on these exploitive loans.\n  Mr. President, unfortunately too many working families are \nsusceptible to predatory lending because they are left out of the \nfinancial mainstream. Between 25 and 56 million adults are unbanked, or \nnot using mainstream, insured financial institutions. The unbanked rely \non alternative financial service providers to obtain cash from checks, \npay bills, send remittances, utilize payday loans, and obtain credit. \nMany of the unbanked are low- and moderate-income families that can ill \nafford to have their earnings unnecessarily diminished by their \nreliance on these high-cost and often predatory financial services. In \naddition, the unbanked are unable to save securely to prepare for the \nloss of a job, a family illness, or a down payment on a first home or \neducation expenses.\n  Mr. President, a Federal program, the First Accounts program, is \nintended to increase access for unbanked low- and moderate-income \nindividuals to mainstream financial services. The program helps to \noffset the costs financial institutions incur in offering low-cost, \nelectronic banking accounts. In addition, the program supports \nfinancial institution and nonprofit initiatives to provide financial \neducation and counseling to low-income households. The First Accounts \nprogram has the potential for developing research into the financial \nservices needs of low-income individuals and financial products \ndesigned to meet these needs. While the need is great, the President \nproposed in his fiscal year 2005 budget request to rescind the $4 \nmillion for the First Accounts program that had been previously \nappropriated in fiscal year 2002 and fiscal year 2003. I will continue \nto work with my colleagues to help preserve these funds for their \nintended purpose and bring people into the financial mainstream.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to continuing to work with my \ncolleagues to help provide additional meaningful disclosure to \nconsumers about their use of credit and expanding access to mainstream \nfinancial service opportunities. We owe it to our country's working \nfamilies and their children.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/24/senate-section/article/S7417-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7417]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S7417]]\n                        TRIBUTE TO MANNY CORTEZ\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a man who has had a \ntremendous impact on southern Nevada, my good friend, Manny Cortez.\n  I haven't known Manny for years; I have known him for decades. In the \n1970s, when I was in State government in Nevada, he was elected to the \nClark County Commission. Since those days our paths have crossed many \ntimes. He has served on the board of governors of the University \nMedical Center, the Las Vegas Valley Water District, and other local \nagencies.\n  For the past 21 years, he has been the driving force behind the Las \nVegas Convention and Visitors Authority--first as a member of the board \nof directors, and for the last 13 years as President.\n  It is no exaggeration to say that Manny Cortez is one of the \nvisionaries who made Las Vegas what it is today--the convention and \nentertainment capital of the world.\n  In 1991, the year he assumed the leadership of the Convention and \nVisitors Authority, we had about 21 million visitors in southern \nNevada. This year we are on track to almost double that number, with \nmore than 37 million visitors. This is due in no small part to the \nbrilliant promotional campaigns of the Convention and Visitors \nAuthority.\n  Under Manny's watch at the LVCVA, our town has seen amazing changes. \nWhen he took the helm in 1991, the first of the new mega resorts, The \nMirage, had just opened a few years earlier. We had about 73,000 hotel \nrooms in Las Vegas.\n  Within the next few years we witnessed the completion of other major \nresorts, including the MGM Grand, Bellagio and Mandalay Bay. Today, we \nhave 130,000 hotel rooms, along with three major convention centers.\n  When our Nation was attacked by terrorists on 9/11, the tourism \nindustry took a serious hit. But Manny didn't panic, and under his \nsteady leadership, Las Vegas bounced back.\n  Manny has been honored many times, by many groups. Travel Agent \nmagazine named him as its Person of the Year in 1999, calling him ``one \nof the most astute marketers in the tourism industry.'' He was recently \nnamed to the U.S. Commerce Department's Travel and Tourism Advisory \nBoard. But I think the recognition that means the most to Manny is the \nClark County Elementary School that was named in his honor in 1999.\n  Manny has also been a leader of the Hispanic community in Las Vegas. \nHis prominence in the city has sent a clear message that in southern \nNevada a person can go as far as their dreams and their talent will \ntake them.\n  Manny has lived in Las Vegas since 1944, when I was growing up down \nthe road in Searchlight. I feel like I have known him all my life. So \nit is hard to believe he turned 65 a few months ago and that he is \nretiring at the end of this month.\n  It is true, though. Manny is leaving the LVCVB, but he is leaving it \nin good hands. He recently said that his biggest challenge over the \nlast few years has been to stay out of the way of the great team he has \nassembled, so they could do their jobs. That is the kind of attitude \nthat has made Manny Cortez such a beloved figure in our community.\n  I salute my old friend on his retirement, and I look forward to our \npaths crossing for many more years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/24/senate-section/article/S7417-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7417]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE DONALD W.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the Donald W. \nReynolds Foundation for its strong commitment to preserving our \nNation's artistic and cultural heritage.\n  Three years ago, as a gift to the Nation, the Donald W. Reynolds \nFoundation generously made possible the acquisition of Gilbert Stuart's \niconic ``Lansdowne'' portrait of George Washington for the \nSmithsonian's National Portrait Gallery, which will reopen on July 4, \n2006. In doing so, the Reynolds Foundation not only saved a national \ntreasure but also provided a permanent home where future generations \ncan appreciate this American masterpiece.\n  The Reynolds Foundation also made possible a 3-year, 8-city tour of \nthe painting. This tour, which visited Las Vegas 2 years ago and is \ncurrently in Little Rock, has allowed millions of Americans to \npersonally view a painting that is part of our national heritage.\n  By providing guides for teachers, newspapers for students, \nreproductions, reenactors, and history lessons about George Washington, \nthe Foundation ensured an enriching educational experience for young \npeople.\n  The exhibition of this painting at the Las Vegas Art Museum was not \nthe first time that the generosity of the Reynolds Foundation enriched \nthe lives of Nevadans. The Foundation has given millions of dollars to \ncreate the Donald W. Reynolds School of Journalism and Center for \nAdvanced Media Studies at the University of Nevada, Reno, and the \nDonald W. Reynolds Student Services Center at the University of Nevada, \nLas Vegas. It has also supported medical research and health and human \nservices programs.\n  It is my honor to recognize the Donald W. Reynolds Foundation's many \ncharitable actions.

He \nruns a little grocery store and he owns the town's original gold claim, \nthe Duplex.\n  Stan has served the people of Nevada in many different capacities. He \nwas administrative coordinator in the Clark County District Attorney's \noffice, the Voter Registrar of Clark County, and the Nevada State \nTreasurer.\n  After he left the Treasurer's office, Stan worked with the Las \nVegas--Clark County library district, where he managed the capital \nconstruction program that built 21 new libraries. He retired from that \njob but came out of retirement a few years ago to help the city of \nHenderson build a new library.\n  Stan has also been active in many civic groups, most recently as the \nPresident of the Henderson Rotary Club.

Mr. President, I rise today to bring attention to \nconcerns related to cancer care reimbursement.\n  Today, many oncology services are paid for through drug \nadministration reimbursement because most are not\n\n[[Page S7418]]\n\ncovered by Medicare. These services include specially-trained oncology \nnurses and supportive care services important to performing first rate \ncancer care. Although the new Medicare law increases reimbursements to \nphysicians and provides much needed compensation for oncology nursing, \nit reduces how much Medicare will reimburse for chemotherapy beginning \nin 2005. While I support the sound and innovative advancements the \nMedicare law provides, it is important not to jeopardize cancer care \nthrough decreases in reimbursements.\n  Congress understood the impact the Medicare law would have on patient \naccess and included a temporary one-year increase in physicians' \npractice expenses. However, this provision will expire in 2005 and \ncould reduce access to care.\n  The ``Ensuring Quality and Access to Cancer Care Act of 2004'' would \nextend the one-year transitional period already established in the law \nfor an additional year. It allows a compromise so Congress has the time \nit needs to further debate this issue, ask important questions \nregarding the impact of payment reductions and better understand how \nMedicare should reimburse for services provided to cancer patients.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/24/senate-section/article/S7418-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7418]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    U.S. COMMISSION ON OCEAN POLICY\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to again acknowledge the \nimportant work and contributions of the U.S. Commission on Ocean \nPolicy. The Ocean Commission, consisting of 16 distinguished \nindividuals, was established by the President pursuant to the Oceans \nAct of 2000, legislation I sponsored to bring special attention to the \nproblems facing our oceans and coasts, and to lead to recommendations \nfor a new national ocean policy. The Oceans Act directed the Ocean \nCommission to submit a report to Congress and the President of its \nfindings and recommendations regarding national ocean policy. Exactly \none month from now, the Ocean Commission will release its final report, \nwhich reflects the deliberations, findings, and comments generated by \n15 public meetings, 17 site visits, 37 State Governors and over 700 \nstakeholders.\n  The last time an oceans report of this magnitude was issued was over \nthirty years ago. The report of the Stratton Commission led to the \ncreation of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and \npassage of landmark legislation protecting our fisheries and coasts. I \nhave read the preliminary report of this Ocean Commission, and I can \ntell you it is very balanced and comprehensive. The final report, when \nit is issued, will no doubt influence ocean policy for years to come, \nand has already inspired oceans legislation which my colleagues and I \nhave introduced in the House and Senate. I am also currently developing \nlegislation that will set out a national vision for ocean policy, \nconservation, research, and education, building upon the commission's \nrecommendations.\n  Reports do not write themselves, and today I am taking a moment to \nacknowledge the tireless efforts of Admiral James Watkins, USN (Ret.), \nChairman of the Ocean Commission, the Commissioners, and their staff. \nAdmiral Watkins deserves to be commended for leading this monumental \ntask and generating the attention it so wisely deserves. Dr. Tom \nKitsos, as Executive Director, should also be recognized for bringing a \nwell balanced report to completion. Each of the Commissioners should be \napplauded for lending their valuable expertise and a considerable \namount of their own time to this task: Dr. Robert Ballard, Ted Beattie, \nLillian Borrone, Dr. James Coleman, Ann D'Amato, Lawrence Dickerson, \nVice Admiral Paul Gaffney, USN (Ret.), Marc Hershman, Paul Kelly, \nChristopher Koch, Dr. Frank Muller-Karger, Edward Rasmuson, Dr. Andrew \nRosenberg, William Ruckelshaus, and Dr. Paul Sandifer.\n  I know Admiral Watkins, Dr. Kitsos and my colleagues share my \nappreciation of the commission staff, who wore many hats and put in \ncountless hours to craft a fine report. The commissioners and Dr. \nKitsos obtained invaluable advice and support from Terry Schaff and \neditorial expertise and advice from Morgan Gopnik. At the heart of the \nreport were the staff who lent their considerable talents to developing \nthe major themes in each of the working groups and in actually drafting \nthe recommendations. Laura Cantral, Aimee David, and Gerhard Kuska \ncontributed their expertise to the discussions on governance. The \nstewardship working group was ably assisted by Captain Malcolm \nWilliams, USCG (Ret.), Brooks Bowen, Angela Corridore, and Frank \nLockhart.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the alarming \nincidence of U.S. contract funds being abused in Iraq. These violations \nrange from the abandonment of vehicles, each worth $85,000, to \nsignificant project overruns involving tens of millions of tax dollars. \nThe scope of these wasteful and fraudulent activities is both \ndisturbing and unacceptable.\n  At this critical juncture in Iraq's rehabilitation, contractors and \ntheir administrators should be providing contracted services and goods \nwith maximum efficiency.\n  As an American, I am proud of and thankful of the men and women who \nhave traveled to Iraq to help restore this country. They risk their \nlives and, sadly, some have given their lives. However, stories of \noutright waste and fraud involving contract funds are deeply \ndisturbing.\n  Three themes have emerged from the abuse of U.S. contracts in Iraq: \ntask order violations, the absence of cost controls, and inconsistent \noversight.\n  Numerous contract officers have used existing procurement or task \norders to obtain services and goods beyond the scope of approved \ncontracts. For instance, during December 2003, the Army acquired \ninterrogators for Iraqi prisons via a contract marked for the \nDepartment of Interior information technology purchases. Interior \ncontract officers negotiated interrogation services through an open-\nended agreement laden with tenuous connections to technology. In such \ncircumstances, new procurement items should only be obtained under open \nand fair competition.\n  The absence of consistent cost controls has also attributed to the \nmisuse of contract funds. The General Accounting Office reports that a \nsignificant portion of task orders, associated with defense logistical \nsupport contracts in Iraq, have been granted without concrete \nspecifications, deadlines, and prices. The prevalence of open-ended \ncontracts have fueled inefficiency and numerous project overruns \nexceeding 100 percent. Unfortunately, the absence of a well-trained \nprocurement workforce in Iraq has impeded efforts to counter these \nadverse outcomes.\n  In the presence of fragmented oversight, the misuse of contract funds \nhas further escalated. Currently, the Coalition Provisional Authority, \nCPA, only has oversight of contracts associated with reconstruction and \nTask Order 44 of the U.S. Army's Logistical Operations Civil \nAcquisition Program, LOGCAP, which provides CPA logistical support, yet \nall other contractors in Iraq are audited by agency inspector General, \nIG, offices. It is anticipated that the challenges of fostering \naccountability will substantially increase after the handover of Iraq \non June 30, 2004. The CPA IG reports that 60 days after the handover, \nCPA audit activities will be merged into the State Department's IG \nOffice. This office will oversee all U.S. contracts in Iraq including \nthose managed by the Department of Defense. Government officials \nforecast that this change\n\n[[Page S7419]]\n\nin audit authority will generate confusion at a time when consistent \noversight is most needed.\n  The widespread misuse of contract funds in Iraq warrants Senate \nattention. During these financially lean times, it is unacceptable to \ntolerate such outright abuse of U.S. tax dollars. It is imperative that \nwe demand greater accountability and efficiency, and immediately focus \non this critical issue. Senate hearings would help identify sources of \nmisuse and assist in developing viable remedies. This war has cost \nhundreds of lives and billions of dollars. We should not ignore the \nprice being paid, and the debt incurred, by this generation and future \ngenerations in this conflict.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/24/senate-section/article/S7419-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7419]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        UNSOLVED MURDER OF UKRAINIAN JOURNALIST HEORHIY GONGADZE\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, for nearly 4 years the case of murdered \nUkrainian investigative journalist Heorhiy Gongadze has gone unsolved, \ndespite repeated calls by the Helsinki Commission, the State \nDepartment, and the international community for a fair and impartial \ninvestigation into this case. As cochairman of the Helsinki Commission, \nI have met with Gongadze's widow and their young twin daughters. \nBesides the human tragedy of the case, the Gongadze murder is a case \nstudy of the Ukrainian authority's utter contempt for the rule of law.\n  Gongadze, who was editor of the Ukrainian Internet news publication \nUkrainska Pravda, which was critical of high-level corruption in \nUkraine, disappeared in September 2000. His headless body was found in \nNovember of that year. That same month, audio recordings by a former \nmember of the presidential security services surfaced that included \nexcerpts of earlier conversations between Ukrainian President Kuchma \nand other senior officials discussing the desirability of Gongadze's \nelimination.\n  Earlier this week, Ukraine's Prosecutor General's office announced \nthat Ihor Honcharov, a high-ranking police officer who claimed to have \ninformation on how Ministry of Internal Affairs officials carried out \norders to abduct Gongadze, died of ``spinal trauma'' while in police \ncustody last year. This came on the heels of an article in the British \nnewspaper, The Independent, which obtained leaked confidential \ndocuments from Ukraine indicating repeated obstruction into the \nGongadze case at the highest levels. Furthermore, just yesterday, \nUkraine's Prosecutor General announced that investigators are \nquestioning a suspect who has allegedly admitted to killing Gongadze.\n  Many close observers of the Ukrainian authorities' mishandling, \nobfuscation and evasiveness surrounding this case from the outset are \nsuspicious with respect to this announcement. Just one of numerous \nexamples of the Ukrainian authorities' obstruction of the case was the \nblocking of FBI experts from examining evidence gathered during the \ninitial investigation in April 2002, after the Bureau had been invited \nby these authorities to advise and assist in the case and earlier had \nhelped in identifying Gongadze's remains.\n  The Ukrainian parliament's committee investigating the murder has \nrecommended criminal proceedings against President Kuchma. This \ncommittee's work has been thwarted at every turn over the course of the \nlast several years by the top-ranking Ukrainian authorities.\n  A serious and credible investigation of this case is long overdue--\none which brings to justice not only the perpetrators of this crime, \nbut all those complicit in Gongadze's disappearance and murder, \nincluding President Kuchma.\n  Ukraine faces critically important presidential elections this \nOctober. Last month, I introduced a bipartisan resolution urging the \nUkrainian Government to ensure a democratic, transparent and fair \nelection process. Unfortunately, there have been serious problems in \nUkraine's pre-election environment.\n  Ukraine can do much to demonstrate its commitment to democracy and \nthe rule of law by conducting free and fair elections and fully and \nhonestly investigating those who were behind the murder of Heorhiy \nGongadze. The Ukrainian people deserve no less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/24/senate-section/article/S7419-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7419-S7420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          CHILD NUTRITION AND WIC REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2004\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to speak in support of the \nChild Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004 as passed by the \nSenate. In the best tradition of the Senate, Members from both sides of \nthe aisle have come together over the past year to renew and improve \nthe School Lunch and Breakfast Programs, the Summer Food Service \nProgram, the Child and Adult Care Food program, and the Special \nSupplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, WIC. I \ncommend the chairman and ranking member of the Agriculture Committee, \nSenator Cochran and Senator Harkin, as well as their staffs, for their \nhard work in support of the millions of children and families who rely \non these vital programs to meet their daily food needs.\n  At the start of the 108th Congress, when we began the process of \nrenewing the child nutrition programs, many of us had high hopes for \nimprovements that might be made. I proposed legislation to provide \nfinancial incentives to schools that want to improve their nutritional \nenvironment, to renew Federal support for nutrition education in \nschools, and to expand and stabilize both the WIC and the WIC Farmer's \nMarket Nutrition Programs. With my friend from Pennsylvania, Senator \nSpecter, I proposed the creation of a farm-to-cafeteria program that \nwould bring fresh foods from local farms into the cafeteria, and with \nmy friend from Indiana, Senator Lugar, I proposed giving the Secretary \nof Agriculture greater authority over the sale of soft drinks and junk \nfoods in schools. Other proposals were made to eliminate the reduced \nprice category for school meals, thereby providing free lunches to all \nchildren living in families with income below 185 percent of poverty. \nUnfortunately, the tight budget with which we had to work did not \nenable us to enact all of these worthy ideas. I am pleased, however, \nthat the bill before us does include many of them and that at the same \ntime it substantially improves program access and integrity.\n  Working together, we were able to ensure access to the programs for \nneedy children through direct certification, targeted verification, and \ntechnical assistance to reduce administrative error, rather than simply \nrequiring across-the-board increased verification that would have \npotentially caused eligible children to be erroneously and unacceptable \nkicked off the program.\n  We have maintained the historic role of milk in our school meals \nprogram, while granting parents the flexibility to help their children \nget a nutritionally equivalent beverage with lunch if they cannot drink \nmilk. This legislation will also allow schools to have more flexibility \non what to serve on the school lunch line. While the school lunch \nprogram currently restricts schools to offering only milk varieties \nthat most students chose in the previous school year, this legislation \nwould allow schools to expand choices based on what they believe are \nthe best offerings for the student body, including flavored milk, \nlactose-free milk and milk of varying fat levels. In particular, I \nwelcome the addition of lactose-free milk to the school lunch line, \nbelieving it will expand milk's appeal to those with special dietary \nneeds.\n  We are also taking an important first step in beginning to conquer \nthe problem of soda in our schools. Twenty years ago children consumed \nmore than twice as much milk as soda; now they drink twice as much soda \nas milk. This is a huge problem for our children. Thus I am pleased \nthis bill gives schools the authority to offer milk at anytime and \nanywhere on school premises or at school events. This will prevent \nrestrictions on milk sales that are sometimes inserted in soft drink \nvending contracts with schools.\n  This legislation ensures that small States will receive an \ninflationary increase in their administrative expense grant--the money \nthat they receive to administer and ensure the integrity of the Federal \nchild nutrition programs. This provision is particularly important to \nmy home State of Vermont as well as to other small and rural States \nthat have not seen an increase in their grant in over 20 years despite \ninflation\n\n[[Page S7420]]\n\nand expansion of the responsibilities of the States to oversee the \nprograms.\n  I look forward to the many wonderful local school-farm partnerships \nthat will be possible under my new farm-to-cafeteria grant program as \nauthorized by this bill. Communities all across our Nation are \nbeginning to explore the benefits of linking local farms and school \ncafeterias. When these connections are made, children get healthier \nfresh food choices at school, and hands-on knowledge about where their \nfood comes from and how it is produced. And farmers not only strengthen \ntheir local markets but become more involved with the schools in their \ncommunity. With just a little seed money and some technical assistance \nthese schools can create a program that teaches children about good \nnutrition, shows them the importance of agriculture, and supports local \nfarms by keeping food dollars within the community. Under this new \nprogram, communities will be able to apply for competitive grants from \nUSDA for up to $100,000 to purchase adequate equipment to store and \nprepare fresh foods, to develop food procurement relationships with \nnearby farmers, to plan seasonal menus and promotional materials, and \nto develop hands-on nutrition education related to agriculture. As a \nmember of the Appropriations Committee, I will now work to secure \nfunding for this important new program.\n  My support for these new farm-to-cafeteria projects comes in part \nfrom the amazing successes demonstrated by the WIC Farmers Market \nNutrition Program, FMNP. Years ago, I helped create this program, which \nprovides vouchers to WIC families good for fruits and vegetables at the \nlocal farmers market. The effects of this program have been stunning, \nand I am very pleased that under that this bill the WIC FMNP voucher \nhas been increased from $20 to $30 and that we have reduced the cost to \nStates of administering the program.\n  These provisions and more mean that millions of children and their \nfamilies will be better served by the Federal child nutrition programs. \nThough I wish we could have had more resources to do some of the other \nthings we had considered, like expand access to the child care and \nsummer programs in rural areas, provide mandatory funds for nutrition \neducation, and eliminate the reduced price meal category, I support the \npackage of reforms that we have before us and I pledge to keep working \non the rest.\n  In particular, I will continue to work with my colleagues in the \nSenate to address the growing crisis of childhood obesity in America \nand the ready availability of junk foods in our schools and cafeterias. \nWith more and more of our children suffering the health consequences of \nbeing overweight and obese, we have a responsibility to help them make \nsmarter nutrition choices. But with all of the funds that Congress \nrightly appropriates each year for nutrition education and healthy \nschool lunches and meals, our Nation's efforts are severely undermined \nwhen children have to walk through a gauntlet of vending machines \noffering unhealthy choices on the way to the cafeteria. We need to put \nlimits on the availability of junk foods in our schools, to ensure that \nstudents are not substituting empty calorie sodas and snacks for their \nnutritious federally subsidized school meals. Though this measure's \nestablishment of local wellness policies is a step in the right \ndirection, I am concerned that we have sidestepped our responsibility \nto the health of our Nation's children yet again and I am hopeful that \nwe will revisit this issue in the near future.\n  Once again, I thank Chairman Cochran and Senator Harkin for their \nleadership on this important legislation, and I am pleased to express \nmy strong support for its final passage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/24/senate-section/article/S7420-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             DEPARTURE OF TAIWAN REPRESENTATIVE C. J. CHEN\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, a good friend of ours, Ambassador C. \nJ. (Chien-Jen) Chen, will soon be leaving Washington, DC, after having \nserved for nearly 4 years as Taiwan's principal representative. We are \ngoing to miss him very much.\n  C. J. brought a wealth of experience to his job. He was first \nassigned to Washington, DC in 1971, and he spent most of his \ndistinguished 37-year career promoting good relations between Taiwan \nand the United States. Over the years, he won many friends for himself \nand for his country. An eloquent speaker and polished diplomat, C. J. \nalso has a reputation for being a ``straight shooter.'' He was always \nprepared to provide an informed, balanced, and fair opinion on the \ncomplex relationship between Taiwan and the United States as well as \nthe broad range of political, economic, cultural and other issues of \ncommon interest to our two countries.\n  Owing in large part to his efforts, much progress has been made on \nthese issues. During his most recent assignment in Washington, with \nU.S. support, Taiwan has acceded to the World Trade Organization and \nbecome our eighth largest trading partner. At the same time, Taiwan has \nalso contributed greatly to U.S.-led international humanitarian efforts \nin places such as Afghanistan and Iraq, and it has cooperated with the \nUnited States in fighting proliferation, terrorism, and money \nlaundering in Asia. All these matters required intensive communication \nand coordination, and we were lucky to have someone like C. J. in place \nto lead the way.\n  One of the most notable and likeable things about C. J. is his \ninexhaustible optimism. While the U.S.-Taiwan relationship has \ncertainly experienced its fair share of twists and turns, ups and \ndowns, as C. J. will surely attest, he has always remained consistently \nupbeat. His confidence is contagious, and I agree wholeheartedly with \nhis observation, that Taiwan and the United States, united by shared \nvalues and common interests, will continue to work closely together, \nnot only for their mutual benefit but also for the sake of lasting \npeace and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific.\n  Now, after having served as his chief representative in the United \nStates, as his country's foreign minister, as member of Taiwan's \nLegislative Yuan, and as a university professor, this man of \nextraordinary talent and vision is leaving Washington, DC. While he \nwill be sorely missed, I am certain that he has established an \nadmirable legacy of friendship, trust, and cooperation that will long \nendure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/24/senate-section/article/S7420-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH.

Mr. President, today I rise to honor a WWII veteran who \nhas gone above and beyond the call of duty in his service to the United \nStates and to the State of Oregon. Bob Maxwell was born in Boise, ID on \nOctober 26, 1920. Before joining the U.S. Army, Bob worked as a logger \nin Colorado. In the summer of 1942, he was shipped to Camp Roberts, CA \nfor training.\n  Bob boarded a British troop ship heading for the European theater and \nlanded in Casablanca in February of 1943. There he was assigned to the \nbattered 3rd Infantry Division. Together with the 3rd Rangers, his \nDivision landed in Licata on the south-central coast of Sicily in July \nof 1943. Fighting their way inland, Bob Maxwell's division successfully \ncaptured the city of Agrigento after seven intense days of battle.\n  Bob's dedication to the war effort was a valiant one. After landing \nnear the town of Netuno, Italy on January 22, 1944, he was struck by \nshrapnel from a German artillery shell, severely injuring his leg. \nMaxwell returned to his duty repairing phone wires and working the \nswitchboard after bandaging\n\n[[Page S7421]]\n\nhis leg. He did not go to the hospital until the next morning when his \nplatoon leader forced him to go. He was later awarded the Silver Star \nfor his efforts.\n  A few months later, stationed near Besancon, France, Maxwell and \nthree other soldiers, armed only with .45 caliber automatic pistols, \ndefended their battalion observation post against a nearly overwhelming \nattack by enemy infantrymen. Despite fire from automatic weapons and \ngrenade launchers, the men aggressively fought off advancing enemy \ntroops and, with his calmness, tenacity, and fortitude, Maxwell \ninspired his fellows to continue the struggle. When an enemy hand \ngrenade was thrown in the midst of his squad, Maxwell unhesitatingly \nthrew himself squarely upon it, using his blanket and his unprotected \nbody to absorb the full force of the explosion.\n  For this action, Maxwell was awarded the Medal of Honor, the nation's \nhighest military award. In addition, while serving with the 3rd \nBattalion, 7th Infantry of the United States Army, he was awarded two \nPurple Hearts, two Silver Stars, and a Bronze Star. Maxwell was \nhonorably discharged from military service at Ft. Lewis, Washington \nJune 13, 1945.\n  After moving to Oregon, Maxwell met his wife Beatrice--Bea--and they \nmarried on August 12, 1951. He and Bea are parents to four children, \nnumerous grandchildren, and a great-grandchild. Bob spent 30 years \nfurther serving the public in the teaching profession.\n  For his selfless service to others, and to the United States in times \nof war, I salute Bob Maxwell as an Oregon Veteran Hero.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/24/senate-section/article/S7421-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7421]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SALUTE TO AN OREGON SOLDIER\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, today I rise to honor a courageous \nOregonian who rushed to save the life of a wounded Taliban fighter. \nSergeant Dan Trackwell, a native of Klamath Falls, OR, and a member of \nthe Combined Anti-Armor Team, is currently serving in Afghanistan \nhelping to secure that country's future.\n  On June 13, 2004, Marines with Battalion Landing Team 1st Battalion, \n6th Marines and Afghan Militia Forces engaged three enemy soldiers on a \nmountain side. The guerillas were tracking and reporting on the \nBattalion Landing Team's activities when coalition forces opened fire \nand wounded at least one of them.\n  The Marines used a high-powered optical sight to observe the enemy \nfighters and to confirm that one was indeed wounded. As the other \nTaliban fighters escaped into the mountains the wounded man was left \nfor dead.\n  Sergeant Dan Trackwell was one of the four Marines who ventured up \nthe mountain to find the enemy. They located him hiding behind a rock. \nHe and Corporal Jesse Clingan, of Unitown, Pennsylvania, determined \nthat the fighter had lost a lot of blood and appeared to be in severe \npain.\n  Corporal Daniel Dimaso, of Junction, NY, stripped off his own t-shirt \nand made a tourniquet to control the bleeding from the gunshot wound on \nthe enemy fighter's lower left leg, while Pvt. 1st Class Daniel \nFondonella, of Mt. Vernon, NY, provided security. Two hours earlier \nthese men were hunting him down and now they were hurrying to save his \nlife.\n  The Marines knew that the Taliban fighter would die if they did not \nget him off the mountain. They gathered the injured man and signaled \nfor the corpsman at the vehicles in the canyon to prepare for their \narrival. Sergeant Trackwell carried the enemy soldier down the \nmountain.\n  The wounded man was then taken to the battalion's command post, where \nthe surgeon, Navy Lt. Brendon Drew, determined that he needed surgery \nsoon. The Marines were instructed to keep an eye on the patient to \nensure that he did not fall asleep while the wound was being worked on. \nAs the surgeons worked on the patient, the Marines took turns holding \nthe man's IV bag and blocking the bright Afghan sun from his eyes.\n  After the patient was stabilized he was taken to a nearby military \nmedical facility for recovery. Lt. Drew determined that it was the \nimmediate medical attention and the quick intervention from the \ncorpsman that saved the man's life.\n  This story shows us that our Marines not only follow the rules of \ncombat, they display a deep respect for humanity. For his selfless \nservices to others, and to the United States in time of war, I salute \nSergeant Dan Trackwell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/24/senate-section/article/S7421-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7421]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ABSENCE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

Mr. President, I ask the United States Senate to join me \nin tribute to Mattie Stepanek, a young man who accomplished so much, \nand sadly, was taken from us this past Tuesday, June 22 at the age of \n13 years. Like his three older siblings, Mattie died from complications \nof a rare form of muscular dystrophy.\n  As anyone can testify who has seen Mattie on television, he was one \nbrilliant person, and he had a big heart to match. At the age of three, \nhe began writing poetry to cope with the death of his brother, writing \nmessages of hope and inspiration, and selling millions of books. Mattie \nquickly became one of the most widely read poets in recent memory, and \nthree of his volumes were on the New York Times' best-seller list.\n  I would like to share one of Mattie's most inspirational poems. It is \ntitled, ``On Being a Champion.''\n\n     ``A champion is a winner,\n     A hero . . .\n     Someone who never gives up\n     Even when the going gets rough.\n     A champion is a member of\n     A winning team . . .\n     Someone who overcomes challenges\n     Even when it requires creative solutions\n     A champion is an optimist,\n     A hopeful spirit . . .\n     Someone who plays the game,\n     Even when the game is called life . . .\n     Especially when the game is called life.\n     There can be a champion in each of us,\n     If we live as a winner,\n     If we live as a member of the team,\n     If we live with a hopeful spirit,\n     For life.''\n\n  Mattie was a champion in every sense of the word and his poetry won \nthe hearts of many admirers, from Oprah Winfrey to former President \nCarter.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, Senator \nConrad, in introducing legislation that provides much needed relief to \nfarmers and ranchers who have been devastated by weather conditions.\n  Farmers and ranchers from my state began the year with great \noptimism. Producers were eager to get their crop in the ground so they \ncould get a good return on their investments and their hard work.\n  But, harsh weather conditions have plagued our state. In some regions \nof North Dakota, late snow followed by unusually high rainfall left \nmuch of our fields under water and unfit to plant. Preliminary reports \nestimate that as much as two million acres of crops were unable to be \nplanted or had crops that were destroyed after planting. This has \nplaced the livelihood of many North Dakota producers in serious \njeopardy.\n  In the southwest portion of the state, the drought conditions have \ncrippled\n\n[[Page S7422]]\n\nlivestock producers. Southwest North Dakota is terribly dry and has \nbeen for nearly two years. They have received almost no rain, making \nhaying and grazing land very hard to come by, and causing feed expenses \nto soar.\n  These family farmers and ranchers ought not have to bear this burden \nalone. I am very pleased to join Senator Conrad in introducing disaster \nlegislation to help ease the financial burden of producers in their \ntime of need. We need quick action on this legislation because \nproducers need help, and they need it now.\n  The legislation being introduced today is very straightforward and \nalmost identical to disaster legislation enacted in previous years, \nincluding last year.\n  Farmers experiencing crop loss of higher than 35 percent would be \neligible for disaster assistance. Folks who bought crop insurance would \nbe eligible for payments equal to 50 percent of the crop price, and \nthose who did not purchase insurance would be eligible for payments \nequal to 40 percent of the crop price. Under this legislation, the \nuninsured producers will be required to purchase crop insurance for the \nfollowing two years in order to receive any disaster assistance.\n  Also, ranchers suffering grazing losses will be eligible for \nassistance to help pay for the cost of feed. To be eligible, they must \nhave suffered 40 percent loss during three consecutive months.\n  The weather conditions, beyond human control, have placed the \nlivelihood of our farmers and ranchers at risk and I urge Congress to \nact quickly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/24/senate-section/article/S7422-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7422]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 20 LEGISLATIVE DAYS AND COUNTING DOWN\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as of today there are 20 legislative days \nleft before the assault weapons ban expires. And as we get closer and \ncloser to September 13, there are reports that gun manufacturers across \nthe country are gearing up to flood the market with previously banned \nassault weapons. These weapons, according to the law enforcement \ncommunity, were the weapons of choice for criminals before the ban and \nthey have no place on our streets. The assault weapons ban is \nstraightforward, commonsense public safety legislation that needs to be \nextended.\n  In addition to banning 19 specific weapons, the ban makes it illegal \nto ``manufacture, transfer, or possess a semiautomatic'' firearm that \ncan accept a detachable magazine and has more than one of several \nspecific military features, such as folding/telescoping stocks, \nprotruding pistol grips, bayonet mounts, threaded muzzles or flash \nsuppressors, barrel shrouds, or grenade launchers. These weapons are \ndangerous and they should not be on America's streets.\n  In response to Congress' inaction, some State legislatures have begun \ntaking action of their own. In Massachusetts, State legislators voted \nWednesday to bar the sale of the same 19 specific weapons mentioned in \nthe Federal ban. According to the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, \nMassachusetts is now one of six States with its own ban. Seven other \nStates are considering enacting their own bans.\n  The National Rifle Association has said that the ban is ineffective \nand unnecessary. The association asserts that guns labeled as assault \nweapons are rarely used in violent crimes, and that many people use \nthem for hunting and target shooting. But this assertion is not \nsupported by the facts. According to statistics reported by the Brady \nCampaign to Prevent Gun Violence, from 1990 to 1994, assault weapons \nnamed in the ban constituted 4.82 percent of guns traced in criminal \ninvestigations. However, since the ban's enactment, these assault \nweapons have made up only 1.61 percent of the crime-related guns \ntraced.\n  Unfortunately, despite Senate passage of a bipartisan amendment that \nwould have extended the ban, it appears that this important gun safety \nlaw will be allowed to expire. The House Republican leadership opposes \nreauthorizing the law and President Bush, though he has said he \nsupports it, has done little to help keep the law alive.\n  I am hopeful that the Congress will act in the 20 days it has \nremaining.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/24/senate-section/article/S7422-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7422-S7424]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE DECISION TO GO TO WAR\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last month Americans across this Nation \ncelebrated Memorial Day. It was a day that had special significance for \nmillions of World War II veterans, tens of thousands of whom came to \nWashington to see the long awaited memorial on the Mall to honor them \nand the more than 10 million American veterans of that war who are no \nlonger living.\n  This Memorial Day was also an opportunity to reflect for those of us \ntoo young to remember that war, but old enough to have parents or \nfriends who fought, died, or in so many other ways sacrificed and \nlabored together to defeat enemies that threatened the survival of the \nfree world.\n  For me, it was a day of mixed emotions. It was uplifting for Marcelle \nand me to be on the Mall and to see so many World War Two veterans and \ntheir families together, many of them reuniting with members of their \ndivisions or regiments for the first time in over half a century. It \nwas extraordinarily moving to hear their stories of the war, told as if \nit were yesterday--stories of bone chilling fear, incredible suffering, \nand awe inspiring bravery.\n  It was also a somber occasion. I think each of us was reminded of how \nmuch we, and so many millions of people in countries around the world, \nowe to that generation of Americans.\n  There was much talk of D-Day, and the thousands of Americans who died \non the beaches that first day of the invasion of Normandy. Having \nreturned from Normandy for the 60th anniversary of D-Day, I can say \nthat the feeling is similar to what one experiences when visiting \nGettysburg or any of the great battlefields of the Civil War. It is \ndifficult to fathom that so many men so young could face death with \nsuch undaunted courage.\n  It was my second visit to Normandy. I was last there for the 50th \nanniversary, and the sight of those rows, and rows, and rows of white \ncrosses was every bit as moving this time as it was the last.\n  Three weeks ago I also attended the funeral of one of two young \nVermonters who were killed in action in Iraq on May 25. Sgt. Kevin \nSheehan and Spec. Alan Bean died when their base on the outskirts of \nBaghdad was attacked. Six other Vermonters were injured, three \nseriously. Sgt. Sheehan and Spec. Bean were the ninth and tenth \nVermonters to die in Iraq.\n  Then on June 7, another Vermonter, Sgt. Jamie Gray, was killed and \ntwo members of his Battalion were injured when their vehicle was hit by \nan improvised explosive device. He was the eleventh Vermonter to die in \nIraq. At his funeral, I thought how the past few weeks have been very \nsad ones in my State; but, of course, the same could be said for many \nother states.\n  As of today, 844 Americans have died in Iraq since the start of the \nwar, and there are thousands more who we rarely hear of who have been \nwounded. They have lost legs, arms, their eyesight, or suffered other \ngrievous injuries that will plague them for the rest of their lives.\n  And there are the tens of thousands of Iraqis, including many \nthousands of civilians caught in the crossfire, who have been killed or \ninjured. Their numbers are not even reported.\n  When I am in Vermont, and I am there most weekends, there is one \nquestion that I am asked over and over. ``What are you doing to bring \nour troops home?'' It is a question that I found myself asking this \nMemorial Day weekend, and in Vermont during those funerals, and then \nagain at Normandy. It arises from a fundamental disagreement with \nPresident Bush's decision to go to war in Iraq, and his rationale for \ncontinuing to keep tens of thousands of our troops there in harm's way \nindefinitely.\n  The attacks of 9/11 were unlike anything our Nation had experienced \nsince that infamous day at Pearl Harbor over a half century ago. I \nsupported the President's decision to use military force against al-\nQaida and the Taliban who had shielded them in Afghanistan. It was the \nright response and the whole world was behind us.\n  But as so many people warned, the decision to launch a unilateral, \npreemptive war against Iraq, even though Saddam Hussein had nothing to \ndo with 9/11 and had no plan or ability to attack us, was a fateful \ndiversion from the real terrorist threat.\n\n[[Page S7423]]\n\n  The President's most recent justification for the war--previous \njustifications having been proven false--is that the Iraqi people are \nbetter off without Saddam Hussein. They are. But that is not the \nmeasure of a policy that led us into a war based on a false premise, \nfaulty, distorted intelligence, and an astounding lack of understanding \nor concern for the huge costs and liabilities.\n  Those of us who have to vote to spend the billions of dollars that \nare necessary to keep our forces there should ask whether the \nPresident's decision to ``stay the course,'' apparently indefinitely, \njustifies the continued deaths of Americans--soldiers and civilians--at \nthe dawn of their lives, often by the very people they were sent to \nliberate or to help recover.\n  No one questions that we were unforgivably vulnerable on 9/11. Our \nborders were porous. Several of the highjackers were living openly, and \nillegally, in this country. Simply securing the doors on airplane \ncockpits might have prevented those attacks. Our law enforcement and \nintelligence agencies were barely speaking to each other. Communication \nbetween the White House, the Strategic Air Command, the FAA and the \nPentagon was hopelessly confused. Countless warnings were ignored.\n  No one questions that we need to do far more to protect ourselves \nfrom terrorists. Every American is a potential target, as we saw, \nagain, last week with the sickening execution style murder of Paul \nJohnson in Saudi Arabia.\n  The question is how best to protect ourselves at home, and how best \nto build the alliances we need to combat terrorism around the world.\n  Imagine if instead of spending $150 billion, soon to be more than \n$200 billion, to invade and occupy Iraq, we had used that money \ndifferently.\n  Imagine if we had used it to increase fiftyfold the number of police \nofficers in this country.\n  Imagine if we had used it to put two air marshals on every airplane \nin or entering American airspace.\n  Imagine if we had used it to tighten our border controls, so rather \nthan inspecting 10 percent of the shipping containers and trucks \nentering this country, we inspected 100 percent.\n  Imagine if we had used it to increase fiftyfold the number of \nimmigration officers at our ports of entry, and to increase fiftyfold \nthe number of investigators to track down people who are here \nillegally.\n  Imagine if we had used it to increase fiftyfold our surveillance \ncapabilities along the Canadian and Mexican borders.\n  Imagine if we had used it to increase tenfold the amount we spend to \nprotect nuclear materials, reactors, and weapons sites from sabotage or \ntheft by terrorists.\n  Imagine if we had used it to teach Arabic to 10,000 new intelligence \nofficers, and stationed them around the world. Think of the schools we \ncould build, the hospitals, the medical breakthroughs funded, and on \nand on.\n  Imagine how much safer we would be if we had done these things. \nInstead, we are spending that money in Iraq, and we will spend another \n$50 billion in Iraq next year. Yet even the Secretary of Defense \ntestified that, after spending $150 billion, he does not know if we are \nwinning the war against terrorism. I think it is safe to say that if he \nbelieved we were, he would be the first to say so.\n  When President Bush announced his decision to invade Iraq he said all \nthe things he was expected to say. He said he made his decision only as \na last resort, after exhausting every other option. He said it was the \nhardest decision of his presidency.\n  In fact, other options were far from exhausted, and the intelligence \nhe relied on was manipulated, misinterpreted, and wrong.\n  In fact, we now know that it was a decision the President made after \nminimal debate and with little difficulty. He consulted only his \nclosest political advisors who for years, despite never experiencing \ncombat themselves, had called for the use of force to overthrow Saddam \nHussein. Those outside the President's inner circle who had \nreservations were ignored. Those who understand the history and the \nculture and religious and ethnic rivalries of that part of the world, \nwhom he might have listened to, were ignored.\n  Over 200,000 young Americans were sent to Iraq, and over 135,000 \nremain there. They were sent into war despite the absence of any \ntangible threat to the United States. They were sent to invade a \ncountry that had nothing to do with 9/11.\n  Many were sent without body armor, without adequate water, and \nwithout the proper armor on their vehicles. They were sent in \ninsufficient numbers to prevent the chaos that has caused twice the \ncasualties since the collapse of the Iraqi Government, when the \nPresident declared ``Mission Accomplished.'' Many of our most severely \nwounded have come home to inadequate medical care, or foreclosures on \ntheir homes.\n  The Pentagon's leaders always insist that the safety and welfare of \nour troops is their highest priority, but history is replete with \nexamples to the contrary and today we are seeing history repeating \nitself.\n  Even worse, as hundreds of Americans die and thousands suffer \nterrible wounds, the rest of the country goes about its daily business, \npacking for their summer vacations, as if the war is someone else's \nproblem.\n  Our soldiers do not have the luxury of refusing to fight if they \ndisagree with the President. That is why a decision by the nation's \nleaders to send America's sons and daughters into harm's way, and to \nkeep them where they are being killed and wounded every day, should be \nmade only if the security of the United States depends on it.\n  Aside from the usual patriotic cliches, the President has not \nexplained why the security of the United States depends on keeping tens \nof thousands of Americans deployed in Iraq's cities where they are \nbeing blown up by roadside bombs and shot by snipers. What are they \ndoing there that is worth the loss of lives?\n  There are encouraging steps as a new Iraqi government takes shape. \nBut they do nothing--nothing--to obscure the grim reality that \nvirtually every day more young American lives are lost. How long will \nthis continue? The President says our troops will be there until they \n``finish the job.'' What job? It is more than a year since the fall of \nBaghdad, yet we still do not know what the mission is.\n  Is it to make Iraq a democracy? Is it, as our troops are told, to \nkill and capture ``bad guys?'' Is it to protect the oil wells and \nrefineries and Halliburton's other investments there? Is it to remake \nthe Middle East?\n  Even the President concedes that other countries are not going to \ndonate significant numbers of their own troops.\n  The hard truth, which no one in this administration is willing to \nadmit, is that regardless of almost anything else that happens in Iraq \nin the coming year, hundreds perhaps thousands more of America's sons \nand daughters are likely to be killed or wounded.\n  There are times when war is unavoidable, as it was when Germany \ninvaded Europe, when Japan bombed Pearl Harbor, and when al-Qaida \nattacked New York and Washington. And when that happens, when the \nsecurity of the country depends on it, the country unites and great \nsacrifices of life and limb are willingly made.\n  It is those sacrifices that we honor on Memorial Day, and which those \nof us who were just in Normandy were reminded of so vividly.\n  But the war against terrorism is a different kind of war.\n  It will not be won by invading and occupying countries.\n  It will not be won by alienating our friends and allies, nor by \ninciting the anger of Muslims around the world who now believe the \nUnited States is at war with Islam itself.\n  It will not be won by arresting people, calling them terrorists, \ntorturing and humiliating them, and releasing them only after it \nbecomes a public relations disaster. Why, if they were innocent, were \nthey detained so long in the first place? It makes a mockery of the \nvery idea of justice.\n  The war against terrorism will not be won by publicly claiming to \nrespect the law when you are secretly declaring the law obsolete, \nbreaking the law, and then refusing to disclose what was done.\n  It will not be won when half the American people do not believe the \nwar in Iraq is making them safer.\n\n[[Page S7424]]\n\n  It will not be won with self-serving rhetoric that distorts history \nand bears little resemblance to reality.\n  The war against terrorism will be best fought by using our military \nselectively, as we are by tracking down al- Qaida in Afghanistan.\n  It will be best fought by building alliances, by working closely and \ncooperatively with the law enforcement and intelligence agencies of \nother countries to infiltrate terrorist networks, capture their \nleaders, and seize their assets.\n  It will be best fought by doing far more to help create economic \nopportunities for the hundreds of millions of impoverished people, \nparticularly in Muslim countries, who have little more than their faith \nand their anger, and who are the terrorist recruiters' greatest hope.\n  And it will be best fought by giving far higher priority to \nstrengthening our defenses here at home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/24/senate-section/article/S7424-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7424]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO KEN ROBINSON\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I want to remember Ken \nRobinson, a long time friend and community leader. Ken passed away on \nFriday, April 30, 2004 at the age of 89 years. I would like to pay \ntribute to the many contributions he has made to his community, to his \nprofession, and to this country.\n  I have known Ken and his wife Mary Louise, both as personal friends \nand as the owners of the Bayard News, the Bagley Gazette, as well as \nseveral other Iowa newspapers. In 1940, he was one of the founders of \nthe Bayard News which merged with the Bagley Gazette in 1973 to become \nthe Bayard News Gazette. They received many awards over the years for \ntheir publishing including the National Newspaper Association's Amos \nAward which is given to a person who is considered to have done the \nmost for the newspaper industry as well as for his own community.\n  When is came to being an advocate for publishers of newspapers in \nrural areas, Ken was the best. He was fearless, and nothing deterred \nhim from approaching public officials, including the Post Master \nGeneral or the President of the United States, to bring to their \nattention problems experienced by his newspaper readers due to delayed \nrural delivery service or postage price increases. He was a crusader in \nthe best sense of the word when there was an issue that needed to be \nfixed.\n  He came to Washington, DC every year to participate in the annual \nconference sponsored by the National Newspaper Association. Ken was the \none to ask the hard questions of the officials who would speak at the \nconference, holding their feet to the fire to follow up on commitments. \nAt one association conference session at the White House, Iowa \nNewspaper Association Director Bill Monroe remembers worrying about Ken \nand why he had not shown up in time for the meeting. Just before the \nmeeting began, Ken came out of the Oval Office just before President \nReagan came out to meet the group. He had been in the office promoting \nBayard's sesquicentennial and had sold President Reagan a raffle \nticket.\n  Ken also served as mayor of Bayard for 24 years, as a State \nrepresentative, and was active in many organizations, including the \nLeague of Iowa Municipalities, the Democratic Party, the Iowa Civil \nRights Commission, and the board of Iowa Public Television. He was an \nactive and loyal alumnus of Drake University from where he graduated \nwith a major in economics. During his college years, he was managing \neditor of the Drake Times Delphic where he primarily wrote sports \narticles.\n  Ken was born near Panora, IA in 1914. In his junior year of high \nschool, he was stricken with polio. As a person with a disability, long \nbefore the ADA was passed, Ken found ways to overcome barriers to \nachieve his long-time dream of owning and publishing a newspaper. He \nnot only achieved his dream, but with his passion for justice and his \nimpatience with inaction, he became a strong voice for common sense and \nfairness. As a civic leader, he had the kind of ``can-do'' attitude \nthat motivates others to get involved to get things done. Who knows \nwhat Ken might have achieved if the ADA had been implemented while he \nwas involved in so many aspects of community life. In this spirit, Ken \nwas the first recipient of the Easter Seals of America Award to honor a \nperson with a disability who had provided outstanding service to \ngovernment and to community.\n  Ken and Mary Louise have been great friends to me and I will never \nforget them. People such as Ken and Mary are an inspiration to us all. \nThey are among the leaders who are the fabric that gives shape and \ncolor to our rural communities. They have spent their life making their \ncommunity, State, and Nation better places to live, work and raise \nfamilies. And for that, we are forever grateful.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/24/senate-section/article/S7424-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7424]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NATIONAL HOMEOWNERSHIP MONTH--JUNE 2004\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, realizing the dream of homeownership \nis one of the greatest moments in a lifetime. I am pleased that June \nhas been designated as National Homeownership Month and I have enjoyed \nworking with my colleagues to increase the number of Americans who are \nable to own their own homes. Homeownership provides more than just a \nshelter. It is a symbol of security that more American families are \nenjoying each year.\n  Owning a home enhances our lives and contributes to thriving \ncommunities. Where homeownership flourishes, communities are more \nsecure, residents are more civic-minded, schools are better and crime \nrates decline.\n  Today, the national homeownership rate stands at 68 percent. I am \nproud of the great strides we have made in order to raise it to the \nhighest rate ever. But if you take a close look at that statistic, \nyou'll see that there is still much work to be done. The fact is that \nhomeownership rates have risen the most among groups that have always \nhad the highest ownership, while they've actually fallen for households \nwith children and those headed by someone under the age of 55. In \naddition, African American and Hispanic households' homeownership rates \nstill lag behind those of white households by more than 25 percentage \npoints.\n  I support President Bush in his goal of expanding the number of \nminority home owners by 5.5 million by 2010. As the lead sponsor of S. \n198, the New Homestead Economic Opportunity Act, I am confident this \nlegislation would go a long way toward increasing the number of \nAmerican home owners--particularly first-time and minority home buyers. \nS. 198 will provide a tax credit for single-family homeownership. \nModeled after the successful low-income rental housing tax credit, this \nproposal would allow States to allocate Federal tax credits to \ndevelopers and investors who provide single-family homes for purchase \nby qualified buyers in qualified areas.\n  The legislation is sound public policy and makes good economic sense. \nIt would foster revitalization of both urban and rural areas and help \nworking Americans currently priced out of the market to buy their first \nhome. It is estimated that each year the credit would produce some \n50,000 new and rehabilitated homes, 120,000 jobs, $4 billion in wages \nand $2 billion in taxes and fees.\n  President Bush has stated that a home is:\n\n     a foundation for families and a source of stability for \n     communities. Part of economic security is owning your own \n     home. Part of being a secure America is to encourage \n     homeownership.\n\n  Today, in the midst of National Homeownership Month, those words ring \neven more loud and true. I ask that my colleagues show their support \nfor homeownership by cosponsoring S. 198.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/24/senate-section/article/S7424-3", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7424-S7425]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               HONORING STEPHAN KATHMAN AND DAVID SHEETS\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

They work in close \ncooperation with police and fire departments, using state-of-the-art \nskills, in pre-hospital situations. WVEMS volunteers also perform other \nimportant community services, including teaching first aid and CPR \nclasses.\n  The men and women of WVEMS have established a remarkable legacy. \nDuring their 25 years of service, they have logged over half a million \nvolunteer hours and cared for over 45,000 ill or injured men, women, \nand children.\n  Fifteen of the original founders still serve with a selfless \ncommitment to their cause, and each has been designated an American Red \nCross Unsung Hero. These exceptional men and women are Edward and \nElizabeth Audley, Patricia Audley, Sharon Barnett, Russel M. Blair, \nSusan DeWitt, Michael Feigin, Richard Frazier, Neil Harding, Thomas M. \nKeenan, Kathleen Todd, Alan Yoder, Isabel Blair, Alan Stolz, Nettie \nSkinner, and Pasquale Salvo. I would also like to commend Jay Paretzky \nand April Anne Yoder, who have also been with the WVEMS for a quarter \ncentury.\n  All of the other active members of the WVEMS certainly deserve our \nrecognition, as well: William Puterbaugh, Norman Coltin, Sandra \nMcPherson, Jeffrey T. Lea, Andrew Dinitz, Loretta S. Harsche, Marge \nCosta, Christine A. Evans, Todd M. Smith, Mark A. Blake, Anthony F. \nSanto, Donald E. Smith III, Thomas F. Burrows, Martha M.

Mr. President, June is National Dairy Month, the \ncountry's oldest and largest celebration of dairy products and the \npeople who have made the industry the success it is today. During June, \nWisconsinites will hold nearly 100 dairy celebrations across our State, \nincluding dairy breakfasts, ice cream socials, cooking demonstrations, \nfestivals and other events.\n  Every State in the Union has dairy farms, which together produce over \n170 billion pounds of milk annually. In my home State of Wisconsin, \ndairy farmers produce approximately 22 billion pounds of milk and 25 \npercent of the country's butter a year. Some of the world's finest \ncheeses are produced within Wisconsin's borders, in addition to a \nvariety of other outstanding dairy products for people to enjoy.\n  The nutritional benefits of milk, yogurt, cottage cheese, and other \ndairy products are important to keeping Americans healthy and strong. \nStrong scientific evidence published in the Journal of the American \nMedical Association and JAMA indicates that dairy foods may play a role \nin reducing the risk of nine common diseases and conditions: obesity, \nhypertension, type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, stroke, kidney \nstones, osteoporosis, colorectal cancer, and pregnancy-related \ncomplications. Research continues to demonstrate the health benefits of \nconsuming dairy products, particularly for children.\n  Throughout my time in the Senate, I have worked to keep my State's \ndairy industry healthy and strong. I have fought attempts to create and \nperpetuate regional disparities in dairy pricing. I have acted on the \nconcerns of many Wisconsinites about the impact of milk protein \nconcentrates on the Wisconsin dairy industry. I have advocated on \nbehalf of the Wisconsin dairy industry to trade negotiators. I will \ncontinue to work to keep Wisconsin a leader in the dairy industry.\n  So here's to good health, a strong agricultural economy, and the \npride of America's dairyland as we enjoy Wisconsin dairy products \nduring the National Dairy Month and throughout the rest of the \nyear.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/24/senate-section/article/S7425-3", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7425-S7426]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO CHUCK VEST\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this month marks the end of a \ndistinguished 14-year tenure for Chuck Vest as president of the \nMassachusetts Institute of Technology. He has been an excellent leader \nfor this outstanding institution in our State. He has attracted and \nretained a world class faculty, including Nobel Prize winners. He's \nmaintained an impressive balance between consistency and change to meet \nthe changing needs of the university in the modern high-tech world. and \nhe has developed the research capacity of the institution far beyond \nits abilities when he took the helm.\n  His commitment to diversity has also been impressive. In 1990, the \nundergraduate student body was 34 percent women and 14 percent \nunderrepresented minorities; today the student body is 42 percent women \nand 20 percent underrepresented minorities--the result of a \nconscientious effort by President Vest and the community he cared about \nso much.\n  His leadership was marked by many innovative reforms. He decided to \npublish all course material online so that it is freely available to \nanyone in the\n\n[[Page S7426]]\n\nworld. He brought the unequal treatment of senior female faculty to the \nattention of the community, and held an open dialogue on how to correct \nthe situation. He offered health benefits to same-sex partners. His \nleadership on financial aid methodologies laid the groundwork for the \nprovisions that are now part of the Higher Education Act.\n  Chuck has worked skillfully as well to obtain increased support for \nscientific research--especially in the physical sciences, and he was a \nfamiliar figure in corporate boardrooms and to many of us in Congress. \nHis cooperative work with Lincoln Labs, with Harvard and with the Broad \nFoundation and his commitment to the Cambridge and Boston Public \nSchools are important parts of all he has brought to MIT. When he was \nnamed in February to the President's Commission on the Intelligence \nCapabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass \nDestruction, he said, ``I will concentrate on two priorities, MIT and \nthe Commission.\n  There is so much to be said about Chuck Vest--his intelligence, his \nappealing personality, his modesty about his own high accomplishments, \nand his tireless pursuit of excellence in everything he does. All of us \nwho know him wish him well in the years ahead, confident that we will \ncontinue to think and act boldly about the role of science and \nscientific education in our changing world and its fundamental \nimportance to the future of our Nation and its best ideals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/24/senate-section/article/S7426-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7426]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CONGRATULATIONS TO CARLOS BOOZER\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased to honor a fellow \nAlaskan. This summer our country will display its patriotism on an \ninternational level during the 2004 Summer Olympic Games. It is \nimportant for us to recognize the men and women who dedicate their \nlives to representing the United States. Though the sacrifices these \nindividuals make are not ``life threatening'' like those of our \nAmerican men and women who serve in our Armed Forces, the individuals \nwho represent our country in the Olympics nonetheless sacrifice \nthemselves, and proudly represent this Nation. That is why I would like \nto take the time to recognize one fellow Alaskan who is about to \ncompete at the highest international level. Recently, my fellow \nAlaskan, Carlos Boozer, was selected to the Men's 2004 Olympic \nBasketball team. He becomes the first Alaskan to be selected to the \nUnited States Men's Olympic Basketball team.\n  Unselfishly, Mr. Boozer has been a quiet winner his whole life. \nCarlos attended Juneau-Douglas High School, winning a State title in \nhis junior season, and then in his senior season he was selected to the \nMcDonald's All-American Team. He then enrolled in Duke University, \nwhere he won a national title with the Blue Devils. After receiving his \ndegree from Duke in 3 years, Carlos was drafted in the second round of \nthe 2002 NBA Draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers. With his workman-like \nmentality, he is becoming a model for those who dedicate themselves to \nperfection and team work, and not personal glory. Now he has the \nopportunity to represent this country in a quest for the Gold Medal in \nthe Summer Olympic Games. I congratulate Carlos, not only for his \nrecent achievement, but for his unselfish dedication. He has dedicated \nhimself to Juneau his home town, Alaska his home state, Duke \nUniversity, the Cleveland Cavaliers, and now the United States. This \nkind of continuous dedication is rare, and Carlos embodies it. In a \ntime when professional athletes are opting out of the Olympic Games, \nCarlos has risen to the occasion and accepted a bid to represent his \ntown, his State, his university, his team, and more importantly, his \ncountry. Again I congratulate Mr. Boozer and the rest of the men and \nwomen who will represent this great Nation in Athens this \nsummer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/24/senate-section/article/S7426-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7426]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IN RECOGNITION OF MR. WILLIAM GREENBLATT\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today I would like to recognize Mr. \nWilliam Greenblatt, a man whose accomplishments are a true testament to \nwhat a business and community leader should be, as he celebrates his \nfiftieth birthday on June 9, 2004.\n  Mr. Greenblatt began his career providing photography services for \ncommercial, industrial, public relations and non-profit organizations \nincluding the City of St. Louis, Make-A-Wish Foundation, United Way, \nand American Heart Association. He also serves as the St. Louis Fire \nDepartment's photographer recreating fire scene construction and \ninvestigations as well as documenting training and incidents.\n  During Mr. Greenblatt's career, he has had the honor of being the \nofficial photographer for many of Missouri's most prominent Federal, \nState, and local politicians, as well as St. Louis artists Nelly and \nToya. In addition to his services at United Press International, he has \ncontributed to numerous publications such as the Chicago Tribune, Los \nAngeles Times, Newsweek Magazine, New York Times, and the Washington \nPost.\n  Mr. Greenblatt has dedicated both his professional and personal life \nto the betterment of his community. He has served on several non-profit \nboards as well as being a member of several professional organizations \nincluding the St. Louis Regional Chamber and Growth Association, St. \nLouis Journalism Review Board of Editorial Advisors, Urban League of \nMetropolitan St. Louis, and the James S. McDonnell Board of Directors.\n  Throughout his service, Mr. Greenblatt has been honored with several \nachievements including placing in the Baseball Hall of Fame Photo \nContest, Certificate of Appreciation from the City of St. Louis \nEmergency Management Agency, Outstanding Citizen Award.\n  Mr. Greenblatt has a distinguished record of service in his public \nand private life. I would like to thank him for his dedication to his \nprofession as well as his contributions to the St. Louis Community. On \nbehalf of Missouri, I wish him a happy 50th birthday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/24/senate-section/article/S7426-3", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7426-S7427]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n\n  THE U.S.-AUSTRALIA FREE TRADE AGREEMENT AND THE AFRICAN GROWTH AND \n                            OPPORTUNITY ACT\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased to announce today my \nsupport for the U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement. The United States \nhas a trade surplus with Australia and this agreement will boost our \nexports still further by eliminating Australian tariffs on our \nmanufactured goods and on several key agricultural exports. Not only \ndoes the agreement promote our economic interests and job creation here \nin America, but Australia is also an important ally, and we must do all \nwe can to ensure a healthy and vibrant relationship between our two \nnations.\n  I am, however, disappointed that the Bush administration did not \nbuild on the model of the U.S.-Jordan agreement by including strong and \nenforceable labor standards in the core of the agreement. Although \nAustralia already has very strong labor rights and an effective \nenforcement regime, the agreement represents a missed opportunity to \nset a higher benchmark for future trade agreements by cementing the \nprinciple that labor and environmental standards are in the core of all \nnew agreements.\n  In addition, I am disappointed that the Bush administration did not \ndo a better job negotiating an agreement that would protect our \nimportant beef and dairy industries. I was happy to support an \namendment in the Finance Committee that helps ensure a level playing \nfield for our domestic beef industry.\n  I am also pleased to announce today my intention to cosponsor the \nMilk Import Tariff Equity Act, S. 560, a bill to impose tariff-rate \nquotas on certain casein and milk protein concentrates and help ensure \nfair competition for our nation's dairy farmers.\n  As we look ahead I want to reiterate that this agreement and others I \nhave supported should not be viewed as models for all future bilateral \nagreements under negotiation. In particular, it is important to have \nstrong ties with our Central American neighbors. However, the lack of \nstrong and enforceable labor and environmental standards are more \nserious in the CAFTA agreement because of the poor history the Central \nAmerican countries have with labor issues. I oppose the current CAFTA \nagreement, and I hope that over time it\n\n[[Page S7427]]\n\ncan be improved to strengthen labor rights and our ties to our \nneighbors. The goal is to make sure that trade lifts all people up, \nthat it creates growth with equity.\n  I also understand that last night Majority Leader Frist and Minority \nLeader Daschle discussed the possibility that the Senate will soon pass \nan extension of the African Growth and Opportunity Act. While some \nSenators have concerns with AGOA III that must still be resolved, and \nwe should provide adequate time to address those concerns, I would like \nthe record to show that I support this important legislation and would \nlike to see it enacted.\n  Today, the countries of sub-Saharan Africa face some of the world's \ngreatest challenges to export growth, including insufficient domestic \nmarkets, lack of investment capital, and poor transportation and power \ninfrastructures. Perhaps most devastating, the region continues to be \nravaged by the growing HIV/AIDS pandemic. AGOA provides a door to a \nbrighter future for these nations. By enhancing and enabling economic, \nlegal and political reform, AGOA sets the stage for economic growth and \npolitical stability in the region, and helps lift up the lives of the \npeople of Africa.\n  Through our trading relationships, the United States can help spread \neffective political, economic and legal institutions to regions of the \nworld that are vulnerable to political instability, civil war and \nglobal terrorism. Ensuring sub-Sahara African economic integration is \none of the surest ways to cultivate new and powerful allies in the war \non terror.\n  AGOA is an integral part of a broader partnership with Africa that \nmust also include progress on debt relief and stepped-up efforts to \nfight the scourage of HIV/AIDS. Given the importance of AGOA to the \nfuture we share with Africa, I hope the remaining concerns of my \ncolleagues can be addressed to ensure the passage of AGOA III. Passing \nthis critical extension of AGOA will send a powerful signal to Africa \nand the world that the United States is committed to extending the \nbenefits of the global economy to all those willing to make the \nnecessary economic, legal and political reforms.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/24/senate-section/article/S7427-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7427]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/24/senate-section/article/S7427-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7427]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/24/senate-section/article/S7427-3", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7427]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT OF THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO \n                       THE WESTERN BALKANS--PM 89\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport: which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent the \nenclosed notice, stating that the Western Balkans emergency is to \ncontinue in effect beyond June 26, 2004, to the Federal Register for \npublication. The most recent notice continuing this emergency was \npublished in the Federal Register on June 24, 2003, 68 Fed.

Subsequent to the \ndeclaration of the national emergency, acts obstructing implementation \nof the Ohrid Framework Agreement of 2001 in the former Yugoslav \nRepublic of Macedonia, have also become a concern. All of these actions \nare hostile to U.S. interests and pose a continuing unusual and \nextraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the \nUnited States.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the Legislature of the State of Louisiana relative to the \n     National Finance Center in New Orleans, Louisiana; to the \n     Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 47\n\n       Whereas, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has been \n     the forerunner in the application of computer technology in \n     managing administrative functions; and\n       Whereas, in 1973, the USDA established the National Finance \n     Center in New Orleans to provide consolidated payroll, \n     personnel, and voucher and invoice payment systems and \n     services to numerous government agencies; and\n       Whereas, today the National Finance Center in New Orleans \n     also provides systems and support services for several \n     government-wide processes, including the Federal Retirement \n     Thrift Savings Plan; and\n       Whereas, the National Finance Center has become an asset \n     not only to the government, but also the Greater New Orleans \n     Area; and\n       Whereas, the National Finance Center in New Orleans employs \n     over twelve hundred local federal employees; and\n       Whereas, the National Finance Center in New Orleans has \n     recently been criticized by the Federal Retirement Thrift \n     Investment Board (FRTIB), which oversees the Thrift Savings \n     Plan; and\n       Whereas, the National Finance Center in New Orleans has \n     dedicated over four hundred federal employees to the Thrift \n     Savings Plan, who are responsible for answering phone calls \n     from plan participants, processing loans, sending out \n     statements, and maintaining the computer information systems; \n     and\n       Whereas, at the request of the FRTIB, the National Finance \n     Center in New Orleans installed a new and untested mainframe \n     computer in order to manage the more than three million one \n     hundred thousand plan participants accounts; and\n       Whereas, due to the flawed computer system, a problem that \n     exceeded the scope of work performed by the National Finance \n     Center's employees, numerous problems were encountered by the \n     Thrift Savings Plan participants; and\n       Whereas, the problems were so serious that the National \n     Finance Center became the subject of congressional hearing \n     which questioned the center's ability to effectively manage \n     the Thrift Savings Plan; and\n       Whereas, as a result of these inquiries, more than four \n     hundred federal employees of the National Finance Center are \n     experiencing a profound loss of moral as they face a future \n     of increasing job uncertainty due to the recent press attacks \n     which have reflected poorly upon their personal work \n     performances; and\n       Whereas, prior to the installation of this new, untested, \n     and flawed mainframe computer by the FRTIB, the National \n     Finance Center in New Orleans had enjoyed a long history of \n     exemplary service and a solid reputation for its ability to \n     effectively serve the needs of its customers: Therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes \n     the Congress of the United States to support and expand the \n     operations of the National Finance Center in New Orleans, \n     including the renewal of its contract with the Federal \n     Retirement Thrift Investment Board. Be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and \n     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives and \n     to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United \n     States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-464. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth \n     of Kentucky relative to legislation to establish English as \n     the official language of the United States; to the Committee \n     on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 242\n\n       Whereas, the United States of America is composed of \n     individuals from diverse ethnic, cultural, and linguistic \n     backgrounds, and continues to benefit from its rich \n     diversity; and\n       Whereas, throughout the history of the United States, the \n     common thread binding individuals of different backgrounds \n     has been the English language; and\n       Whereas, declaring English as the official language is \n     essential for uniting Americans who now speak more than 329 \n     languages by providing a common means of communication; and\n       Whereas, U.S. immigrants would be encouraged to learn \n     English in order to use government services and to \n     participate in the democratic process; and\n       Whereas, learning English would be beneficial to immigrants \n     who become United States Citizens because studies of Census \n     data show that an immigrant's income rises about 30 percent \n     as a result of learning English, leading to the realization \n     of the American dream of increased economic opportunity and \n     the ability to be a productive member of society; and\n       Whereas, in New York City schools, 54 percent of students \n     who entered English as a Second Language programs in \n     kindergarten scored above the 50th percentile in reading when \n     they reached the 7th grade, compared with under 40 percent \n     for students who entered bilingual programs at the same time; \n     and in mathematics, the gap was even greater, 70 percent \n     versus 51 percent; and\n       Whereas, the 2000 U.S. Census revealed that 21.3 million \n     Americans, eight percent of the population, are classified as \n     ``limited English proficient,'' a 52 percent increase from \n     1990, and more than double the 1980 total; and\n       Whereas, the United States Government's efforts make it \n     easy for immigrants to function in their native languages has \n     not only proven to be expensive for American taxpayers, it \n     has served to keep immigrants linguistically isolated, \n     excluding them from the American ``melting pot'' which truly \n     unites us as a people; and\n       Whereas, in 1983 the late Senator S. I. Hayakawa, an \n     immigrant himself, founded U.S. English, Incorporated, a \n     group dedicated to preserving the unifying role of the \n     English language in the United States, declaring that \n     ``English is the key to full participation in the \n     opportunities of American life''; and\n       Whereas, President Theodore Roosevelt stated that ``We have \n     room for but one language here, and that is the English \n     language, for we intend to see that the crucible turns our \n     people out as Americans''; and\n       Whereas, official English legislation does not mean \n     ``English only'' because it does not prohibit government \n     agencies from using other languages when there is a \n     compelling public interest for doing so, such as protecting \n     public health and safety, assuring equality before the law, \n     promoting tourism, teaching foreign languages, providing for \n     national defense, and many other legitimate, common sense \n     needs: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the General \n     Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky:\n       Section 1.

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Hawaii \n     relative to legislation to provide access prescription drugs \n     by allowing purchase of prescription drugs from Canada and \n     other countries that meet federal safety requirements; to the \n     Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 47\n\n       Whereas, the cost of prescription drugs has risen steadily \n     in recent years, affecting consumers, businesses or \n     employers, and public programs, while the pharmaceutical \n     industry has been named as the most profitable among the \n     Fortune 500 Companies in 2002; and\n       Whereas, Americans pay more for prescription drugs than in \n     any other industrialized nation; in Canada, for example, a \n     three-month supply of the best selling prescription drug \n     Lipitor is thirty-seven percent cheaper; Paxil is \n     approximately fifty percent cheaper; Vioxx is fifty-eight \n     percent cheaper; and the anti-psychotic drug Risperdal is \n     eighty percent cheaper; and\n       Whereas, in May 2003, Hawaii's Attorney General joined \n     thirty-seven other attorneys general in a letter to Congress, \n     seeking relief for consumers from the high cost of \n     prescriptions and pointing out that the high cost of many \n     brand-name prescription drugs makes lifesaving medications \n     out of reach for many individuals; and\n       Whereas, the federal Food and Drug Administration has \n     refused to certify as safe for reimportation prescription \n     medication from Canada and other foreign countries, which \n     would allow United States citizens, state and county \n     governments, and businesses access to prescription drugs at \n     much lower prices; and\n       Whereas, to justify its refusal, the Food and Drug \n     Administration contends that reimportation from other \n     countries could jeopardize consumer safety because \n     pharmaceuticals from other countries will not be subject to \n     the same requirements imposed by the United States; and\n       Whereas, a number of governors and mayors already are \n     taking steps to provide prescription drugs from Canada to \n     state employees, retirees, and residents; and\n       Whereas, in recent legislation, Congress authorized drug \n     reimportation from Canada, giving United States Health and \n     Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson the authority to \n     grant exceptions to allow states to purchase Canadian drugs \n     for state employees and retirees; and\n       Whereas, it is likely, however, that the practice of \n     reimportation will remain illegal;\n\n[[Page S7430]]\n\n     for example, Secretary Thompson quickly denied Illinois \n     Governor Rod Blagojevich's request for an exemption, \n     declaring that he would waive federal regulations only if he \n     could guarantee the safety of prescription drugs from Canada; \n     and\n       Whereas, recent research indicates that Canada's drug \n     approval system is as stringent as that of the United States \n     and pharmacy practices in the Canadian provinces of Manitoba \n     and Ontario were deemed equal to or superior to pharmacy \n     practice in Illinois; and\n       Whereas, there is pending federal legislation that will \n     enable the reimportation of prescription drugs from Canada \n     and other industrialized countries that can meet regulatory \n     requirements to ensure that consumers and government agencies \n     have access to safe prescription drugs at reasonable costs: \n     Now be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-\n     second Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of \n     2004, That members of Congress, including Hawaii's \n     congressional delegation, are urged to establish as an \n     immediate priority the passage of legislation that makes \n     safe, affordable prescription drugs accessible to all United \n     States residents through reimportation and other means, \n     including requesting the cooperation of the United States \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Food and Drug \n     Administration; and be it further\n       Resolved, That certified copies of this Resolution be \n     transmitted to the President of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Food and Drug \n     Administration, and members of Hawaii's delegation to the \n     United States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-466. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Hawaii \n     relative to the Employee Free Choice Act; to the Committee on \n     Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 195\n\n       Whereas, in 1935, the United States established, by law, \n     that workers must be free to form unions; and\n       Whereas, the freedom to form or join a union is \n     internationally recognized as a fundamental human right; and\n       Whereas, union membership provides workers better wages and \n     benefits, and protection from discrimination and unsafe \n     workplaces; and\n       Whereas, unions benefit communities by strengthening tax \n     bases, promoting equal treatment, and enhancing civic \n     participation; and\n       Whereas, workers want to organize, but are unable to, since \n     more than forty million United States workers say they would \n     join a union now if they had the opportunity; and\n       Whereas, even though, on paper, America's workers have the \n     freedom to choose for themselves whether to have a union, in \n     reality, workers across the nation are routinely denied that \n     right; and\n       Whereas, when the right of workers to form a union is \n     violated, wages fall, race and gender pay gaps widen, \n     workplace discrimination increases, and job safety standards \n     disappear; and\n       Whereas, many thousands of America's workers are routinely \n     threatened, coerced, or fired each year because they attempt \n     to form a union; and\n       Whereas, most violations of workers' freedom to choose a \n     union occur behind closed doors and each year millions of \n     dollars are spent to frustrate workers' efforts to form \n     unions; and\n       Whereas, a worker's fundamental right to choose a union is \n     a public issue that requires public policy solutions, \n     including legislative remedies; and\n       Whereas, the Employee Free Choice Act (S. 1925 and H.R. \n     3619) has been introduced in the United States Congress in \n     order to restore workers' freedom to join a union; and\n       Whereas, the Employee Free Choice Act has received broad \n     bipartisan support with over two hundred congressional \n     members as co-sponsors; and\n       Whereas, at its March 17 meeting, the Hawaii State AFL-CIO \n     Executive Board unanimously endorsed the Employee Free Choice \n     Act: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-\n     second Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of \n     2004, the Senate concurring. That the Legislature supports \n     the Employee Free Choice Act (S. 1925 and H.R. 3619), which \n     would:\n       (1) Authorize the National Labor Relations Board to certify \n     a union as the bargaining representative when a majority of \n     employees voluntarily sign authorizations designating that \n     union to represent them;\n       (2) Provide for first contract mediation and arbitration; \n     and\n       (3) Establish meaningful penalties for violations of a \n     worker's freedom to choose a union; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature urges Hawaii's congressional \n     delegation to support the Employee Free Choice Act and to \n     impel the United States Congress to pass this measure to \n     protect America's workers and preserve their freedom to \n     choose for themselves whether or not to form a union; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That certified copies of this Concurrent \n     Resolution be transmitted to the President of the United \n     States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, and the members of Hawaii's congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-467. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Hawaii \n     relative to the No Child Left Behind Act; to the Committee on \n     Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 42\n\n       Whereas, Hawaii commends President George W. Bush and the \n     No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 for pursuing the laudable \n     goals of increasing student performance and closing the \n     achievement gap; and\n       Whereas, these are the same goals that states have been \n     pursuing on their own behalf for years--well before the \n     introduction of No Child Left Behind; and\n       Whereas, many aspects of this law, however, are misplaced \n     and too prescriptive for the State and impose specific \n     requirements on state education agencies; and\n       Whereas, many of the mandates inherent in No Child Left \n     Behind will impose costs on the State above what it is \n     receiving in federal money and could undermine current \n     programs and policies; and\n       Whereas, it is unrealistic to require that all subgroups of \n     students--those with disabilities, limited English \n     proficiency--and ethnic and economically disadvantaged \n     backgrounds--reach one hundred percent proficiency or \n     adequate yearly progress, based on the same measures and \n     standards; and\n       Whereas, it is unfair to identify a school as \n     underperforming based upon the results of one subgroup, \n     without taking into consideration the school's overall \n     performance; and\n       Whereas, using a value-added model, based upon the growth \n     of individual students from grade to grade, may be more \n     appropriate for states and should be an acceptable option; \n     and\n       Whereas, identifying an entire school as under-performing \n     based solely on the ninety-five per cent participation \n     requirement for testing is inappropriate and will cause major \n     negative implications to the Hawaii school system; and\n       Whereas, requiring all teachers and paraprofessionals to \n     meet a ``highly qualified'' definition is inappropriate for a \n     state as remote as Hawaii and threatens to exacerbate current \n     teacher shortages; and\n       Whereas, Hawaii is not in the proximity of other states \n     that would allow the State to recruit ``highly qualified'' \n     teachers from other areas; and\n       Whereas, each state is required to expand the frequency and \n     scope of student testing to include testing of all students \n     in reading or language arts and mathematics each year in \n     grades three through eight, beginning in the 2005-2006 school \n     year, and to adopt standards for the teaching of science and \n     develop and administer science assessments by the 2007-2008 \n     school year; and\n       Whereas, if a Title I (federally funded compensatory \n     education program for low-income and at-risk students) school \n     fails to make ``adequate yearly progress'', then certain \n     consequences will follow. If the failure is:\n       (1) For two consecutive years, then the state department of \n     education must: (a) give parents the option of transferring \n     their children to another school, including a charter school, \n     at the beginning of the third year, that has not been \n     identified as needing improvement; and (b) provide technical \n     assistance to help the school improve student performance and \n     make adequate yearly progress;\n       (2) For three consecutive years, then the state department \n     of education must give parents whose children remain at a \n     school that has been identified as needing improvement the \n     option of obtaining supplemental educational services \n     (e.g., tutoring and other enrichment services that are in \n     addition to instruction provided during the school day) \n     for their children at the beginning of the fourth year;\n       (3) For four consecutive years, then the department must: \n     (a) replace some school staff; (b) implement a new \n     curriculum; (c) decrease the school's management authority; \n     (d) appoint an outside adviser; (e) extend the school day or \n     year; or (f) restructure the internal organization of the \n     school; and\n       (4) For five consecutive years, then the department must \n     implement one of the following alternative governance \n     arrangements in accordance with the school's restructuring \n     plan: (a) reopen the school as a charter school; (b) replace \n     all or more of the school's staff; or (c) turn management of \n     the school over to a private company; and\n       Whereas, according to the Department of Education's \n     statistics for the 2002-2003 school year, one hundred sixty-\n     seven of Hawaii's two hundred seventy-six schools, or nearly \n     sixty-one percent, fell short of the federal requirements \n     inherent in No Child Left Behind; and\n       Whereas, as testing requirements increase, teacher \n     requirements come into affect, and adequate yearly progress \n     benchmarks are raised, the likelihood will increase that more \n     and more schools will not be able to meet these mandates; and\n       Whereas, there is a realistic possibility that all schools \n     in Hawaii will fall short of the federal mandates within the \n     first several years of the law's implementation; and\n       Whereas, the State commends the federal government for \n     providing increased levels of federal resources to states for \n     education; and\n       Whereas, Hawaii relies on federal aid for education, but is \n     concerned that accepting funds related to No Child Left \n     Behind will put the State in the precarious situation of\n\n[[Page S7431]]\n\n     having to spend its own money in order to meet the mandates \n     of the law: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-\n     Second Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of \n     2004, That this body requests Congress to amend the No Child \n     Left Behind Act of 2001 to include waivers to help states \n     meet the requirements of this law. Specifically, this body \n     requests a waiver from deeming a school as failing based \n     solely on participation rates; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the State requests the President and \n     Congress to provide the State with sufficient funding \n     necessary to meet the mandate to leave no child behind; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That certified copies of this Resolution be \n     transmitted to President George W. Bush, the President of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives, the members of Hawaii's congressional \n     delegation, the Chairperson of the Board of Education and the \n     Superintendent of Education.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-468.

Bush \n     signed into law the ``No Child Left Behind Act'' of 2001 \n     (NCLB), which requires the development of state educational \n     standards, tests to measure against those standards, and \n     collection and reporting of testing data; and\n       Whereas, NCLB contains several very expensive mandates for \n     which Congress has not provided adequate funds to the states; \n     and\n       Whereas, costs to individual states associated with NCLB \n     mandates result from implementing assessment and \n     accountability systems, data collection, teacher quality \n     requirements, and new standards for paraprofessionals, among \n     additional factors; and\n       Whereas, many of the mandates inherent in NCLB inflict \n     costs of the states above what they receive in federal money, \n     and unfunded mandates included in NCLB represent a serious \n     imposition on individual states; and\n       Whereas, any federal mandate for which there are \n     insufficient funds provided is sure to divert resources away \n     from other laudable objectives of individual states; and\n       Whereas, adequate federal funding is a necessity if states \n     are to fully meet the goals of NCLB. Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     urge and request the United States Congress to provide \n     sufficient funding for full implementation of the ``No Child \n     Left Behind Act'' of 2001. Be it further\n       Resolved, That a suitable copy of this Resolution be \n     transmitted to the speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, the president of the United States Senate, \n     and each member of Louisiana's congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-469.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Hawaii \n     relative to visa processing capacity in the consular section \n     of the United States Embassy in Seoul in the Republic of \n     Korea; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                      House Concurrent Resolution\n\n       Whereas, Hawaii remains one of the premier visitor \n     destinations in the world and tourism remains the backbone of \n     Hawaii's economy; and\n       Whereas, the United States and the Republic of Korea have a \n     long history of friendly relations; and\n       Whereas, the Republic of Korea has been a trusted ally for \n     over fifty years, is a major trading partner of the United \n     States, and is the thirteenth largest economy in the world; \n     and\n       Whereas, January 13, 2003 marked the centennial of the \n     first arrival of Koreans in the United States; and\n       Whereas, in the past, the number of visitors from the \n     Republic of Korea had reached as high as 100,000 annually; \n     and\n       Whereas, however, this number has drastically decreased, in \n     part, due to new security requirements prompted by the \n     terrorist acts of September 11, 2001, and the fact that the \n     Republic of Korea is not among the Asian countries currently \n     included in the Visa Waiver Program for visitor entry into \n     the United States; and\n       Whereas, in fact, among the Asian countries, only Japan and \n     Singapore currently benefit from the Visa Waiver Program \n     through which citizens from those countries may enter the \n     United States without needing to obtain visitor visas; and\n       Whereas, due to increased security it has become much more \n     difficult for citizens of the Republic of Korea, especially \n     those living outside the capital city of Seoul, to obtain \n     visitor visas that allow travel to the United States; and\n       Whereas, as part of the required security measures, the \n     Republic of Korea is in the process of installing the \n     equipment needed to enable passports to be machine-readable; \n     and\n       Whereas, while the Republic of Korea is doing its part in \n     facilitating the processing of travel requirements for its \n     citizens, the United States should do its part in \n     facilitating visitors from the Republic of Korea to travel to \n     this country: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-\n     second Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of \n     2004, the Senate concurring, That the Legislature urges the \n     members of Hawaii's congressional delegation to introduce \n     federal legislation to provide additional resources to expand \n     visa processing capacity in the Consular Section of the \n     United States Embassy in Seoul in the Republic of Korea, and \n     to include the Republic of Korea in the Visa Waiver Program; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That certified copies of this Concurrent \n     Resolution be transmitted to the members of Hawaii's \n     congressional delegation, the President of the United States, \n     the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, \n     the President of the United States, the Speaker of the United \n     States Senate, the Secretary of State, the Secretary for \n     Homeland Security, and the Governor.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-471. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the Legislature of the State of Louisiana relative to a \n     Veterans Clinic in Jennings, Louisiana; to the Committee on \n     Veterans' Affairs.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 60\n\n       Whereas, the United States Department of Veterans Affairs \n     has conducted a Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced \n     Services (CARES) Commission Report to enhance the health care \n     services for veterans dated February 2004; and\n       Whereas, the goal of CARES is to make a recommendation to \n     the Secretary of Veterans Affairs on realignment and \n     reallocation of Veterans Affairs health care facilities over \n     the next twenty years, focused on accessibility and cost \n     effectiveness, and involved input from veterans, and their \n     families; and\n       Whereas, the CARES Commission did not recommend the closure \n     of the Jennings Community Based Outpatient Clinic; and\n       Whereas, the Director of the Veterans Medical Center in \n     Alexandria recommended to the CARES Commission to relocate \n     the Jennings Community Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) to Lake \n     Charles, Louisiana, in order to reduce veteran travel; and\n       Whereas, the Jennings CBOC facility was constructed by the \n     Jennings American Legion Hospital and leased by the Veterans \n     Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) Alexandria for ten years with \n     two years remaining as a special use facility by the Veterans \n     Affairs utilizing Veterans Affairs specifications; and\n       Whereas, the Jenning CBOC has become a centrally located \n     Veterans Affairs clinic with easy access off of Interstate 10 \n     to provide health care services to veterans of southwest \n     Louisiana; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana Reserve military forces and National \n     Guard have been activated to preserve freedom, combat \n     terrorism, and enhance human rights in Iraq and Afghanistan; \n     and\n       Whereas, the proposed closure of Jennings CBOC is a \n     negative signal to our loyal, dedicated, Louisiana military \n     forces in combat who will need community health care in the \n     future; and\n       Whereas, the United State Department of Veterans Affairs \n     has entered into a twenty year cooperative agreement with the \n     state of Louisiana to construct a veterans nursing home in \n     Jennings, Louisiana, located between the only two American \n     Legion Hospitals in the United States within a few miles of \n     Jennings CBOC; and\n       Whereas, veterans in southwest Louisiana and in the nursing \n     home would benefit from the close proximity of an outpatient \n     clinic in Jennings that would provide specialized health care \n     in addition to primary care, instead of requiring those \n     disabled World War II, Korean, Vietnam, and Gulf War veterans \n     to travel over a four hour round trip for specialized health \n     care services at VAMC Alexandria; and\n       Whereas, veterans in the Lake Charles area use the Jennings \n     CBOC and due to the high volume of southwest Louisiana \n     veterans using the Jennings CBOC, another CBOC is required in \n     Lake Charles as recommended by the Director of VAMC \n     Alexandria to the CARES Commission; and\n       Whereas, the Jennings CBOC is approximately halfway between \n     the Lafayette CBOC and the proposed Lake Charles CBOC, by \n     enhancing the Jennings CBOC to include specialized health \n     care for 66,159 veterans would significantly reduce the time \n     of travel for southwest Louisiana veterans who would \n     otherwise spend over four hours traveling to the middle of \n     Louisiana at VAMC Alexandria. Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana hereby \n     memorializes the United States Congress to continue the \n     operation of the Jennings CBOC by providing primary health \n     care, and expand Veterans Affairs health care services to \n     offer enhanced specialized health care at the centrally \n     located Jennings CBOC, between Lafayette and Lake Charles, \n     Louisiana, to reduce the travel of disabled southwest \n     Louisiana veterans.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the Legislature of the State\n\n[[Page S7432]]\n\n     of Hawaii relative to Filipino World War II Veterans and \n     their families; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 97\n\n       Whereas, in recognition of the courage and loyalty of the \n     Filipino troops who fought alongside our armed forces in the \n     Philippines during World War II, the United States Congress \n     enacted legislation in 1990 that provided a waiver from \n     certain immigration and naturalization requirements for those \n     Filipino veterans; and\n       Whereas, as a result of that legislation, many of those \n     Filipino veterans have become proud citizens and residents of \n     this country; and\n       Whereas, because the 1990 legislation did not go far enough \n     in extending those immigration and naturalization benefits to \n     the children of those veterans, the result has been years \n     long separations between the veterans and their children \n     remaining in the Philippines awaiting the issuance of \n     immigrant visas; and\n       Whereas, on November 21, 2003, H.R. 3587 was introduced in \n     the United States House of Representatives to amend the \n     Immigration and Naturalization Act to give priority in the \n     issuance of immigration visas to the sons and daughters of \n     Filipino World War II veterans who are or were naturalized \n     citizens of the United States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the Twenty-second Legislature of \n     the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2004, the House of \n     Representatives concurring, That the President of the United \n     States and the United States Congress are urged to support \n     the passage of H.R. 3587 into law; and be it further\n       Resolved, That certified copies of this Concurrent \n     Resolution be transmitted to the President of the United \n     States, the President of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, and \n     the members of Hawaii's congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-473. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Hawaii \n     relative to benefits for Filipino veterans of World War II; \n     to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 258\n\n       Whereas, on December 8, 1941, thousands of Filipino men and \n     women responded to President Roosevelt's call for help to \n     preserve peace and democracy in the Philippines; and\n       Whereas, during the dark days of World War II, nearly \n     100,000 soldiers of the Philippine Commonwealth Army provided \n     a ray of hope in the Pacific as they fought alongside United \n     States and Allied forces for four long years to defend and \n     reclaim the Philippine Islands from Japanese aggression; and\n       Whereas, thousands more Filipinos joined U.S. Armed Forces \n     immediately after the war and served in occupational duty \n     throughout the Pacific Theater; and\n       Whereas, valiant Filipino soldiers fought, died, and \n     suffered in some of the bloodiest battles of World War II, \n     defending beleaguered Bataan and Corregidor, and thousands of \n     Filipino prisoners of war endured the infamous Bataan Death \n     March and years of captivity; and\n       Whereas, their many guerrilla actions slowed the Japanese \n     takeover of the Western Pacific region and allowed U.S. \n     forces the time to build and prepare for the allied \n     counterattack on Japan; and\n       Whereas, Filipino troops fought side-by-side with U.S. \n     forces to secure their island nation as the strategic base \n     from which the final effort to defeat Japan was launched; and\n       Whereas, President William J. Clinton proclaimed October \n     20, 1996, as a day honoring the Filipino Veterans of World \n     War II, recalling the courage, sacrifice, and loyalty of \n     Filipino veterans of World War II in defense of democracy and \n     liberty; and\n       Whereas, for decades after their heroic service under the \n     command of their leaders and General Douglas MacArthur, these \n     men and women of Filipino-American national heritage were \n     denied the benefits and privileges provided to their American \n     compatriots who fought side-by-side with them; and\n       Whereas, the Rescission Act of 1946 withdrew the U.S. \n     veteran's status of Filipino World War II soldiers, thereby \n     denying them the benefits and compensation received by their \n     American counterparts and soldiers of more than sixty-six \n     other U.S. allied countries, who were similarly inducted into \n     the U.S. military; and\n       Whereas, the Rescission Act discriminated against \n     Filipinos, making them the only national group singled out \n     for denial of full U.S. veterans status and benefits; and\n       Whereas, the passage of S. 68, now pending in the United \n     States Senate, would extend full and equitable benefits, \n     particularly health benefits, to Filipino veterans, \n     considering their advanced age and poor health; and\n       Whereas, S. 68 proposes to amend Title 38 of the United \n     States Code, to improve benefits for Filipino veterans of \n     World War II and for the surviving spouses of those veterans; \n     and\n       Whereas, S. 68 would increase the rate of payment of \n     compensation benefits to certain Filipino veterans, \n     designated in Title 38 United States Code section 107(b) and \n     referred to as New Philippine Scouts, who reside in the \n     United States and are United States citizens or lawful \n     permanent resident aliens; and\n       Whereas, S. 68 would further increase the rate of payment \n     of dependency and indemnity compensation of surviving spouses \n     of certain Filipino veterans; and\n       Whereas, S. 68 would further make eligible for full \n     disability pensions certain Filipino veterans who reside in \n     the United States and are United States citizens or lawful \n     permanent resident aliens; and\n       Whereas, S. 68 would further mandate the Secretary of \n     Veterans Affairs to provide hospital and nursing home care \n     and medical services for service-connected disabilities for \n     any Filipino World War II veteran who resides in the United \n     States and is a United States citizen or lawful permanent \n     resident alien; and\n       Whereas, S. 68 would further require the Secretary of \n     Veterans Affairs to furnish care and services to all Filipino \n     World War II veterans for service-connected disabilities and \n     nonservice-connected disabilities residing in the Republic of \n     the Philippines on an outpatient basis at the Manila VA \n     Outpatient Clinic: Now, therefore be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-\n     Second Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of \n     2004, the Senate concurring, That the United States Congress \n     is respectfully urged to support the passage of S. 68 to \n     improve benefits for certain Filipino veterans of World War \n     II; and be it further\n       Resolved, That certified copies of this Concurrent \n     Resolution be transmitted to the President of the United \n     States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, the members of the Hawaii Congressional \n     delegation, and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/24/senate-section/article/S7432-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. STEVENS, from the Committee on Appropriations:\n       Report to accompany S. 2559, an original bill making \n     appropriations for the Department of Defense for the fiscal \n     year ending September 30, 2005, and for other purposes (Rept. \n     No. 108-284).\n       By Mr. INHOFE, from the Committee on Environment and Public \n     Works, without amendment:\n       H.R. 1572.

A bill to amend the Older Americans Act of 1965 to provide \nfor mental health screening and treatment services, to amend the Public \nHealth Service Act to provide for integration of mental health services \nand mental health treatment outreach teams, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, today, I rise to introduce the Positive \nAging Act of 2004 to improve the accessibility and quality of mental \nhealth services for our rapidly growing population of older Americans \nwith my colleagues Senators Breaux and Collins. Representatives Patrick \nKennedy and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen are also introducing a companion bill \nin the House this afternoon.\n  My colleagues John Breaux and Patrick Kennedy introduced this bill \ninitially to focus on mental health programs, and with constituent \ninput we decided to broaden it to involve the aging community as well. \nI want to acknowledge our partners from both the mental health and \naging organizations who have collaborated with us and been working hard \non these issues for a long time.\n  Our significant success in extending the life span of older adults \nhas created a set of challenges related to the quality of life for \nAmerican's senior citizens. It is critically important now to focus on \nmaking the extra years of life as productive and healthy as possible. \nThis legislation is designed to do just that. It puts mental health \nservices on a par with other primary care services in community \nsettings that are easily accessible to the elderly. I firmly believe we \nmust integrate mental health services with other essential primary \ncare.\n  The Surgeon General's report on mental health in 1999 told us that \ndisability due to mental illness in the elderly population is fast \nbecoming a major public health problem. Depression, dementia, anxiety, \nand substance abuse are growing problems among older Americans that \nresult in functional dependence, long-term institutional care and \nreduced quality of life.\n  Nearly 20 percent of those over age 55 experience mental illnesses \nthat are not a part of ``normal'' aging, and are all too frequently \nundetected and untreated. The real tragedy is that we can effectively \ntreat many of these conditions, but in far too many instances we are \nnot making such treatments available. Unrecognized and untreated mental \nillness among elderly adults can be traced to gaps in training of \nhealth professionals, and in our failure to fully integrate mental \nhealth screening and treatment with other health services. Far too \noften physicians and other health professionals fail to recognize the \nsigns and symptoms of mental illness. More troubling, knowledge about \neffective interventions is simply not accessible to many primary care \npractitioners.\n  Research has shown that treatment of mental illnesses can reduce the \nneed for other health services and can improve health outcomes for \nthose with other chronic diseases. These missed opportunities to \ndiagnose and treat mental diseases are taking a huge toll on the \nelderly and increasing the burden on their families and our health care \nsystem.\n  I know there are a number of reasons for our failure to meet the \nmental health needs of our seniors. Regrettably, acknowledging and \nseeking mental health care can be impeded by the stigma associated with \nmental illness. In addition, Medicare benefit discrimination related to \ncoverage of mental health services continues to be a barrier to \nappropriate care for the elderly.\n  Finally, the lack of coverage for prescription drugs in Medicare has \nuntil now imposed significant financial burdens on many older \nAmericans. Notwithstanding the addition of a limited Medicare drug \nbenefit, there remains the potential that drugs needed for \nthe treatment of mental illness will be treated unfairly through \nformulary restrictions, prior authorization, and higher out-of-pocket \nexpenses. We must be especially vigilant in our oversight of this \nbenefit to prevent such discrimination on behalf of the millions of \nolder Americans with mental illnesses.\n\n  The bill we are introducing today provides new authorities and \nresources to the Administration on Aging (AOA) and the Substance Abuse \nand Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) in the Department of \nHealth and Human Services. For over 35 years, the AOA has provided home \nand community-based services to millions of older persons through the \nprograms funded under the Older Americans Act. SAMHSA provides block \ngrants to the States and other financial support to develop and apply \nbest practices in the identification and treatment of mental diseases \nat the community level. Working together these agencies have the \npotential for strengthening and extending the delivery of mental health \nservices to older Americans.\n  This legislation focuses on getting mental health services to \ncommunity sites where primary care and other social services are \nprovided. It will promote the integration of mental health services and \nthe use of evidence-based practice protocols. This approach has the \nadvantage of building on existing structures and programs, and \n``mainstreaming'' mental health care for these vulnerable populations.\n  The bill authorizes AOA to make formula grants to the states for the \ndevelopment and operation of systems for providing mental health \nscreening and treatment services to older Americans. These funds may \nalso be used for outreach programs to increase public awareness of the \navailability and effectiveness of mental health assessments and \ntreatment. Priority will be given to areas that are medically under-\nserved and include significant numbers of older adults. States will be \nrequired to coordinate projects with existing community agencies and \nvoluntary organizations offering services to the targeted populations.\n  This legislation also establishes new grant authorities at AOA to \nsupport development and operation of projects for screening and \ntreating mental illness among seniors in rural and urban areas.\n\n[[Page S7438]]\n\n  Multidisciplinary teams of mental health professionals relying on \nevidence-based intervention and treatment protocols are required to \ndeliver these services. To the maximum extent possible, the grants will \nbe coordinated with activities in senior centers, adult day care \nprograms, and naturally occurring retirement centers (NORCs).\n  This legislation also authorizes two new grant programs at SAMHSA to \nprovide new resources to support mental health screening and treatment \nservices in clinical settings. Primary care sites serving a geriatric \npatient population such as public or private nonprofit community health \ncenters or private practices would be eligible for one of these new \ngrant programs.\n  The other program will provide support for geriatric mental health \noutreach teams to foster collaboration between clinical sites and \nsenior centers, assisted living facilities, and other social or \nresidential service centers.\n  Since the projects supported by these new grant programs are based in \nclinical settings, these funds will help to inform primary care \npractitioners and increase their capabilities in screening and \ntreatment for mental illness. These projects build on existing health \ncare delivery systems and extend their reach to low-income seniors in \nthe community.\n  I expect these demonstrations will be a catalyst for breaking down \nthe barriers that have limited access to mental health services and \nretarded the dissemination of evidence-based protocols in the primary \ncare setting. I have specifically set a priority for projects to serve \na variety of populations, including racial and ethnic minorities and \nlow-income populations, in both rural and urban areas.\n  Finally, we have included in this bill several administrative \nprovisions to raise the profile of mental health services for older \nadults at AOA and SAMHSA. A new Office of Older Adult Mental Health \nServices is established at AOA to provide a senior level focus for \ninitiatives to improve the access of seniors to appropriate mental \nhealth screening and treatment services. At SAMHSA, the bill creates a \nnew deputy director for geriatric mental health services within the \nCenter for Mental Health Services to develop and implement targeted \nprograms for older adults.\n  There are practical and immediate opportunities to improve mental \nhealth care for older Americans. This legislation can help to target \nour resources on identifying and treating a population at high risk for \ndisability and dependence.\n  We have an obligation to take what is known about effective \ntreatments and improve the quality of life and overall health of \nmillions of seniors. It's not only the right thing to do; it's also an \ninvestment that will return enormous dividends in terms of more \neconomical use of health resources, improved patient outcomes, and a \nbetter quality of life for older Americans. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2572\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague \nfrom New York in introducing the Positive Aging Act, which will help to \nincrease older Americans' access to quality mental health screening and \ntreatment services in community-based care settings.\n  The legislation we are introducing today is particularly important \nfor States, like Maine, that have a disproportionate number of elderly \npersons. Maine currently is our Nation's seventh ``oldest'' State. \nMoreover, our older population will continue to grow in the future and, \nby the year 2025, one in five Mainers will be over the age of 65.\n  One of the most daunting public health challenges facing our Nation \ntoday is how to increase access to quality mental health services for \nthe more than 44 million Americans with severe, disabling mental \ndisorders that can devastate their lives and the lives of the people \naround them.\n  What is often overlooked, however, is the prevalence of mental \nillness among our Nation's elderly. Studies have shown that more than \none in five Americans aged 65 and older--including more than 32,000 \nMainers--experience mental illness, and that as many as 80 percent of \nelderly persons in nursing homes suffer from some kind of mental \nimpairment.\n  Particularly disturbing is that fact that the mental health needs of \nolder Americans are often overlooked or not recognized because of the \nmistaken belief that they are a normal part of aging and therefore \ncannot be treated.\n  While older Americans experience the full range of mental disorders, \nthe most prevalent mental illness afflicting older people is \ndepression. Ironically, while recent advances have made depression an \neminently treatable disorder, only a minority of elderly depressed \npersons are receiving adequate treatment. Unfortunately, the vast \nmajority of depressed elderly don't seek help. Many simply accept their \nfeelings of profound sadness and do not realize that they are \nclinically depressed.\n  Those who do seek help are often underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed, \nleading the National Institute of Mental Health to estimate that 60 \npercent of older Americans with depression are not receiving the mental \nhealth care that they need. Failure to treat this kind of disorder \nleads to poorer health outcomes for other medical conditions, higher \nrates of institutionalization, and increased health care costs.\n  Untreated depression can even lead to suicide. The sad fact is that \nAmericans over 65 are more likely to commit suicide than any other age \ngroup. Among those over 85, the suicide rate is twice the national \naverage. What is particularly disturbing about these statistics is that \nstudies have shown that 40 percent of older people who commit suicide \nhave had a visit with their primary care provider within one week of \ntheir death. Seventy percent of these elderly suicide victims had a \nprimary care visit within 30 days of their death.\n  Fortunately, important research is being done that is helping to \ndevelop innovative approaches to improve the delivery of mental health \ncare for older\n\n[[Page S7441]]\n\nadults by integrating it into primary care settings. This research \ndemonstrates that older adults are more likely to receive appropriate \nmental health care if there is a mental health professional on the \nprimary care team, rather than simply referring them to a mental health \nspecialist outside the primary care setting. Multiple appointments with \nmultiple providers in multiple settings simply don't work for older \npatients who must also cope with concurrent chronic illnesses, mobility \nproblems, and limited transportation options. The research also shows \nthat there is less stigma associated with psychiatric services when \nthey are integrated into general medical care.\n\n  The Positive Aging Act builds upon this research and authorizes \nfunding for a range of projects that integrate mental health screening \nand treatment services into community sites and primary health care \nsettings, including community health centers, senior centers, and \nassisted living facilities. Moreover, the evidence-based services under \nthis legislation will be provided by interdisciplinary teams of mental \nhealth professionals working in collaboration with other providers of \nhealth and social services.\n  Among other provisions, our legislation authorizes the creation of an \nOffice of Older Adult Mental Health Services in the Administration on \nAging to develop and implement initiatives to address the mental health \nneeds of older adults. In addition, the Administration on Aging would \nbe authorized to provide grants to States for the development and \ntesting of model mental health delivery systems for the diagnosis and \ntreatment of mental illness and the elderly. It would also be \nauthorized to award demonstration grants to projects targeted to \nproviding screening and mental health services for seniors residing in \nrural areas, as well as grants to encourage the collaboration between \nmental health and other health and social services providers in \nproviding screening and treatment services.\n  The legislation also authorizes the Substance Abuse and Mental Health \nServices Administration (SAMHSA) to award demonstration grants which \nwould support the integration of evidence-based mental health services \nby geriatric mental health specialists into primary care settings and \nsupport the establishment of community-based mental health treatment \noutreach teams in settings where older adults reside or receive social \nservices.\n  The Positive Aging Act will help to promote the mental health and \nwell-being of our older citizens. It is an investment that will return \ntremendous dividends in terms of improved quality of life, better \npatient outcomes, and more efficient use of health care dollars. The \nlegislation has been endorsed by the American Association for Geriatric \nPsychiatry, the National Council on Aging, the American Nurses \nAssociation, the American Psychological Association, the American \nPsychiatric Association and the National Association of Social Workers, \nand I urge all of our colleagues to join us as cosponsors.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MIKULSKI (for herself and Mr. Sarbanes):\n  S. 2574. A bill to provide for the establishment of the National \nInstitutes of Health, Police, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the NIH \nSecurity Act. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is one of \nAmerica's most successful investments. NIH saves lives and helps \nAmericans to live longer and live better. Research funded by NIH has \nmade breakthroughs on many different fronts, from cutting edge \nbioterrorism research to mapping the human genome. Much of the research \ndepends on experts working with hazardous chemicals or biological \nsubstances. We must make sure NIH is safe and secure--both to protect \nimportant research that may save future lives, and to make sure \nhazardous materials don't fall into the wrong hands.\n  The main NIH campus and its satellite facilities contain \napproximately 3,000 research laboratories--2,500 of which are approved \nfor the use of radioisotopes. NIH has 21 high-containment laboratories \nand two high-containment animal facilities. And NIH is constructing \nadditional high-containment laboratories in order to tackle the \nchallenging issue of defending the country against bioterrorism.\n  We count on the NIH Police to protect this national treasure. Yet NIH \nPolice officers are overworked and underpaid. Security at NIH \nfacilities may be at risk because NIH is having trouble recruiting and \nretraining qualified police officers, and because the Police Department \nis not authorized to protect all of NIH's facilities.\n  That's why I am introducing this bill to improve security at NIH by \ngiving the NIH Police the authority they need to do their job and the \npay and benefits they deserve for a job well done. This legislation \ndoes three things. It establishes a permanent police force at NIH. It \nexpands their jurisdiction to cover all of NIH's campuses. And it gives \nNIH Police officers the same pay and retirement benefits that other \nFederal law enforcement officers have.\n  Historically, NIH Police salaries have been among the lowest for law \nenforcement officers in the Washington-Metropolitan area. From 1998-\n2002, the NIH Police had a 70 percent attrition rate. Most officers \nleft for positions in other Federal and local law enforcement agencies \nthat offered better pay and benefits. The constant turnover is having a \ndevastating effect on morale, and it's costing taxpayers hundreds of \nthousands of dollars in overtime pay and lost training costs. That's \nbecause NIH invests in specialized training to make sure their officers \nare prepared to respond to potential biological, chemical, and nuclear \ndisasters. But other agencies are able to lure these officers away. \nAfter spending the money to give their officers the training they need, \nNIH isn't able to give them the pay and benefits they deserve. My bill \nwill ensure that NIH Police officers are getting the same pay and \nretirement benefits as other Federal law enforcement officers.\n  My bill also gives NIH Police officers the authority to carry \nfirearms, serve warrants and conduct investigations on all properties \nunder the custody and control of the NIH. Currently, the NIH Police's \njurisdiction is limited to the main campus in Bethesda, leaving \nthousands of employees and numerous laboratories without their \nprotection. NIH currently employs unarmed security guards at its \nsatellite facilities in Maryland and across the country. These security \nguards do the best they can, but they don't have the authority to \nenforce laws, and they aren't as highly trained as the NIH Police.\n  NIH is serious about security. Dr. Zerhouni, the Director of NIH, \nfully recognizes the need for a highly quality police force to protect \nNIH and the surrounding community, and fully supports this legislation. \nLet's give the NIH Police the resources they need to make sure NIH is \nsafe and secure. This is an important issue that must be addressed. I \nurge my colleagues to pass this important bill quickly, and I ask \nunanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2574\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct \nresearch, monitoring, management, treatment, and outreach activities \nrelating to sudden oak death syndrome and to convene regular meetings \nof, or conduct regular consultations with, Federal, State, tribal and \nlocal government officials to provide recommendations on how to carry \nout those activities; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am introducing today with my colleague, \nSenator Gordon Smith, a bill that addresses an ecological crisis in \nCalifornia and Oregon that quite literally threatens to change the face \nof our States, as well as others. The beloved oak trees are in grave \nperil. Thousands of black oak, coastal live oak, tan and Shreve's oak \ntrees--among the most familiar and best loved features of California's \nlandscape--are dying from a disease known as Sudden Oak Death Syndrome \n(SODS).\n  Caused by an exotic species of the Phytophthora fungus--the fungus \nresponsible for the Irish potato famine--SODS first struck a small \nnumber of tan oaks in Marin County in 1995. Now the disease has spread \nto other oak species from Big Sur in the south to Humboldt County in \nthe north. The loss of trees is approaching epidemic proportions, with \ntens of thousands of dead trees appearing in thousands of acres of \nforests, parks, and gardens. As the trees die, enormous expanses of \nforest, some adjacent to residential areas, are subject to extreme fire \nhazards. Dead oak trees near homes significantly increase fire hazards, \nso residents who built their homes around or among oak trees are in \nparticular danger.\n  Yet, the spread of the fungus-like pathogen that causes SODS is not \nlimited to oak trees. It has also been found on rhododendron plants in \nCalifornia nurseries, bay trees, wild huckleberry plants and other \nnursery stock and small fruit trees. Due to genetic similaries, this \npathogen potentially endangers Red and Pin oak trees on the East Coast, \nas well as the Northeast's lucrative commercial blueberry and cranberry \nindustries.\n  SODS has already had serious economic and environmental impacts. \nAfter the initial discovery of the Sudden Oak Death, the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture (USDA) imposed a quarantine on oak products \nand some nursery stock in 10 counties in Northern California and Curry \nCounty, Oregon. Subsequently, two other counties in Northern California \nwere also put under quarantine. The discovery of the pathogen that \ncauses SODS in two Southern California nurseries in March 2004 led the \nUSDA to impose restrictions on the interstate movement of host and \npotential host plants--as well as plants within 10 meters of these \nplants--from all nurseries in California. To date, 17 States and Canada \nhave placed their own restrictions on the importation of California's \nnursery stock, and some States have banned plants from California \naltogether.\n  If left unchecked, SODS could cause major damage to our commercial \nnurseries, as well the health, productivity and biodiversity of our \nforests. California is the nursery industry's lead producer of \nhorticultural plants, valued at $2 billion a year. The State's oak \nwoodlands provide shelter, habitat, and food to over 300 wildlife \nspecies. They also reduce soil erosion and help moderate extremes in \ntemperature. Not only does SODS put all these benefits at risk, but \ndead and infected trees from this disease increase the threat of \nwildfire, threatening our communities.\n  More needs to be known about the pathogen that causes SODS. \nScientists are struggling to better understand SODS, how the disease is \ntransmitted, and what the best treatment options might be. In 2000, the \nU.S. Forest Service, the University of California, the State \nDepartments of Forestry and Fire Protection, and County Agricultural \nCommissioners created an Oak Mortality Task Force to help coordinate \nresearch, management, monitoring, education, and public policies aimed \nat addressing SODS. Although we have learned a great deal about SODS \nsince the, adequate Federal support is needed if we are to stop the \nspread of this disease before it is too late.\n  That is why I am introducing the Sudden Oak Death Syndrome Control \nAct of 2004, which is based on legislation I introduced in 2001 and \nwhich passed the Senate in 2002. The Sudden Oak Death Syndrome Control \nAct of 2004 would authorize $44.2 million annually over the next five \nyears for creation of a Sudden Oak Death research and monitoring \nprogram, management and treatment activities, fire prevention \nactivities, and education and outreach. The bill would also provide \nfunding for a comprehensive national survey of the fungus-like pathogen \nthat causes SODS and a risk assessment of the threat posed by this \npathogen to natural and managed plant resources. Combined with the \nefforts of state and local officials, this legislation will help to \nprevent the dire predictions from becoming a terrible reality.\n  This bill is endorsed by the American Nursery & Landscape \nAssociation, the California Association of Nurseries and Garden \nCenters, the Nursery Growers Association of California, the state, \nlocal and private members of the California Oak Mortality Task Force, \nand the Marin County Board of Supervisors.\n  I thank Senator Smith for working with me on this bill and for \njoining me in introducing it. I urge my colleagues to join us in this \neffort to help ensure the protection of our nation's commercial nursery \nindustry and precious woodlands.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters from these organizations be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      American Nursery & Landscape\n\n\n                                                  Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 23, 2004.\n     Hon. Gordon Smith,\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Boxer and Smith: The American Nursery & \n     Landscape Association is the national trade organization \n     representing nursery growers, landscape professionals, and \n     retail garden centers in the U.S. On behalf of our industry \n     of small and family businesses, we wish to thank you for your \n     work to prepare and introduce legislation to address the \n     current and expected challenges associated with the serious \n     plant pathogen Phytophthora ramorum.\n       As you well know, the potential risks posed by P. ramorum \n     to American forests, landscape, nurseries, and other \n     agricultural producers necessitate strong federal leadership \n     in such areas as survey and detection, risk mitigation, and \n     research. Your legislative efforts will help to ensure the \n     focus and\n\n[[Page S7443]]\n\n     funding necessary for a cohesive federal and state \n     cooperative response.\n       We would like to commend the performance of your staff \n     contacts, Laura Cimo and Matt Hill. Both have been \n     professional, accessible, and open to suggestions toward \n     improving the legislative language in preparation for its \n     introduction.\n       ANLA is pleased to support your impending legislation, as a \n     critical step toward solving the P. ramorum crisis. Please \n     let us know how ANLA can be of further assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Craig J.

Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: We thank you for all of your efforts on \n     the issue of Sudden Oak Death and especially your \n     legislation, the Sudden Oak Death Syndrome Control Act of \n     2004, which we strongly endorse and support.\n       As you well know, many states closed their borders to all \n     nursery plants in California after Sudden Oak Death was \n     discovered in a southern California nursery. These blockades \n     have included all plants, even those without the ability to \n     transmit the pathogen, and they have included nurseries that \n     the U.S. Department of agriculture has certified are free of \n     Sudden Oak Death.\n       Quite clearly, there is much that needs to be learned about \n     Sudden Oak Death so that regulations are based on risk and \n     not on fear. Your much-needed legislation will improve both \n     the research into the pathogen, its role relating to Sudden \n     Oak Death, and the management and treatment of the disease. \n     Significantly, your legislation will compel a ``comprehensive \n     and biologically sound national survey.'' Only by such a \n     rigorous survey can policymakers understand the risk posed by \n     the pathogen. After all, states that have barred California \n     nursery plants may already harbor Sudden Oak Death but \n     without a national survey they have every incentive to avoid \n     even looking for the pathogen.\n       Again, thank you for drafting this important legislation.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                               Robert H. Falconer,\n     Executive Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          California Oak Mortality\n\n\n                                                   Task Force,\n\n                                   Sacramento, CA, June 24, 20004.\n     Re Sudden Oak Death Syndrome Control Act of 2004.\n\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: The California Oak Mortality Task Force \n     applauds your efforts to secure federal funding for research, \n     monitoring, regulations, management and educational \n     activities necessitated by Sudden Oak Death (Phytophthora \n     ramorum). Resources are urgently needed to address this \n     aggressive exotic pathogen in California and Oregon and \n     protect other parts of the United States and other countries \n     from becoming infested.\n       The California Oak Mortality Task Force represents over 75 \n     organizations cooperating to limit the spread of the pathogen \n     that causes Sudden Oak Death, a disease that has killed tens \n     of thousands of tanoak, coast live oak, and black oak in \n     coastal California. The pathogen also infects rhododendron, \n     camellia and huckleberry, important nursery and agricultural \n     plants.\n       There is much that urgently needs to be done to prevent \n     further damage and protect commerce and natural resources. \n     Some of the highest priorities:\n       Research to understand how the pathogen spreads, assess the \n     potential for ecological, horticultural and agricultural \n     damage, and improve diagnostic tools and treatments\n       Regulation enforcement to limit pathogen spread via \n     commodities\n       Management that includes eradication protocols for new \n     areas, fire prevention treatments for high risk areas, and \n     diagnostic services\n       Monitoring/surveys to determine extent of damage, \n     distribution and spread\n       Educatioal programs for professionals, land managers and \n     homeowners to recognize the problem and determine what can be \n     done about it, including Information and explanation of \n     quarantine measures.\n       The state, local, and private members of the task force \n     support your efforts to address Sudden Oak Death and protect \n     the oak woodlands of the United States. Please contact Lucia \n     Briggs, Coordinator of the CA Oak Mortality Task Force \n     (lbriggs@nature.berkelkey.edu) if we can assist you.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Mark R. Stanley,\n\n                                       Chairperson, California Oak\n     Mortality Task Force.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          The Board of Supervisors\n\n\n                                              of Marin County,\n\n                                    San Rafael, CA, June 16, 2004.\n     Re ``Sudden Oak Death Syndrome Control Act of 2004''--\n         SUPPORT.\n\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: As President of the Marin County \n     California Board of Supervisors, I write to indicate our \n     strong support of your efforts with regard to the ``Sudden \n     Oak Death Syndrome Control Act of 2004,'' which would \n     authorize $44.2 million for FY2005 through FY2009, as \n     compared to the $14.25 million already authorized for FY2003 \n     through FY2007.\n       The legislation addresses the ever expanding need for \n     resources for local, state and federal agencies to deal with \n     the economic, environmental and policy impacts created by the \n     infestation of this devastating plant disease. Marin County \n     has lost tens of thousands of trees and has been at the \n     center of this problem for several years as one of the \n     original 12 California Counties placed under state and \n     federal quarantine.\n       The recent documentation of Sudden Oak Death (SOD) \n     infestation in commercial nurseries in Southern California \n     has elevated the problem. The transmission of the disease \n     across state lines, carried on nursery stock, to a number of \n     states in the southern and eastern United States has \n     triggered multiple state SOD quarantines against California \n     and created enforcement and communication problems \n     nationwide.\n       Funding increases proposed in the bill would provide much \n     needed improvements in communication and intergovernmental \n     coordination between USDA, APHIS, State Plant Quarantine \n     Officials, California Agricultural Commissioners and Nursery \n     Sock Producers. It would fund a national risk assessment to \n     determine the possible biological and economic impacts of the \n     disease. The bill would also address the need to strengthen \n     domestic quarantine inspections to determine if the disease \n     may be moving into the United States on nursery stock \n     originating from Europe.\n       The Marin County Board of Supervisors strongly supports \n     your proposed ``Sudden Oak Death Syndrome Control Act of \n     2004'' and thank you for your continued support in dealing \n     with this critical issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Steve Kinsey,\n                                                        President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 2576. A bill to establish an expedited procedure for congressional \nconsideration of health care reform legislation; to the Committee on \nRules and Administration.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I introduce the Health Care Reform \nExpedited Procedures Act of 2004, legislation that requires Congress to \nact on what may be the most pressing domestic policy issue of our time, \nnamely health care reform.\n  I travel to each of Wisconsin's 72 counties every year to hold town \nhall meetings. Year after year, the number one issue raised at these \nListening Sessions is the same--health care. The failure of our health \ncare system brings people to these meetings in droves. The frustration \nI hear, the anger and the desperation, have convinced me that we must \nchange the system.\n  So many people now come to tell me that they used to think government \ninvolvement was a terrible idea, but not anymore. Now they tell me that \ntheir businesses are being destroyed by health care costs, and they \nwant the government to step in. These costs are crippling our economy \njust as the Nation is struggling to rebound from the loss of millions \nof manufacturing jobs.\n  Our health care system has failed to keep costs in check. Costs are \nskyrocketing, and there is simply no way we can expect businesses to \nkeep up. So in all too many cases, employers are left to offer sub-par \nbenefits, or to wonder whether they can offer any benefits at all. \nEmployers cannot be the sole provider of health care when these costs \nare rising faster than inflation.\n  One option that could help employers, especially small businesses, \nreduce their health care costs is to have them form health care \ncooperatives, where employers lower costs by purchasing care as a \ngroup. I have introduced a bill in the Senate to make it easier for \nbusiness to create these cooperatives.\n  But this legislation certainly isn't the magic bullet that can \naddress the whole problem. We need to come up with more comprehensive \nways to address rising costs. In most cases, costs are still passed on \nto employees, who then face enormous premiums that demand more and more \nof their monthly income. People tell me that they don't understand how \nanyone can afford these astronomical premiums, and what can you say to \nthat?\n  We can say that it's time to move toward universal coverage. I \nbelieve we can find a way to make universal coverage work in this \ncountry. Universal coverage doesn't mean that we have to copy a system \nalready in place in another country. We can harness our Nation's \ncreativity and entrepreneurial\n\n[[Page S7444]]\n\nspirit to design a system that is uniquely American. Universal coverage \ndoesn't have to be defined by what's been attempted in the past. What \nuniversal coverage does mean is ending a system where nearly 44 million \nAmericans are uninsured, and where those who are insured are struggling \nto pay their premiums, struggling to pay for prescription drugs, and \nstruggling to find long term care.\n  We can't tolerate a system that strands so many Americans without the \ncoverage they need. This system costs us dearly: Even though almost 44 \nmillion Americans are uninsured, the United States devotes more of its \neconomy to health care than other industrial countries.\n  Leaving this many Americans uninsured affects all of us. Those who \nare insured pay more because the uninsured can't afford to pay their \nbills. And those bills are exceptionally high, because the uninsured \nwait so long to see a doctor. The uninsured often live sicker, and die \nearlier, than other Americans, so they also need a disproportionate \namount of acute care.\n  In 2001 alone, health care providers provided $35 billion worth of \nuncompensated care. While providers absorb some of those costs, \ninevitably some of the burden is shifted to other patients. And of \ncourse the process of cost-shifting itself generates additional costs.\n  We are all paying the price for our broken health care system, and it \nis time to bring about change.\n  Over the years I have heard many different proposals for how we \nshould change the health care system in this country. Some propose \nusing tax incentives as a way to expand access to health care. Others \nthink the best approach is to expand public programs. Some feel a \nnational single payer health care system is the only way to go.\n  I don't think we can ignore any of these proposals. We need to \nconsider all of these as we address our broken health care system.\n  As a former State legislator, I come to this debate knowing that \nStates are coming up with some very innovative solutions to the health \ncare problem. So in addition to the approaches already mentioned, I \nthink we really need to look at what our States are doing, and add to \nthe menu of possibilities an approach under which each State decides \nthe best way to cover its residents.\n  I favor an American-style health care reform, where we encourage \ncreative solutions to the health care problems facing our country, \nwithout using a one-size-fits-all approach. I believe that States have \na better idea about what the health care needs of their residents are, \nand that they understand what types of reform will work best for their \nstate. So I am in favor of a state-based universal health care system, \nwhere States, with the Federal Government's help, come up with a plan \nto make sure that all of their residents have health care coverage.\n\n  This approach would achieve universal health care, without the \nFederal Government dictating to all of the states exactly how to do it. \nThe federal government would provide states with the financial help, \ntechnical assistance and oversight necessary to accomplish this goal. \nIn return, a State would have to make sure that every resident has \ncoverage at least as good as that offered in the Federal Employee \nHealth Benefits Program, FEHBP--in other words, at least as good as the \nhealth insurance members of Congress have.\n  States would have the flexibility to expand coverage in phases, and \nwould be offered a number of Federal ``tools'' to choose from in order \nto help them achieve universal coverage. States could use any number of \nthese tools, or none of them, instead opting for a Federal contribution \nfor a state-based ``single-payer'' system. In addition to designing and \nimplementing a plan to achieve universal care, states would also be \nrequired to provide partial funding of these plans. The Federal \nGovernment would approve each State plan, and would conduct oversight \nof the implementation of these plans.\n  Federal tools that States could choose from to help expand health \ncoverage could include an enhanced Medicaid and SCHIP federal match for \nexpanding coverage to currently uninsured individuals; refundable and \nadvanceable tax credits for the purchase of health insurance for \nindividuals and/or businesses; the establishment of a community-rated \nhealth pool, similar to FEHBP, to provide affordable health coverage \nand expanded choices for those who enroll; and assistance with \ncatastrophic care costs.\n  States could be creative in the state resources they use to expand \nhealth care coverage. For example, a state could use personal and/or \nemployer mandates for coverage, use state tax incentives, create a \nsingle-payer system or even join with neighboring states to offer a \nregional health care plan.\n  The approach I have set forth would guarantee universal health care, \nbut still leave room for the flexibility and creativity that I believe \nis necessary to ensure that everyone has access to affordable, quality \nhealth care.\n  As I have noted, there have been a number of interesting proposals to \nmove us to universal health care coverage. While I will be advocating \nthe state-based approach that I have just outlined, others have \nproposed alternative approaches that certainly merit consideration and \ndebate.\n  And this brings us to the legislation I am introducing today, \nbecause, the reason we haven't reformed our health care system isn't \nbecause of a lack of good ideas. The problem is that Congress and the \nWhite House refuse to take this issue up. Despite the outcry from \nbusinesses, from health care providers, and from the millions who are \nuninsured, Washington refuses to address the problem in a comprehensive \nway.\n  That is why I am introducing this bill. My legislation will force \nCongress to finally address this issue. It requires the Majority and \nMinority Leaders of the Senate, as well as the Chairs of the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee and the Finance Committee, to \neach introduce a health care reform bill in the first 30 days of the \nnext Congress. If a committee chair fails to introduce a bill within \nthe first month, then the ranking minority party member of the \nrespective committee may introduce a measure that qualifies for the \nexpedited treatment outlined in my bill.\n  The measures introduced by the Majority Leader and Minority Leader \nwill be placed directly on the Senate Calendar. The measures introduced \nby the two committee chairs, or ranking minority members, will be \nreferred to their respective committees.\n  The committees have 60 calendar days not including recesses of 3 days \nor more to review the legislation. At the end of that time, if either \ncommittee fails to report a measure, the bills will be placed directly \non the legislative calendar.\n  If the Majority Leader fails to move to one of the bills, any Member \nmay move to proceed to any qualifying health care reform measure. The \nmotion is not debatable or amendable. If the motion to proceed is \nadopted, the chamber will immediately proceed to the consideration of a \nmeasure without intervening motion, order, or other business, and the \nmeasure remains the unfinished business of the Senate until the body \ndisposes of the bill.\n  Similar procedures are established for House consideration.\n  I want to emphasize, my bill does not prejudge what particular health \ncare reform measure should be debated. There are many worthy proposals \nthat would qualify for consideration, and this bill does not dictate \nwhich proposal, or combination of proposals, should be considered.\n  But what my bill does do is to require Congress to act.\n  It has been 10 years since the last serious debate over health care \nreform was killed by special interests and the soft money contributions \nthey used to corrupt the legislative process. The legislative landscape \nis now much different. Soft money can no longer be used to set the \nagenda, and businesses and workers are crying out as never before for \nCongress to do something about the country's health care crisis.\n  It has been 10 years since we've had any debate on comprehensive \nhealth care reform. We cannot afford any further delay. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the Health Care Reform Expedited Procedures Act \nof 2004.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S7445]]\n\n                                S. 2576\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nadjust the amount of payment under the physician fee scheduled for drug \nadministration services furnished to medicare beneficiaries; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Ensuring \nQuality and Access to Cancer Care Act of 2004. I want to thank my \ncolleague, Senator Hutchison, for working with me on this critical \nissue. Regardless of how we feel about the new Medicare law, I believe \nwe all agree that there are legitimate concerns about changes in cancer \ncare reimbursement. Critical services that help patients and their \nfamilies may be in jeopardy because Medicare reimbursement is scheduled \nto be drastically cut in 2005.\n  I believe that these changes will be disruptive to patients' care. It \nis especially urgent in Michigan, which is ranked fourth in the Nation \nin number of residents with cancer.\n  Doctors administer more than 70 percent of all cancer chemotherapy in \ntheir offices, but the new Medicare law drastically cuts doctors' \nreimbursement for drug administration. Changes in the reimbursement \nsystem will\n\n[[Page S7446]]\n\nmean that doctors will likely be paid dramatically less for \nchemotherapy. Preliminary estimates indicate that roughly $4.2 billion \nwill be taken out of cancer care in the United States over the next 10 \nyears.\n  Many critical services are paid for through drug administration \nreimbursement because they are not covered by Medicare. These include \nspecially-trained oncology nurses and related staff; the handling, \nstorage, and preparation of the toxic chemotherapy agents; and \ncognitive, nutrition, and support care services that are important \nindices of quality cancer care.\n  The result could be fewer and fewer doctors will treat cancer \npatients, leaving them without access to the best care possible. \nFurthermore, patients may lose access to vital support services.\n  Congress clearly recognized that questions related to the impact of \nthe Medicare law on patient access needed to be answered. That's why \nthe Medicare law included a temporary one-year increase in physicians' \npractice expenses. But access problems will likely emerge in 2005 when \nthe temporary aid and drug reimbursement decrease significantly. And \nseveral programs to help oncologists and patients will not begin until \n2006.\n  The ``Ensuring Quality and Access to Cancer Care Act of 2004'' would \nmerely extend the 1-year transitional period built into the law for an \nadditional year. It's a fair compromise so that we have time to answer \nimportant questions regarding the impact of the payment reductions. And \nit will ensure that policy changes do not disrupt patient access to \nquality cancer care.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2587\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide a conservation royalty from Outer \nContinental Shelf revenues to establish the Coastal Impact Assistance \nProgram, to provide assistance to States under the Land and Water \nConservation Fund Act of 1965, to ensure adequate funding for \nconserving and restoring wildlife, to assist local governments in \nimproving local park and recreation systems, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, today, Senator Landrieu and I are \nintroducing the Americans Outdoors Act of 2004, bipartisan legislation \nthat will provide nearly $1.5 billion annually to help Americans in \nevery State enjoy the great American outdoors.\n  The Americans Outdoors Act would provide a reliable stream of funding \nby collecting a conservation royalty on revenues from drilling for oil \nand gas on offshore Federal land. It would use this conservation \nroyalty to fully fund three existing Federal programs: the so-called \nState side of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, $450 million \nannually; wildlife conservation, $350 million annually to fully fund \nthat Federal program; and to fully fund urban parks initiatives, \nanother $125 million. It would also provide an additional $500 million \neach year for coastal impact assistance, including wetlands protection.\n  In addition, Senator Landrieu and I intend to offer an amendment to \nour legislation that would fully fund the $450 million per year Federal \nside of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, but only after we have \nconsulted further with our colleagues to develop a consensus.\n  We offer this legislation because there is nothing more central to \nthe American character than the great American outdoors. We offer it \nbecause we want to provide a conservation legacy for the next \ngeneration. We believe there is a huge conservation majority in America \nand in the Senate that will support this legislation.\n  In 1985, when I was Governor of Tennessee, President Ronald Reagan \nasked me to chair the President's Commission on American Outdoors. \nGilbert Grosvenor, president of the National Geographic Society, was \nvice-chairman. Patrick Noonan of the Conservation Fund and other \ndistinguished Americans served on the commission. President Reagan \nhimself was an outdoorsman. The President challenged his commission to \nlook ahead for a generation and tell the country how we can have \nappropriate places to do what we want to do outdoors.\n  In the report of our commission in 1987, we found many threats to the \nopportunity to enjoy the outdoors: exotic pollutants, loss of space \nthrough urban growth, and disappearance of wetlands. Changing \nlifestyles and new technology presented new challenges as well as \nopportunities. Differences in needs and Federal land ownership between \nthe eastern and western States created challenging conflicts to \nresolve.\n  In our report we emphasized that most outdoors recreation occurs \nclose to home, near towns or cities where 80 percent of us live. We \ntherefore recommended more land trusts, greenways, city parks and \nscenic byways.\n  We suggested that most of this action be accomplished by a prairie \nfire of local concern rather than by action in Washington, DC, but we \ndid recommend that Congress dedicate at least $1 billion a year from \noffshore oil and gas drilling revenues to provide a steady, reliable \nflow of funds to the Land and Water Conservation Fund.\n  Much of what we recommended has happened and is now law.\n  But it is now time to build on the commission's work of 20 years ago \nand look ahead for another generation.\n  By fully funding State wildlife grants, urban parks and the State \nprograms of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, the Americans \nOutdoors Act of 2004 will continue that legacy. It will enlarge on the \nlegacy by providing new funds for coastal assistance, including \nwetlands protection.\n  It will do so through a new steady stream of funding by creating what \nI think of as a ``conservation royalty.'' This new conservation royalty \nis not such a new idea at all. This conservation royalty is modeled \nafter the existing State royalty for onshore oil and gas drilling that \nwas created in the Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920. That act gives 50 \ncents of every dollar from drilling--and in the case of Alaska, 90--as \na royalty to the State in which the drilling occurs.\n  In a similar way, The Americans Outdoors Act of 2004 would create a \nconservation royalty of about 25 percent for revenues of the funds \ncollected from offshore drilling on Federal lands. Some of the royalty \nwould go to the States where the drilling occurs. More would go to all \nstates for parks, game and fish commissions and projects funded by the \nLand and Water Conservation Fund.\n  The idea is very simple: if drilling for oil and gas creates an \nenvironmental impact, it is wise to use some of the proceeds to create \nan environmental benefit. In 2001, the Federal Government received $7.5 \nbillion in oil and gas revenues from federal offshore leases. This \nrevenue comes from the Outer Continental Shelf, which supplies more oil \nto the United States than any other country, including Saudi Arabia.\n  Chairman Peter Domenici has scheduled a hearing in the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee on July 13. In the meantime Senator \nLandrieu and I will continue our discussion with other committee \nmembers and other colleagues to create a consensus.\n  There is at least one piece of unfinished business. At some point in \nthe process, Senator Landrieu and I will offer an amendment to our own \nlegislation that will fully fund--at $450 million a year--the Federal \nside of the Land and Water conservation Fund. It was this provision in \nearlier legislation that helped to cause the legislation not to be \nenacted by the Senate. We believe\n\n[[Page S7447]]\n\nthat by listening to our colleagues and developing more flexibility \namong states in how these dollars might be spent, we can develop \nlegislation that will pass the Senate.\n\n  We are glad to see that Congressmen Young and Miller have introduced \na similar piece of legislation in the House of Representatives. We look \nforward to working with them.\n  We are pleased tat already more than two dozen national organizations \nrepresenting millions of Americans have expressed their support for the \nAmerican outdoors Act of 2004. These organizations range from the U.S. \nConference of Mayors, to the National Wildlife Federation, to Ducks \nUnlimited, and the City Parks Alliance. We invite all Americans and our \ncolleagues of both political parties, to join with us in providing a \nlegacy for the next generation to enjoy the great American outdoors.\n  Someone once said that Italy has its art, England its history, and \nthe United States has the great American outdoors. Our magnificent \nland, as much of our love of liberty, is at the core of our character. \nIt has inspired our pioneer spirit, our resourcefulness and our \ngenerosity. Its greatness has fueled our individualism and optimism, \nand made us believe that anything is possible. It has influenced our \nmusic, literature, science and language.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague \nSenator Alexander as we introduce this very significant conservation \nlegislation. The junior Senator from Tennessee has been a long-time \neffective advocate for the environment and for conservation, not only \nin his own State of Tennessee but for our Nation.\n  The legislation we introduce today is a new, enhanced version of a \npiece of legislation that was introduced several years ago. We believe \nit is a very promising approach to launch one of the most significant \nconservation efforts ever considered by Congress. The American Outdoors \nAct is a landmark multiyear commitment to conservation programs \ndirectly benefiting all 50 States and hundreds of local communities. It \ncreates a conservation royalty derived from the production of oil and \ngas on the Outer Continental Shelf and directs it toward the \nrestoration of coastal wetlands, preservation of wildlife habitat, and \nit helps build and maintain local and State parks for our children, our \nchildren's children, for generations to come.\n  By enacting this legislation, we will make the most significant \ncommitment of Federal resources to conservation ever and ensure a \npositive legacy of protecting and enhancing critical wildlife habitat, \nestuaries, marshlands, mountain ranges, open green spaces, and expanded \nrecreational opportunity for Americans today and generations to come. \nThe legislation builds on a great and notable effort made during the \n106th Congress that was supported by Governors, mayors, and a coalition \nof over 5,000 organizations throughout the country. Unfortunately, \ndespite our bipartisan and very deep and widespread support, our \nefforts were cut short before a final bill could be signed into law. \nInstead, a commitment was made by those who opposed the legislation \nlast time to guarantee funding for these programs. And unfortunately, \nwe all know the story and the outcome of those promises.\n  As we have painfully witnessed since then, these programs have not \nonly been reduced, some of them have been eliminated completely, and \nare terribly underfunded in terms of the critical needs that are \npresented to us today.\n  What has happened is exactly what those of us who initiated the \neffort always anticipated. Each of these significant programs has been \nshortchanged and a number of them have been left out altogether or \nforced to compete with each other for Federal resources.\n  The legislation we are introducing today provides reliable, \nsignificant, and steady funding for the urgent and worthy conservation \nand outdoor recreation needs of our states and rapidly growing urban \nareas. What makes more sense than to take a portion of revenues from a \ndepleting capital asset of the Nation--offshore Federal oil and gas \nresources--and reinvest them into sustaining the natural resources of \nour Nation: wetlands; parks and recreation areas and wildlife.\n  The Americans Outdoors Act dedicates assured funding for four \ndistinct programs and honors promises made long ago to the American \npeople. The four programs include:\n  Coastal impact assistance--$500 million to oil and gas producing \ncoastal States to mitigate the various impacts of States that serve as \nthe ``platform'' for the crucial development of Federal offshore energy \nresources from the Outer Continental Shelf as well as provide for \nwetland restoration. This program merely acknowledges the impacts to \nand contribution of States that are providing the energy to run our \ncountry's economy. The Outer Continental Shelf supplies 25 percent of \nour Nation's oil consumption, more than any other country including \nSaudi Arabia, with the promise of more, expected to reach 40 percent by \n2008. Since this frontier was officially opened to significant oil and \ngas exploration in 1953, no single region has contributed as much to \nthe nation's energy production as the OCS. The OCS accounts for more \nthan 25 percent of our Nation's natural gas and oil production. With \nannual returns to the Federal Government averaging $5 billion annually, \nno single area has contributed as much to the Federal Treasury as the \nOCS. In fact, since 1953, the OCS has contributed $140 billion to the \nU.S. Treasury. Allocation to States would be based on their proximity \nto production. Thirty-five percent of the State's allocation would be \nshared with coastal political subdivisions based on a formula of 50 \npercent proximity to production, 25 percent miles of coastline and 25 \npercent coastal population;\n  $450 million for the State side of the Land and Water Conservation \nFund, LWC, to provide stable funding to States for the planning and \ndevelopment of State and local parks and recreation facilities. The \nallocation to States would be 60 percent equally among all 50 States \nand 40 percent based on relative population. This program provides \ngreater revenue certainty for State and local governments to help them \nmeet their recreational needs through recreational facility development \nand resource protection--all under the discretion of State and local \nauthorities while protecting the rights of private property owners;\n  Wildlife conservation, education and restoration--$350 million is \nallocated to all 50 States through the successful program of Pittman-\nRobertson for the conservation of nongame and game species, with the \nprincipal goal of preventing species from becoming endangered or listed \nunder the Endangered Species Act. By taking steps now to prevent \nspecies from becoming endangered we are able to not only conserve the \nsignificant cultural heritage of wildlife enjoyment for the people of\n\n[[Page S7453]]\n\nthis country, but also avoid the substantial costs associated with \nrecovery for endangered species. Allocations to States would be based \non a formula of \\2/3\\ relative population and \\1/3\\ relative land area; \nand\n  The Urban Parks and Recreation Recovery Program, UPARR--$125 million \nin the form of matching grants, 70 percent to provide direct assistance \nto our cities and towns so that they can focus on the needs of their \npopulations within the more densely inhabited areas around the country \nwhere there are fewer green-spaces, playgrounds and soccer fields for \nour youth.\n  I would also like to acknowledge our interest in several programs \nthat are not part of this initial package but will be considered as the \nbill moves through the process. For example, the Federal side of the \nLand and Water Conservation Fund which focuses primarily on Federal \nland acquisition. The goal of the Federal side of the LWCF was to share \na significant portion of revenues from offshore development with States \nto provide for protection and public use of the natural environment. It \nis our intention to discuss this program with our colleagues on the \nSenate Energy and Natural Resources Committee with the goal of \ndeveloping a compromise that will garner broad support. In addition, \nother worthy programs that are not part of the legislation we are \nintroducing today but ideally would be part of a larger more \ncomprehensive effort include Historic Preservation, Payment in Lieu of \nTaxes, PILT, and the Forest Legacy program.\n  While we confront a time of war, budget deficits and a struggling \neconomy, setting aside a portion of oil and gas royalties to our states \nand localities for initiatives such as outdoor spaces or recreation \nfacilities for our children to play could not be more crucial. Programs \nsuch as the State side of the Land and Water Conservation Fund are in \nfact the economic stimulus that our States and cities need in these \ntimes. The time has come to take the proceeds from a non-renewable \nresource for the purpose of reinvesting a portion of these revenues in \nthe conservation and enhancement of our renewable resources. To \ncontinue to do otherwise, as we have over the last 50 years, is \nfiscally irresponsible.\n  As I said, the legislation we introduce today, therefore, provides a \nreliable, significant, and steady stream of funding that cannot be \nmanipulated or tampered with at the whim of this or that, but will be \nthere for conservation efforts that our local communities and States \ncan count on to provide this great legacy and heritage for our \ngrandchildren.\n  What makes more sense than taking a portion of the offshore oil and \ngas revenues that have generated almost $130 billion since the first \nwell was drilled off of our shore on the Continental Shelf almost 100 \nyears ago? What would make more sense than taking a small portion of \nthat money and giving it back to the environment, back to our mountain \nranges, to our marshes, to our coastal areas, protecting and preserving \nour great land for generations to come? The American Outdoors Act does \nexactly that.\n  It dedicates and assures funding for four distinct programs: Coastal \nimpact assistance, of which Louisiana and other coastal States would \nbenefit. Of course, we are proud to serve as oil and gas producers, \nhelping us secure our energy independence from foreign sources, \nproviding much critical feedstock, if you will, for our energy industry \nin the State, and expanding our economic opportunities. Because we \nproduce so much oil and gas, we would deserve help with our vanishing \ncoastline.\n  In addition, the other segment of this bill would fund the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund State side. As the Senator from Tennessee \nnoted, he and I are firmly committed to also providing support and full \nfunding for the Federal side of land and water, as this bill moves \nthrough the process.\n  Wildlife conservation, education, and restoration would be fully \nfunded. That helps all of our States. The Urban Parks and Recreation \nProgram, which has been so critical for quality-of-life issues and \neconomic development in our cities, in our suburbs, our urban centers, \nwould also be funded.\n  Time is not on our side. While other issues might be able to wait and \nother issues could maybe be funded gradually over time, for every month \nwe delay, for every year we delay, we lose acres and acres, miles and \nmiles of land we will never be able to recover.\n  Louisiana itself is literally washing away. We have lost the size of \nthe State of Rhode Island off our coast in the last 100 years. If some \nforeign country attacked our country and tried to take a portion of \nland away from us, we would fight with every strength and every tool \nand every resource available. But we stand here literally in some ways \ntwiddling our thumbs while this land is washed away into the Gulf of \nMexico. And not just any land but very productive land and very \nnecessary land, not just for Louisiana but for the entire United \nStates.\n  I close with a quote from Teddy Roosevelt because it is appropriate. \nHe was a great conservation President. Over 100 years ago he started \nmany programs. I love taking my children to Theodore Roosevelt Island. \nWe ride our bikes over there. I love telling them the story of Teddy \nRoosevelt.\n  I explain many stories about what he did, hunting in Louisiana, the \nhistory of the black bear, et cetera.\n  In his autobiography he wrote of his experiences in Coastal \nLouisiana:\n\n       And to lose the chance to see frigate birds soaring in \n     circles above the storm or, a file of pelicans winging their \n     way homeward across the crimson afterglow of the sunset, or a \n     myriad of terns flashing in the bright light of midday as \n     they hover in a shifting maze above the beach, why, the loss \n     is like the loss of a gallery of masterpieces of the artists \n     of old time.\n\n  This is what he said when he recalled his trip to Breton Island \nSound, the second of over 540 national wildlife heritage areas \ndesignated in the last 100 years. The land in this picture is gone. It \nno longer exists because we have twiddled our thumbs for almost 100 \nyears.\n  Today we introduce a bill to stop us from twiddling our thumbs, \ndirect our resources, get serious about conservation, serious about the \ntaxpayer money, and do something with it that the overwhelming majority \nof the taxpayers would stand up and cheer, if they had the chance to \nvote on it.\n  I thank the Chair. It will be a pleasure working with the Senator \nfrom Tennessee as we lead this great effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CONRAD (for himself and Mr. Dorgan):\n  S. 2592. A bill to provide crop and livestock disaster assistance; to \nthe Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I am joined by my colleague from \nNorth Dakota, Senator Dorgan, in introducing legislation intended to \naddress the twin natural disasters that are threatening the livelihoods \nof farmers and ranchers across our State.\n  For much of North Dakota, the year began with great promise. Record \nhigh crop and livestock prices offered the potential for much needed \nimprovement in farm income for producers throughout the State. The \nstage was set for increased returns from the marketplace, and a \ncorresponding reduction in current costs under the 2002 Farm Bill.\n  Then Mother Nature intervened.\n  In early May, just as fieldwork was set to begin in earnest, many \nfarmers in the northern part of the State were hit with a late snowfall \nand continued, unseasonably cool weather. That was followed by weeks of \nrepeated rains, sometime several inches at a time. The deluge, and \ncontinued low temperatures, left fields soggy or underwater, and \ndelayed and eventually prevented the planting of crops across huge \nswaths of the northern and northeastern part of the state, generating \nnumerous reports of farmers being forced to abandon one-third, one-\nhalf, and even more of their crop ground.\n  As one hard struck farmer described the situation to me:\n\n       Our 2004 crop is late again, due to cold wet ground since \n     May 10. Heavy snow on May 11 and 12 and continuous rain is \n     delaying all field work. If we don't get some help we will be \n     forced to sell out. Input costs--fuel, fertilizer, and \n     repairs never end. We haven't been able to seed a kernel of \n     grain yet for 2004 due to too much water.\n\n  In the southwestern corner of North Dakota, the problem faced by \nlivestock producers is just the opposite. Conditions are bone dry, and \neven though it's relatively early in the season, the land is parched, \nthanks to virtually no moisture since the start of the year and the \nlingering effect of a drought that has robbed the land of subsoil\n\n[[Page S7454]]\n\nmoisture and that, for many producers, goes back two years or more.\n\n  Here's how one rancher explained what he's up against:\n\n       I am a registered Angus Producer in SW North Dakota. Our \n     moisture situation is bad. We have had approximately 1\" of \n     rain all spring if you count all the little showers together. \n     The cool weather is the only thing that has saved what little \n     forage there is in the pasture. There will be no hay crop and \n     that includes trying to hay the ditches.\n\n  Another one wrote me:\n\n       I live in rural Sioux County North Dakota. I am a rancher. \n     The drought situation is getting very serious. I am looking \n     for options as far as feed & pasture for my cattle, but \n     haven't found any yet. I have sold nearly half of my cattle \n     since the dry conditions started in 2002. We appreciate any \n     and all help that you can give us. This is cow country & I \n     think we need to retain as much of our cattle numbers as we \n     can.\n\n  These producers need real help and they need it urgently. That's why \nthe bill I am introducing today follows closely the outline of disaster \nassistance legislation enacted in recent years, all in an effort to \nspeed the delivery of crop and livestock assistance to those who \nlivelihoods hang in the balance.\n  The essential provisions of the ``Agricultural Assistance Act of \n2004'' are as follows:\n  First, in the case of crop losses, eligibility for assistance would \nbe triggered by production losses exceeding 35 percent of normal \nyields. Under the bill, producers who had purchased crop insurance--\nwhich under the best of options covers only a portion of normal \nyields--would receive a payment equal to 50 percent of the \n``established price'' for the crop. Those who did not purchase crop \ninsurance would receive a payment equal to just 40 percent of the \nestablished price, and would be required to purchase crop insurance for \neach of the following two crop years. Assistance to individual \nproducers would be limited as provided in previously-enacted disaster \nbills.\n  In the case of ranchers suffering grazing losses of 40 percent or \nmore during three consecutive months, they would be eligible for \npayments to help defray the cost of purchasing feed. Payments under \nthis program would similarly be limited as provided in past \nlegislation.\n  Finally, I think it is important that in providing this assistance, \nwe reinforce crop insurance as the foundation for agricultural risk \nmanagement. This bill would do that. First, by not penalizing--as \nprevious legislation did--those who had purchased crop insurance at \nhigher coverage levels, and second, by decreasing the payment to those \nwho purchased no crop insurance at all.\n  The natural disasters facing our farmers and ranchers demand \nimmediate attention, and I urge the Congress, and the President, to \nact.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN:\n  S. 2594. A bill to reduce health care disparities and improve health \ncare quality, to improve the collection of racial, ethnic, primary \nlanguage, and socio-economic determination data for use by healthcare \nresearchers and policymakers, to provide performance incentives for \nhigh performing hospitals and community health centers, and to expand \ncurrent Federal programs seeking to eliminate health disparities; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, our Nation wrestles with a medical \nmystery that affects the health and very lives of millions of Americans \nevery year: Why do patients with similar ailments have such disparate \noutcomes?\n  Albert Einstein once said: ``I cannot believe that God plays dice \nwith the world.'' I would never quibble with Einstein. And besides, I \nstrongly believe that myself.\n  I also believe we should aspire to that ideal in the earthly \ninstitutions we create, like our health care system. Medical outcomes \nshould not be a matter of luck. Treatment should be as predictable and \nequal as possible within the bounds of science and human fallibility.\n  But that is not the system we have today. Study after study shows \nthat we have created a health care casino where the quality of care \nseems to have as much to do with the luck of the dice as anything else.\n  In America, good medical care for all should be a given--not a \ngamble.\n  That is why today I am introducing legislation I call FairCare. \nFairCare will give us the tools we need to begin eliminating these \nacross-the-board problems of medical disparities among patients with \nidentical ailments.\n  In the broadest sense, we know we have two problems--quality of care \nand disparity of care. While these problems are distinct and separate--\nsolving either will help solve both.\n  Let me dramatize the kind of odds we are talking about when a patient \nenters the healthcare system. I would ask my colleagues to imagine for \na moment that they are in a casino, rolling dice and need a five or a \nnine to win. The odds of you winning with either of those numbers is \nabout 60 percent. Of course, that means you have a 40 percent chance of \nlosing.\n  Now, if you enjoy gambling--and are not betting a lot of money--maybe \nthat's fun. But would you bet your house on those odds? Or your \nchildren's college fund? Or your health--or your life?\n  Well, the odds in our imaginary dice game are the precise odds we \nsend people into the health care system every day.\n  A recent study reported in the New England Journal of Medicine said \nthat about 40 percent of patients reported medical errors in the care \nof either themselves or a loved one. The cost of these mistakes is \nstaggering. Between 44,000 and 100,000 people die each year because of \nthose medical mistakes.\n  To put those shocking numbers in perspective, imagine if you will \nthat our nation experienced a day like September the 11th, at least \ntwice a month, every month--for a year.\n  Overall, the cost of not getting it right the first time represents a \nyearly loss to the national economy of $17 to $29 billion. This is due \nlargely to the medical complications that must be treated down the line \nbecause of the initial medical errors, as well as lost wages and \nproductivity.\n  Now, while most Americans have problems finding high-quality health \ncare at a reasonable cost, racial and ethnic minorities fare the worst.\n  Medical studies also show that:\n  When actors portrayed patients with identical complaints of chest \npain, women and African Americans were 40 percent less likely to have \ntheir complaints taken seriously and be referred for further diagnostic \ntests.\n  Hispanics with asthma are almost twice as likely as white patients to \nface largely-avoidable emergency rooms visits or have the illness limit \ntheir daily activities.\n  Infants born to American Indians and Alaskan Natives are twenty-five \npercent more likely than the national average to die in the first year \nof life.\n  Asian American women are 20 percent less likely to get life-saving \nscreening exams for cervical cancer than white women.\n  And many of these disparities persist, even when factors like income \nand access to health care are taken into account. Why is this? The \nanswer is: We don't exactly know. But it is clear that we do not have a \ncolor blind healthcare system. And unequal treatment is Un-American. We \ncannot tolerate it. Rather, we must understand it, confront it, and fix \nit.\n  Besides, solving this medical mystery for the most severely affected \nminority groups will improve healthcare for everyone else as well. In \nother words, if we can dramatically increase the quality of medical \ncare, unfair disparities will decline and all will benefit.\n  The clues to solving the problems of both medical quality and \nhealthcare disparities are there. We just have to go find them. That \nwill require gathering crucial information that will help us clearly \nidentify the problems. Then we can help finance the solutions that will \ncure them.\n  That's why we need FairCare.\n  To begin, we need data--we need to see where we have quality problems \nand where we have disparities in care. FairCare will bring the medical \nand patient communities together to help us better measure healthcare \nquality in a scientific way that will give us our first comprehensive \nglimpse of where the problems lie.\n  Once glimpsed, FairCare can begin to fund improvement efforts \ndeveloped by local hospitals and community health centers that fit the \nneeds of their local neighborhoods. FairCare will use the reach and \nresources of Medicare to reward hospitals that improve quality and \nreduce disparities.\n\n[[Page S7455]]\n\n  In recent testimony before the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on \nHealth Care, Glenn Hackbarth, Chairman of Medicare Payment Advisory \nCommission, said he agreed with this approach. ``It is time for \nMedicare to take the next step in quality improvement and put financial \nincentives for quality directly into its payment systems,'' he said.\n  Under FairCare, community health centers not part of the Medicare \nsystem will be eligible for grants and bonuses. In other words, \nFairCare is a carrots program, not a sticks program--it rewards \nhospitals and health centers that perform--that make progress in \nimplementing quality healthcare and reducing healthcare disparities.\n  We will also provide tax relief to help FairCare providers cover the \ncost of their malpractice insurance.\n  Taken together, FairCare will give our most overburdened and \nfinancially strapped healthcare providers--that act to deliver quality \nmedicine--the help they need to give their communities the help they \nneed. And when they succeed, we will all win. When they succeed, good \nmedical care for all will be a given--not a gamble.\n  Just as God does not play dice with the world, we will no longer play \ndice with the lives of our most vulnerable--the sick and the ailing.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nstatements of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2594\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Evidence of Healthcare Disparities.--With respect to \n     evidence of healthcare disparities, Congress makes the \n     following findings:\n       (1) Healthcare disparities affect the lives, health, and \n     livelihood of Americans, and increase the overall cost of \n     health care in the United States.\n       (2) Minority patients with chronic diseases have been found \n     less likely to receive the necessary services required to \n     manage effectively these illnesses, such as routine blood \n     pressure checks or eye examinations, and are less likely to \n     receive treatments to cure these conditions, such as heart \n     surgeries or kidney transplants.\n       (3) Studies have shown that non-English speaking patients \n     report more satisfaction with health encounters and have \n     better health outcomes after encounters with healthcare \n     providers who speak their primary language.\n       (4) The Institute of Medicine's report ``In the Nation's \n     Compelling Interest'', concluded that racial and ethnic \n     minority healthcare providers are significantly more likely \n     than their white peers to serve minority and medically \n     underserved communities, thereby helping to improve problems \n     of limited minority access to care.\n       (5) Data from the National Center for Health Statistics \n     demonstrates that minorities are less likely to receive \n     routine cancer screenings even when they do have health \n     insurance and access to healthcare providers, and once \n     diagnosed with cancer, elderly minority patients are also \n     less likely to receive appropriate treatment for pain \n     associated with cancer.\n       (b) Evidence of Inconsistencies in Healthcare Quality.--\n     With respect to evidence of inconsistencies in healthcare \n     quality, Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Inconsistent healthcare quality threatens the health of \n     all Americans regardless of race, ethnicity, or socio-\n     economic status.\n       (2) Studies by the RAND Corporation have shown that all \n     patients in the United States have only a 55 percent \n     possibility of receiving clinically appropriate care in the \n     healthcare setting, despite the fact that the United States \n     spends twice as much as other industrialized countries on \n     health care.\n       (3) The control of hypertension is essential to reducing \n     mortality from heart disease, stroke, and diabetes \n     complications, yet, only 23 percent of Americans with \n     hypertension are adequately treated.\n       (4) About 1 in 5 elderly Americans are prescribed \n     inappropriate medications.\n       (5) Only 21 percent of Americans with diabetes get all \n     recommended checkups.\n       (6) One of the safest, simplest, and most cost-effective \n     ways to reduce cancer morbidity and mortality is to increase \n     screening rates for selected cancers including colorectal \n     cancers, yet, less than half of men and women over the age of \n     50 report screening for colorectal cancers.\n       (7) In the United States, over 1/4 of infants and toddlers \n     of all races and ethnicities do not receive all recommended \n     vaccines.\n       (8) Breakthroughs in treatments have enabled more patients \n     to survive and live better, yet too many of these treatments \n     are not being administered to all those who can benefit from \n     them.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to establish State grant programs related to \nassistive technology and protection and advocacy services, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, today, I join my esteemed colleague, the \nSenator from Iowa, Senator Harkin, and other members, in introducing \nthe Improving Access to Assistive Technology for Individuals with \nDisabilities Act of 2004.\n  For the past 6 months we have been working in a bipartisan fashion on \nthe reauthorization of the Assistive Technology Act. Our proposed \nlegislation is designed to remove barriers that people with \ndisabilities encounter when attempting to access and purchase assistive \ntechnology. Working with the disability, business, and research and \ndevelopment communities, the Departments of Education, Labor, and \nCommerce, and the Small Business Administration, we have completely \nrewritten the Act to accomplish this goal. More specifically, our \nefforts focused on three fundamental changes: improving access by \nreducing bureaucracy; fostering private/public sector relationships; \nand stabilizing the State projects funding stream\n  In a March 1993 report to the President and the Congress on the \n``Study on the Financing of Assistive Technology Devices and Services \nfor Individuals with Disabilities,'' the National Council on Disability \nheard repeatedly from witnesses at public forums about the abandonment \nof equipment by persons with disabilities who had no opportunity prior \nto purchase to try it out or see it demonstrated.\n  Current law authorizes State projects to conduct system change \nactivities and provide information and referral services to people with \ndisabilities and their families. Although these are necessary and \nimportant duties, they do not immediately impact and help a person with \na disability obtain assistive technology that he or she may need today.\n  This bill modifies the current list of authorized activities by \nexpanding the authority of the State assistive technology act programs \nto increase the ability of persons with disabilities to experience or \nobtain assistive technology. Our bill, written by members of the \nCommittee on Health Education, Labor and Pensions, provides the State \nprojects with a tangible set of mandatory activities, yet at the same \ntime provides State flexibility to address emerging State needs.\n  Therefore, the new functions require States to provide citizens with \naccess to device loan, reutilization, and financing programs, and \nequipment demonstration centers directly by developing such programs, \nor partnering with another entity in the State currently conducting \nthese programs. The purpose of these programs is to provide individuals \nwith disabilities the opportunity to receive proper assessments and \nevaluations for assistive technology, test and obtain information about \nvarious devices, borrow or rent devices and equipment before it is \npurchased, and be able to access low interest loans to purchase needed \ntechnology. Each of these new requirements will help make the most of \nlimited public resources in an environment that emphasizes consumer \nchoice in and control of assistive technology services and funding. \nFurther, they demonstrate the benefits and costs of assistive \ntechnology.\n  Additionally, our bill intensifies outreach efforts to employers, \nproviders of employment and adult services, school systems, and health \ncare providers that have direct contact with persons with disabilities \nto inform them about the beneficial aspects of assistive technology. \nFinally, we authorize States to create an advisory board to provide \nenhanced flexibility, guide the actions of the State programs and \nestablish State priorities to meet the specific assistive technology \nneeds of State residents.\n  The Committee on Health Education, Labor and Pensions learned through \nseveral public forums held this and last year that employers are \nfrequently confused by the vast array of assistive technology devices \navailable to employees, the costs associated with purchasing assistive \ntechnology, and how or where to purchase assistive technology to meet \nthe needs of potential employees or employees acquiring disabilities \ndue to age, accidents and other causes. However, various studies paint \na different picture. The Office of Disability Employment Policy of the \nDepartment of Labor funds the Job Accommodation Network (JAN), a free \nconsulting service designed to increase the employability of people \nwith disabilities. According to an ongoing JAN evaluation, 71 percent \nof the businesses\n\n[[Page S7462]]\n\nthat used JAN for assistance on providing specific accommodation \ninformation for employees with disabilities found that the \naccommodation that the employee needed cost between $0.00 and $500.00.\n  This sent up a red flag, indicating that there is a disconnect or gap \nbetween the knowledge base as it currently exists and how that \ninformation reaches not only employers, but schools, school districts, \nhospitals and other entities. I imagine at schools and school officials \nin Berlin, NH, Clearmont, WY, Tribune, KS, or any other rural community \nwould have a difficult time determining the assistive technology needs \nof a student with a disability without some type of assistance.\n  I am also sure that the same is true for small businesses. The \nDisability Business and Technical Assistance Centers (DBTACs), funded \nby the National Institute on Disability Rehabilitation and Research \n(NIDRR) Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS) \nat the Department of Education, are regional Centers that provide \ntraining, information, and technical assistance on the Americans with \nDisabilities Act (ADA) to businesses, consumers, schools, and State and \nlocal governments. The DBTACs do wonderful work; however, a small \nbusiness owner usually does not know where to go or where to send an \nemployee if he or she needs an assessment or knowledge of various \nassistive devices so the small business can provide the necessary and \nappropriate assistive device.\n  According to statistics from the Small Business Administration office \nof Advocacy, small businesses pay 44.3 percent of the total private \npayroll in the United States, and have generated anywhere from 60 to 80 \npercent of net new jobs annually over the past decade. As a current \nhigh school student with disabilities graduates and looks for a job, \nthere is a good chance that this young person will work for a small \nbusiness. That being said, if the student has accommodation or \ntechnology needs, will the business know where to go for assistance?\n  There are quite a few State Assistive Technology Act projects that \nare currently conducting outreach and public awareness activities, \nproviding technical assistance to the business community, but it is not \noccurring unilaterally across the Nation. While current law authorizes \nsuch activities it does not specifically state that public awareness \nactivities should be focused on the business community.\n\n  This bill aggressively engages businesses, especially small \nbusinesses, by providing them with greater access to technical \nassistance so that they can accommodate employees with disabilities. \nAdditionally, in an effort to improve access to assistive technology \nand to lower costs, the bill enhances competition and forges incentives \nfor researchers and developers.\n  The bill accomplishes these goals by improving the utilization of \nfederal dollars and collaborative efforts between the agency \nadministering the Assistive Technology Act projects and other Federal \ndepartments and initiatives, such as the Small Business \nAdministration's (SBA) and Department of Labor's (DOL) interagency \ninitiative to improve employment opportunities for people with \ndisabilities in small businesses.\n  This bill also strengthens relationships between federally funded \nprograms, such as the Assistive Technology Act projects, with private \nsector employers and researchers, by directing the Office of Special \nEducation and Rehabilitation Services at the Department of Education to \nmake grants available to for-profit and non-profit entities to enhance \npublic/private partnerships. These grant opportunities include creating \ngrants to support the development of public service announcements, \nwhich can be modified for regional use, to reach out to small \nbusinesses, the aging population, and people with disabilities about \nthe benefits of assistive technology. Grants can also fund a technical \nassistance provider to assist employers in addressing the needs of \naging workers that are acquiring disabilities and may need assistive \ntechnology to maintain their current level of productivity.\n  When Congress passed the original Assistive Technology Act in 1988, \nCongressional intent was to provide States with time-limited Federal \nseed money to assist them in developing and implementing their own \nassistive technology programs. This Federal-State partnership has \nprovided an important service to individuals with disabilities by \nstrengthening the capacity of each State to assist individuals with \ndisabilities of all ages with their assistive technology needs. \nHowever, thousands of people with disabilities could lose access to \nthis infrastructure if the Federal contribution comes to an end. \nAdditionally, the bill drafters have recognized that for-profit and \nnon-profit entities have not put the necessary time and energy into \nfostering relationships with the State programs, fearing that the \nFederal contribution would end, and the State programs would no longer \nexist.\n  Three years ago, with the introduction of the President's New Freedom \nInitiative in the winter of 2001, the Administration launched new \ncomprehensive programs to tell America that individuals with \ndisabilities are valued citizens. Traditionally, individuals with \ndisabilities have been outcasts of society--seen as burdensome and \ninstitutionalized--and have not been permitted to contribute to society \nor expected to pursue the American Dream that so many of us take for \ngranted.\n  This Administration recognizes and believes in the full participation \nof people with disabilities in all areas of society. This belief has \nbeen put into action by increasing access to assistive and universally \ndesigned technologies, expanding educational and employment \nopportunities, promoting increased access into daily community life, \nand helping members of this misunderstood and underutilized group of \ncitizens achieve and succeed. Compassionate Conservatism is what I \nbelieve our President calls it.\n  As the New Freedom Initiative states, ``Assistive and universally \ndesigned technologies can be a powerful tool for millions of Americans \nwith disabilities, dramatically improving one's quality of life and \nability to engage in productive work. New technologies are opening \nopportunities for even those with the most severe disabilities.'' This \nnew-found sense of purpose and urgency, occurring shortly after the \nOlmstead decision, has re-ignited the interest and support for a \nFederal-State partnership to provide comprehensive, statewide assistive \ntechnology services to individuals with disabilities.\n  Consequently, Congress must stabilize funding for the State programs \nby supporting State efforts to improve the provision of assistive \ntechnology for individuals with disabilities. Congress must also ensure \nthat the Federal commitment to independent living, and the full \nparticipation of individuals with disabilities in society, guaranteed \nthrough the President's ``New Freedom Initiative,'' is upheld. In this \ninstance, that translates into providing States with the necessary \nfunding to maintain the comprehensive Statewide programs of technology-\nrelated assistance for individuals with disabilities of all ages. \nHowever, the drafters of this legislation also expect States to take \nownership of and expand upon the comprehensive Statewide programs of \ntechnology-related assistance.\n  Therefore, this bill removes the sunset provision in the 1998 Act and \ncreates a typical reauthorization cycle, while slightly increasing the \nState minimum allotment to offset some of the costs for the additional \nrequirements.\n  I would like to thank Senator Harkin, and his staff, particularly \nMary Giliberti, for their hard work and dedication in putting together \na bi-partisan bill that will assist thousands of individuals with \ndisabilities access services and devices that they so desperately need. \nI would also like to thank Senators Roberts, DeWine, Warner, Ensign, \nKennedy, and Reed, and their staff members, Jennifer Swenson, Mary Beth \nLuna, John (JK) Robinson, Lindsay Lovlien, Kent Mitchell, Connie \nGarner, Elyse Wasch, and Erica Swanson as they were on board and helped \nmake this a bipartisan process from the beginning.\n  Senator Harkin and I were determined to make this a bipartisan \nprocess from the beginning. We have crafted a bill that we are \nconfident will be overwhelmingly supported by both Republicans and \nDemocrats--and most importantly by the disability community, providers \nof disability related\n\n[[Page S7463]]\n\nservices, States, employers and businesses, and the educational \ncommunity.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the legislation be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2595\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Improving Access to \n     Assistive Technology for Individuals with Disabilities Act of \n     2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Over 54,000,000 individuals in the United States have \n     disabilities, with almost half experiencing severe \n     disabilities that affect their ability to see, hear, \n     communicate, reason, walk, or perform other basic life \n     functions.\n       (2) Disability is a natural part of the human experience \n     and in no way diminishes the right of individuals to--\n       (A) live independently;\n       (B) enjoy self-determination and make choices;\n       (C) benefit from an education;\n       (D) pursue meaningful careers; and\n       (E) enjoy full inclusion and integration in the economic, \n     political, social, cultural, and educational mainstream of \n     society in the United States.\n       (3) Too many individuals with disabilities are outside the \n     economic and social mainstream of society in the United \n     States. For example, individuals with disabilities are less \n     likely than their non-disabled peers to graduate from high \n     school, participate in postsecondary education, work, own a \n     home, participate fully in their community, vote, or use the \n     computer and the internet.\n       (4) As President Bush's New Freedom Initiative states, \n     ``Assistive and universally designed technologies can be a \n     powerful tool for millions of Americans with disabilities, \n     dramatically improving one's quality of life and ability to \n     engage in productive work. New technologies are opening \n     opportunities for even those with the most severe \n     disabilities. For example, some individuals with quadriplegia \n     can now operate computers by the glance of an eye.''.\n       (5) According to the National Council on Disability, ``For \n     Americans without disabilities, technology makes things \n     easier. For Americans with disabilities, technology makes \n     things possible.''.\n       (6) Substantial progress has been made in the development \n     of assistive technology devices, universally designed \n     products, and accessible information technology and \n     telecommunications systems. Those devices, products, and \n     systems can facilitate communication, ensure independent \n     functioning, enable early childhood development, support \n     educational achievement, provide and enhance employment \n     options, and enable full participation in community living. \n     Access to such devices, products, and systems can also reduce \n     expenditures associated with early childhood intervention, \n     education, rehabilitation and training, health care, \n     employment, residential living, independent living, \n     recreation opportunities, and other aspects of daily living.\n       (7) Over the last 15 years, the Federal Government has \n     invested in the development of statewide comprehensive \n     systems of assistive technology, which have proven effective \n     in assisting individuals with disabilities in accessing \n     assistive technology devices and assistive technology \n     services. Federal dollars fund statewide infrastructures that \n     support equipment demonstration programs, short-term device \n     loan programs, financial loan programs, equipment exchange \n     and recycling programs, training programs, advocacy services, \n     and information and referral services.\n       (8) Despite the success of the programs and services \n     described in paragraph (7), individuals with disabilities who \n     need assistive technology and accessible information \n     technology continue to have a great need to know what \n     technology is available, to determine what technology is most \n     appropriate, and to obtain and utilize that technology to \n     ensure their maximum independence and participation in \n     society.\n       (9) The 2000 decennial Census indicates that over \n     21,000,000 individuals in the United States, more than 8 \n     percent of the United States population, have a disability \n     that limits their basic physical abilities such as walking, \n     climbing stairs, reaching, lifting, or carrying. Nearly 12 \n     percent of working-age individuals in the United States, or \n     21,300,000 of those individuals, have a disability that \n     affects their ability to work.\n       (10) The combination of significant recent changes in \n     Federal policy (including changes to section 508 of the \n     Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d), accessibility \n     provisions of the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (42 U.S.C. \n     15301 et seq.), Executive Order 13217 (42 U.S.C. 12131 note; \n     relating to community-based alternatives for individuals with \n     disabilities), and the amendments made by the No Child Left \n     Behind Act of 2001) and the rapid and unending evolution of \n     technology require a Federal investment in State assistive \n     technology systems to ensure that individuals with \n     disabilities reap the benefits of the technological \n     revolution and participate fully in life in their \n     communities.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to enhance the ability of the Federal Government to \n     provide States with financial assistance that supports \n     statewide--\n       (A) activities to increase access to, and funding for, \n     assistive technology devices and assistive technology \n     services, including financing systems and financing programs;\n       (B) device demonstration, device loan, and device re-\n     utilization programs;\n       (C) training and technical assistance in the provision or \n     use of assistive technology devices and assistive technology \n     services;\n       (D) information systems relating to the provision of \n     assistive technology devices and assistive technology \n     services; and\n       (E) improved interagency and public-private coordination \n     that results in increased availability of assistive \n     technology devices and assistive technology services; and\n       (2) to provide States with financial assistance to \n     undertake activities that assist each State in maintaining \n     and strengthening cross-disability, full-lifespan State \n     assistive technology programs, consistent with the Federal \n     commitment to full participation and independent living of \n     individuals with disabilities.\n\n     SEC. 3.

REPEAL.\n\n       The Assistive Technology Act of 1998 (29 U.S.C. 3001 et \n     seq.) is repealed.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I join with my colleague from New \nHampshire, Senator Gregg, and others to introduce the Assistive \nTechnology Act of 2004.\n  Assistive technology and accessible information technology and \ntelecommunication are so critical to the lives of people with \ndisabilities. An NOD/Harris poll released today shows that 35 percent \nof individuals with disabilities surveyed indicated that they would not \nbe able to take care of themselves at home without assistive \ntechnology. Over a quarter of individuals with disabilities reported \nthat they would not be able to get around outside of their homes. \nAssistive technology and accessible information technology and \ntelecommunication also provide opportunities in education, employment \nand civic and social participation that would not otherwise be \navailable to some individuals with disabilities.\n  To quote the National Council on Disability--``For Americans without \ndisabilities, technology makes things easier. For Americans with \ndisabilities, technology makes things possible.''\n  The Assistive Technology Act that we introduce today builds upon the \nsuccesses of this law, dating back to 1988. The state Assistive \nTechnology programs have been very effective in providing information, \ntraining, and technical assistance to a wide array of individuals in \ntheir states, including people with disabilities, their families, \neducators, health care professionals and others. The Assistive \nTechnology Act has also authorized alternate finance programs that have \noffered low interest loans and other financing to people with \ndisabilities who otherwise could not access the funds needed to buy \ntheir assistive technology.\n  The most recent data available, FY 02, indicates that the programs \nare making a substantial difference in their states. In that year, \nthere were 92,000 equipment demonstrations provided, 38,000 devices \nloaned to individuals with disabilities and over 6,000 devices \nexchanged or recycled. Also over 6 million dollars was loaned to \nindividuals with disabilities so they could purchase assistive \ntechnology, ranging from a hearing device to an accessible van. The AT \nprograms also provided needed information to a wide array of \nindividuals, answering 151,000 requests for assistance and training \nover 172,000 people.\n  In this reauthorization, we strengthen this successful program and \nprovide authorization for increased appropriations to carry out the \nmany activities that are needed in the states. We emphasize programs \nthat will improve access to assistive technology devices and also \nincrease attention to some federal priorities, including \nimproving education, promoting community integration, and increasing \nemployment opportunities for individuals with disabilities.\n\n  While there are many important initiatives in this bill, I will \nhighlight a few of the most significant.\n  First, the bill authorizes a minimum of $500,000 for each state \nprogram and includes an authorization of 36 million dollars in 2005 \nwhich would allow each state to receive that minimum. These funds will \nbe used to support all of the activities specified in the law.\n  The bill also strengthens some of the core functions of the state \nassistive technology programs, focusing training and technical \nassistance to ensure statewide access to information and an emphasis on \nskills development and technical training to improve service planning \nfor individuals with disabilities.\n\n[[Page S7473]]\n\n  It further requires States focus their efforts on one of three target \npopulations. These populations include 1. elementary and secondary \nschool students, providers and related personnel; 2. adult service \nprovider clients, providers and related personnel; and 3. employees, \nemployment providers, and related personnel.\n  States will be required to focus their energies on service planning \nfor one of these populations so we can ensure that assistive technology \nis getting out to where it is needed most--in the schools, on the job \nand in the community. The Senate has recently passed the Individuals \nwith Disabilities Act and the Workforce Investment Act and we continue \nto be concerned about implementation of the ADA and the Olmstead \ndecision. This targeted effort aligns the Assistive Technology Act with \nthese other initiatives.\n  The bill includes provisions designed to increase access to assistive \ntechnology and accessible information technology and telecommunications \nby requiring that assistive technology programs operate equipment loan, \ndevice reutilization, device demonstration, and financing systems. The \nbill also seeks to improve information about service providers and \nvendors of assistive technology and accessible information technology.\n  Because individuals with disabilities still experience significantly \nfewer employment opportunities than individuals without disabilities, \nthe bill places an emphasis on educating and targeting employers and \nemployees. One of the projects of national significance authorized in \nthe bill includes development of public service announcements and other \nmeans of reaching employers and others with information regarding \nassistive technology.\n  For the first time, the bill addresses the need to coordinate state \nprogram activities with the businesses that develop and produce much of \nthe assistive technology and accessible information technology. The \nbill authorizes a project of national significance in research and \ndevelopment and authorizes the Secretary to conduct a detailed \nassessment of the assistive technology industry.\n  The bill also recognizes the ongoing contribution of protection and \nadvocacy services in making assistive technology available to \nindividuals with disabilities and increases minimum authorization \nlevels for this important function. Iowa has had a very successful \nadvocacy program, which will be continued under this bill.\n  These are just a few of the many significant issues addressed in this \nbill. It is a very comprehensive effort due to the hard work of the \nmany stakeholders that participated.\n  I want to thank my colleague, Senator Gregg, and his staff, \nparticularly Aaron Bishop and Annie White, for their work on this \nbipartisan initiative. I also want to recognize the work of Senators \nKennedy, Roberts, Reed and Warner and their staff members, Kent \nMitchell, Connie Garner, Jennifer Swenson, Elyse Wasch, Erica Swanson, \nand John Robinson because this has truly been a collaborative and \nbipartisan effort to reauthorize this important legislation.\n  As part of this reauthorization process, committee staff have had \nextensive bipartisan briefings and met with a very wide array of \nstakeholders. Stakeholders also participated in work groups designed to \nforge consensus on many of the issues addressed in this bill. As a \nresult, I believe we have a very strong bill. I want to thank the many \nindividuals with disabilities, family members, assistive technology \nprograms, vendors, members of the information technology industry, the \nfinancial and business community, service providers, advocates, \neducators and others who gave generously of their time and worked so \nhard on this bill.\n  This bill continues the tradition of bipartisan cooperation that has \nmarked significant disability legislation. Just as the ADA, IDEA and \nother bills have been bipartisan, so is this Assistive Technology Act \nof 2004. I look forward to moving ahead and getting it enacted into \nlaw.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am proud to join Senators Gregg and \nHarkin in the introduction of the Assistive Technology Act of 2004, \nwhich will continue and expand our Nation's promise to improve access \nto assistive technology for individuals in every State and territory.\n  In the Senate we are dedicated to breaking down barriers to equal \neducation, to employment opportunities and to quality and affordable \nhealth care. Assistive technology enables people with disabilities to \nbreak down the physical and other barriers which prevent them from \nreaching their full potential.\n  For an individual with difficulty communicating, a hand-writing aid \nor a communication board can open up a whole new world of \nrelationships. A wheelchair or scooter can give them the freedom to \nengage in activities otherwise impossible. And switches and other \ndevices can transform their home into an accessible environment and \nallow them to perform daily household tasks essential to independent \nliving.\n  Since 1988, the Assistive Technology Act has funded projects in every \nState and territory to raise awareness about the enormous potential of \nassistive technology, give individuals an opportunity to test products, \nand connect them with low-cost options for purchasing technology. Each \nproject has a different focus, but all are providing these core \nservices, and providing them well.\n  In Massachusetts, the Massachusetts Assistive Technology Project \ntrains individuals with disabilities to be self-advocates. They monitor \nimplementation of State and Federal laws. And they operate an Equipment \nExchange Trading Post for individuals to exchange or sell assistive \ntechnology products. This is just a small sample of what they are \ndoing. They deserve great credit, and so do the other projects across \nthe nation.\n  The Assistive Technology Act of 2004 makes a commitment to continue \nthese projects. It asks them to perform device demonstrations, \nequipment loans, device refurbishment, and provide financing systems \nsuch as low-cost loan programs. It mandates a new focus on training \nlocal personnel who work every day with people with disabilities in \nadult service provider settings, in schools, and in employment \nsettings. It gives States the flexibility to which populations to focus \non, but asks that they work to make the promise of the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act, the Workforce Investment Act, and the \nOlmstead decision a reality.\n  I know they are up to the challenge, and I will work to ensure they \nhave the resources to make it happen. To that end, the act authorizes \nadditional resources and sets a higher minimum appropriation of \n$500,000 for each State project. It is vital that any final legislation \ninclude this recognition that these life-changing services need real \nresources.\n  I commend Senators Gregg, Harkin, and Reed for their hard work on \nthis legislation. I also commend all of the disability advocates, \norganizations and project directors who informed this legislation. I \nlook forward to working with them and my colleagues in the House of \nRepresentatives to get a bill signed into law this year.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise as an original cosponsor of the \nImproving Access to Assistive Technology for Individuals with \nDisabilities Act of 2004. This important legislation reauthorizes the \nAssistive Technology, AT, Act, which helps States strengthen their \ncapacity to address the assistive technology needs of individuals with \ndisabilities and supports loan and device demonstration programs, for \nsix years.\n  This legislation improves current law in several ways which will help \nindividuals with disabilities gain access to the assistive technology \ndevices and services that will help them lead full and productive \nlives. Importantly, the legislation removes the sunset provision \nincluded in the last reauthorization and increases the minimum State \nallotment to $500,000, ensuring that all States can continue this vital \nwork. Assistive technology devices and services are increasingly \nnecessary, particularly as our population ages and for soldiers \nreturning from battle with injuries that used to be life ending.\n  I am particularly pleased that this legislation contains language I \nsought to address areas of need that I heard from assistive technology \nusers, providers, advocates, and administrators in my State of Rhode \nIsland. First, the bill enhances training activities to improve the \ncapacity of local education,\n\n[[Page S7474]]\n\nearly intervention, adult providers, and employers to assess, \nimplement, and integrate AT devices. Secondly, funding is authorized \nfor inventing and developing new AT devices and adapting, maintaining, \nservicing, and improving existing AT devices. Finally, the bill makes \ngreat strides to promote interagency coordination and collaboration to \neffectively deliver assistive technology devices and services.\n  I want to thank Senators Gregg, Kennedy, and Harkin for working so \nclosely with me and my staff on this bill. It is my hope that we will \nbe able to maintain this same cooperative, bipartisan spirit in which \nthis bill was crafted as the reauthorization process moves forward.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SCHUMER (for himself, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Corzine, Mrs. \n        Clinton, Mr. Leahy, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Sarbanes, and Mr. Nelson \n        of Florida)\n  S. 2597. A bill to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nto establish and maintain an Internet website that is designed to allow \nconsumers to compare the usual and customary prices for covered \noutpatient drugs sold by retail pharmacies that participate in the \nmedicaid program for each postal Zip Code, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2597\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Access to prescription drugs is important to all \n     Americans.\n       (2) Many individuals cannot afford to purchase the drugs \n     prescribed by their doctors. Others skip doses or split pills \n     contrary to their doctor's orders because they cannot afford \n     to refill their prescriptions.\n       (3) Individuals who use their limited financial resources \n     to obtain needed drugs may do so by foregoing other \n     expenditures important to their health and well-being.\n       (4) Among the objectives of the medicaid program set forth \n     in section 1901 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396) \n     is the objective to enable each State to furnish services to \n     help low-income families and aged, blind, or disabled \n     individuals ``attain or retain capability for independence or \n     self-care''.\n       (5) Some States, such as Maryland, have established \n     interactive Internet websites that use the usual and \n     customary price information reported by pharmacies \n     participating in the State's medicaid program to allow all \n     residents of the State to comparison shop for prescription \n     drugs.\n       (6) Requiring all States to collect from pharmacies that \n     participate in the medicaid program the usual and customary \n     price for prescription drugs sold by the pharmacies and to \n     report that information to the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services in order that a national, interactive Internet \n     website may be established and maintained for individuals to \n     use to comparison shop for prescription drugs is consistent \n     with the objectives of the medicaid program.\n\n     SEC. 3. STATE PLAN REQUIREMENT TO COLLECT AND REPORT USUAL \n                   AND CUSTOMARY PRICES FOR COVERED OUTPATIENT \n                   DRUGS SOLD UNDER THE MEDICAID PROGRAM.\n\n       Section 1902(a) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1396a(a)) is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (66), by striking ``and'' at the end;\n       (2) in paragraph (67), by striking the period and inserting \n     ``; and''; and\n       (3) by inserting after paragraph (67), the following:\n       ``(68) provide that the State shall--\n       ``(A) require each retail pharmacy which receives payments \n     under the plan to report to the State concurrent with the \n     filling of a prescription for a covered outpatient drug (as \n     defined in section 1927(k)(2)) for an individual receiving \n     medical assistance under this title--\n       ``(i) the usual and customary price (as defined in section \n     1927(k)(10)) for the strength, quantity, and dosage form of \n     the covered outpatient drug, as of the date the prescription \n     is filled; and\n       ``(ii) the postal Zip Code in which the retail pharmacy is \n     located; and\n       ``(B) submit the information reported under subparagraph \n     (A) to the Secretary on such frequent basis as the Secretary \n     shall require so as to allow for monthly updates of the \n     information posted on the Internet website required to be \n     established under section 5 of the Prescription Drug Price \n     Comparison for Savings Act of 2004.''.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to protect, conserve, and restore public land \nadministered by the Department of the Interior or the Forest Service \nand adjacent land through cooperative cost-shared grants to control and \nmitigate the spread of invasive species, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Public Land \nProtection and Conservation Act of 2004. I am pleased to have my \nesteemed colleagues Senator Frank Lautenberg, Senator Carl Levin, \nSenator Dianne Feinstein, Senator Daniel Inouye, and Senator Ron Wyden \ncosponsoring the bill with me. This legislation encourages Federal, \nState, and local agencies, non-governmental entities, and Indian tribes \nto work together through a cost-shared, cooperative grant program to \ncontrol the spread of terrestrial invasive species. The bill authorizes \nthe Secretary of the Interior to provide state assessment grants to \ninventory and prioritize invasive species problems. It provides \nadditional grants to control invasive species on Federal land or \nadjacent areas. And most importantly, it provides rapid response funds \nfor states to eradicate serious new outbreaks.\n  Invasive species cause devastating environmental, human health, and \neconomic consequences throughout the Nation and world. They are \nresponsible for damage to native ecosystems and vital industries, such \nas agriculture, fisheries, and ranching. The impacts of invasive \nspecies are estimated to cost the United States at least $100 billion \neach year. Invasive species threaten the existence of 42 percent of \nthreatened and endangered species in the United States, and this is an \nissue that must be confronted.\n  The implications of the nationwide invasive species problem are \nenormous. Nowhere, however, are the impacts greater than in my home \nState of Hawaii, which has always been known for its biodiversity. \nApproximately 11,000 species are believed to have evolved from roughly \n20,000 ancestors that successfully colonized at a rate of one every \n35,000 years. Today, 20 to 50 new nonnative species arrive in Hawaii \nevery year.\n  In total, unwanted alien pests are entering Hawaii at a rate that is \nabout\n\n[[Page S7475]]\n\ntwo million times more rapid than the natural rate. Nonnative, invasive \nspecies comprise roughly 20 percent of the plants and animals in \nHawaii. Invasive species are the number one cause of the decline of \nHawaii's threatened and endangered species. This is a serious concern \nbecause Hawaii has more than 10,000 species found nowhere else on \nEarth. Of the 114 endangered species that have become extinct in the \nfirst 20 years of the Endangered Species Act, almost one-half were in \nHawaii. The fragility of our native species is compounded by the fact \nthat most introduced species have no natural predators in the state.\n  Let me give you just a few examples of invasive species problems in \nHawaii. Control efforts for the Formosan ground termite are estimated \nto cost residents in Hawaii more than $150 million per year. Damage to \nour agricultural industry and the related control costs of the \nMediterranean fruit fly are more than $450 million annually. Native \nbirds in our rainforests are succumbing to malaria spread through \nintroduced mosquitos.\n  Coqui frogs, accidentally imported on plants to Hawaii, can reach \ndensities of 8,000 frogs per acre. Each one can produce a call at 90 \ndecibels. The noise from 8,000 frogs at 90 decibels is equivalent to \nlistening to a high-pitched jackhammer all night! Infestations of frogs \nare lowering property values and threatening Hawaii's export \nfloriculture and nursery industries. Coqui frogs also consume more than \n48,000 prey items per acre per night, depleting the food supply for \nthreatened and endangered birds and spiders. Miconia, an invasive tree \ninfesting over 15,000 acres of rainforest in Hawaii, eliminates the \nhabitat of endangered plants and animals and causes serious erosion \nproblems that threaten the water supply.\n  Miconia has overwhelmed all other species on these mountainsides. \nMiconia, like many invasives, is a major threat to native biodiversity.\n  The brown tree snake has invaded Guam and devastated native bird \npopulations there. If it were to become established in Hawaii, economic \ncosts have been estimated to exceed hundreds of millions of dollars.\n  Agriculture in Hawaii is threatened by the spread of the red imported \nfire ant, a serious problem in 14 southern states causing over $2 \nbillion in annual damage. As you can see, the time to address the issue \nof invasive species is now, before there are even more serious \nproblems.\n  My bill, the Public Land Protection and Conservation Act, authorizes \nthe Secretary of the Interior to provide grants to states, nonprofit, \nand tribal entities to assess, control, and eradicate invasive species. \nThere are three types of grants in this bill, one of which requires \nmatching funds.\n  First, this legislation provides grants to states for assessment \nprojects to identify, quantify, and prioritize invasive species \nthreats. This step is a critical underpinning for invasives programs, \nbut many states do not have the resources to carry out this assessment.\n  Second, the control grants supply appropriate public or private \nentities or Indian tribes with funding to carry out, in partnership \nwith a Federal agency, an eradication, containment, or management \nproject on Federal land or adjacent land. Control projects would \nreceive a higher ranking for funding based on shared priorities in \nstate and Federal plans, the extensiveness or severity of the invasive \nspecies impacts in a state, and whether the project fosters results \nthrough public-private partnerships, among other criteria.\n  Control grants are cost-shared with states. A maximum of 75 percent \nof funding shall be federally provided for control projects on adjacent \nland, with the exception of pilot or demonstration projects, or \nprojects that conserve threatened or endangered species, which shall \nreceive 85 percent federal funding. The Federal share of control \nprojects carried out on Federal land shall be 100 percent.\n  Finally, rapid response funds, designated for States facing new \noutbreaks of invasive species, will provide timely resources to \neradicate these organisms before they gain a foothold. Rapid response \nfunds are critical to States in order to combat newly identified \ninvasives.\n  The impacts of invasive species are already costing the United States \nan estimated $100 billion each year. The Department of the Interior, in \nits FY 2005 budget request acknowledges that invasive species pose an \nenormous threat to the ecological and economic health of the Nation. \nThe Department states that the economic costs associated with invasive \nspecies are enormous already, and increasing. The Department of the \nInterior and U.S. Forest Service together received approximately $126 \nmillion in FY 2004, and the combined FY 2005 request is identical. \nAlthough I applaud the current efforts of the Department of the \nInterior and the U.S. Forest Service, we need a more coordinated attack \non invasive species. The attack must have robust funding if we are to \nwork in partnership with the states.\n  An estimated 5,000 to 6,000 invasive species are established in the \nUnited States. With 73 percent of the continental United States held in \nprivate lands, our Federal lands will not be adequately protected \nwithout public-private partnerships because invasive species know no \nboundaries.\n  My bill requires coordination between the National Invasive Species \nCouncil, the Department of the Interior, the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture, and state invasive species councils and plans. It provides \nthe support necessary for agencies, organizations, and individuals to \nimplement cooperative projects to address new threats and long-standing \ninvasive species problems.\n  I am particularly pleased that the State of Hawaii is taking a \nleadership role in addressing invasive species problems as our State is \nintimately familiar with the serious impacts. Hawaii's Department of \nLand and Natural Resources, the State government, and each county's \nInvasive Species Councils are committed to a proactive approach to \npreserve the environmental heritage and economic security of our \ncommunities for generations to come. Each of these Councils now \ncoordinates their activities on the State level through the formation \nof the Hawaii Invasive Species Council in 2003.\n  In addition to the Council, many public and private partnerships have \nbeen formed to protect our common natural resources. The East Maui \nWatershed Partnership brings together multiple public and private \nlandowners and the County of Maui to control invasive species and \nprotect 100,000 acres of our prime watershed areas. This is just one \nexample of many highly successful and dedicated partnerships in Hawaii \nworking to preserve our invaluable resources.\n  This legislation is supported by the State of Hawaii's Department of \nLand and Natural Resources, which has primary responsibility for land \nuse, forests, wildlife and oceans. In his letter of support, the \nChairperson of the DLNR, Mr. Peter Young, states that ``Increasing \nsuccess in invasive species projects in Hawaii has come largely from \nthe formation of strong partnerships between State, County and Federal \nagencies and private groups.'' The intent of this bill is to encourage \npartnerships like the East Maui Watershed Partnership and the Hawaii \nInvasives Species Council in their fight against invasives.\n  Most recently, the Hawaii State Legislature allocated $4 million of \nthe $5 million requested by Governor Linda Lingle to support the \nInvasive Species Prevention and Control program. This request is part \nof the overall state proposal to earmark $20 million over the next four \nyears. These actions demonstrate Hawaii's commitment to the problem. \nThis money, however, is clearly not sufficient to control the nonnative \nspecies in Hawaii.\n  Despite their best efforts to reduce the devastation caused by \ninvasive species, states lack the needed funds to adequately address \nthis issue. The General Accounting Office (GAO) issued a report on \nSeptember 5, 2003, documenting gaps and barriers in Federal invasive \nspecies legislation. The number one barrier identified in the report \nwas insufficient Federal funding for state efforts to control invasive \nspecies. Another barrier identified was the inadequate amount of \ngeneral information and research on invasive species. My legislation \nwill provide States the desperately needed funding to start a serious \nbattle against invasive species.\n  The GAO report also recommended authorizing the National Invasive \nSpecies Council as the most effective leadership structure for managing \ninvasive species. I applaud Senators Levin and\n\n[[Page S7476]]\n\nDeWine for addressing this issue in legislation they have introduced \nduring the 108th Congress, the National Aquatic Invasive Species Act of \n2003. I am a cosponsor of their bill, S. 525, because aquatic invasives \nare important in Hawaii. I am also a cosponsor of Senator Larry Craig's \nNoxious Weed Control Act of 2003, S. 144, that focuses on terrestrial \nweeds. My bill, the Public Land Protection and Conservation Act of \n2004, will fill a needed gap by addressing all invasive organisms, \nflora and fauna, in and around federal lands through public-private \npartnerships.\n\n  The National Environmental Coalition on Invasive Species, a coalition \nof representatives from major environmental organizations, has extended \nits full support for this legislation. Its letter of support calls this \nbill ``one of the best legislative proposals to date to deal with the \ngrowing threat that invasive species pose to our nation's ecological \nand economic health.'' The bill is also supported by The Conservation \nCouncil of Hawaii, the National Wildlife Federation affiliate in \nHawaii. I greatly appreciate their endorsements.\n  Lastly, I want to acknowledge my colleague in the House, \nRepresentative Nick Rahall, for recognizing the gaps in national \nlegislation for controlling and eradicating invasive species on Federal \nand adjacent lands through cooperative grants. He introduced H.R. 2310, \nthe Species Protection and Conservation of the Environment Act, on June \n3, 2003. His legislation provided a solid blueprint that inspired my \nbill, and I am eager to join him in the eradication of invasive species \non Federal and adjacent lands.\n  There are increasingly severe problems and economic burdens \nassociated with invasive species in our nation. Federal support to \nstates to combat this problem at the ground level is crucial. If ever \nthere was a time to commit to defending the security of our domestic \nresources for the future, it is now.\n  I ask unanimous consent that text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2598\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Public Land Protection and \n     Conservation Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to encourage partnerships among \n     Federal, State, and local agencies, nongovernmental entities, \n     and Indian tribes to protect, enhance, restore, and manage \n     public land and adjacent land through the control of invasive \n     species by--\n       (1) promoting the development of voluntary State \n     assessments to establish priorities for controlling invasive \n     species;\n       (2) promoting greater cooperation among Federal, State, and \n     local land and water managers and owners of private land or \n     other interests to implement strategies to control and \n     mitigate the spread of invasive species through a voluntary \n     and incentive-based financial assistance grant program;\n       (3) establishing a rapid response capability to combat \n     incipient invasive species invasions; and\n       (4) modifying the requirements applicable to the National \n     Invasive Species Council.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to strengthen anti-terrorism investigative tools, to \nenhance prevention and prosecution of terrorist crimes, to combat \nterrorism financing, to improve border and transportation security, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that \nwill facilitate the sharing of information from Federal law enforcement \nagencies to State and local law enforcement. Right now, existing \nFederal law authorizes the FBI to obtain certain records and \ninformation, such as telephone records, bank records, and consumer \ncredit records, in investigations of terrorist activities. One of the \ntools\n\n[[Page S7478]]\n\nthat the FBI uses for this purpose is the National Security Letter (or \nNSL), which is, in effect, a limited type of administrative subpoena \nthat is directed to the institutions that have these records. The \nstatutes authorizing the use of NSLs generally require that the \nrequested information be relevant to an investigation of international \nterrorism or clandestine intelligence activities, and these statues \nprohibit investigations based solely on First Amendment-protected \nactivities of people known under the law as ``United States persons,'' \nwhich is a group consisting of U.S. citizens and permanent resident \naliens.\n  Unfortunately, when the FBI receives records or information provided \nto it in response to NSLs, several different statutes govern the \ncircumstances under which the Bureau may disseminate this information \nto other agencies. The standards differ from statute to statute--\ncomplicating the sharing of the information with other agencies that \nmay need it for counterterrorism purposes--and a number of these \nprovisions curiously are more restrictive about information sharing \nwith other Federal agencies than with non-Federal agencies. The \nInformation Sharing Improvement Act of 2004 (ISIA), which I introduce \ntoday along with my good friend from Arizona, John Kyl, would amend \nthese statutes to allow the dissemination of information obtained \nthrough NSLs in conformity with consistent guidelines developed by the \nAttorney General.\n\n  The Information Sharing Improvement Act also amends a statute that \nauthorizes sharing of national security-related investigative \ninformation with relevant Federal, State, and local officials, to make \nit clear that the statute applies regardless of whether the \ninvestigation in which the information was obtained is characterized as \na ``criminal'' investigation or a ``national security'' investigation.\n  Finally, the Information Sharing Improvement Act would restore \nHomeland Security Act amendments that broaden the sharing of Federal \ngrand jury information concerning threatened terrorist attacks with \nState and local authorities.\n  The Information Sharing Improvement Act does not expand the powers of \nthe FBI or Federal prosecutors to acquire records or information, but \nit will improve their ability to share information--obtained under \nexisting authorities--with Federal, State, and local agencies that need \nit to protect the public from terrorism.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CLINTON (for herself, Mr. Levin, Mr. Dodd, Ms. Cantwell, \n        Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Schumer, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Santorum, Mr. \n        Lieberman, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Specter, Mr. Alexander, Ms. \n        Stabenow, Mrs. Feinstein, Mrs. Hutchison, Ms. Mikulski, Ms. \n        Collins, Mr. Corzine, and Mr. Pryor):\n  S. 2600. A bill to direct the Architect of the Capitol to enter into \na contract to revise the statue commemorating women's suffrage located \nin the rotunda of the United States Capitol to include a likeness of \nSojourner Truth; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation, \nwith strong bi-partisan support, calling for the women's suffrage \nstatue located in the Capitol Rotunda to include a likeness of \nSojourner Truth. As many of my colleagues know, in the majestic Capitol \nRotunda sits a monument honoring three pioneers of the women's suffrage \nmovement, which led to the women of our great nation being granted the \nright to vote in 1920.\n  The monument features the busts of Lucretia Mott, Elizabeth Cady \nStanton, and Susan B. Anthony that were sculpted by Adelaide Johnson, \nwho passed away in 1955. As the Architect of the Capitol has noted, the \nmonument was presented to the Capitol as a gift from the women of the \nUnited States by the National Women's Party and was accepted on behalf \nof Congress by the Joint Committee on the Library on February 10, 1921. \nThe unveiling ceremony was held in the Rotunda on February 15, 1921, \nthe 101st anniversary of the birth of Susan B. Anthony, and was \nattended by representatives of over 70 women's organizations. The \nCommittee authorized the installation of the monument in the Crypt, \nwhere it remained until, by act of Congress in 1996, it was relocated \nto the Capitol Rotunda in May 1997.\n  In addition to the wonderful busts of Stanton, Mott, and Anthony, one \nof the interesting features of the monument is the existence of a large \nslab of stone that was never sculpted. Looking at the monument, it is \nclear that it was intended for a fourth person--another pioneer of the \nwomen's suffrage movement--to be sculpted. The legislation I am \nintroducing today calls for Sojourner Truth to be that person.\n  Born into slavery as one of the youngest of thirteen children of \nJames and Elizabeth in Hurley, which is in Ulster County, New York, in \napproximately 1897, Sojourner Truth's given name was Isabella Baumfree. \nAlmost all of her brothers and sisters had been sold to other slave \nowners. Some of her earliest memories were of her parents' stories of \nthe cruel loss of their other children.\n\n  Isabella was sold several times to various slave owners and suffered \nmany hardships under slavery, but throughout her life she maintained a \ndeep and unwavering faith that carried her through many difficult \ntimes.\n  In 1817, the New York State Legislature passed the New York State \nEmancipation Act, which granted freedom to those enslaved who were born \nbefore July 4, 1799. Unfortunately, however, this law declared that \nmany men, women and children could not be freed until July 4, 1827, ten \nyears later. While still enslaved and at the demand of her then owner, \nJohn Dumont, Isabella married an older slave named Thomas, with whom \nshe had at least five children--Diane, Peter, Hannah, Elizabeth, and \nSophia.\n  As the date of her release came near--July 4, 1827--she learned that \nDumont was plotting to keep her enslaved, even after the Emancipation \nAct went into effect. For this reason, in 1826, she ran away from the \nDumont plantation with her infant child, leaving behind her husband and \nother children.\n  She took refuge with a Quaker family--the family of Isaac Van \nWagenen--and performed domestic work for them as well as missionary \nwork among the poor of New York City. While working for the Van \nWagenen's, she discovered that a member of the Dumont family had sold \nher youngest son Peter to a plantation owner in Alabama. At the time, \nNew York law prohibited the sale of slaves outside New York State and \nso the sale of Peter was illegal. Isabella sued in court and won his \nreturn. In doing so, she became the first black woman in the United \nStates to take a white man to court and win.\n  Isabella had always been very spiritual, and soon after being \nemancipated, she had a vision that affected her profoundly, leading \nher--as she later described it--to develop a ``perfect trust in God and \nprayer.'' In 1843, deciding her mission was to preach the word of God, \nIsabella changed her name to Sojourner Truth--her name for a traveling \npreacher, one who speaks the truth--and left New York. That summer she \ntraveled throughout New England, calling her own prayer meetings and \nattending those of others. She preached ``God's truth and plan for \nsalvation.''\n  After months of travel, she arrived in Northampton, Massachusetts, \nand joined the Northampton Association for Education and Industry, \nwhere she met and worked with abolitionists such as William Lloyd \nGarrison, Frederick Douglas, and Olive Gilbert.\n  As we know, during the 1850s, slavery became an especially heated \nissue in the United States. In 1850, Congress passed the Fugitive Slave \nLaw, which allowed runaway slaves to be arrested and jailed without a \njury trial, and in 1857, the Supreme Court ruled in the Dred Scott case \nthat those enslaved had no rights as citizens and that the government \ncould not outlaw slavery in the new territories.\n  Nevertheless, these extraordinarily difficult times did not stop \nSojourner Truth from continuing her mission. Her life story--``The \nNarrative of Sojourner Truth: A Northern Slave''--written with the help \nof friend Olive Gilbert, was published in 1850.\n  While traveling and speaking in states across the country, Sojourner \nTruth met many women abolitionists and noticed that although women \ncould be part of the leadership in the abolitionist movement, they \ncould neither vote nor hold public office. It was\n\n[[Page S7479]]\n\nthis realization that led Sojourner to become an outspoken supporter of \nwomen's rights.\n  In 1851, she addressed the Women's Rights Convention in Akron, Ohio, \ndelivering her famous speech ``Ain't I a Woman?'' The applause she \nreceived that day has been described as ``deafening.'' From that time \non, she became known as a leading advocate for the rights of women. \nIndeed, she was one of the nineteenth century's most eloquent voices \nfor the cause of anti-slavery and women's rights.\n  By the mid-1850s, Truth had earned enough money from sales of her \npopular autobiography to buy land and a house in Battle Creek, \nMichigan. She continued her lectures, traveling to Ohio, Indiana, Iowa, \nIllinois, and Wisconsin. When the Civil War erupted in 1861, she \nvisited black troops stationed near Detroit, Michigan, and offered \nencouragement. After the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863, she worked \nin Washington as a counselor and educator for those who had been \npreviously enslaved through the Freedman's Relief Association and the \nFreedmen's Hospital. It was during this time--in October 1864--that she \nmet with President Abraham Lincoln.\n  Throughout the 1870s, Sojourner Truth continued to speak on behalf of \nwomen and African Americans. Failing health, however, soon forced \nSojourner to return to her Battle Creek, Michigan home, where she died \non November 26, 1883.\n  This brief recounting of Sojourner Truth's life story only begins to \nspeak of her faith, courage, intelligence, and steadfastness in the \nface of extraordinary circumstances and volatile times in our Nation's \nhistory. Though she could neither read nor write, her eloquence \ncommanded the attention of thousands of Americans, both black and \nwhite. It therefore comes as no surprise to learn that among her many \nfriends, admirers and staunch supporters were Frederick Douglass, Amy \nPost, Olive Gilbert, Parker Pillsbury, Mrs. Francis Gage, Weldell \nPhillips, Willilam Lloyd Garrison, Laura Haviland, Lucretia Mott, and \nSusan B. Anthony.\n  The legislation I am introducing today pays tribute to Sojourner \nTruth by including her in the portrait monument with three of her \nfellow leading suffragettes. That is why this legislation has the \nstrong bi-partisan support of so many of my colleagues and of many \norganizations, including the National Council of Women's Organizations.\n  I also want to take a moment to say a special thanks of appreciation \nto Dr. C. Delores Tucker, Chair of the National Congress of Black \nWomen, who is the champion of this legislation and for all African \nAmerican women, children and families today. I know that with her \ncontinued, unwavering support, this legislation will be enacted. I ask \nall of my colleagues to support it. Thank you.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2600\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Sojourner Truth was a towering figure among the \n     founders of the movement for women's suffrage in the United \n     States, and any monument that accurately represents this \n     important development in our Nation's history should include \n     her.\n       (2) The statue known as the Portrait Monument, originally \n     presented to Congress in 1920 in honor of the passage of the \n     Nineteenth Amendment guaranteeing women the right to vote and \n     presently exhibited in the rotunda of the Capitol, portrays \n     several early suffragists who were Sojourner Truth's \n     contemporaries, but not Sojourner Truth herself, the only \n     African American among the group.\n\n     SEC. 2. REVISION OF WOMEN'S SUFFRAGE STATUE.\n\n       Not later than the final day on which the One Hundred Ninth \n     Congress is in session, the Architect of the Capitol shall \n     enter into a contract to revise the statue commemorating \n     women's suffrage located in the rotunda of the United States \n     Capitol (commonly known as the ``Portrait Monument'') to \n     include a likeness of Sojourner Truth.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to co-sponsor \nlegislation to add the likeness of Sojourner Truth to the statue \ncommemorating women's suffrage located in the rotunda of the United \nStates Capitol.\n  Sojourner Truth (1797?-1883) was the self-given name of a woman born \ninto slavery. The year of her birth is uncertain, and is usually taken \nto be 1797. Originally Isabella Van Wagener, she escaped to Canada in \n1827.\n  After New York State had abolished slavery in 1829, she returned and \nworked as a domestic servant for over a decade, and joined Elijah \nPierson in evangelical preaching on street-corners. Later in life she \nbecame a noted speaker for both the Abolitionist movement and the \nwomen's rights movement. Perhaps one of her most famous speeches was \nAin't I A Woman, a short but pointed commentary delivered in 1851 at \nthe Women's Convention in Akron, Ohio.\n  During the American Civil War, she organized collection of supplies \nfor the Union. In 1850, she worked with Olive Gilbert to produce a \nbiography, the Narrative of Sojourner Truth.\n  This was a truly amazing woman who endeavored in her time to change \nthe American experience both for her fellow freed slaves as well as \nwomen of all races. A courageous woman, Truth not only spoke out \nagainst the racial oppression that she had endured throughout her \nchildhood but acted on her beliefs, inspiring men and women of all \nraces with her personal strength, wisdom, and social activism.\n  Through her courage and perseverance, Sojourner Truth, her \ncontemporaries, and future visionaries have led our nation and the \nworld toward greater freedom and democracy for all. Three of these \nwomen--Lucretia Mott, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Susan B. Anthony--are \nalready portrayed by the Portrait Monument, which was presented to \nCongress in 1920 in honor of the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment \nguaranteeing women the right to vote. Her recognition, as an African-\nAmerican would be an appropriate, noteworthy addition to the statue.\n  I am pleased to offer this legislation to finally honor Sojourner \nTruth in the rotunda of the U.S. Capitol and encourage the retelling of \nher inspirational story to the American people. This is a long overdue \neffort and I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG:\n  2601. A bill to amend title 37, United States Code, to require the \npayment of monthly special pay for members of the uniformed services \nwhose service on active duty is extended by a stop-loss order or \nsimilar mechanism, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed \nServices.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a bill that \naddresses a critical element of defense funding.\n  My bill will very simply compensate men and women from all services \nwho will be deployed even after their service agreement has ended.\n  The so called ``Stop Loss'' policy that will keep over 10,000 troops \nforcefully conscripted is a direct result of perhaps the most dangerous \nerror the administration made in its planning for the war in Iraq.\n  The administration gravely miscalculated the military personnel \nrequired in the post-invasion stage of the Iraq campaign. It \ndrastically underestimated the challenges of the so called \n``Reconstruction Phase'' and instead naively pretended we would be \ngreeted as liberators, with sweets and tea.\n  The civilian leadership at the Pentagon failed to plan for adequate \npersonnel to ensure the security of Iraq.\n  But this wasn't just failure by omission. This was a deliberate \nneglect of expert opinion, which warned the administration that \nhundreds of troops would be needed to secure a country the size of \nCalifornia. In January 2003, three star General Eric Shinseki told the \nWhite House, the Pentagon and the public that 300,000 troops were \nnecessary to execute the war and post-war objectives.\n  Not only was his expert advice ignored, but he was also fired for \noffering a dissenting view.\n  In May 2003, the administration was given a second chance to bolster \nits troops in Iraq; it could have solicited the support of our major \nallies--such as Turkey, France, India and others--and NATO and urge a \ntruly international coalition to maintain peace in Iraq.\n  Unfortunately, the opportunity to bolster our troops through a real \nmultinational coalition was squandered and now it is too late.\n\n[[Page S7480]]\n\n  In fact, our troop shortage is so dire in Iraq that we are paying \nnon-military private contractors to perform typically military \nfunctions in Iraq--everything from serving meals to securing command \ncenters.\n  We now have over 20,000 private security contractors in Iraq, which \nis approximately the same number of individuals as the international \ntroops from the United Kingdom, Poland, Thailand, Italy and elsewhere \nwho are in our coalition.\n  And now, the military is forced to rely on the policy of forcing \nindividuals at the end of their service term to remain with their unit \nif it is deployed or will be deployed to the combat theaters.\n  The Pentagon has cleverly borrowed the corporate term ``Stop Loss'' \nto describe this new policy, which will affect over 10,000 new active \nduty and national guard and reservists.\n  I call the policy: ``Going Back on Your Word.'' With the Stop Loss \norders, thousands of men and women are being forcibly maintained in the \nservices, just as they were packing their bags and preparing to return \nhome to civilian life.\n  Stop Loss has an extremely large impact on all troops, but especially \nimpacts the National Guard and Reservists, many of whom have already \nbeen deployed much longer than they expected.\n  These men and women have put jobs and families on hold and now the \nPentagon is delaying their return further.\n  My bill addresses the serious strain that is currently being placed \non our young men and women in uniform and their families back home. It \nrequires the Pentagon to reimburse service members $2,000 a month for \neach month that they are forcibly maintained in the Armed Services, \nafter their term of enlistment has extended.\n  Critics might claim that this bonus will unfairly reward some troops \nand not others. But the Army and other services already have instituted \nmany different types of bonus awards that compensate service members \nabove and beyond the base military pay. For example, we routinely give \nhazardous danger pay and separation pay and recently we've initiated \nnew bonuses for those who enlist as a recruiting tool.\n  It's only fair that we compensate the troops who have already been \nfighting on the front lines of our two combat theaters.\n  These American heroes being sent back to war deserve a $2,000 a month \nbonus each and every month they are serving.\n  While the richest among us have been rewarded with tax cuts, the \nsoldiers, sailors, marines, and air men and women and their families \nare living paycheck to paycheck. This is just one example of how this \nwar is requiring sacrifices from only a small, overburdened segment of \nAmerican society.\n  It is not fair and my Military Fairness Act of 2004 will begin to \nredress the inequity in sacrifice:\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2601\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. MONTHLY SPECIAL PAY FOR ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE \n                   EXTENDED BY STOP-LOSS ORDERS.\n\n       (a) In General.--(1) Chapter 5 of title 37, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     section:\n\n     ``Sec. 327. Special pay: active duty service extended by \n       stop-loss order\n\n       ``(a) Special Pay.--A member of the uniformed services \n     entitled to basic pay whose enlistment or period of obligated \n     service is extended, or whose eligibility for retirement is \n     suspended, pursuant to the exercise of an authority referred \n     to in subsection (b) is entitled while on active duty during \n     the period of such extension or suspension to special pay in \n     the amount specified in subsection (c).\n       ``(b) Extension Authorities.--An authority referred to in \n     this section is an authority for the extension of an \n     enlistment or period of obligated service, or for suspension \n     of eligibility for retirement, of a member of the uniformed \n     services under a provision of law as follows:\n       ``(1) Section 123 of title 10.\n       ``(2) Section 12305 of title 10.\n       ``(3) Any other provision of law (commonly referred to as \n     `stop-loss authority') authorizing the President to extend an \n     enlistment or period of obligated service, or suspend an \n     eligibility for retirement, of a member of the uniformed \n     services in time of war or of national emergency declared by \n     Congress or the President.\n       ``(c) Monthly Amount.--The amount of special pay specified \n     in this subsection is $2,000 per month.\n       ``(d) Construction With Other Pays.--Special pay payable \n     under this section is in addition to any other pay payable to \n     members of the uniformed services by law.''.\n       (2) The table of sections at the beginning of such chapter \n     is amended by adding at the end the following new item:\n\n``327.

A bill to provide for a circulating quarter dollar coin \nprogram to honor the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto \nRico, Guam, American Samoa, the United States Virgin Islands, and the \nCommonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the District of \nColumbia and United States Territories Circulating Quarter Dollar \nProgram Act. I am proud to cosponsor this important legislation with my \ncolleague, Sen. Robert Bennett, R-UT.\n  This legislation will provide the District of Columbia, American \nSamoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of \nthe Northern Mariana Islands the opportunity to put a design of their \nchoice on the reverse side of a quarter coin. These jurisdictions were \ninadvertently excluded from the 50 States Quarter Commemorative Coin \nProgram Act, Public Law 105-124, that gave each State the same right in \n1997.\n  As part of the 50 State Quarter Program, over twenty-two billion \nquarter coins representing 27 states have been minted. All the coins \nare minted according to the year each State ratified the Constitution \nof the United States or were admitted into the Union. Although States \nhave appropriate latitude, there are limitations as to what can be used \nas a design.\n  According to Public Law 105-124, the Secretary of the Treasury has \nthe final approval of each design. The law gives clear guidance as to \nwhat is an acceptable design concept. Suitable design concepts include \nState landmarks, landscapes, historically significant buildings, \nsymbols of State resources or industries, official State flora and \nfauna, State icons, and outlines of States. Among the examples of \nsuitable coins already in circulation year New York's Statue of \nLiberty, Missouri's depiction of Lewis and Clark as they paddled down \nthe Missouri River with the Gateway Arch in the background, and North \nCarolina's first successful airplane flight.\n  The District of Columbia has been the unfortunate target of acts of \nterror, yet citizens of the District have no one who can cast a vote in \nCongress on policies to protect their security. Citizens of Washington, \nD.C., pay income taxes just like every other American. In fact on a per \ncapita basis, District residents have the second highest Federal tax \nobligation. And yet they have absolutely no say in how high those taxes \nwill be or how their tax dollars will be spent.\n  This legislation is a reminder of the importance of including all \nAmericans in the symbols of American citizenship. The residents of the \nDistrict are American citizens, despite their lack of voting \nrepresentation in the Congress.\n  I believe that the least that we can do is allow the residents of the \nDistrict of Columbia, as citizens of the United States, to commemorate \nthe symbols of their own jurisdiction.\n  The 50 States Commemorative Coin Program Act of 1997 states that \n``Congress finds that it is appropriate and timely to honor the unique \nFederal Republic of 50 States that comprise the United States; and to \npromote the diffusion of knowledge among the youth\n\n[[Page S7481]]\n\nof the United States about the individual states, their history and \ngeography, and the rich diversity of the national heritage'' and to \nencourage ``young people and their families to collect memorable tokens \nof all of the States for the face value of the coins.''\n  I believe that it is of significant importance to America's youth to \nbetter understand and honor the rich, vibrant history of our nation's \ncapital and territories, as well as that of our states. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this meaningful legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2602\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``District of Columbia and \n     United States Territories Circulating Quarter Dollar Program \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. ISSUANCE OF REDESIGNED QUARTER DOLLARS HONORING THE \n                   DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AND EACH OF THE \n                   TERRITORIES.\n\n       Section 5112 of title 31, United States Code, is amended by \n     inserting after subsection (m) the following new subsection:\n       ``(n) Redesign and Issuance of Circulating Quarter Dollar \n     Honoring the District of Columbia and Each of the \n     Territories.--\n       ``(1) Redesign in 2009.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Notwithstanding the fourth sentence of \n     subsection (d)(1) and subsection (d)(2) and subject to \n     paragraph (6)(B), quarter dollar coins issued during 2009 \n     shall have designs on the reverse side selected in accordance \n     with this subsection which are emblematic of the District of \n     Columbia and the territories.\n       ``(B) Flexibility with regard to placement of \n     inscriptions.--Notwithstanding subsection (d)(1), the \n     Secretary may select a design for quarter dollars issued \n     during 2009 in which--\n       ``(i) the inscription described in the second sentence of \n     subsection (d)(1) appears on the reverse side of any such \n     quarter dollars;

A bill to amend section 227 of the Communications Act of \n1934 (47 U.S.C. 227) relating to the prohibition on junk fax \ntransmissions; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Allen, Hollings \nand Sununu to introduce the ``Junk Fax Prevention Act of 2004.'' This \nbill will strengthen existing laws by providing consumers the ability \nto prevent unsolicited fax advertisements and provide greater \nCongressional oversight of enforcement efforts by the Federal \nCommunications Commission (FCC). This bill will also help businesses by \nallowing them to continue to send faxes to their customers in a manner \nthat has proven successful with both businesses and consumers.\n  At the end of last summer, the FCC reconsidered its Telephone \nConsumer Protection Act (TCPA) rules and elected to eliminate the \nability for businesses to contact their customers even where there \nexists an established business relationship. The effect of the FCC's \nrule would be to prevent a business from sending a fax solicitation to \nany person, whether it is a supplier or customer, without first \nobtaining prior written consent. This approach, while seemingly \nsensible, would impose significant costs on businesses in the form of \nextensive record keeping. Almost immediately after issuing this rule, \nthe Commission stayed its implementation until January 1, 2005.\n  The purpose of this legislation is to preserve the established \nbusiness relationship exception currently recognized under the TCPA. In \naddition, this bill will allow consumers to opt out of receiving \nfurther unsolicited faxes. This is a new consumer protection that does \nnot exist under the TCPA today.\n  We believe that this bipartisan bill strikes the appropriate balance \nin providing significant protections to consumers from unwanted \nunsolicited fax advertisements and preserves the many benefits that \nresult from legitimate fax communications. We hope that this body can \npass this legislation in a timely manner, prior to January 1, 2005, \nwhen the FCC's stay expires.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2603\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Junk Fax Prevention Act of \n     2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON FAX TRANSMISSIONS CONTAINING \n                   UNSOLICITED ADVERTISEMENTS.\n\n       (a) Prohibition.--Section 227(b)(1)(C) of the \n     Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 227(b)(1)(C)) is \n     amended to read as follows:\n       ``(C) to use any telephone facsimile machine, computer, or \n     other device to send, to a telephone facsimile machine, an \n     unsolicited advertisement, unless--\n       ``(i) the unsolicited advertisement is from a sender with \n     an established business relationship with the recipient;

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to reduce \nthe recognition period for built-ins gains for subchapter S \ncorporations; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I am very pleased today to introduce the \nSmall Business Growth and Opportunity Act of 2004 along with my Finance \nCommittee colleague, Senator Breaux.\n  This legislation will allow S corporations to liquidate unproductive \nassets freeing up capital to be used to grow the business and create \nnew jobs.\n  There are about 2.9 million of these small and family-owned \nbusinesses in all 50 States. Over the past few years, many of these \nsmall businesses have been forced to lay off workers and delay capital \ninvestment. At the same time, the tax code forces them to hold on to \nunproductive and inefficient assets or face the double tax period of \nthe corporate ``built-in gains'' tax.\n  Under current law, businesses that convert from C corporation to S \ncorporation status are penalized by a double tax burden for a period of \n10 years if they sell assets they owned as a C corporation. This tax \npenalty is imposed at the corporate level on top of normal shareholder-\nlevel taxes, making the sale and reinvestment of these assets \nprohibitively expensive. In some States, this double-tax burden can \nexceed 70 percent of the built-in gain.\n  Clearly this tax penalty is neither justifiable nor sustainable as a \nreasonable business matter. The built-in gains tax 1. limits cash flow \nand availability, 2. encourages excess borrowing because the S \ncorporation cannot access the locked-in value of its own assets, and 3. \nprevents these small businesses from growing and creating jobs.\n  While I would like to see even more generous relaxation of these \nrules, for revenue considerations this bill will reduce the built-in \ngains recognition period, the holding period, from 10 years to 7 years. \nThis three-year reduction would be a significant start in easing this \nunproductive tax burden on these small and family-owned businesses.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Senate Finance \nCommittee and hope the Committee will consider this proposal this year.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n                                S. 2604\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. REDUCED RECOGNITION PERIOD FOR BUILT-IN GAINS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Paragraph (7) of section 1374(d) (relating \n     to definitions and special rules) is amended to read as \n     follows:\n       ``(7) Recognition period.--The term `recognition period' \n     means the 7-year period beginning with the 1st day of the 1st \n     taxable year for which the corporation was an S corporation. \n     For purposes of applying this section to any amount \n     includible in income by reason of distributions to \n     shareholders pursuant to section 593(e), the preceding \n     sentence shall be applied without regard to the duration of \n     the recognition period in effect on the date such \n     distribution.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--\n       (1) General rule.--The amendment made by this section shall \n     apply to any recognition period in effect on or after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (2) Special application to existing periods exceeding 7 \n     years.-- Any recognition period in effect on the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the length of which is greater than 7 \n     years, shall end on such date.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/24/senate-section/article/S7483-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7483-S7487]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 391--DESIGNATING THE SECOND WEEK OF DECEMBER 2004 AS \n                ``CONVERSATIONS BEFORE THE CRISIS WEEK''\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee of the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 391\n\n       Whereas 2,400,000 people in the United States die each \n     year;\n       Whereas research shows that a majority of people in the \n     United States would prefer to die at home, surrounded by \n     family and other loved ones, free from pain, and with their \n     wishes honored;\n       Whereas only 30 percent of people in the United States \n     living with life-limiting illness experience the \n     interdisciplinary care that hospice provides to patients and \n     their caregivers;\n       Whereas studies have shown that too many people do not get \n     the care they want, with 70 percent dying in hospitals and \n     nursing homes suffering needlessly from high levels of pain \n     due to poor pain and symptom management;\n       Whereas individuals need to have more information and \n     support in order to make informed choices and share these \n     end-of-life care wishes with their families, doctors, \n     lawyers, and clergy;\n       Whereas all people in the United States have the ability to \n     make their end-of-life care wishes clear through the \n     execution of an advance directive, which includes a living \n     will describing the kind of care they would like to receive \n     and the appointment of a health care agent or proxy to speak \n     for them if they cannot speak for themselves;\n       Whereas only 15 to 20 percent of people in the United \n     States currently have an advance directive and most do not \n     know that there are options for good pain and symptom \n     management and quality end-of-life care, and thus do not ask \n     for them;\n       Whereas honoring a dying person's preferences is a critical \n     element of quality end-of-life care and the right of all \n     people in the United States;\n       Whereas advance directive documents are valid in all 50 \n     states and are available without charge on the Internet;\n       Whereas a ``Conversations Before the Crisis Week'', and \n     activities planned to support this week, would encourage \n     family members to designate time during the week to talk to \n     their loved ones about their personal end-of-life wishes and \n     to document those wishes formally through the completion of a \n     living will and appointing a medical power of attorney; and\n       Whereas the Senate believes educating people in the United \n     States about end-of-life care choices and encouraging \n     conversations about these issues before there is a medical \n     crisis is of the utmost importance: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the second week of December 2004 as \n     `Conversations Before the Crisis Week'; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling on the people of the United States to observe the \n     week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, last week my colleague Senator \nJay Rockefeller and I had the privilege of introducing the Advanced \nDirectives Improvement and Education\n\n[[Page S7484]]\n\nAct of 2004, which would improve an individual's understanding of the \nimportance of advance directives and give people the opportunity to \ndiscuss their options with their doctor.\n  The goals of the legislation are important. But as we make advance \ndirectives more accessible, we must also reach out to the many \nAmericans who feel uncomfortable discussing serious illness and death \nand help them learn how to make their end-of-life health care plans.\n  Accordingly, today I am pleased to introduce a Resolution designating \nthe second week of December 2004 to be ``Conversations Before the \nCrisis Week.'' During this week, there will be town hall meetings, \ntelevision and radio shows, educational events, newspaper articles, \nlegal clinics, and other activities taking place in communities across \nthe country. This coordinated effort will bring the discussion of dying \nout of the shadows and into the public square. There are difficult \nquestions to ask and the answers are neither simple nor universal. But \nit is essential that we discuss them and that each of us find the best \nanswer we can for ourselves and our families.\n  The alternative is unacceptable: once a terminal illness or tragedy \nstrikes, it is infinitely more difficult to sort through the complex \nand confusing emotional, spiritual, legal, and medical concerns. We \nmust begin having these conversations before the crisis because it is \nimportant to plan for end-of-life care without the anger, sadness, \nfear, and pain that may accompany a terminal diagnosis, and because \nknowing what you want is the greatest gift you can give to those who \nlove you and may have to make medical decisions for you.\n  It is my hope that as we talk more we will learn more; and as we \nlearn more, we will demand more. If we demand better end-of-life care, \nwe will get it. One example: Medicare has an excellent hospice benefit \nbut only 25-30 percent of eligible Medicare beneficiaries use this \nservice. Even people who do use the hospice benefit stay for an average \nof 28 days--too short to provide maximum benefit. Since Medicare allows \npeople who need it to have over 180 days of hospice care, this is very \nsurprising. By supporting this resolution, and creating a \n``Conversations Before the Crisis Week,'' we can generate important \npublic attention--attention that will help explain this mystery, and \nattention that will be crucial to helping people end their lives in a \nway that is as peaceful and as meaningful as possible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 392--CONVEYING THE SYMPATHY OF THE SENATE TO THE \nFAMILIES OF THE YOUNG WOMEN MURDERED IN THE STATE OF CHIHUAHUA, MEXICO, \nAND ENCOURAGING INCREASED UNITED STATES INVOLVEMENT IN BRINGING AN END \n                            TO THESE CRIMES\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mrs. Hutchison, and Ms. Landrieu) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S.

and\n       Whereas impunity for these crimes is a threat to the \n     ability of Mexico to consolidate its growing democracy: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns the abductions and murders of young women in \n     Ciudad Juarez and the city of Chihuahua in the State of \n     Chihuahua, Mexico, since 1993;\n       (2) expresses its sincerest condolences and deepest \n     sympathy to the families of the young women killed in the \n     State of Chihuahua, Mexico, since 1993, many of whom appear \n     to be victims of 1 or more serial murderers;\n       (3) recognizes the courageous struggle of the victims' \n     families in seeking justice for the victims;\n       (4) urges the President and Secretary of State to continue \n     to express concern over these abductions and murders to the \n     Government of Mexico and to request that the investigative \n     and preventative efforts of the Mexican Government become \n     part of the bilateral agenda between the Governments of \n     Mexico and the United States;\n       (5) urges the President and Secretary of State to continue \n     to express support for the efforts of the victims' families \n     to seek justice for the victims, to express concern relating \n     to the continued harassment of these families and the human \n     rights defenders with which they work, and to express concern \n     with respect to impediments in the ability of the families to \n     receive prompt and accurate information in their cases;\n       (6) supports multilateral efforts to create a DNA database \n     that would allow families to positively identify the remains \n     of the victims and encourages the Secretary of State to \n     facilitate United States participation in such a DNA \n     database;\n       (7) encourages the Secretary of State to continue to \n     include in the annual Country Report on Human Rights of the \n     Department of State all instances of improper investigatory \n     methods, threats against human rights activists, and the use \n     of torture with respect to cases involving the murder and \n     abduction of young women in the State of Chihuahua;\n       (8) recommends that the United States Ambassador to Mexico \n     visit Ciudad Juarez and the city of Chihuahua to meet with \n     the families of the victims, women's rights organizations, \n     and Mexican Federal and State officials responsible for \n     investigating these crimes and preventing future such crimes;\n       (9) condemns the use of torture as a means of investigation \n     into these crimes;\n       (10) encourages the Secretary of State to urge the \n     Government of Mexico to ensure fair and proper judicial \n     proceedings for the individuals accused of these abductions \n     and murders and to impose appropriate punishment for those \n     individuals subsequently determined to be guilty of such \n     crimes;\n       (11) condemns all senseless acts of violence in all parts \n     of the world and, in particular, violence against women; and\n       (12) expresses the solidarity of the people of the United \n     States with the people of Mexico in the face of these tragic \n     and senseless acts.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues Senators \nHutchison and Landrieu to submit a resolution to convey the deepest \nsympathy of the Senate to the families of the young women who have been \ntragically murdered in Ciudad Juarez and throughout the State of \nChihuahua, and urge the governments of Mexico and the United States to \nwork together to address this issue. This is an issue that has not only \naffected the people of Mexico, but has long troubled the communities in \nmy home State and across the entire Southwest region. A similar \nresolution, H. Res. 466, has been introduced by Representative Hilda \nSolis and enjoys the bipartisan support of 125 cosponsors.\n  In 1993, the bodies of women began appearing in the deserts outside \nthe city of Juarez, Mexico, marking the beginning of a horrendous \nepidemic that has plagued the United States-Mexico border region for \nmore then 10 years. Since then, more than 370 women have\n\n[[Page S7485]]\n\nbeen killed. Many of the young women were abducted in broad daylight in \nwell-populated areas, held captive for several days and subjected to \nphysical violence, humiliation, and sexual torture, before having their \nmutilated bodies discovered days, or sometimes years, later in deserted \nareas.\n  Unfortunately, these murders have continued into this year. Most \nrecently, on May 28, 14-year old Luisa Rocio Chavez Chavez was found \nmurdered in the city of Chihuahua after disappearing the previous \nmorning on her way home from the store. She had been raped and \nstrangled to death, and her body was found partially clothed. And \nbefore that, on April 26, a 33-year old factory worker, Teresa \nTorbellin, was found after being beaten to death and dragged through \nbushes and desert, eventually being dumped in a deserted area outside \nthe city. Like these deaths, nearly all of the cases remain unsolved. \nIn fact, many of the bodies of victims have yet to be positively \nidentified. One can only imagine how much pain and suffering this has \ncaused the families and friends of these young women. I want to make \nsure that these deaths are never forgotten, and that the governments on \nboth sides of the border continue to give this issue the attention that \nit so rightly deserves.\n  National and international human rights groups, as well as Mexico's \nown special prosecutor, Maria Lopez Urbina, have reported that many \ntimes bodies were misidentified, evidence was contaminated or lost, key \nwitnesses were not properly interviewed, and autopsies were \ninadequately performed. Some reports have even suspected local, state, \nand federal authorities of being involved or complicit in the women's \nmurders.\n  It is my understanding that President Vicente Fox has taken steps to \naddress this issue, by setting up the Commission to Prevent and \nEradicate Violence Against Women, which is responsible for coordinating \nFederal and State efforts in preventing violence of women in Ciudad \nJuarez and Chihuahua, and appointing a special prosecutor for punishing \nthose responsible for the murders in Ciudad Juarez and Chihuahua. \nAlthough I am pleased that President Fox has taken the initiative on \nthese fronts, I continue to believe that there needs to be a more \ncoordinated effort on the part of the Mexican and U.S. governments. \nThat is why I stand here today to submit this vitally important \nresolution.\n  Specifically, this resolution would condemn the abductions and \nmurders of young women in the State of Chihuahua, Mexico, express the \nsincerest condolences and deepest sympathy of the Senate to the \nfamilies of the young women, and urge a continued multilateral effort \non the part of the governments of Mexico and the United States to \naddress this issue.\n  To this end, it would urge the governments of Mexico and the United \nStates to support efforts to further develop a DNA database that would \nallow families to positively identify the remains of the victims, and \nencourage the Secretary of State to continue to facilitate U.S. \nparticipation with such a DNA database.\n  It would also encourage the Secretary of State to urge the Mexican \ngovernment to ensure fair and proper judicial proceedings for the \nindividuals accused of these abductions and murders, and to impose \nappropriate punishment for those individuals found guilty of such \ncrimes. Additionally, it would condemn the use of torture as a means of \ninvestigation.\n  Lastly, this resolution would condemn all senseless acts of violence \nagainst women across the world and express the solidarity of the people \nof the United States with the people of Mexico in the face of these \ntragic and senseless acts.\n  This problem cannot be ignored. We have the chance to help end the \nsuffering of these innocent families, and I hope that the Senate will \njoin me in supporting this resolution.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 393--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE IN SUPPORT OF \n          UNITED STATES POLICY FOR A MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS\n\n  Mr. FRIST (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Levin, Mr. Nelson of \nFlorida, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Lieberman, Ms. Mikulski, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. \nCorzine, Mr. Lautenberg, and Mr. Voinovich) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 393\n\n       Whereas the Road Map, endorsed by the United States, \n     Israel, the Palestinian Authority, the European Union, \n     Russia, and the United Nations, remains a realistic and \n     widely recognized plan for making progress toward peace;\n       Whereas, on April 14, 2004, President Bush welcomed the \n     plan of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to remove certain \n     military installations and all settlements from Gaza, and \n     certain military installations and settlements from the West \n     Bank;\n       Whereas under the Road Map, Palestinians must undertake an \n     immediate cessation of armed activity and all acts of \n     violence against Israelis anywhere, all Palestinian \n     institutions, organizations, and individuals must end \n     incitement against Israel, the Palestinian leadership must \n     act decisively against terror (including sustained, targeted, \n     and effective operations to stop terrorism and dismantle \n     terrorist capabilities and infrastructure), and Palestinians \n     must undertake a comprehensive and fundamental political \n     reform that includes a strong parliamentary democracy and an \n     empowered prime minister;\n       Whereas Prime Minister Sharon noted Israel's \n     responsibilities under the Road Map include limitations on \n     the growth of settlements, removal of unauthorized outposts, \n     and steps to increase, to the extent permitted by security \n     needs, freedom of movement for Palestinians not engaged in \n     terrorism;\n       Whereas there likely will be no security for Israelis or \n     Palestinians until they and all states join together to fight \n     terrorism and dismantle terrorist organizations;\n       Whereas the United States remains committed to Israel's \n     security, and well-being as a Jewish State, including secure, \n     recognized, and defensible borders, and to preserving and \n     strengthening Israel's capability to deter enemies and defend \n     itself against any threat;\n       Whereas Israel has the right to defend itself against \n     terrorism, including to take actions against terrorist \n     organizations that threaten Israel's citizens;\n       Whereas, after Israel withdraws from Gaza and parts of the \n     West Bank, existing arrangements regarding control of \n     airspace, territorial waters, and land passages relating to \n     the West Bank and Gaza are planned to continue;\n       Whereas, as part of a final peace settlement, Israel must \n     have secure and recognized borders, which should emerge from \n     negotiations between the parties in accordance with United \n     Nations Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338;\n       Whereas, in light of realities on the ground, including \n     already existing major Israeli population centers, it is \n     unrealistic to expect that the outcome of final status \n     negotiations will be a full and complete return to the \n     armistice lines of 1949, but realistic to expect that any \n     final status agreement will only be achieved on the basis of \n     mutually agreed changes that reflect these realities;\n       Whereas Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has stated: \n     ``the barrier being erected by Israel is a security rather \n     than political barrier, is temporary rather than permanent, \n     and should therefore not prejudice any final status issues \n     including final borders, and its route should take into \n     account, consistent with security needs, its impact on \n     Palestinian communities'';\n       Whereas an agreed just, fair, and realistic framework for a \n     solution to the Palestinian refugee issue as part of any \n     final status agreement will need to be found through the \n     establishment of a Palestinian state, and the settling of \n     Palestinian refugees there, rather than in Israel;\n       Whereas the United States supports the establishment of a \n     Palestinian state that is viable, contiguous, sovereign, and \n     independent, so that the Palestinian people can build their \n     own future;\n       Whereas the United States will join with others in the \n     international community to assist in fostering the \n     development of Palestinian democratic political institutions \n     and new leadership committed to those institutions, the \n     reconstruction of civic institutions, the growth of a free \n     and prosperous economy, and the building of capable security \n     institutions dedicated to maintaining law and order and \n     dismantling terrorist organizations; and\n       Whereas in order to promote a lasting peace, all states \n     must oppose terrorism, support the emergence of a peaceful \n     and democratic Palestine, and state clearly that they will \n     live in peace with Israel: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) endorses the above-mentioned principles and practices \n     of United States policy in the Middle East, and ongoing \n     actions to make progress toward realizing the vision of two \n     states living side by side in peace and security, as a real \n     contribution toward peace, and as important steps under the \n     Road Map;\n       (2) reaffirms its commitment to a vision of two states, \n     Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and \n     security as the key to peace; and\n       (3) supports efforts to continue working with others in the \n     international community, to build the capacity and will of \n     Palestinian institutions to fight terrorism, dismantle \n     terrorist organizations, and prevent the areas from which \n     Israel has withdrawn from posing a threat to the security of \n     Israel.\n\n[[Page S7486]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 394--TO AUTHORIZE TESTIMONY AND REPRESENTATION IN \n                 UNITED STATES V.

Res. 396\n\n       Whereas in 1854, the Farmers' High School was founded in \n     Centre County, Pennsylvania in response to the State \n     Agricultural Society's interest in establishing an \n     educational institution to bring general education and modern \n     farming methods to the farmers of the Commonwealth of \n     Pennsylvania;\n       Whereas in 1855, the Farmers' High School was granted a \n     permanent charter by the Pennsylvania General Assembly;\n       Whereas the Morrill Land-Grant Act of 1862 provided for the \n     distribution of grants of public lands owned by the Federal \n     Government to the States for establishing and maintaining \n     institutions of higher learning;\n       Whereas in 1863, the Commonwealth accepted a grant of land \n     provided through such Act, establishing one of the first two \n     land-grant institutions in the United States, and designated \n     the Farmers' High School, renamed the Agricultural College of \n     Pennsylvania, as the Commonwealth's sole land-grant \n     institution;\n       Whereas in 1874, the Agricultural College of Pennsylvania \n     was renamed The Pennsylvania State College and in 1953, such \n     was renamed The Pennsylvania State University;\n       Whereas with a current enrollment of 83,000, The \n     Pennsylvania State University consists of 11 academic \n     schools, 20 additional campuses located throughout the \n     Commonwealth, the College of Medicine, The Dickinson School \n     of Law, and The Pennsylvania College of Technology;\n       Whereas 1 in every 8 Pennsylvanians with a college degree, \n     1 in every 720 Americans, 1 in every 50 engineers, and 1 in \n     every 4 meteorologists are alumni of The Pennsylvania State \n     University;\n       Whereas formed in 1870, The Pennsylvania State University \n     Alumni Association is the largest dues-paying alumni \n     association in the nation;\n       Whereas The Pennsylvania State University has the largest \n     outreach effort in United States higher education, delivering \n     programs to learners in 87 countries and all 50 States;\n       Whereas The Pennsylvania State University consistently \n     ranks in the top 3 universities in terms of SAT scores \n     received from high school seniors;\n       Whereas The Pennsylvania State University annually hosts \n     the largest student-run philanthropic event in the world, \n     which benefits the Four Diamonds Fund for families with \n     children being treated for cancer;\n       Whereas the missions of instruction, research, outreach and \n     extension continue to be the focus of The Pennsylvania State \n     University;\n       Whereas The Pennsylvania State University is renown for the \n     following: the rechargeable heart pacemaker design, the \n     heart-assist pump design, 4 astronauts to have flown in space \n     including the first African-American, and the first \n     institution to offer an Agriculture degree; and\n       Whereas The Pennsylvania State University is one of the \n     most highly regarded research universities in the nation, \n     with an outreach extension program that reaches nearly 1 out \n     of 2 Pennsylvanians a year and an undergraduate school of \n     immense scope and popularity: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate commemorates the 150th \n     anniversary of the founding of The Pennsylvania State \n     University and congratulates its faculty, staff, students, \n     alumni, and friends on the occasion.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 397--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE \n      TRANSITION OF IRAQ TO A CONSTITUTIONALLY ELECTED GOVERNMENT\n\n  Mr. FRIST (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Sessions, Mr. \nLieberman, Mr. Graham of South Carolina, and Mr. Biden) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 397\n\n       Whereas June 30, 2004, marks Iraq's assumption of \n     sovereignty and the beginning of the transition of Iraq to a \n     free and constitutionally elected government, which is to be \n     established by December 31, 2005;\n       Whereas the Senate congratulates the Iraqi people, \n     expresses its appreciation to the Iraqi Interim Government, \n     and reaffirms the United States desire for the people of Iraq \n     to live in peace and freedom;\n       Whereas the successful transition of Iraq to a \n     constitutionally elected government requires that Iraq \n     develop the capacity to provide security to its citizens, \n     defend its borders, deliver essential services, create a \n     transparent and credible political process, and set the \n     conditions for economic prosperity;\n       Whereas the people of Iraq have a long tradition of \n     cultural and technological achievement and a talented and \n     dedicated population;\n       Whereas the United States desires peace and prosperity for \n     the citizens of Iraq;\n       Whereas more than three decades of dictatorial rule have \n     deprived the people of Iraq of the benefits of that tradition \n     and history, caused extraordinary personal suffering, and \n     robbed the people of Iraq of the opportunity to reach their \n     full potential;\n       Whereas establishing security is a prerequisite to the \n     successful transition to democracy and reconstruction of \n     Iraq;\n       Whereas providing security to the people of Iraq will \n     require a well-trained and well-equipped police force, a \n     professional military accountable to civilian leadership, the \n     disbanding of militias, and a fair and efficient judicial \n     system;\n       Whereas the current program to train and equip Iraq \n     security services could benefit from better vetting of \n     candidates, expanded training time, follow-on field training \n     with experienced police and military professionals, and the \n     accelerated provision of equipment and resources;\n\n[[Page S7487]]\n\n       Whereas the administration of the institutions of \n     government and the delivery of essential services in Iraq \n     will require technical expertise and training not yet fully \n     developed in Iraq;\n       Whereas Iraq faces a shortage of essential services, \n     including sanitation, safe water, and a reliable supply of \n     electricity;\n       Whereas economic prosperity in Iraq will require viable \n     financial institutions, conditions that encourage private \n     investment, and the significant reduction of foreign debt \n     incurred by the regime of Saddam Hussein;\n       Whereas the people of Iraq were the victims of three \n     decades of economic mismanagement under the regime of Saddam \n     Hussein, and have inherited $120,000,000,000 in debt incurred \n     by that regime;\n       Whereas Prime Minister Allawi has requested assistance from \n     the international community to aid in the rebuilding and \n     security of Iraq, including assistance from the neighbors of \n     Iraq to improve intelligence-sharing and to tighten controls \n     of the borders with Iraq in order to prevent the infiltration \n     of terrorists and illicit goods, and assistance from the \n     North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to train and equip \n     Iraqi Security Forces;\n       Whereas the international community, through a unanimous \n     vote of the United Nations Security Council in Resolution \n     1546 (2004), called on United Nations member states and \n     international and regional organizations to contribute to a \n     multinational force in Iraq and a dedicated force to provide \n     security for the United Nations presence in Iraq, to help \n     Iraq build the capability of its security forces and \n     governing institutions, to aid in rebuilding the capacity for \n     governance in Iraq, and to commit additional resources to \n     reconstruct and develop the economy of Iraq;\n       Whereas since the adoption of United Nations Security \n     Council Resolution 1546, some members of the international \n     community who have long expressed concern for the plight of \n     the people of Iraq, and who voted for the adoption of the \n     Resolution in the Security Council, have failed to respond to \n     the urgent needs of the people of Iraq;\n       Whereas improved security in Iraq and the increased \n     capacity of the people of Iraq to provide essential services \n     will reduce the burdens on United States military personnel \n     in the region;\n       Whereas the United States supports the determination of the \n     Iraqi Interim Government to defeat the loyalists to Saddam \n     Hussein, radical militias, common criminals, and terrorists \n     who make up the insurgency in Iraq;\n       Whereas the United States is committed to assisting Iraq in \n     reasserting its full sovereignty, consistent with United \n     Nations Security Council Resolution 1546;\n       Whereas the Senate acknowledges the efforts and sacrifices \n     of the Armed Forces, other employees of the United States \n     Government, contractors, and their counterparts in the \n     coalition to promote Iraq's security, recovery, and \n     transition; and\n       Whereas the United States and other members of the \n     international community have a profound stake in the success \n     of the transition of Iraq to a constitutionally elected \n     government: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the members of the Armed Forces and their families have \n     performed courageously and nobly and have earned the deep \n     gratitude of the people of the United States;\n       (2) success in Iraq is a global priority and therefore \n     demands cooperation from all states and international \n     organizations;\n       (3) states and international organizations should fulfill \n     their commitments to contribute what resources and skills \n     they can to the establishment and security of an independent \n     Iraq with a constitutionally elected government;\n       (4) states and international organizations should fulfill \n     the financial commitments they have already made to the \n     reconstruction of Iraq;\n       (5) the international community should establish, to the \n     highest standards, additional police training academies \n     inside and outside of Iraq, contribute additional trainers to \n     those academies, and dedicate experienced police to train \n     Iraq police officers in the field;\n       (6) the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is \n     uniquely qualified to respond to the call for assistance in \n     United Nations Security Council Resolution 1546 (2004) to \n     meet the needs of the people of Iraq for security and \n     stability, including by assisting in training the Iraq \n     military, providing security for elections in Iraq, and \n     helping secure the borders of Iraq and should, therefore, \n     respond positively to the request of Interim Iraqi Prime \n     Minister Allawi to provide training, equipment, and other \n     forms of technical assistance that his government determines \n     is appropriate to help Iraq's security forces defeat \n     terrorism and reduce Iraq's reliance on foreign forces;\n       (7) in order to ensure that the United Nations can play the \n     leading role called for by United Nations Security Council \n     Resolution 1546, member states should contribute additional \n     military and security forces, and other resources as \n     appropriate, to provide security for a United Nations \n     presence in Iraq;\n       (8) countries unable to contribute security personnel to \n     help stabilize Iraq should contribute to the transition of \n     Iraq in other ways, including by providing technical experts, \n     civil engineers, municipal management advisers, and to fill \n     other needs requested by the Iraqi government;\n       (9) countries holding debt incurred under the Saddam \n     Hussein regime should meaningfully reduce amounts of that \n     debt;\n       (10) the United States is committed to a free and peaceful \n     Iraq; and\n       (11) it is appropriate to thank coalition partners and \n     other countries that have helped promote security, stability, \n     reconstruction, and democracy in Iraq.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n     SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 120--PROVIDING FOR A CONDITIONAL \n  ADJOURNMENT OR RECESS OF THE

Con. \nRes. 83, and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the concurrent resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 83) promoting the \n     establishment of a democracy caucus within the United \n     Nations.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their support of \nS. Con. Res. 83, a resolution that I introduced in support of the \nestablishment of a Democracy Caucus within the United Nations. In \nparticular, I thank Senators Lugar, Hagel, Lieberman, and Coleman for \ntheir co-sponsorship of this resolution. I also want to thank Chairman \nLugar for permitting the resolution to come to the floor today.\n  I am pleased that the Bush administration also supports the \nestablishment of a U.N. Democracy Caucus, and that significant progress \nwas made on this front in Geneva at this year's Commission on Human \nRights. In particular, Peru, Romania, East Timor, Poland, Chile, South \nKorea, India and Italy have been very engaged in collaborative \ndemocracy-promotion initiatives. I am encouraged by such joint efforts. \nThe broader the international support for a caucus, the more effective \nit will be.\n  The establishment of a U.N. Democracy Caucus is not merely a project \nsupported by Congress and the State Department. It is also endorsed by \na broad-based coalition of U.S.-based organizations and advocacy groups \nsuch as Freedom House, Human Rights Watch, the American Jewish \nCommittee, the American Bar Association and the Council for Community \nof Democracies. I also thank them for their work and advocacy on this \nissue.\n  The idea of establishing a Democracy Caucus within the United Nations \nmakes extraordinary good sense. The basic principal is this: democratic \nnations share common values, and should work together at the United \nNations to promote those values. We will be more effective in doing so.\n  Working together with like-minded nations in the United Nations and \nother multilateral organizations is a logical and practical way to \nconduct foreign policy. We build coalitions in American politics, in \nlegislatures across the land and here in the Congress. Similarly, we \nshould build coalitions of like-minded states in the United Nations, \nparticularly to bolster global democratic principles, advance human \nrights, and promote international security and stability.\n  The administration has recently re-discovered the virtues of working \nin cooperation with other nations at the United Nations. There we are \njust one nation, though a very powerful one. We only have one vote, \nwhether in the General Assembly or the Security Council. Other \ndemocratic states should be natural allies on many\n\n[[Page S7495]]\n\nissues; a caucus of democracies will facilitate such cooperation. \nForging a coalition of democracies is not merely a statement that \nnations have shared values; it is a hard-headed diplomatic approach. By \njoining forces to make common cause, the democracies can be more \neffective in the U.N. and other world bodies.\n  The unanimous passage of this resolution demonstrates the strong \nsupport of the Senate for the creation of a Democracy Caucus. I hope \nthe Senate's action gives democracy-building efforts in the United \nNations an important boost to this idea. I thank my colleagues within \nand outside the Senate for supporting this resolution.\n  Mr. FRIST.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The concurrent resolution (S. Con.

Res. 83\n\n       Whereas a survey conducted by Freedom House in 2003, \n     entitled ``Freedom in the World'', found that of the 192 \n     governments of nations of the world, 121 (or 63 percent) of \n     such governments have an electoral democracy form of \n     government;\n       Whereas, the Community of Democracies, an association of \n     democratic nations committed to promoting democratic \n     principles and practices, held its First Ministerial \n     Conference in Warsaw, Poland, in June 2000;\n       Whereas, in a speech at that Conference, Kofi Annan, the \n     Secretary-General of the United Nations, stated that ``when \n     the United Nations can truly call itself a community of \n     democracies, the [United Nations] Charter's noble ideals of \n     protecting human rights and promoting `social progress in \n     larger freedoms' will have been brought much closer'', that \n     ``democratically governed states rarely if ever make war on \n     one another'', and that ``in this era of intra-state wars, is \n     the fact that democratic governance--by protecting \n     minorities, encouraging pluralism, and upholding the rule of \n     law--can channel internal dissent peacefully, and thus help \n     avert civil wars'';\n       Whereas a report by an Independent Task Force cosponsored \n     by the Council on Foreign Relations and Freedom House in \n     2002, entitled ``Enhancing U.S. Leadership at the United \n     Nations'', concluded that ``the United States is frequently \n     outmaneuvered and outmatched at the [United Nations]'' \n     because the 115 members of the nonaligned movement \n     ``cooperate on substantive and procedural votes, binding the \n     organization's many democratic nations to the objectives and \n     blocking tactics of its remaining tyrannies'';\n       Whereas, at the First Ministerial Conference of the \n     Community of Democracies, the representatives of the \n     participating governments agreed to ``collaborate on \n     democracy-related issues in existing international and \n     regional institutions, forming coalitions and caucuses to \n     support resolutions and other international activities aimed \n     at the promotion of democratic governance''; and\n       Whereas that agreement was reaffirmed at the Second \n     Ministerial Conference of the Community of Democracies in \n     Seoul, Korea, in November 2002: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring),\n\n     SECTION 1. PROMOTION OF A DEMOCRACY CAUCUS WITHIN THE UNITED \n                   NATIONS.\n\n       Congress urges the President to instruct any representative \n     of the United States to a body of the United Nations to use \n     the voice and vote of the United States to seek to establish \n     a democracy caucus within the United Nations as described in \n     this Resolution.\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSE OF THE DEMOCRACY CAUCUS.\n\n       The purpose of the democracy caucus referred to in section \n     1 should be to advance the interests of the United States and \n     other nations that are committed to promoting democratic \n     norms and practices by--\n       (1) supporting common objectives, including bolstering \n     democracy and democratic principles, advancing human rights, \n     and fighting terrorism in accordance with the rule of law;\n       (2) forging common positions on matters of concern that are \n     brought before the United Nations or any of the bodies of the \n     United Nations;\n       (3) working within and across regional lines to promote the \n     positions of the democracy caucus;\n       (4) encouraging democratic states to assume leadership \n     positions in the bodies of the United Nations; and\n       (5) advocating that states that permit gross violations of \n     human rights, sponsor terrorist activities, or that are the \n     subject of sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security \n     Council are not elected--\n       (A) to leadership positions in the United Nations General \n     Assembly; or\n       (B) to membership or leadership positions in the Commission \n     on Human Rights, the Security Council, or any other body of \n     the United Nations.\n\n     SEC. 3. CRITERIA FOR PARTICIPATION IN THE DEMOCRACY CAUCUS.\n\n       Participation in the democracy caucus referred to in \n     section 1 should be limited to countries that--\n       (1) are qualified to participate in the Community of \n     Democracies, an association of democratic nations committed \n     to promoting democratic principles and practices; and\n       (2) have demonstrated a commitment--\n       (A) to the core democratic principles and practices set out \n     in the Final Warsaw Declaration of the Community of \n     Democracies, adopted at Warsaw June 27, 2000; and\n       (B) to the democratic principles set forth in--\n       (i) the United Nations Charter;\n       (ii) the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; and\n       (iii) the International Covenant on Civil and Political \n     Rights.\n\n     SEC. 4. ANNUAL MEETING.\n\n       The members of the democracy caucus referred to in section \n     1 should hold a ministerial-level meeting at least once each \n     year to coordinate policies and positions of the caucus.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/24/senate-section/article/S7495-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7495-S7496]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                WESTERN SHOSHONE CLAIMS DISTRIBUTION ACT\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 592, H.R. 884.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 884) to provide for the use and distribution \n     of the funds awarded to the Western Shoshone identifiable \n     group under Indian Claims Commission Docket Numbers 326-A-1, \n     326-A-3, and 326-K, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 884) was read the third time and passed.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the legislation just passed has been 30 \nyears in the making. It deals with Shoshone Indians in the State of \nNevada. It is a fund that has grown to about $150 million. Thousands of \nIndians will benefit from this fund.\n  These people live in such desperate straits, many of them. Large \nnumbers are on welfare. The places they live in are very difficult.\n  I want everyone who reads this Record at some subsequent time to know \nthat every entity that is involved with this legislation will receive \nthousands of dollars. They should also know that we are ready, willing, \nand able to meet with each one of them. If they have any problem with \ntheir land claims, we will work with them. This does not shut down any \nof their ability to change in some way, claim anything they had \nrelating to land in the future.\n  I know the time is late, but I must mention Larry Pifero. He is dead. \nHe was on kidney dialysis and died. But he worked so hard on this \nlegislation. Why? Because he wanted his family to wind up with \nsomething. And Larry now should know that his family will wind up with \nsomething. The other person is Nancy Stewart. She has spent months and \nmonths of her life trying to work this out. There were a few \ndissidents--for lack of a better way to describe them--people who \nwanted to do anything they could to upset this settlement. They did \nthings that were wrong, but because 95 percent of the Shoshones in the \nState of Nevada wanted this approval, we had two votes, and they voted \nfor approval.\n  This is so important. Thousands of Indians have waited. Some, like \nLarry Pifero, are gone. They will never receive the benefit of this \nlegislation, only their families will. But the Shoshone Indians of \nNevada are better off today than they were yesterday. They have the \nhope of receiving some economic gain from their dealings with the U.S. \nFederal Government.\n  I am so happy this has been done. This is a big day for thousands of \nNevada Indians.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I very much appreciate the comments of the \ndistinguished assistant minority leader. For me to be able to hear that \nis meaningful. It reminds me also that each piece of legislation we go \nto, we tend to go through quickly, especially\n\n[[Page S7496]]\n\nat a late hour, has such a huge impact. It reflects the beauty in what \nwe are able to accomplish by having the privilege of serving in this \nbody.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/24/senate-section/article/S7496-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7496]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              AFRICAN GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITY ACT EXTENSION\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

The government \nis alleging that Enron in essence parked assets with Merrill Lynch to \nenhance fraudulently Enron's financial statements. This case is being \ntried this summer in Houston.\n  The transactions at the center of this case were the subject of \nextensive investigation and a hearing by the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations of the Committee on Government Affairs during the last \nCongress. In the course of the subcommittee's investigation, \nsubcommittee staff interviewed a Merrill Lynch executive, Robert S. \nFurst, who is now one of the defendants on trial, about these \ntransactions.\n  Last Congress the Senate agreed to Senate Resolution 317, authorizing \nthe Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations to cooperate with requests \nfrom law enforcement agencies for access to subcommittee records from \nits Enron Investigation.

Res. 397) expressing the sense of the \n     Senate on the transition of Iraq to a constitutionally \n     elected government.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and any statements relating to this resolution be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 397) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 397\n\n       Whereas June 30, 2004, marks Iraq's assumption of \n     sovereignty and the beginning of the transition of Iraq to a \n     free and constitutionally elected government, which is to be \n     established by December 31, 2005;\n       Whereas the Senate congratulates the Iraqi people, \n     expresses its appreciation to the Iraqi Interim Government, \n     and reaffirms the United States desire for the people of Iraq \n     to live in peace and freedom;\n       Whereas the successful transition of Iraq to a \n     constitutionally elected government requires that Iraq \n     develop the capacity to provide security to its citizens, \n     defend its borders, deliver essential services, create a \n     transparent and credible political process, and set the \n     conditions for economic prosperity;\n       Whereas the people of Iraq have a long tradition of \n     cultural and technological achievement and a talented and \n     dedicated population;\n       Whereas the United States desires peace and prosperity for \n     the citizens of Iraq;\n       Whereas more than three decades of dictatorial rule have \n     deprived the people of Iraq of the benefits of that tradition \n     and history, caused extraordinary personal suffering, and \n     robbed the people of Iraq of the opportunity to reach their \n     full potential;\n       Whereas establishing security is a prerequisite to the \n     successful transition to democracy and reconstruction of \n     Iraq;\n       Whereas providing security to the people of Iraq will \n     require a well-trained and well-equipped police force, a \n     professional military accountable to civilian leadership, the \n     disbanding of militias, and a fair and efficient judicial \n     system;\n       Whereas the current program to train and equip Iraq \n     security services could benefit from better vetting of \n     candidates, expanded training time, follow-on field training \n     with experienced police and military professionals, and the \n     accelerated provision of equipment and resources;\n       Whereas the administration of the institutions of \n     government and the delivery of essential services in Iraq \n     will require technical expertise and training not yet fully \n     developed in Iraq;\n       Whereas Iraq faces a shortage of essential services, \n     including sanitation, safe water, and a reliable supply of \n     electricity;\n       Whereas economic prosperity in Iraq will require viable \n     financial institutions, conditions that encourage private \n     investment, and the significant reduction of foreign debt \n     incurred by the regime of Saddam Hussein;\n       Whereas the people of Iraq were the victims of three \n     decades of economic mismanagement under the regime of Saddam \n     Hussein, and have inherited $120,000,000,000 in debt incurred \n     by that regime;\n       Whereas Prime Minister Allawi has requested assistance from \n     the international community to aid in the rebuilding and \n     security of Iraq, including assistance from the neighbors of \n     Iraq to improve intelligence-sharing and to tighten controls \n     of the borders with Iraq in order to prevent the infiltration \n     of terrorists and illicit goods, and assistance from the \n     North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to train and equip \n     Iraqi Security Forces;\n       Whereas the international community, through a unanimous \n     vote of the United Nations Security Council in Resolution \n     1546 (2004), called on United Nations member states and \n     international and regional organizations to contribute to a \n     multinational force in Iraq and a dedicated force to provide \n     security for the United Nations presence in Iraq, to help \n     Iraq build the capability of its security forces and \n     governing institutions, to aid in rebuilding the capacity for \n     governance in Iraq, and to commit additional resources to \n     reconstruct and develop the economy of Iraq;\n       Whereas since the adoption of United Nations Security \n     Council Resolution 1546, some members of the international \n     community who have long expressed concern for the plight of \n     the people of Iraq, and who voted for the adoption of the \n     Resolution in the Security Council, have failed to respond to \n     the urgent needs of the people of Iraq;\n       Whereas improved security in Iraq and the increased \n     capacity of the people of Iraq to provide essential services \n     will reduce the burdens on United States military personnel \n     in the region;\n       Whereas the United States supports the determination of the \n     Iraqi Interim Government to defeat the loyalists to Saddam \n     Hussein, radical militias, common criminals, and terrorists \n     who make up the insurgency in Iraq;\n       Whereas the United States is committed to assisting Iraq in \n     reasserting its full sovereignty, consistent with United \n     Nations Security Council Resolution 1546;\n       Whereas the Senate acknowledges the efforts and sacrifices \n     of the Armed Forces, other employees of the United States \n     Government, contractors, and their counterparts in the \n     coalition to promote Iraq's security, recovery, and \n     transition; and\n       Whereas the United States and other members of the \n     international community have a profound stake in the success \n     of the transition of Iraq to a constitutionally elected \n     government: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the members of the Armed Forces and their families have \n     performed courageously and nobly and have earned the deep \n     gratitude of the people of the United States;\n       (2) success in Iraq is a global priority and therefore \n     demands cooperation from all states and international \n     organizations;\n       (3) states and international organizations should fulfill \n     their commitments to contribute what resources and skills \n     they can to the establishment and security of an independent \n     Iraq with a constitutionally elected government;\n       (4) states and international organizations should fulfill \n     the financial commitments they have already made to the \n     reconstruction of Iraq;\n       (5) the international community should establish, to the \n     highest standards, additional police training academies \n     inside and outside of Iraq, contribute additional trainers to \n     those academies, and dedicate experienced police to train \n     Iraq police officers in the field;\n       (6) the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is \n     uniquely qualified to respond to the call for assistance in \n     United Nations Security Council Resolution 1546 (2004) to \n     meet the needs of the people of Iraq for security and \n     stability, including by assisting in training the Iraq \n     military, providing security for elections in Iraq, and \n     helping secure the borders of Iraq and should, therefore, \n     respond positively to the request of Interim Iraqi Prime \n     Minister Allawi to provide training, equipment, and other \n     forms of technical assistance that his government determines \n     is appropriate to help Iraq's security forces defeat \n     terrorism and reduce Iraq's reliance on foreign forces;\n       (7) in order to ensure that the United Nations can play the \n     leading role called for by United Nations Security Council \n     Resolution 1546, member states should contribute additional \n     military and security forces, and other resources as \n     appropriate, to provide security for a United Nations \n     presence in Iraq;\n       (8) countries unable to contribute security personnel to \n     help stabilize Iraq should contribute to the transition of \n     Iraq in other ways, including by providing technical experts, \n     civil engineers, municipal management advisers, and to fill \n     other needs requested by the Iraqi government;\n       (9) countries holding debt incurred under the Saddam \n     Hussein regime should meaningfully reduce amounts of that \n     debt;\n       (10) the United States is committed to a free and peaceful \n     Iraq; and\n       (11) it is appropriate to thank coalition partners and \n     other countries that have helped promote security, stability, \n     reconstruction, and democracy in Iraq.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I do want to make a very brief statement on \nthis resolution submitted by Senator Daschle and myself expressing the \nsense of the Senate on the transition of Iraq to a constitutionally \nelected government.\n  This resolution does a number of things. I will mention a couple. \nFirst, it congratulates Iraq on its transition to a free and \nconstitutionally elected government. All of this is in reference to \nIraq's assumption of full sovereignty on June 30, which will occur \nwhile we are on recess, and its transition to democracy in the months \nahead.\n  Secondly, it expresses the Senate's appreciation for the service, \ncourage, and commitment of the Iraqi interim government to a free and a \ndemocratic Iraq. It commends all members of the U.S. Armed Forces and \ntheir families for their noble and courageous service in this cause. It \naffirms that success in Iraq is a global priority that demands \ncooperation from all States and international organizations. It calls \non the international community to assist Iraq in the training of police \nand security forces. It calls on NATO to respond positively to Iraqi \nPrime Minister Allawi's request of NATO to assist Iraq in the training \nand equipping of Iraq security forces. It urges countries that cannot \nprovide security forces or similar resources to assist Iraq in other \nways such as providing financial assistance or forgiving Iraq's debt.\n  The resolution thanks the U.S. coalition partners and other countries \nthat\n\n[[Page S7499]]\n\nhave joined us in Iraq for their efforts in promoting Iraq's security, \nstability, reconstruction, and transition to democracy.\n  In particular, I also thank Senator Sessions for originating the idea \nof this resolution and for turning it into real language for his \ncolleagues to consider. He initially proposed such a resolution that \nprovided certain language. At that time, he was working in a bipartisan \nmanner with Senator Lieberman and other Members of both sides of the \naisle on this bipartisan resolution. He later joined with Senators \nLindsey Graham, Joe Biden, Tom Daschle, and myself--most of us have \nactually been in Iraq recently--to hammer out a resolution that not \nonly celebrates the liberation of Iraq and its transition to full \nsovereignty but also prescribes a number of steps that should be taken \nin the coming months to ensure those fruits of our efforts are \nrealized.\n  I thank Senator Daschle and his colleagues for their help in fine-\ntuning this resolution so the entire Senate can endorse it. It is a \ngood resolution. The importance of its passage I do not think can be \nunderscored given the fact we are about a week before Iraq's transition \nto full sovereignty. It sends a timely message, the right message, of \nthanks to our coalition partners and our support to the Iraqi interim \ngovernment and the Iraqi people who are endeavoring to defeat terrorism \nand secure the blessings of democracy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. If the distinguished majority leader will yield, following \nthe meeting with the President this morning, which I had the good \nfortune of being able to attend, the one message that came out of the \nmeeting to me is that the hero today in Iraq is the Prime Minister of \nIraq. He is a man of great courage who has had a number of \nassassination attempts on his life, even when he did not live in Iraq, \nbecause of the people who were trying to get rid of him, and I wish him \nwell. He is a man of courage. To take on this responsibility knowing \nthat the evil forces that are in that country are out to dispense with \nhim says a lot about the kind of man he is.\n  Speaking personally of the meeting at the White House this morning, I \nrepeat the one thing that came out of that meeting today is the \nforceful nature of the man who is leading that country as of next \nWednesday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. I will just add to the comments of my friend from Nevada \nthat I had the opportunity to meet with the Prime Minister a little \nover 2 weeks ago when we were in Baghdad.\n  I know Senator Daschle and Senator Biden and Senator Graham also had \nthe opportunity to meet with the Prime Minister on their recent trip. I \nmention that because 4 weeks ago nobody knew that he was going to be \nPrime Minister. In fact, he didn't know. It was not a position that he \nhad asked for. The interim government, through this selection process, \nasked him to step forward, and he did just that. Uniformly, the people \nwho met him and who have talked with him since he has assumed this \nposition have been impressed with his courage, his determination, and \nhis understanding of the role that is before him.\n  I should also add the distinguished assistant Democratic leader and I \nhad the opportunity to meet with the President of Iraq who will be \nworking with the Prime Minister. He, too, is very impressive in terms \nof his leadership and his vision, and the boldness we know is going to \nbe required.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/24/senate-section/article/S7499-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7499]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  GAO HUMAN CAPITAL REFORM ACT OF 2004\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I again congratulate Chairman Stevens and \nSenator Inouye on completing the first appropriations bill of the year. \nThe record will show, I am sure, the time spent on this bill was one of \nthe fastest, if not the fastest ever, that a Defense Appropriations \nCommittee bill has been considered in the U.S. Senate.\n  We have to understand that it was only on Tuesday morning of this \nweek that the Subcommittee on Defense reported the bill, and the full \ncommittee reported it out that afternoon. Here we are on Thursday night \nhaving completed this very important, critical bill.\n  I am sure this marathon would not have been possible without the \nexcellent cooperation of many Senators and the terrific work of the \nDefense appropriations staff, under the leadership of Sid Ashworth for \nthe majority and Charlie Houy for the minority.\n  I am also particularly happy that conferees on this important bill \nhave been appointed and that hopefully shortly after the recess that \nconference can also be completed in record time so critical funds can \nbe made available to our service men and women around the globe, \nfighting and standing guard to protect our freedoms and securities.\n  Also, I thank the chairman and Senator Inouye for including today \ncritical funding for humanitarian assistance in the Sudan. We simply \ncan not stand by idly as half a million people are uprooted and forced \nto flee the Darfur region while also suffering unbelievable starvation, \nhunger, and murder from Sudan, government-backed Arab militias.\n  The funding we have provided today will go to USAID to assist these \nrefugees but of course a political solution needs to found also for \nthis part of our world.\n  Again, I thank Chairman Stevens and Senator Inouye for their hard \nwork today.\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}]
