We \nbegin this session with the question You asked King Solomon, ``Ask! \nWhat shall I give You?'' We empathize with Solomon's answer. He asked \nfor an ``understanding heart.'' We are moved with a more precise \ntranslation of the Hebrew words for ``understanding heart,'' meaning a \n``hearing heart.''\n  Solomon wanted to hear a word from You about the perplexities that he \nfaced. He longed for the gift of wisdom so that he could have answers \nand direction for his people. We are inspired by Your response, ``See, \nI have given you a wise and listening heart.''\n  I pray nothing less as You answer this urgent prayer for the women \nand men of this Senate. Help them to listen to Your guidance and grant \nthem wisdom for their debates and decisions. All through our history as \na Nation You have made good men and women great when they humbled \nthemselves, confessed their need for Your wisdom, and listened intently \nto You. Speak Lord; we need to hear Your voice in the cacophony of \nother voices. We are listening. You are our Lord and Saviour. Amen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/12/senate-section/article/S3559-3", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3559]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE\n\n  The Honorable Ted Stevens led the Pledge of Allegiance, as follows:\n\n       I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of \n     America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation \n     under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/12/senate-section/article/S3559-4", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3559]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback).

Mr. President, this morning the Senate will resume \nconsideration of the partial-birth abortion bill. We had a good and \nvigorous debate last night and all day yesterday and made substantial \nprogress on the bill. I appreciate Senators' willingness to come \nforward and debate this measure. In fact, I encourage Members who have \nnot made opening statements and want to speak on this legislation to \ncome to the floor today. We are moving expeditiously. We got a good \nunanimous consent agreement yesterday that calls for votes later this \nmorning, perhaps at the latest early this afternoon.\n  My understanding is we have, beyond the two amendments that are \nlocked in right now, two additional amendments that could be offered \nthis afternoon. There may not be any other amendments. I want to make \nsure Members know there is a chance we could end up even finishing \ntoday. If Members are waiting, thinking they have plenty of time to \ncome down and speak on the underlying bill, I encourage them to come \ndown. We will be debating two amendments this morning. Senator Boxer's \namendment will be up first. Actually, it is not an amendment but a \nmotion to commit the bill to the Judiciary Committee. There will be 2 \nhours of debate, equally divided, on that motion, which we will proceed \nto momentarily, and subsequent to that debate we will have an hour \ndebate on the Durbin amendment. All of that time is equally divided. \nThen we will proceed to votes on both of those amendments.\n  If all time is used, we will have votes at roughly 12:30 this \nafternoon, if not earlier.\n  As I said, there are two other amendments of which we are aware that \ncould be offered this afternoon. I encourage Members who wish to \nparticipate in this debate to please come to the floor and do so this \nmorning or this afternoon.\n\n  I remind my colleagues that a cloture motion was filed on the Estrada \nnomination yesterday by our leader, and that motion will ripen tomorrow \nmorning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, through the acting majority leader I say to \nthe majority leader, we believe we have the ability to finish this \nlegislation very quickly. Anyone who wants to offer an amendment should \nget with floor staff forthwith because we are in the process of \npropounding a unanimous consent request to terminate this legislation. \nIf people have amendments they want to offer, they should advise floor \nstaff forthwith.\n  Also, we were able to work out yesterday, following the dialog I had \nwith the majority leader on the floor, with Senator Daschle and people \non our side to allow one of the circuit court nominees to go forward \nwith debate, with up to 6 hours debate. Hopefully, we can complete that \ntomorrow also.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, because the Senator from \nCalifornia has requested that the time on her amendment be the full 2 \nhours, and Senator Santorum and I have taken a little bit of time this \nmorning--I ask that be the order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/12/senate-section/article/S3559-6", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3559]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senator from \nCalifornia, Mrs. Boxer, is to be recognized.\n  Under the previous order, there will now be up to 2 hours of debate \nequally divided on the motion to commit. The Senator from California.\n\n\n                            Motion to Commit\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I send a motion to the desk, and I ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer] moves to commit \n     the bill, S. 3, to the Committee on the Judiciary with \n     instructions to hold at least one hearing on such bill and to \n     report such bill back to the Senate after addressing the \n     constitutional issues raised by the Supreme Court in its \n     Stenberg v. Carhart decision.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this straightforward motion essentially \nsays it is important that this bill receive the guidance and the wisdom \nof the Judiciary Committee, since issues have been raised at the \nSupreme Court that have not been addressed in this bill.\n  When I raised this in the beginning of the debate, a Senator on the \nother side said: We have debated this many times. Why do you want to go \nback to the committee?\n  Well, there is a big difference between the three previous occasions \nthat we have debated this bill and this time, and that is, the Supreme \nCourt has spoken. In June 2000, in the case of Stenberg v. Carhart, the \nSupreme Court ruled Nebraska's so-called partial-birth abortion law is \nunconstitutional. I am told very clearly by the lawyers who were \ninvolved in that case that the current bill before us, S. 3, is legally \nidentical to the Nebraska bill.\n  The Supreme Court ruled that bill unconstitutional for two reasons. I \nwould like to see the chart there. First, the bill contains no health \nexception. This is what the Supreme Court said:\n\n       The governing standard requires an exception where it is \n     necessary in the appropriate medical judgment for the \n     preservation of the life or health of the mother. Our cases \n     repeatedly invalidated statutes that, in the process of \n     regulating the methods of abortion, imposed significant \n     health risks.\n\n  Mr. President, this bill contains no health exceptions. I am very \npleased Senator Durbin will be offering a health exception today, as \nwell as Senator Feinstein later, and there may be others. But the \nbottom line is the bill itself, as it stands, contains no health \nexception. It makes it unconstitutional.\n  The second reason the legally identical bill was declared \nunconstitutional by the Supreme Court is that it imposed an undue \nburden on women because the definition in the law is too vague. It \ncovers more than one procedure. This is what the Supreme Court said:\n\n       Even if the statute's basic aim is to ban D\n\n  By the way, there is no such mention of D in S. 3.\n\n     its language makes clear that it also covers a much broader \n     category of procedures.\n\n  Therefore, it is putting an undue burden on the woman, Mr. President. \nWith the Supreme Court's decision, we should at least have a bill \nbefore us that will pass constitutional muster.\n  If I may see the other chart that summarizes the two.\n  Here you see the summary of the problems with S. 3. Exactly the same \nas Stenberg: Undue burden on women because the definition is vague, and \nno exception to protect women's health.\n  I believe we have a responsibility to make sure this bill is \nconstitutional, and I would think that those of my colleagues who \nsupport this bill, even without a health exception, which I think is \ncruel to a woman and I think goes against the American value of caring \nabout mothers and caring about their health--even if you support that, \nwithout a health exception, you ought to care about this being \nconstitutional. It should be our responsibility because what is the \npoint of all this--the President said he is going to sign it--if, in \nfact, the Court turns around and says it is the same problem all over \nagain?\n  You hear from others that this problem has been remedied and we have \ntaken care of this in the findings, and they are tweaking some of the \nwords, but the people who argued this law the last time said that \nclearly it is legally identical. I placed those letters in the Record, \nand I will read from them again.\n\n  So we are spending time on the bill that experts tell us is \nunconstitutional. Yet we have so many other matters we should be \naddressing. If we want to address this bill, at least send it to the \nJudiciary Committee so that when it comes back, they will have looked \nat this question of constitutionality. In the meantime, we are not \nlooking at the loss of jobs in this country.\n  Yesterday, my colleagues on the other side voted down health \ninsurance for poor, pregnant women--the ability for women to have \ncontraceptives so they would avoid unintended pregnancies. Oh, this is \namazing to me. These are the issues people confront every single day.\n  So we have 14 pages of findings that basically say the Supreme Court \nfound this, found that, and we find this, we find that; therefore, \nessentially, what we are doing is constitutional. It is amazing to me \nthe authors of this bill would bypass the committee their own party \ncontrols and bring this bill straight to the floor without stopping in \nthe committee of jurisdiction after the Court has very clearly spoken \nthat this S. 3--because it is identical to Stenberg in a legal sense--\nis unconstitutional. No health exception. How can anyone who has ever \nread the Stenberg case or, for that matter, case law regarding \nabortions since many years ago, argue that if you don't have a health \nexception, you are meeting the constitutional standard?\n  I guess the Justices have felt all these years that a woman's health \nis important, and I guess some people in this body don't feel that way. \nThat is your choice. But it is not constitutional. I think a hearing \nwould be salutary. We could hear from the scholars, hear from the \npeople who were involved in the Stenberg case. We could once again hear \nfrom the women who have gone through this procedure, many of whom I \nhave shown you on the floor of the Senate. They call themselves very \nreligious, very pro-life. Yet they chose to have a procedure that their \ndoctors told them was necessary to preserve their fertility, to make \nsure they would not wind up being paralyzed.\n  I am looking forward to Senator Durbin's amendment. I want to hear \npeople argue against Senator Durbin's amendment when he spells out the \nhealth impact that could occur to a woman if this type of procedure is \nnot available to her. We have a committee system and it ought to be \nused. I want to let the Senate know that this idea of taking a bill to \ncommittee is certainly not a new idea.\n  Let's see what some of the Republican leaders said about sending \nbills to committee. This is March 6, 2002. This is Senator Don Nickles \non bringing a bill directly to the floor and bypassing the committee, \nwhich is exactly what is happening today. This bill bypassed the \ncommittee of jurisdiction, the Judiciary Committee, and was brought to \nthe floor. Let's hear what Senator Nickles said:\n\n       Where is the committee report? One of the reasons we have \n     markups in committees is to have everybody on the committee \n     who has expertise on the issue to have input, to support it \n     or oppose it--to issue a committee report so we can find out \n     what is in it, so you can read what is in it in English, not \n     just the legislative language, which is difficult to \n     decipher. Our competent and capable staff prepare a committee \n     report explaining in English, here is what this provision \n     does, here is what this provision means.\n\n  This is why it is important to send bills to committee, particularly \non a subject the Supreme Court has taken up and has found terrible \nproblems, constitutional problems, with a similar, if not legally \nidentical, bill.\n  Let's look at what else has been said. This is another statement by \nSenator Nickles on bringing a bill directly to the floor and bypassing \nthe committee:\n\n       I think that bypassing the committee and bringing a bill \n     directly to the floor is a violation of Senate protocol--\n     spirit, basically\n\n[[Page S3561]]\n\n     telling the minority they don't matter. It doesn't make any \n     difference if there are 49 members on the Republican side, \n     you don't matter; you have no input.\n\n  I think this is quite amazing. And we have more statements as to why \nbills should go to committee by the Republicans who have bypassed \ncommittees just a year later--not even a year later.\n  Senator Frank Murkowski, now Governor of Alaska. He said this on \nbringing a bill directly to the floor and bypassing a committee:\n\n       The question is, why in the normal course of events would a \n     bill under the jurisdiction of the committee not be referred \n     to that committee? To suggest that there is an effort to \n     obstruct the process by giving members input on the bill \n     through the normal process of amendments is a travesty of the \n     process associated with the traditions of the Senate.\n\n  That was February 5, 2002.\n  That is a statement of Senator Murkowski, Republican, now Governor of \nAlaska. ``It is a travesty of the process to bypass a committee.'' And \nthis is about a bill that has, by the way, no constitutional problem as \nfar as anyone knew, and here we are talking about a bill that comes out \nafter a Supreme Court case and acting as if it never happened, in my \nview, because the operative language of the bill still does not meet \nthe constitutional challenges laid out by the Court.\n  This is another statement on bringing a bill directly to the floor \nand bypassing the committee, by Senator Nickles:\n\n       I am very disappointed in this process. This process should \n     not be repeated. It should not be repeated by Democrats or \n     Republicans.\n\n  Let me say that again:\n\n       This process should not be repeated by Democrats or \n     Republicans. We have committees for a purpose. We have \n     committees for a purpose: So we can have bipartisan input, so \n     we can have the legislative process work, so we can have \n     hearings on legislation so people can know what they are \n     voting on, to where they can try to improve it, to where any \n     member of the committee has an opportunity to read the bill \n     and to amend it, to change it--win or lose, at least they \n     have the opportunity to try.\n\n  We have a bill before us that should have gone to the Judiciary \nCommittee. Senator Trent Lott's comments on bringing a bill directly to \nthe floor and bypassing the committee:\n\n       If we bring these important issues to the Senate floor \n     without them having been worked through committee, it is a \n     prescription for a real problem.\n\n  What do we have? A bill that never went through the committee, a \nchanged bill that never had a hearing at Judiciary, about a subject \nthat is as important as life and death. Unbelievable.\n  So my motion to commit this bill to the committee--where, by the way, \nthe Republicans have control--is a proposal that is not partisan and \nthat is sincere because I believe, with all the problems we have in the \nworld, the last thing we need to do is pass a bill that is \nunconstitutional and then have it brought back again, where we have to \nstart all over, we have to have pictures that some of my constituents \ntold me they could not even look at.\n  The Supreme Court said you must have a health exception:\n\n       The governing standard requires an exception where it is \n     necessary, in the appropriate medical judgment for the \n     preservation of the life or health of the mother.\n\n  My colleagues want to put themselves in the doctor's shoes and decide \nthey know what is best in an operating room. They know. They may not \nhave gone to medical school, but they know.\n  The Supreme Court wrote:\n\n       Our cases have repeatedly invalidated statutes that, in the \n     process of regulating the methods of abortion, imposed \n     significant health risks [to the mother].\n\n  The Supreme Court wrote:\n\n       Even if the statute's basic aim is to ban D, its language \n     makes it clear it also covers a much broader category of \n     procedures.\n\n  What I have presented in my opening statement is the following: We \nhave a bill that deals with a subject of life and death. We have a bill \nthat, if it passes, makes no exception for the health of the mother. We \nhave a bill that legal experts say is legally identical to the law that \nwas ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.\n  We have a bill that affects real people. We heard their cases, and we \nwill hear them more when Senator Durbin presents his amendment. At a \nminimum, could we have a little humility and send a bill such as that \nto the appropriate committee? Could we have a little humility? Could we \nbe a little humble?\n  Senators are playing doctor, and that is wrong. Senators are ignoring \na Supreme Court decision that says there must be an exception for the \nhealth of the mother. That is wrong.\n  My mother always said to me, there is right and there is wrong. You \nshould be humble, and you should care about other people. Those are the \nvalues I grew up with.\n  As a mother of two children, having had two premature babies and, \nthank God--in those years it was not easy--they made it, with God's \nhelp, and as a grandmother who saw a daughter have a very challenging \npregnancy, I know these things do not always go smoothly. And I know, \nbecause I have lived long enough to know, that if a doctor says to a \nmother or a father of a daughter or a husband of a daughter or family \nmembers of a woman, she could have a hemorrhage and die if we do not \nuse this procedure, she could have a uterine rupture, she could be made \ninfertile, she could have a blood clot, she could have an embolism, she \ncould have a stroke, she could have damage to her nearby organs and she \ncould be paralyzed for life if she does not have a procedure, it is a \nvery serious matter.\n  This is not a list that was made up by anyone. It comes from \nphysicians. I have the letter, and I have placed it in the Record. \nThere are other things, such as a coma, that I did not put on the list.\n  I am saying to my colleagues, be a little humble. At the minimum, \nsend this bill to the committee. Have these doctors come forward. \nCreate a health exception that is fair. Do not give us a bill with no \nhealth exception because that is cruel, it is wrong, and it goes \nagainst American values of caring about each other.\n  I hope we will have a good vote and that this bill, S. 3, will go to \nthe Judiciary Committee. Senator Santorum can appear before them. He \ncan tell them why he believes he has met the Supreme Court case, the \nchallenges that were laid down in Stenberg. I could be there, Senator \nFeinstein, other colleagues who feel another way. We could present our \nwitnesses, we could talk about it, and then the committee could decide \nwhich way to go on it.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Is the Senator from California saying that no matter how \none feels on the underlying issue, we would be better off as a Senate \nif it went back to the full committee for a hearing and they had \nwitnesses come and testify before the committee, those who are in favor \nof the procedure, those who are against the procedure, and then bring \nthe bill back to the floor? Is that what the Senator is saying should \nhappen?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes. In addition, I say to my friend, have the lawyers \nwho are familiar with the Stenberg case.\n  This chart shows the differences between this bill and the Stenberg \ncase in terms of the legalese. Basically, they are identical. What we \nhave is the Stenberg case that ruled that the Nebraska statute was \nunconstitutional because it placed an undue burden on women because the \ndefinition is vague and there is no exception to protect women's \nhealth.\n  Lawyers and constitutional experts tell us that the same problem \nexists in S. 3. So my friend is right. We would bring the legal people \ntogether. We would bring the women back. We could have another debate \nand then, regardless of how one feels--and I know the Senator and I may \ncome down differently on this in the end--that is fine. I do not expect \nmy position to prevail, let's be clear. But I think the Senate should, \nat the minimum, have the humility to hold a hearing and find out how \nthey ought to draft this bill.\n\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Absolutely.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator and I came to Washington to serve in Congress \nat the same time. We were elected the same year, 1982. Is it true that \nduring the Senator's service in the House of Representatives, she sat \nthrough hundreds of hearings on a multitude of issues? Is that a fair \nstatement?\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. What, I say for the people who are watching this, would the \nSenator say as to why we have those hearings?\n\n[[Page S3562]]\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Clearly, we are trying to get an in-depth knowledge of \nthe issues and the challenges. We want to make sure the bills we \npresent to the full Senate, or the full House on the other side, are \ncarefully thought out; they make sense; there are no unintended \nconsequences that could occur. It is for all of those reasons. Of \ncourse, it becomes a place for the public to get involved, because \nright now--Senator Frist, who is a doctor, his expertise is heart \nsurgery and transplantation--we do not have anyone in the Senate who is \nan OB/GYN.\n  The other point I want to make while my colleague is in the Chamber, \nin addition to the fact that there is no health exception, is to bring \nout one of the things Senator Nickles said last year about bypassing \nthe committee.\n  This is a statement made by Don Nickles when a bill bypassed the \ncommittee of jurisdiction and came straight to the floor. He said:\n\n       I am very disappointed in this process. This process should \n     not be repeated. It should not be repeated by Democrats or \n     Republicans. We have committees for a purpose. We have \n     committees for a purpose: So we can have bipartisan input, so \n     we can have the legislative process work, so we can have \n     hearings on legislation so people can know what they are \n     voting on, to where they can try to improve it, to where any \n     member of the committee has an opportunity to read the bill \n     and to amend it, to change it--win or lose, at least they \n     have the opportunity to try.\n\n  That goes directly to my friend's question about why we have \ncommittees and what their purposes are.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is asking in this motion filed to recommit this \nbill to the committee, basically what the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee said last year, that this should be referred back to \ncommittee because this bill has not had a committee hearing before it \ncame here, and after the Supreme Court decision, so that people who are \ninvolved or have some questions about the legislation can do as Senator \nNickles said, try to improve it, have an opportunity to amend it, \nchange it. Win or lose, at least have the opportunity to try.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes. This is not a motion to recommit; it is a motion to \ncommit.\n  Senator Lott said, on bringing the bill to the floor and bypassing \nthe committee:\n\n       If we bring these important issues to the Senate floor \n     without them having been worked through committee, it is a \n     prescription for a real problem.\n\n  I say to my friend, Senator Reid, you may be interested in this \nstatement of Senator Murkowski:\n\n       The question is, why in the normal course of events would a \n     bill under the jurisdiction of the committee not be referred \n     to that committee? To suggest that there is an effort to \n     obstruct the process by giving Members input on the bill \n     through the normal process of amendments is a travesty of the \n     process associated with the traditions of the Senate.\n\n  It is very unusual for me to bring out statements made by the other \nparty when arguing for a position. I am not saying it any more \neloquently than they said it.\n  I say to my friend, our assistant Democratic leader, what they are \nreferring to is the energy bill. That never really had a constitutional \nquestion. We have here a situation where we have the Supreme Court \nruling on a legally identical bill that this is unconstitutional.\n  I hope we will have support. I look forward to the remainder of the \ndebate. I also look forward to Senator Durbin's presentation on making \nsure we get a health exception. I hope colleagues will support that. \nThat is what they ought to do if they really care about families and \nwomen and women's health, and we can move on, complete this bill, and \nhave it, hopefully, committed to the Judiciary Committee where they can \nlook at the constitutional questions and call on the doctors, have a \ngood debate, and bring this back to the floor having had the benefit of \nthe wisdom of the members of the Judiciary Committee, both Democratic \nand Republican.\n  I retain the remainder of my time and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). The Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, to comment directly on the Senator's \nmotion to recommit, she cites statements by Members of the Republican \nleadership concerning the practice last session of repeatedly bringing \nbills to the floor without having gone through committee. The bills we \nwere referring to included a comprehensive energy bill, a bill about \nthat thick, and the agriculture reauthorization, which was another \nrather thick and complicated piece of legislation, all brand-new \nmaterial. The prescription drug plan, roughly $300 to $400 million in \nnew Government spending, and a brand-new entitlement, never went \nthrough committee. And a whole host of other pieces of legislation. We \nare talking about major, complex, lengthy, pieces of legislation.\n  The corporate responsibility bill was dramatically changed and a \nwhole list of others that came to this floor. Members were justifiably \nconcerned that these rather extensive and expensive and complex pieces \nof legislation should have had some review at the committee level.\n  None of these measures, prior to their being placed on the floor of \nthe Senate, had been on the floor of the Senate before, had not had any \nkind of consideration in any body.\n  Compare that to the legislation before the Senate. The legislation \nbefore the Senate is the same subject matter we have debated on the \nfloor on four previous occasions. There have been two extensive \nJudiciary Committee hearings on this piece of legislation and there has \nbeen wide discussion both on the floor and off the floor about this \nparticular procedure.\n  The Senator from California argues we should have this bill go before \nthe Judiciary Committee now because it is a changed bill. These are her \nwords: ``It's a changed bill.'' Earlier in her discussion she said this \nbill does not meet constitutional muster because it is identical to the \nbill we passed previously. So if it is identical, how can it be \nchanged? If it is identical, why do we have to go back? If it is not \nidentical, you can at least make the point we need to go back.\n  I make the argument the underlying issue we are dealing with here, \nthe issue of banning this procedure, has not changed at all. Some of \nthe legislative language has changed, but the Senate floor is \neventually going to handle this issue anyway and is perfectly competent \nto review this legal language and make a determination on their own as \nto whether they believe this meets the constitutional standard as set \nforth in the Carhart decision. I don't believe it is hard. There is a \nunique expertise within the Judiciary Committee to deal with something \nthat eventually we have to deal with on the floor. There is a lot of \ninformation written about this subject area, and it has been fully and \nopenly debated on the Senate floor.\n  It is a very narrow issue. This is not a Medicare prescription drug \nplan. This is not a comprehensive energy strategy. This is not an \nagriculture reauthorization bill. This is not a corporate \nresponsibility bill. This is a very narrow single issue. We are talking \nabout the difference in this case between maybe 20 or 30 words. I don't \nthink we need a Judiciary Committee hearing and markup for 20 or 30 \nwords on a bill we have debated four times on the floor of the Senate. \nWe are perfectly capable of handling it.\n\n  That leads me to the second issue, which is the issue of \nconstitutionality the Senator from California brings up as a reason to \ncommit this legislation back to committee.\n  Let me address those issues. First, the issue of vagueness. The \nSenator from California quotes the U.S. Supreme Court in saying, ``its \nlanguage makes clear''--its language being the bill's language in \nNebraska--``that it also covers a much broader category of \nprocedures.'' As a result of that, the possibility with the language in \nthe Nebraska statute covering procedures other than partial-birth \nabortion, the Court found it to be vague.\n  We have responded to that. We have responded to that with a much more \ndetailed definition. Let me read the operative parts of the definition \nto show the difference in language in how we have responded to this \nconcern. In S. 1692, which was virtually identical to the Nebraska \nstatute, the definition was:\n\n       An abortion in which the person performing the abortion \n     deliberately and intentionally vaginally delivers some \n     portion of\n\n[[Page S3563]]\n\n     an intact living fetus until the fetus is partially outside \n     the body of the mother.\n\n  Let me repeat that:\n\n       . . . some portion of an intact living fetus until the \n     fetus is partially outside the body of the mother.\n\n  The Court said there are other procedures done, late-term abortion \nprocedures that are done, that in the process of doing that procedure, \na portion of the body--maybe an arm or a leg or an appendage, may \nactually come outside of the mother while the child is still alive. So \nwhat they are saying is as a result of that, we could be banning this \nother procedure. In the course of doing another abortion procedure that \nis legal, not barred by the legislation before us today, that could \noccur.\n\n  We have addressed that issue. They clearly point to that particular \nexample. We have changed the language by saying the person performing \nthe abortion deliberately and intentionally vaginally delivers ``a \nliving fetus until, in the case of a head-first presentation, the \nentire fetal head is outside the body of the mother or, in the case of \na breech presentation, any part of the fetal trunk''--not an arm, not a \nhand, not a foot, not a leg--any part of the fetal trunk, which means, \nof course, the feet, the legs and the trunk ``past the navel, is \noutside the body of the mother.''\n  So we are not talking about performing a D, where the baby is \nkilled in utero and dismembered and taken out a piece at a time. We are \nnot talking about that procedure. We are talking about a procedure \nwhere--if we can get the chart so I can graphically show what we are \ntalking about--there is no other procedure that could possibly be \ncovered.\n  I ask those who are opponents of this bill if they can name for me \nanother procedure where the child would be arms, legs, and trunk \noutside of the mother, all but the head. That is the procedure we are \ntalking about here. No other medical procedure as defined in the \nmedical literature has a baby in this position. Period. Period. There \nis no vagueness here. We are clear about this procedure.\n  We are very clear that the child is delivered in a breech position \nand then, if we put the previous chart up, these 8-inch long scissors--\nwe can see the scissors are about as long as a human hand and the baby \nis roughly as long, maybe slightly longer than a human hand. This baby \nat this point is roughly, I believe, 24 weeks, which is roughly the \ntime, 20 to 26 or 27 weeks, when the vast majority of these partial-\nbirth abortions are performed.\n  I know the Senator from California said her constituents saw these \npictures and they couldn't look at them. That is why we are trying to \nban this procedure. Because this is horrific. You cannot look at it and \nnot be affected.\n  The Senator from Washington, the day before yesterday, said that \nbanning this procedure is an extreme measure. I would like to know what \nher definition of extreme is. Banning this procedure is an extreme \nmeasure. I asked her what she thought about the fact that 70 percent of \nthe American public wanted to ban this procedure. Under my definition \nof extreme, it does not equate to 70 percent support of something being \nconsidered extreme. But she held fast. She said the reason it is 70 \npercent support is because they do not understand really what this \nprocedure is all about.\n  I want to juxtapose that statement to the statement of the Senator \nfrom California who said the people in her State could not even look at \nthe pictures. I suggest to you, what if every single American were \nforced to sit in front of a television set, or, worse yet, were \nrequired to come into an abortion clinic--these are not performed at \nhospitals; they are just performed at abortion clinics. What if every \nsingle American were required to come in and watch this occur to a \nlittle baby, to stand and watch a physician who is trained to heal, who \nis trained to save lives, who is trained, as the Senator from \nCalifornia said yesterday, to ``first do no harm,'' remove a 20-week to \n26-week, 27-week--in some cases unfortunately later than that--little \nbaby from its mother.\n  This is the part I just find chilling. Imagine yourself, close your \neyes and imagine yourself in this abortion clinic watching this little \nchild. I have witnessed the birth of our seven little children. I see \nthese little people emerge miraculously, incredibly, from the birth \ncanal, from their mother into the loving hands of a doctor whose job it \nis to heal, whose job it is to nurture and take care of that child.\n  But in this case those hands are not there to heal. These are not \nhealing hands. They look like it, don't they? They have the gloves on, \ndon't they? They are sterile, aren't they? But they are not healing \nhands. No, these hands are not there to heal this little child. Those \nhands are there to grasp that little child who is alive; who is alive. \nBy definition, under this bill, this is not a partial-birth abortion, \nbecause it says ``delivers a living fetus.''\n  So, if this child is not alive, this procedure is not barred. This \nprocedure is only barred if this baby is alive.\n  So you have hands of a doctor trained to heal, grasping a living \nchild whose arms and legs are extended, whose heart is beating, whose \nnerves are sensing, whose brain is attempting to understand what is \ngoing on, and he's grasping this living being.\n  When you hold something that is alive, when you have it in your \nhands, whether it is a little rabbit, guinea pig, or little puppy, \nthere is a feeling. There is a sense you have when you are holding \nsomething that is alive. This doctor is holding something he or she \nknows is alive and is 3 inches from being born, 3 inches from \nconstitutional protection. This doctor is not there to heal. He is \nthere to take these scissors, long, narrow scissors that come to a \npoint at the end--they are called Metzenbaum scissors--his job is to do \nthis blindly, because this is not done with a sonogram. This is not \ndone where the doctor can see inside of the mother through a medical \ndevice. No, this is done blindly. The doctor is feeling, reaching his \nhands in to find the spot, the lethal spot, the soft spot here at the \nbase of the skull, that soft spot in this little baby where he takes \nthis sharp instrument and blindly thrusts it into this baby's skull.\n  As our majority leader said yesterday, it is a dangerous procedure \nfor mothers. It is a blind procedure. It is done in an area of the body \nthat is very susceptible to injury. It is a very lush area of the body. \nThere is no protection for the mother. As the Senator from Tennessee \nyesterday said, those scissors could slip because it a blind procedure. \nThey could perforate a uterus, or they could lead to incompetent \ncervix. They could lead to a variety of harm that other late-term \nabortion procedures do not do.\n  Not only is this lethal for this baby but it is dangerous for the \nmother. According to the doctor who designed this procedure, he said--\nagain, this his testimony--that he has never encountered a situation \nwhere a partial-birth abortion was medically necessary to achieve the \ndesired outcome. His words: Never medically necessary. He personally \ndesigned the procedure and said often that the reason he designed this \nprocedure was not because it was healthier for women, not because it \nwas safer for women, and not because it was a better, more scientific \nway of doing this. This procedure is not taught in a single medical \nschool in the country. It is not taught in a single hospital in the \ncountry. It is not, to my knowledge, performed by any obstetrician. It \nis performed by abortionists who are not board certified in obstetrics. \nBut they are certified in destruction. That is what this procedure is. \nThis is not a procedure to preserve the health of mothers. The doctor \nwho designed this procedure said he designed this procedure because the \nother type of abortion, which we do not ban in this legislation, takes \n45 minutes. This takes 15 minutes. In his words--not mine--``I can do \nmore abortions in a day.''\n  Those scissors are thrust into this little baby's skull.\n  Again, you are in this room. Close your eyes. You are in this room, \nand you are watching this baby whose arms and legs are moving, who is \nalive, who but for this act that is being perpetrated upon it, would be \nborn alive. That is not to say it would live substantially longer after \nbirth; depending on its gestational age, maybe or maybe not.\n  We have cases the Senator from Ohio talked about where mothers who \nhad partial-birth abortions or were to have partial-birth abortions--\nremember how this procedure works. You can go in and present yourself \nto the abortionist. The abortionist gives you a pill and\n\n[[Page S3564]]\n\nsends you home for 2 days. That is the reason it only takes 15 minutes \nof his time--because he sends you home with medication to dilate your \ncervix over a 2-day period of time and you present yourself again for \nthe procedure. At that point, it only takes 15 minutes of his time. \nThere are all sorts of complications which I will not get into right \nnow.\n  Having dilation over a 2-day period of time could lead to women's \ninability to carry children long term after their abortion. In two \ncases in Ohio, women delivered children because their cervix dilated \ntoo quickly, which induced labor. It resulted in the delivery of two \nchildren, both of whom lived. One did not survive because she was too \npremature. The other lives today but was selected for this procedure.\n  Go back to the room again. You are watching this doctor with these \nhands that are holding a living child. The child fits, as you can see, \nvery comfortably. The entire trunk and the body of the child fit into \nthis physician's hand. The body is moving. But he finds the spot and \nthrusts the scissors into the base of the skull.\n  Nurse Brenda Shafer was assisting on a partial-birth abortion. By the \nway, she was not pro-life. She was working in an abortion clinic. But \nwhen she saw this and saw--her description--the arms and legs of the \nchild shoot out like when you hold a little baby and you let it fall a \nlittle bit. The baby will react like that and shoot its arms and legs \nout, not knowing what is going on and not understanding what is being \ndone to it because their ability to understand is limited to that. This \nbaby doesn't have any time to understand because in that moment in \nwhich these little girl's or boy's arms spasm out like that, the baby \nis dead.\n\n  But the procedure doesn't end, the insult doesn't end, because the \ndoctor then takes these scissors and pulls them, causing the scissors \nto pull the skull open--to break the skull apart so he can create a \nhole in the baby's head big enough for a suction catheter to be \ninserted into the base of the baby's brain.\n  They turn on this vacuum suction tube. Then they suction the baby's \nbrain contents out--the cranial contents out. Because of the softness \nof the baby's skull, the skull collapses and the baby is then delivered \ndead.\n  As our majority leader, the doctor from Tennessee, said yesterday, \nthe only advantage he can possibly conceive of for this procedure is \nthat it guarantees the baby is dead before it is delivered.\n  We are not vague about the procedure we are describing. The court \nshould not be under any misunderstanding about what we are attempting \nto bar. The language in this legislation is not really identical. If I \nwere arguing for the plaintiff--that is their job. Their job is to go \nout and present the best argument they can. My guess is they will argue \nthat it is not legally identical, and they will have three or four \nother arguments in the alternative that this court will not buy. That \nis the job of the lawyer representing their client.\n  Our job as Senators is to protect the decency of our society. It is \nto stop unnecessary brutality to the weakest among us--to stop \nprocedures that are harmful to the health of mothers. There is not one \nphysician who has testified who has said this procedure is the safest \nor is the best.\n  I ask this question again: As I repeated the last 3 days and I have \nasked for 7 years on this floor, give me a procedure, give me a case \nstudy where a partial-birth abortion is indicated, where it is \nnecessary--this is the term, by the way, that the Supreme Court used as \nSenator Boxer's chart shows--where it is ``necessary and appropriate \nmedical judgment for the preservation of the life or health of the \nmother''--where it is necessary. There is not one case, not one \ninstance in 7 years when it has been brought to this floor, or to the \nfloor of any State legislature, the floor of any courtroom, any hearing \nroom. Not one case has been brought where it has been argued, because \nof the particular medical circumstances, it is medically necessary for \nthis brutality.\n  Why? Because this isn't taught in any medical school. It isn't done \nin any hospital. It isn't done by any obstetrician. This is a rogue \nprocedure for the convenience and economic benefit of abortionists and \nabortion clinics. Of course, it is not medically necessary. It is not \neven medically recognized. It is dangerous to the health of mothers.\n\n  Let me quote from the findings in the bill. By the way, this is all \nfrom congressional testimony. I understand the Senator from California \nwants us to commit this back to committee for congressional hearings. \nHere are the definitive hearings we have had on this legislation:\n\n       Those risks include, among other things: an increase in a \n     woman's risk of suffering from cervical incompetence--\n\n  As I said before, you have a 2-day period where the cervix is \ndilated. That leads to a variety of different risk factors, including \ninfection, that could lead to cervical incompetence.\n  As the Senator from Tennessee said yesterday--the only physician in \nthe Senate, who has delivered his share of babies--you do not put these \nkinds of instruments through the opening where the cervix is without \nhaving some consequence or potential consequences to the ability, long \nterm, for a mother to carry a child.\n\n       As a result of cervical dilation making it difficult or \n     impossible for a woman to carry a subsequent pregnancy to \n     term; an increased risk of uterine rupture--\n\n  Why? because of those scissors we showed you before, that suction \ncatheter, if not properly placed, could cause a lot of damage.\n\n       abruption, amniotic fluid embolus, and trauma to the uterus \n     as a result of converting the child to a footling breech \n     position--\n\n  Now, remember, any of you who have gone through the birth of a \nchild--whether as a mother or a father or a relative--who have \nexperienced the birth of a child, one of the things you always worry \nabout is, is the child in the right position before delivery? Is the \nchild in the right position? What is the right position? Well, head \ndown.\n  What is one of the greatest fears of a mother and a father when they \ngo in to deliver a baby? If the baby is not in the right position, and \nthe delivery might have to be what? Breech. Breech deliveries are \ndangerous. They are potentially life threatening to the baby and could \nbe very harmful to the mother.\n  What does this procedure deliberately do? It delivers the baby in a \nbreech position. And:\n\n     a procedure which, according to a leading obstetrics \n     textbook, ``there are very few, if any, indications for [the \n     breech position] other than for delivery of a second twin;'' \n     and a risk of lacerations and secondary hemorrhaging due to \n     the doctor blindly forcing a sharp instrument into the base \n     of the . . . child's skull while he or she is lodged in the \n     birth canal, an act which could result in severe bleeding, \n     brings with it the threat of shock, and could ultimately \n     result in maternal death.\n\n  Now, you have to ask a question, folks. Why are there people across \nthis country in some of those organizations that are ``abortion rights \norganizations,'' and some Members here in the Senate coming here to \nargue to maintain the legality of a procedure which is a rogue \nprocedure--not according to Rick Santorum, but according to the AMA, \naccording to a variety of different organizations that are out there \nthat are physician-oriented organizations. It is a rogue procedure--not \ntaught in medical schools, not done in hospitals, not done by \nobstetricians--designed by abortionists for the convenience of the \nabortionist, that is a greater risk.\n  I show you a chart with Dr. Hern's comment. I show you a comment of \nan abortionist who does late-term abortions. In fact, he doesn't just \ndo them, he is ``the'' expert in America. As they say, he wrote the \nbook. This man wrote the book. He is the author of standard textbooks \non abortion procedures, abortion practices, and performs many third-\ntrimester abortions. This is what he said:\n\n       I have very serious reservations about this procedure . . . \n     you really can't defend it. I would dispute any statement--\n\nlisten--\n\n     any statement that this is the safest procedure to use.\n\n  This is not someone who supports my side of the argument, by the way. \nBut what he is suggesting is, this is the least safe. In fact, we have \numpteen medical organizations and physicians' testimony, saying: Well, \nyou know, we want to keep it as an option. Many of these groups say: \nAnd we don't want doctors to have any restrictions on their right to \npractice. But, no, there are safer procedures, certainly.\n\n[[Page S3565]]\n\n  But the evidence is overwhelming. This is the least safe procedure. \nThis is the most dangerous procedure to the health of a mother. So it \nis the most dangerous. And it is never medically indicated, never \nmedically necessary.\n  So, again, why? Why do you oppose this? Of all the alternatives, it \nis the most dangerous to the health of the mother. So it is dangerous \nto the health of the mother, and it is never medically indicated. Well, \nthen, why would you support keeping it legal?\n  What is so important, what value that you hold, what thing is so \nprecious that would require you to come here and defend a procedure \nthat is never medically necessary and more harmful to women than other \nalternatives? What is it? It is not women's health. No, no, no, it is \nnot women's health, because this is the most dangerous. And this is not \nmedically necessary. So what is it?\n  Well, as the abortion rights groups have said, this is an assault on \nthe right to an abortion. This procedure is an assault on the right. I \nwould argue, most people do not even believe you could have abortions \nat this stage. When you look at this little, fully formed, living \nchild, most people in America cannot imagine that abortions are \nperformed on healthy mothers with healthy babies at this point in \npregnancy, because the other side has said, for years: Well, Roe v. \nWade only allows first-trimester abortions. They are limited \nafterwards. Wrong. Wrong--healthy mothers, healthy babies.\n  How do we know? Well, Ron Fitzsimmons, who is the director of the \norganization of abortion clinics in America, said: I lied through my \nteeth when I said this was performed in rare circumstances only to \nprotect the health of the mother, on children who are deformed or \nmothers who are in danger. I lied through my teeth, he said. He said: \nWe all know that these abortions are performed on healthy mothers and \nhealthy babies. The vast majority--his quote--the ``vast majority.'' We \nhave better than a vast majority.\n  The State of Kansas, the only State in the Union that tracks these \nkinds of abortions, requires a reason for the abortion on the form the \ndoctor has to fill out after he performs it. In Kansas, there were 182 \npartial-birth abortions in 1 year--in a State the size of Kansas. How \nmany were for the health of the mother? How many were because the \nmother's life was in danger? How many were because the mother's \nfuture fertility was in danger? How many were because the mother was in \ndanger of grievous medical injury, physical injury? How many were \nbecause this was medically necessary? How many? None. Zero. The reason \ngiven for all 182 brutal executions at the hands of a physician: mental \nhealth. They had to check a box somewhere: ``mental health.'' Well, \nthey have to say a health reason. You can't do it for no reason. But \nmental health, of course, is fear, anxiety, stress--certainly things we \nshould be concerned about, but I do not believe at this stage in \npregnancy a sufficient reason in the American public's eyes to do this.\n\n  Is stress a reason for this? Is this a justification in the eyes of \nthe American public? Seventy percent--I daresay if we had every \nAmerican in the room when one of these procedures was performed, God, I \nhope at least 95 percent would agree it was not justified.\n  This is an evil in our midst. One of the great things I believe about \nAmerica and about my colleagues is when they see evil, they have the \ncourage to stand up and fight it. This is the face of evil. Those \nhands, those healing hands are a corruption of medicine that we cannot \nallow to continue.\n  Please vote against this motion to commit, this motion to delay the \nbanning of this procedure that could save some little baby somewhere in \nAmerica from having to go through this.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we have reached a point of this debate \nwhere there has been screaming and yelling on the Senate floor. I will \ntry to react to those screams as calmly as I can and say that this bill \ndoesn't protect the health of women. It puts our daughters in harm's \nway. That is not groups saying that. That is 45,000 OB/GYNs. Talk about \nloving hands; they are saying that. It is women who have had the \nprocedure. They are saying that. And guess what. The Supreme Court says \nthat. Because of that, we need to send this bill back. Actually it is \nnot back to committee; it never went to committee.\n  I never said it was identical. I said it was legally identical to the \nStenberg case. I have said that over and over.\n  This morning we have been listening to a series of lectures about \nmedicine. I guess I find that odd on the Senate floor, especially the \none about breech babies because my daughter was delivered breech. I \nunderstand that. I don't need to be lectured about that, about what it \nis, about what the risks were to me or my baby because I lived it.\n  I do know one thing: My constituents are right to look away from this \ndrawing. No one wants to look at abortion. We want abortion to be rare. \nWe want it to be safe. We want it to be legal. The vast majority of \npeople in the State I represent, a State of 35 million people, support \nRoe v. Wade because it is a moderate decision that balances all the \ninterests. Yes, the health and life of the mother always, and the \ninterest of the fetus where, after the first 3 months, States can in \nfact set the rules of abortion, but always, always with the life and \nhealth of the mother at the forefront.\n  This bill does not do that. Therefore, this bill is unconstitutional, \nin addition to being cruel, in addition to being dangerous, in addition \nto putting women in jeopardy.\n\n  Again, I say to my colleague that he has chosen to put this drawing \nhere. I could have chosen to put a drawing of a woman having a \nhemorrhage behind me. I could have chosen to put a drawing of a woman's \nuterus rupturing and everyone running around in the emergency room \ndesperately trying to save her. I could have chosen a drawing of a \nwoman slipping into a coma, having an embolism. I could have put a \ndrawing of a woman paralyzed for life because perhaps she couldn't get \nthis procedure which my colleague has decided doctors say they don't \nneed. That is false on its face, and that is the reason we need to have \na hearing.\n  We have letters from doctors. We have letters that lay out why, in \nfact, this procedure is necessary and why this bill is \nunconstitutional. A letter from the University of California, San \nFrancisco, signed by Felicia Stewart. She says this bill:\n\n     . . . fails to protect women's health by omitting an \n     exception for women's health; it menaces medical practice \n     with the threat of criminal prosecution; it encompasses a \n     range of abortion procedures; it puts women in jeopardy.\n\n  She names the various abortion procedures which could be outlawed.\n  I would like to have this bill go to the Judiciary Committee because \nI would like to know why one procedure wasn't mentioned in the bill \never. It is on purpose because it is meant to cover more than one \nprocedure. That is another unconstitutional provision.\n  By the way, the proponents of this said before that the laws before \nthe court would be deemed constitutional. They were not. They were \nwrong then; they are wrong now. And surely if they think they are so \nright, why don't they want to take the time and have this bill go \nthrough the Judiciary Committee.\n  Dr. Stewart says:\n\n       If the safest medical procedures are not available to \n     terminate a pregnancy, severe adverse health consequences are \n     possible . . .\n\n  And she lists them. They are even more than what is behind me.\n  The individual who argued the Supreme Court case that we are talking \nabout, Stenberg, says the new Federal bill, S. 3 ``contains the same \ntwo flaws of the Nebraska bill that was ruled unconstitutional.'' And \nshe goes on to explain why. I don't want to be terribly repetitive, but \nthere were two problems in the Stenberg case. The ban was too vague \nand, therefore, there was an undue burden on the woman because she \ncould be denied all kinds of procedures. Secondly, there was no health \nexception.\n  So, yes, I could have had a drawing that showed a woman in severe \ncrisis and constituents would have turned away from that as well. That \nis why Roe v. Wade is such an important decision because it knows that \nthis issue is so difficult. It weighed the competing interests and it \nsaid, in the first 3 months of a pregnancy, government stay out. A \nwoman and her doctor can decide. Senator Santorum should not decide, \nalthough in his opinion, I know\n\n[[Page S3566]]\n\nhe wants Roe v. Wade overturned. He thinks government should decide. I \ntake issue with that. But there is no difference on the rest because I \ndo believe later in a pregnancy, the State has a right to set the \nrules, always making an exception for the life and health of the \nmother.\n  I don't know what all the yelling is about because I could tell my \ncolleague that we could probably get, if the leaders on his side of the \nanti-choice would agree, we could get a bill that could ban all late-\nterm abortions--all--except for life and health of the mother. Wouldn't \nthat be something we could do?\n  We will have the chance because, as I understand it, Senator \nFeinstein will be offering that very bill. Let's see how our colleagues \nfeel. They will have a chance to ban all late-term abortions with the \nlife and health exception.\n  My colleague said, in answer to Senator Nickles' comments about how \nimportant it is to send bills to the committee of jurisdiction--I wrote \ndown what he said--they were talking about a complex piece of \nlegislation, major complex piece of legislation. They were talking \nabout a big piece of legislation, many pages. Well, I ask the question: \nWhat could be more important for the Senate Judiciary Committee to look \nat than a matter that deals with life and health? What could be more \nimportant for the Judiciary Committee to look at than a possible ban on \na procedure that has no health exception, which could lead a woman into \na life where she is paralyzed, where she has a stroke, where she cannot \nbear children anymore, where, in essence, she is taken away from her \nfamily? What could be more important to take 2 days on?\n\n  Are women not worth a couple of days of hearings here? Are women not \nworth it? They are your mother, they are your sister, they are your \nwife, they are our daughters.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield further?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I want to make sure this is understood by Members of the \nSenate and those following this debate, and I want to ask this \nquestion: Am I correct in my assumption that the exact language of S. \n3, which is currently before us, was the same language in the Nebraska \nstatute that was found unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court?\n  Mrs. BOXER. It is legally the same. There are a couple of tweaks in \nthe language, and there are a series of findings, but the lawyers who \nargued the other case tell us it is legally the same because there is \nno health exception and the language is so vague that it creates an \nundue burden.\n  I have behind me on a chart the two reasons the Court found that \nStenberg was sufficient. Those issues remain in S. 3. That is why this \nmotion to commit is an attempt to do the right thing by the women in \nthis country, and for the children of this country, and for the \nfamilies in this country, and for anybody who cares about this matter, \nand to have a couple of days of hearings to see if we can get a bill \nthat would pass constitutional muster.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I may ask another question of the Senator. So in 1999 \nwe debated virtually the same bill on the floor?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. There was a vote taken and then the veto by President \nClinton. Then subsequent to that the U.S. Supreme Court across the \nstreet took the Nebraska statute to consider whether or not it was \nconstitutional, and that statute had the same language we are \nconsidering today. I can quote it. This was in the Nebraska statute, \nand this is in S. 3. Abortion is:\n\n     necessary to save the life of a mother whose life is \n     endangered by a physical disorder, physical illness, physical \n     injury, including life and danger of physical condition \n     caused by or from the pregnancy itself.\n\n  The identical wording to the Nebraska statute. So in the year 2000, \nthe Supreme Court ruled this language unconstitutional. Yet we come \nback today with exactly the same language that was already rejected by \nthe Supreme Court, and we are supposed to vote on this without any \nintervening committee hearing, without having people come before us and \nsuggest that if you are going to approach this again, you certainly \ndon't want to go down the same path as the Nebraska statute.\n  So the Senator's motion to commit is basically to take the language \nrejected by the Supreme Court--the language before us now--back to \ncommittee so that whether you are for or against this amendment, you \ncan at least concede the obvious--that this language has already been \nrejected.\n  What we are going through here is, frankly, not a very productive \nundertaking. Is that the Senator's suggestion with the motion to \ncommit?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes. I thank my friend. As an attorney, as he is, and as \na member of the Judiciary Committee, he understands that this is in \nfact a wasted amount of time because there are so many other issues we \ncould be dealing with here regarding the people of our country, who are \nstruggling now under terrible economic times and are worried about \nforeign policy problems; and we are spending time on an extremely \nemotional issue. There is no question it is very difficult for this \nSenator to be here talking about it, because it deals with a situation \nwhere I believe the health of women could be jeopardized and doctors \ncould be put in jail for trying to do the best for their patients. The \nother side gets very emotional as well. In the end, we have a piece of \nlegislation that doesn't pass constitutional muster and this will be \nbrought back again.\n  So it seems to me the intelligent thing to do is to bring it to the \ncommittee and make sure that this bill, as Senator Santorum says, meets \nthe constitutional issues that were raised. Experts tell me it does \nnot. The record is replete with references that colleagues on the other \nside thought the Nebraska case would pass constitutional muster and it \ndid not either.\n  I also would like my friend to see a comment made by Senator Nickles \nregarding the importance of going to committee because I think it \nstands out here as a way to make the point that, whether you are a \nDemocrat or Republican, you should respect the fact that we have \ncommittees for a reason. When a bill bypassed the committee, he said he \nwas very disappointed in this process, and this process should not be \nrepeated, so that we can have bipartisan input, have the legislative \nprocess work, have hearings so people know what they are voting on, et \ncetera.\n  I think what we are doing makes a lot of sense because it impacts the \nhealth of women, the lives of women, and life and death itself, and it \nought to go back.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I think two things ought to be brought up \nas part of the motion to commit. The first is that we are considering \nlanguage already rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court--a 5-to-4 vote, by \na fairly conservative Court. Yet we are being asked to vote on it again \ntoday. That does not suggest a learning process. It suggests that \npeople are stuck in a political position that they are going to keep \nbringing up over and over again regardless of the Court. So the \nlanguage is identical.\n  The second thing the Supreme Court said when they rejected the \nNebraska statute still applies to this, and that is that there is no \nhealth exception, no situation where a mother's health situation is \ntaken into consideration when an abortion procedure is allowed.\n  I might ask the Senator from California this. I listened carefully--\nand again I will defer to my colleague from Pennsylvania when it comes \nto his convictions and feelings on this issue; they are heartfelt, \nreal, and sincere. I cannot listen to him without coming away with that \nimpression. He said he believes that if every American could come into \na medical setting and watch this abortion being performed, they would \nunderstand his position.\n  I would like to ask the Senator from California: Couldn't the same \nthing be said of the women who are finding late in their pregnancies \nthat there has been a terrible complication which has occurred, which \nthreatens their lives, threatens their health? Couldn't we also say, if \nyou could sit down in a waiting room with a mother-to-be and her \nhusband who have just been given tragic news at the end of what they \nthought was a normal pregnancy, and that in fact it is not normal, \nthere are terrible complications, and that continuing this pregnancy \nmay threaten this mother's life or threaten her ability to ever have \nchildren again? I wonder if you invited all of America into that \nwaiting room to anguish with\n\n[[Page S3567]]\n\nthese parents, what their conclusion would be.\n\n  I say to the Senator--and I ask for a response--there is no doubt \nabout this. This is a painful and emotional issue on both sides. But in \nfairness, it has to be said that the other side is arguing they don't \nwant to take into consideration the health of the mother, they don't \nwant to create an exception for a mother in desperate circumstances, \nfacing a medical crisis that is threatening her health and ability to \never bear another child.\n  In honesty and fairness, should we not be talking about both sides of \nthis equation? I ask the Senator to respond.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend that that is the whole point. When you \nare dealing with these emotional, difficult, terrible issues, you have \nto look at all of that. That is why, on our side, we are willing to say \nwe would ban all late-term abortions, as the Senator's bill would do, \nexcept for life of the mother and, in your case, a health exception \nwhich is a pretty tough health exception.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Grievous physical injury.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am going to support you. I am also going to support \nSenator Feinstein's, which gives a little more leeway to the patient \nand the doctor. The point is that is the right approach to balance the \nfetus's rights and the mother's rights.\n  That is the whole point of Roe and why it was such a reasoned, \nreasonable, and moderate decision because all of this is difficult. For \nus to outlaw medical procedures which doctors tell us are necessary--\nand my colleague keeps saying they do not. I put in the Record the \nletter from the OB/GYNs, 45,000 strong, who say do not do away with \nthis procedure and, if you do, make a health exception.\n  I have told stories and I want to quickly go through one--how much \ntime do I have remaining on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fourteen minutes, 40 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Can I be told when I have 5 minutes remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will advise the Senator.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I say to my friend, he \nposed a very good rhetorical question which was: Does the Senator \nbelieve if people could hear these stories of the women and their \nfamilies who are going through these choices, would they not also be \ntouched and be moved? The answer is clearly yes.\n  I wish to tell my colleague about Coreen Costello who went through \nthis procedure. I want to tell you how she defines her own ideology and \nreligion. She says:\n\n       We are Christians and conservative. We believe strongly in \n     the rights, value, and sanctity of the unborn. Abortion was \n     simply not an option we would ever consider.\n\n  She was told the muscles of the baby she was carrying had stopped \ngrowing and her vital organs were failing. Her lungs were so \nunderdeveloped they barely existed. Her head was swollen with fluid and \nher little body was stiff and rigid. She was unable to swallow and, as \na result, the excess fluids were puddling in her uterus. They tried \ndesperately to save the pregnancy.\n  She said:\n\n       We wanted our baby to come on God's time, and we didn't \n     want to interfere. We chose to go into labor naturally.\n\n  Eventually she was told if she did that, she could die.\n\n       We asked our pastor to baptize her in utero. We named her \n     Catherine Grace, Catherine meaning ``pure'' and Grace \n     representing God's mercy.\n\n  We talk about the problems families face. These families are \ndesperate to do the right thing for the family, for the child in utero, \nand eventually she had to have this procedure that the Senator wants to \noutlaw. She said it saved her life and it saved her health, and it was \nthe only choice she had to save her fertility. She said:\n\n       Losing our daughter was the hardest thing we ever \n     experienced.\n\n  She said it has been difficult to come to Washington and tell her \nstory.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I may ask the Senator a question.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I have heard that story, and I have personally met a \nwoman from my State who faced a similar medical crisis, Vikki Stella, \nof Naperville, IL, a mother of two children who was pregnant with her \nthird, anxiously awaiting the arrival of this little boy and learned \nvery late in her pregnancy, much to her surprise, that her poor child \nwas so deformed and abnormal that it could not survive outside the \nwomb. The child was destined to die almost immediately after birth.\n  Of course, some people would say at that point: Why not just finish \nthe pregnancy? Why do you have to do anything? Her doctor said to her, \nunfortunately: You are not the healthiest person in the world even as a \nmother of two children. You have a diabetic condition, and you have the \nchance of complications. Therefore, her doctor recommended that she \nterminate that pregnancy, using the same procedure which would be \noutlawed, banned, prohibited by this legislation.\n\n  Her husband was a practicing physician who was then in private \nbusiness. She said in her testimony she almost had to be carried out of \nthe waiting room after she was told this devastating information. They \nwent home. I talked with her. She said they had sleepless nights about \nwhat is the right thing to do: Should I go ahead and risk my life and \nmy health and finish this pregnancy or what?\n  They finally came to the conclusion that the best thing for her, her \nhealth, and her family was to go ahead and terminate the pregnancy of \nthis poor malformed fetus that would never survive, and she did it. \nThey used the very procedure which the Senator from Pennsylvania would \nprohibit and ban. The last time I saw her was here on Capitol Hill. She \nwas pushing a stroller with her new baby boy.\n  I say to the Senator, a lot of this debate is premised on false \npremises that women that late in pregnancy would not take the \ntermination of a pregnancy very seriously. I do not believe that. I \nthink the overwhelming majority of women that late in a pregnancy are \nnot going to end the pregnancy unless there is some extraordinary \nsituation. That somehow the women who make this decision really never \nwanted to have a baby--look at Vikki Stella. Look at Mrs. Costello and \nothers. They had a family and were hoping to add to their families. \nFrankly, there are lots of options which they could choose.\n  I say to the Senator from California, isn't that what we are finding, \nthat these are extraordinary medical situations where we are asked now \nin the Senate to impose our medical judgment over the judgment of an \nobstetrician, over the judgment of a family doctor? We are going to \nmake the medical decision on the floor of the Senate, a decision which \nshould be made in a hospital, in a clinic, in a doctor's waiting room; \nisn't that what this comes down to?\n  I ask the Senator from California if she sees it as an issue that \nbrings that kind of decision to the forefront.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend, no one can be more eloquent than he. \nI think this whole debate is about Senators thinking they know more \nthan families, doctors, the ability of families to sit around and \nchoose the safest option in a real emergency situation.\n  My colleagues say it is not an emergency; the procedure takes 3 days. \nThat does not even make sense to me. I think if you find out you are \ngoing to have a cancer operation and it takes a long time, it still is \nan emergency. The fact the procedure takes a while probably indicates \nit is even more of an emergency.\n  We have a lot to do. We have a lot of responsibilities. I do not want \nto do harm. I think that by sending this bill to the committee of \njurisdiction to further explore the constitutional ramifications of \nthis bill, which is legally identical to a law that was ruled \nunconstitutional by the Supreme Court, is the right thing to do. To \nlisten, again, to some of the people who have lived through this is the \nright thing to do.\n  To do no harm is the minimum we should be doing. I think when the \nSenator offers his amendment to have a pretty narrowly drawn health \nexception, it ought to win because how do we stand here and say we have \na heart when we ignore stories like Vikki Stella's?\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I may ask the Senator, too, after most of the debate \nyesterday, Senator Santorum came to the floor and told a very \ncompelling story about a little girl who was born with some serious \nhealth defects and who survived and prospered. He showed us a\n\n[[Page S3568]]\n\nbeautiful photograph--which I am sure he is going to refer to again--of \nthis little girl who had survived and conquered all of these \nchallenges.\n  I ask the Senator from California, we all know these stories and we \nadmire the courage of the parents and of the children who make it, but \ndoesn't the Senator from California believe, as I do, that we should \nhave adopted the Murray-Reid amendment yesterday which would have \nguaranteed health insurance coverage for uninsured mothers with these \nchildren who are struggling with all of these medical problems? Doesn't \nthe Senator believe that if we are truly committed to these families \nand these children that Senator Murray and Senator Reid have the best \napproach in terms of family planning information so that they have \nwanted pregnancies and that they have health insurance for these \nchildren?\n  Does the Senator believe, as I do, that if one is committed to these \nchildren, these mothers, and these families, they should also be \ncommitted to health insurance coverage so they can have the care they \nneed to survive and prosper?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I absolutely supported the Murray-Reid amendment, as did \nmy colleague. I was stunned at how many people on the other side of the \naisle, who stood up and defended the rights of the fetus, somehow \ncannot defend the rights of a child. It is a stunning thing to me to \nsee people, who are speaking so eloquently on this, vote against the \nMurray-Reid amendment to help poor children get the help they need, to \nhelp them get the medical attention they need.\n  We ought to think about the pictures of these women, with their \nfamilies, who faced this. This is not an issue that is an abstraction. \nIt is an issue about real families struggling. And being told that to \nsave the woman, to save her ability to have future children, to make \nsure she does not wind up paralyzed or with a stroke, that she have a \nchance, this Senate is going to move to outlaw this procedure, that \ncould do that for this woman without a health exception--I think it is \ncruel. I think it is wrong. I think it is sad. I think it shows a lack \nof humility. And I hope the people of this country will understand what \nwe are talking about: The willingness of the pro-choice Members of this \nSenate to outlaw all late-term abortion as long as the life and the \nhealth of the mother are excepted.\n  I thank my colleagues for listening, and I retain the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, to address a few issues the Senator from \nCalifornia spoke about, I made a comment about her calling this bill \nidentical, and she said she did not call it identical, that she called \nit legally identical.\n  I quote from the unofficial record from 6:51 p.m. Monday on the floor \nof the Senate, the Senator from California: The Supreme Court said in \nan identical bill, it is far broader than just one procedure--identical \nbill.\n  The Senator from Illinois just repeatedly said this is the exact same \nbill, exactly the same language--``identical bill.'' The Senator from \nCalifornia said that is correct. So she is saying this is an identical \nbill, and then she suggested we need to send it back to committee \nbecause we need hearings because it is a changed bill. Which is it? Is \nis a changed bill or an identical bill?\n  It is not an identical bill, I concede that point to her. It is \ndifferent. The language is substantially different. The Senator from \nCalifornia said: We meant to cover more than one procedure with this \nlanguage.\n  Why would we want to do that? The Supreme Court said: The reason we \nare striking down your language is that we believe it covers more than \none procedure. So we are going to craft language so the Supreme Court \ncan come back and say, well, it covers more than one procedure?\n  Maybe my colleagues think we are not serious about banning this \nprocedure. Let me assure them, I am serious as a heart attack about \nbanning this procedure, and we have crafted language to do just that, \nand only that.\n  The language is different. It is not identical to the Nebraska \nstatute. The Nebraska statute said, as the previous bill we considered \non the floor, that a partial-birth abortion is performed in which the \nperson performing the abortion deliberately and intentionally \nvaginally:\n\n     delivers some portion of an intact living fetus until the \n     fetus is partially outside the body of the mother.\n\n  The new language says:\n\n     deliberately and intentionally vaginally delivers a living \n     fetus until, in the case of a head presentation, the entire \n     fetal head is outside the body of the mother, or, in the case \n     of a breech presentation, any part of the fetal trunk--\n\n  That means the arms, legs, trunk--\n\n     past the navel is outside the body of the mother.\n\n  Now, that is substantially different. It is not an identical bill. It \nis much more specific, to address the very issue the Court wanted us to \naddress in the Stenberg v. Carhart case. So we are very clear. This is \nnot vague, and this is an honest and sincere attempt to meet the \nconstitutional strictures of the Supreme Court decision.\n  I will address Senator Durbin's and Senator Boxer's point on some of \nthe special cases, but the Senator from Minnesota is in the Chamber and \nI yield 10 minutes to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I do not know if there is an issue we \nface in this Senate that is as charged and certain to elicit a whole \nrange of emotional responses as the issue of abortion. A lot of us \nbring very passionate perspectives to this. My wife Laurie and I are \nparents of two children who were destined to die. Our first son, Adam, \nwas born with a genetic condition that we found out about at the time \nof birth, at delivery. He lived for a very short time, not more than a \ncouple of months. As a result of that, I can say that my sense about \nthe value of life was forged in steel, that each life is precious, that \neach life has value. That is the perspective I bring.\n  Ten years ago, our fourth child, our last daughter, Grace--in between \nwe have a son Jacob, who is going to be 17 tomorrow, Thursday, and a \ndaughter Sarah, who is 13, but our daughter Grace was born with the \nsame condition. We knew about a week before that she was going to have \nthis genetic condition which is very rare.\n  My wife gave birth. We cared for Grace for a couple of months. We \nbrought her home from the hospital very quickly. We knew she was \ndestined to die. We made that choice for Grace to be part of our life, \nbecause we understand the incredible value that every life gives, that \nevery life has, that every life is a gift from God.\n  I recognize that my friends across the aisle have heartfelt and \npassionate beliefs on the other side of the abortion issue. I \nunderstand that. We disagree. But in this debate about partial-birth \nabortion, this debate in which we talk about a child partially \ndelivered and then crushing its skull, this debate is one in which \nMinnesotans certainly, I believe, and Americans at large, can find \ncommon ground. This should be an issue which, in spite of one's \nposition on the life issue, in spite of their views on abortion \ngenerally--this issue is one in which we should come together and agree \nto ban partial-birth abortion. As divisive as the issue of abortion is, \nthere are a few things in which we can find common ground.\n  It is not part of this debate, but I have to tell this story. A while \nago, my 13-year-old went to get her ears pierced. I received a call \nfrom the folks who wanted to pierce her ears wanting to know if dad \nsaid it was okay. They had to have parental consent. I think most \nAmericans and most Minnesotans would say that makes sense. If it is \ntrue for having one's ears pierced, it should be true for abortion.\n  Even on this divisive issue, there are those things that we, as \nAmericans, can agree on and say let's move together, let's find the \ncommon ground, and banning partial-birth abortion is one of them. It is \ntime to put an end to this gruesome procedure that claims the lives of \nthousands of unborn children every year. It is time to ensure that no \nchild suffers this violent, tragic death.\n  We are under assault in this country. I have watched the debate and I \nrespect the work of my distinguished colleague from Pennsylvania. In \nthis debate, we have been besieged by a campaign of falsehoods about \nwhat this issue is about. It is about partial-birth abortion.\n  Some say that the procedure is rarely performed; we do not need to \ndeal\n\n[[Page S3569]]\n\nwith it. If it was performed even one time, most Americans would say is \nwrong and must be stopped.\n  So we are doing the right thing by finding common ground on this \ndivisive issue and banning partial-birth abortion.\n  A recent survey by the Alan Guttmacher Institute, an affiliate of \nPlanned Parenthood, released in January of 2003, reported that 2,200 \npartial-birth abortions were performed in 2000. In 1997, the executive \ndirector of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers estimated that \napproximately 3,000 to 5,000 abortions were performed by that method \nannually. This means that anywhere between 6 and 14 children die every \nday as a result of partial-birth abortion. This bill is a significant \npiece of child protection legislation and, again, one in which we \nshould find common ground in spite of and regardless of one's position \non abortion.\n  Abortion providers would have people believe this procedure is \ncurrently only performed when the mother's life is threatened or the \nfetus is deformed. This is simply not the case. Ron Fitzsimmions, \nexecutive director of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers, has \nstated:\n\n       In the vast majority of cases, the procedure is performed \n     on a healthy mother with a healthy fetus, as reported in the \n     New York Times.\n\n  My colleague, the distinguished Senator from Illinois, has offered an \namendment that he believes offers a reasonable compromise to provisions \ncontained in S. 3. Sometimes your friends want to love you to death. In \nthe guise of saying they will help, they want to kill what we are \ntrying to do. What we are trying to do is very simple in this bill. It \nis very specific. It is very clear. It is uncomplicated. We are trying \nto ban a gruesome procedure known as partial-birth abortion. That is \nwhat this is about.\n  The Senator's amendment seeks to make it unlawful to abort a viable \nfetus unless a physician, prior to performing an abortion, certifies \nthe continuation of the pregnancy would threaten the mother's life or \nrisk grievous injury to her physical health.\n  In this case, the exception swallows the rule. The word ``viable'' \nmakes the ban on partial-birth abortion virtually meaningless, as a \nlarge majority of the procedures are believed to be performed during \nthe second trimester, and the term ``viable'' will likely be read by \nthe courts to include only third-trimester abortions.\n  Further, there is no requirement to certify whether the unborn child \nis, in fact, viable. The capacity for a baby to survive independently \nof the mother with technological assistance is currently reached in the \nlate weeks of the second trimester. Without certification of viability, \nthere is little or no new protection against the partial-birth abortion \nprocedure.\n  Equally alarming, this amendment requires that there be a risk, not \nsignificant risk--not even slightest risk--but risk to the mother's \nhealth. There is a risk involved in almost every type of medical \nprocedure, including delivering a baby. In the guise of seeking to \noffer some common ground, what we really have--and folks have to \nunderstand it for what it is--is an attempt to try to kill what is a \nvery clear, very straightforward, very unequivocal, very heartfelt, and \na very strong consensus-building effort to move together on this \ndivisive issue of abortion. We want to say that in the Senate we \nunderstand there is common ground, and that common ground is to put an \nend to partial-birth abortion.\n  The amendment from my distinguished colleague from Illinois offers no \nnew protection against this violent procedure for unborn children, as \nthe loopholes in the amendment are so large. It is time to stop this \ninhumane, gruesome procedure. It is the right thing to do, and this is \nwhat the American people are asking us to do. The people in Minnesota \nare asking it. I have received scores of messages and letters from \nfolks saying move forward on this effort. It is the right thing to do.\n  Again, this issue is divisive. We bring deep, personal stories to the \ndebate. In the final analysis, we have before us a common ground, clear \ncommon-sense thing to do, and that is put an end to this gruesome \nprocedure.\n  I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania and stand in solid support with \nhim.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 11 minutes and 9 seconds.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield to the Senator from Illinois 7 minutes.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania for the \nexcellent work he has been doing on this ban on partial-birth abortion. \nI am an original cosponsor of Mr. Santorum's bill. I applaud him for \nhis hard work and toil on this issue, not just this year but for \nseveral previous years. In fact, Senator Santorum has been working on \nthis issue for some 7 years.\n  When you reflect that it has taken this long for this body to get to \nthis date where we are close to having a vote and we hope the bill will \npass and be signed by the President, you have to wonder what kind of a \nsociety have we become that it has taken us so long to get to the point \nwhere we are close to banning what to me seems to be a very cruel and \ninhumane procedure. It has been made abundantly clear, both in this \ndebate and in many Senate committee hearings on prior occasions, that \nbanning partial-birth abortion is a simple step those of us on both \nsides of the abortion issue should be able to coalesce and find common \nground over.\n  We are talking about banning a specific procedure in which a baby is \npartially delivered, scissors are stuck in the back of the baby's \nskull, a vacuum suction tube is inserted into the skull, and the baby's \nbrains are sucked out. We are banning this type of abortion only. Can \nwe not agree this is too cruel and inhumane a procedure to allow in the \nUnited States? As Senator Santorum has said, we are not banning other \ntypes of abortion.\n  I am struck that several times in the 4-plus years I have been in the \nSenate, we have on several occasions had debates on the Senate floor \nand votes in the Senate about banning cruel and inhumane treatment of \nanimals. In fact, I remember several years ago we had a debate over an \namendment brought by Senator Torricelli that would prohibit the use of \nfunds in the Interior budget to facilitate the use of steel-jawed traps \nand neck snares for commerce or recreation in a national wildlife \nrefuge.\n  During the debate on this amendment, my friend and colleague from \nNevada, Senator Reid, described the amendment to ban steel-jawed traps \nand neck snares as a ``no brainer.'' My colleague went on to say: \n``These traps are inhumane. They are designed to slam closed. The \nresult is lacerations, broken bones, joint dislocations, and \ngangrene.'' In concluding, Senator Reid stated: ``In this day and age \nthere is no need to resort to inhumane methods of trapping.''\n  Many Members were persuaded. I was persuaded. I voted to protect the \nanimals out West, the coyotes, wolves, and bears that were being \ninhumanely trapped in these steel-jawed traps and neck snares. Why were \nmany of us persuaded? Why were we all troubled by steel-jawed traps and \nneck snares? Is it because there is something in our gut that turns and \ntwists over the unnecessary suffering and pain of creatures with whom \nwe share this Earth; the majestic animals who are as much a part of \nGod's wonderful creation as we are; wonderful animals who add richness \nand texture to our own experience of the planet; animals whom we thank \nGod for allowing us to appreciate and admire?\n  The suffering of a bear or a deer can lead many of us to say no to a \nsteel-jawed trap or neck snare, but what about the scissor through the \nhead and neck of a child? What about sucking a baby's brains out? We \nwould not treat a mangy raccoon this way.\n  I remember a couple years back the Senate acted to do more to fight \nthe inhumane treatment of dolphins. I remember supporting an amendment \noffered by my friend and colleague, Senator Boxer, to the fiscal year \n2000 Commerce, Justice, State appropriations bill to force countries to \npay their fair share of the expenses of the Tuna Commission and delay \nthe importation of tuna caught using fishing methods that unnecessarily \nharm and kill dolphin. During debate on this amendment, Senator Boxer \nspoke eloquently of the thousands of dolphin killed each year by \nfishing methods that cruelly and unnecessarily harass, chase, circle, \nmaim, and kill dolphin\n\n[[Page S3570]]\n\nthat happen to be swimming over schools of tuna. I appreciated her \nefforts and others' efforts in the name of humaneness.\n  I believe our Maker has touched our human conscience with something \nthat makes us almost instinctively recoil from causing unnecessary pain \nand suffering to animals. I know there is a tender spot in the hearts \nof some who now oppose a ban on this cruel and inhumane procedure. I \nknow it is there because I have seen it in debates in this body. But I \ndon't understand how those who can hear the howl of the wolf or the \nsqueal of a dolphin can be deaf to the cry of an unborn child.\n  If people were sticking scissors in the heads of puppies, we would \nnot abide it. In the name of common decency and humanity, I urge my \ncolleagues not to let this happen any longer to our own young. I \napplaud Senator Santorum for the good work he has been doing. We will \nkeep fighting until we get this ban enacted into law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator from Illinois for his support both \nhere on the floor and things that we have done off the floor to get \nsupport for this legislation. He has been one of the champions. I \nappreciate his support as well as that of the Senator from Minnesota, \nhis very heartfelt support for this legislation and the very touching \npersonal story he related to the Senate.\n  How much time is remaining on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 3 minutes 10 \nseconds. The Senator from California has 3 minutes 53 seconds.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, just to reiterate, I do not believe we \nshould support the motion to commit. As I stated before, this is a \npiece of legislation we have had on the Senate floor. This is the fifth \ndebate on the floor of the Senate. The Judiciary Committee has held two \nhearings and reported the bill out.\n  It is not exactly the same. As I said before, it is not identical. We \nhave addressed issues of health and vagueness, but the substance is the \nsame. We are talking about the same thing. We are talking about \nchanging roughly 20 words in the statute. I think that is a small \nenough change for Members of the Senate to digest without the Judiciary \nCommittee going through and giving its opinion.\n  The Senator from Utah, Senator Hatch, came to the floor and addressed \nthe issues. Other members of the Judiciary Committee have been here and \ndone likewise, many of whom are cosponsors of this ban.\n  I believe this is, frankly, going to delay consideration of this \nlegislation. It will not have any impact or import in the long run to \nour deliberations. I think Members of the Senate are fully able to make \nthis decision at this time being well versed after this debate.\n  We have had a good debate over the last 3 days. We will continue to \ndo so, prior to passage. I think it is time to move forward. I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in opposing the motion to commit.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to start by answering Senator \nFitzgerald, who complimented me on my work. We have worked together on \nsaving dolphin and others. But since he couched it in the form of an \nattack, I think I would like to respond in this way.\n  My whole life has been dedicated to protecting children, women, the \nelderly, the infirm, and that is what my current position on this issue \nreflects. I want to ensure pregnancies are safe, that women have \nprenatal care so they have healthy babies and, yes, when a woman faces \na crisis pregnancy, that she can be saved--women, like some of the \nwomen in the Senator's own State of Illinois, who have to choose this \nparticular procedure that would be banned by his vote, without even an \nexception for the health of a woman. I find that position to be \ninhumane.\n  I want abortions to be safe, legal, and rare. I have to say to my \ncolleague from Illinois, if he wants to go back to the days when \nabortions were illegal, I could share some stories about people I knew \nwho were made infertile, and many whom I have read about who died. If \nyou want to go there, we will talk about it.\n\n  But right now we are talking about a bill that is a very important \nbill because it bans a procedure that women need to have available to \nthem on rare occasions. Because we are talking about a bill that is \nlegally identical--if I didn't use the term ``legally identical'' in \nevery case, I apologize--we are talking about a bill that is legally \nidentical to the bill that was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme \nCourt.\n  Senator Leahy agrees. He is the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary \nCommittee. I will ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record, \nif it has not been done so, his statement.\n  He says:\n\n       Senators deserve the benefit of full consideration and \n     vigorous debate before they are asked to cast a vote on such \n     a significant and complicated issue.\n\n  He says:\n\n       The Judiciary Committee has not had an opportunity to fully \n     debate the pros and cons of this issue in a hearing since \n     1997.\n\n  I would say to my colleagues, to heed the words of their own \nleaders--Senator Don Nickles, who excoriated Democrats for bypassing \nthe committees instead of bringing a bill to the floor, in which he \nsaid:\n\n       Bypassing the committee should not be repeated by Democrats \n     or Republicans. We have committees for a purpose so we can \n     have bipartisan input, so we can have the legislative process \n     work, so we can have hearings on legislation so people can \n     know what they are voting on.\n\n  It is the height of irresponsibility, it seems to me, when we are \ntalking about a bill that would deny a procedure that 45,000 OB/GYNs \nsay is sometimes necessary to save the health of the mother, not to \nhave a hearing on this particular piece of legislation since we have \nnot had one in a very long time and the Supreme Court chastised those \nwho wrote the Nebraska law because, they said, it did not really make \nany exception for the health of the woman even though the kinds of \nrisks that she faces are very serious.\n  Let's take a look at the risks that doctors tell us women face: \nHemorrhage, uterine rupture, blood clots, embolism, stroke, damage to \nnearby organs, and paralysis.\n  So I say to my friends who come here with such compassion in their \nheart, to be compassionate toward the mothers, too, to understand what \nthey may face. Let's send this to the Judiciary Committee. That is \nwhere it should be. Let them take a look at it and bring it back up.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, when Senator Santorum introduced S. 3 on \nFebruary 14, the leadership immediately placed the bill on the Senate \nLegislative Calendar, bypassing committee consideration of the bill. I \nrise today to support the motion to commit the bill for consideration \nby the Judiciary Committee.\n  Senators deserve the benefit of full consideration and vigorous \ndebate before they are asked to cast a vote on such a significant and \ncomplicated issue. In fact, the Judiciary Committee has not had an \nopportunity to fully debate the pros and cons of this issue in a \nhearing since 1997. Since that time, we have welcomed many individuals \nto the Senate, and to the Judiciary Committee, who were not members of \nthis body when the bill was last debated. In addition, since our last \nCommittee hearing, there has been judicial review of similar \nlegislation, including a Supreme Court decision, that should be fully \nvetted by the Judiciary Committee.\n  The committee referral process is there for a reason and we ought to \nrespect it. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have \nrepeatedly called for the Senate to follow these well-established \npractices.\n  For example, the distinguished senior Senator from Oklahoma \ncomplained in relation to the prescription drug bill last year: ``What \nhappened to the committee process? Shouldn't every member of the \nFinance Committee have a chance to say, `I think we can do a better \njob?' Maybe we can do it more efficiently or better. No, we bypass the \ncommittee and take it directly to the floor.'' Other senior Republican \nSenators likewise complained about the need to involve Senate \nCommittees and their expertise in development of prescription drug \nlegislation, energy legislation and many other matters. How\n\n[[Page S3571]]\n\nquickly they have changed their position. I have some respect for the \nSenate's established procedures and processes. I urge all Senators to \nsupport the motion to commit this matter initially to the Judiciary \nCommittee for a hearing and committee consideration. With Senator Hatch \nas the committee chair and with a majority Republican membership, I do \nnot understand what the Republican majority fears by having fair \nproceedings before the committee before the Senate is asked to take \nfinal action.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 259\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time under the previous order has expired. \nUnder the previous order, the Senate will now resume consideration of \nthe Durbin amendment, No. 259.\n  Under the previous order, there will now be 1 hour of debate equally \ndivided on the amendment.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 259, As Modified\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I send a modification of my amendment to \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to modifying the amendment? \nIf not, the amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 259), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1.

Ban on certain abortions.................................1531.''.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, with no objection, let me explain what I \nhave\n\n[[Page S3572]]\n\ndone because it is significant. I want to make it clear at the outset \nof this debate what I have done. If either side wishes to address it, I \nwant to explain my rationale.\n  In the original version of the amendment we said if the doctor \ncertified that a woman who was pregnant was eligible for a late-term \nabortion, certifying that her life was at stake if she continued the \npregnancy, or that she faced the threat of grievous physical injury--if \na doctor made that certification, we wanted to make certain it was the \ntruth. We provided in this bill that a doctor who knowingly certified \nthat a woman was eligible for a late-term abortion when he knew it was \nnot true ran the risk of losing his medical license, would no longer be \nable to practice medicine, and for the first offense a fine of \n$100,000, for the second offense a fine of $250,000.\n  There was also a provision later in the same bill which subjected \nthat same doctor to a potential criminal penalty for perjury.\n  I have spoken to some doctors who have said to me: Senator, \nunderstand, even if a mother's life is at risk, what you are asking \nthis doctor to decide, that he is willing--he or she is willing to risk \ntheir medical license to ever practice medicine again, face a fine of \n$100,000, and go to prison--how many doctors do you think, even under \nthe most difficult circumstances, would then undertake getting involved \nin terminating a pregnancy even if a mother's life is at stake?\n  I have thought about that. I rolled around last night thinking about \nthat. I came to the conclusion they are right. I think it is a \nsufficient penalty to say that a doctor who misrepresents on this \ncertification whether a mother's life is at stake or she faces a \ngrievous physical injury could lose his license to practice medicine \nand face a substantial fine.\n  The modification which has been accepted here removes the criminal \npenalty. But even the criminal penalty, which might be 2 years, is \nsomething that comes and goes. Losing your medical license for a \nlifetime is certainly a penalty felt by that person for the rest of his \nor her natural life.\n  I made this modification. There will be some who will say you have \nweakened this bill. I don't think the loss of a medical license and \nfacing a fine is a weakening of this bill to the point where doctors \nare now going to be less vigilant in making certain that they enforce \nthe provisions of my approach and my amendment.\n  Having said that, and having explained what I have done this morning \nwith this modification, and addressed the concerns of doctors and those \nof my colleagues who raised it, let me go to the heart of the issue.\n  We have talked today about a gruesome abortion procedure. I am still \ntouched by it every time it is described. Any sensitive human being \nwould be touched by it. But I will tell you there is no abortion \nprocedure which, if it is described in detail, would not touch your \nheart. You are talking about the elimination of a fetus, whether viable \nor not. You are talking about gruesome surgical circumstances. Why in \nthe world do we allow this to happen in America?\n  In the earliest stages of the pregnancy, we say we don't believe the \nfetus has reached the point of being a person. The argument about \nwhether the joining of the sperm and the egg creates a person has been \ngoing on for centuries. Different religions, different cultural \ntraditions, different countries, and different leaders have come to \ndifferent conclusions. Even people in medicine can't quite tell you \nwhen it becomes a person.\n  So the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade came up with some definitions in \ntrimester terms--the first three months, the second three months, and \nlast three months of pregnancy. They basically said in the first 3 \nmonths if a woman learns she is pregnant, it is basically her decision \nas to whether she wants to continue with the pregnancy or end it. In \nthe second three months, a more complicated decision. But in the last \nthree months--the seventh, eighth and ninth month of the pregnancy--the \nCourt has made it clear we will not terminate the pregnancy in that \nsituation unless there are compelling circumstances involving a threat \nto the life of the mother or a threat to the mother's health.\n  We have to put this conversation and debate into context. We are \ntalking about the termination of a pregnancy through an abortion \nprocedure where we have reached such a medical crisis that a doctor \nsays to a woman, I have to tell you, if you continue this pregnancy, it \ncould threaten your life. You may never bear this child because of the \ncomplications of this pregnancy, because you may die or I can tell you \nthis: You may go through this pregnancy and run the risk of endangering \nyour health permanently.\n  You say to yourself: What kind of endangerments would lead a woman to \nterminate a pregnancy late in the pregnancy? Senator Boxer has listed \nthem. You could be dealing with a uterine rupture in a pregnancy where \nthe woman understands that if she continues the pregnancy, she may \nnever be able to bear another child.\n  These are not theoreticals or hypotheticals dreamed up by Senate \nstaff and Members of the Senate. These are told us by doctors and by \nobstetricians who literally have to sit across the desk from a mother-\nto-be and say, I have terrible news. Something has happened we never \nanticipated. This late in the pregnancy you are facing something which \nyou didn't think would ever happen: The possibility of a hemorrhage \nthat could endanger your life, a uterine rupture that could endanger \nthe ability to have a child, blood clots, embolisms, stroke, danger to \nyour organs of a permanent nature, and even paralysis.\n\n  I have spoken to women who have been through this. Believe me, this \nwas not a casual, easy decision. These women, late in pregnancy, were \ncounting the days when finally their back stopped hurting them and \nfinally they could get back to normal clothes and have the baby in \ntheir arms. They were waiting expectantly for that, only to learn at \nthe last minute in the pregnancy something had happened that no one had \nanticipated.\n  The amendment which I offer says let us make certain if we are going \nto draw the line on the termination of pregnancy late in the pregnancy, \nlet us make certain we don't forget there are two things that need to \nbe respected. One of those comes down to the basic premise of \nphilosophy of the mother first. Hardly anyone argues with this. If it \nis a choice between the life of the mother and the life of a fetus, \nmost religious traditions and most people would say, For goodness \nsakes, you save the mother. You save the mother.\n  The Durbin amendment says you can only terminate the pregnancy late \nin the pregnancy, after viability, in the final trimester, give or take \na few days, you could only terminate it if the mother's life is at \nstake. I hope there is no argument about that.\n  The second part is equally important. This is the part where we have \na division of opinion. We part company here in the Senate; that is, \nwhether or not you should allow late-term abortions when a mother faces \nthe possibility of a grievous physical injury, as I have described. I \nthink you should. At least I think the option should be there.\n  If some mother in that circumstance takes the heroic position that \nshe may never be able to have another child, but she wants to go \nforward with this pregnancy, that is her decision. That is the decision \nfor her and her family and conscience. It is one she can make.\n  But what we are seeing here with the underlying bill is we don't want \nto create the possibility for that decision to be made. We want to \nforeclose the possibility that a woman facing the threat of grievous \nphysical injury late in her pregnancy would make the decision to \nterminate the pregnancy.\n  I think it is a mistake. I think we have pushed ourselves into \nmedical judgment and medical decisions in a way we never should have \ndone. Whether you are pro-life or pro-choice, should we not create an \nopportunity for that mother who has just been hit between the eyes with \nthe knowledge that what was a perfect pregnancy has sadly gone the \nwrong way and that now if she continues that pregnancy she may endanger \nher life or endanger her ability to have another child?\n  These are tough decisions.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. As soon as I am completed, I would be happy to, and I \nwill yield on the Senator's time and on his sides time.\n  But I will just say if we are going to err in judgment here, let us \nat least err\n\n[[Page S3573]]\n\non the side of understanding that there are medical complications and \nthere are medical problems which we cannot as simple lawyers and \nlegislators even envision. Let us defer to the professionals, the \nobstetricians and gynecologists who have written to us and said, Please \ndon't pass S. 3, the Santorum amendment. There are moments in time when \nwe have to make critical medical decisions, and in those moments we \nhave to do what is best for the woman involved here. Don't foreclose an \nopportunity. Don't tell us we cannot do it. Don't make it be prohibited \nunder law.\n\n  That, I think, is what this debate is all about. I will tell you that \nthis amendment which I have offered does not have universal acceptance \neither on the pro-choice or the pro-life side. Even this morning a pro-\nchoice group notified me that people voting for the Durbin amendment \nare not going to be viewed in a popular and favorable light. I consider \nmyself pro-choice in my approach to this decision. I know now that some \npro-choice groups disagree with us because this amendment is very \nstrict and very specific. It says when it comes to postviability \nabortions and late-term abortions, we are laying down very strict \nlimitations and guidelines as to when you can be eligible for this.\n  This says it isn't just matter of a doctor performing the abortion \nreaching the decision. It is a matter that has to be confirmed by \nanother doctor. An independent doctor has to certify, yes, if that \npregnancy goes forward, that mother's life is at stake, if that \npregnancy goes forward that mother is facing the risk of grievous \nphysical injury, and if that doctor misrepresents the condition of the \nmother, that doctor stands to lose his medical license and faces fines \nup to a quarter of a million dollars. I think this is as tough as it \ncan be, and as tough as it should be to make certain we don't have \nabortions in late-term pregnancies except for the most serious and \ntragic circumstances.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators Harkin and \nLieberman be added as cosponsors to my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I want to make four quick points. I had \nthree and a half points as reasons to oppose the amendment, but now I \nhave a full-fledged four reasons because of the modification that was \njust submitted.\n  No. 1, this amendment is in the form of a substitute, so the \nunderlying partial-birth abortion statute is gone. We do not ban \npartial-birth abortions under this procedure. It is gone. This \nprocedure remains legal in the law of the land. This Durbin amendment \nis a substitute. If you want to ban partial-birth abortions, you cannot \nvote for the Durbin amendment because it eliminates the ban. That is \nNo. 1.\n  No. 2, it talks about this is a postviability ban. The problem with \nthat is--there are many problems--No. 1, viability is not defined in \nthe legislation, and it is solely up to the discretion of the \nabortionist performing the procedure.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the chart that \nI have on survival rates.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                     Weeks                         Number      Percent\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n22............................................            1            0\n23............................................           42           36\n24............................................           61           69\n25............................................           77           71\n26............................................           76           87\n27............................................           92           83\n28............................................          105           96\n29............................................          100           95\n30............................................          141           92\n31............................................          184           96\n32............................................          267           98\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. And even up to 32, 33 weeks, you still have a 1, 2, 3-\npercent chance where the baby would not be viable. So you have up until \n32, 33 weeks to basically say the child is not viable. If that is the \ncase, this statute is not operative. You cannot even come in under it. \nThere is nothing. The statute does not exist. All you have to do is say \nit is not viable. So you create an exception that swallows up the \nentire ban. That is No. 2.\n  No. 3, even if, by some point, the abortionist will say it is viable, \nand then proceed with an abortion--which I cannot imagine any \nphysician, in their right mind, doing; but assuming they would say it \nis viable and proceed with an abortion--they just have to say there is \na risk of grievous injury to her physical health. The operative word \nhere is ``risk''--a 1-percent risk, a .5-percent risk, a .001-percent \nrisk--any risk.\n  Now, ``risk'' is, again, not clearly defined and is open. What this \nstatute does say is it is subject to a second opinion from a doctor. \nGreat. The problem is, there is no penalty anymore. That was half a \nproblem because I thought the penalties were rather weak. Now, with the \nelimination of any potential prosecution under perjury, there are no \npenalties.\n  The Senator from Illinois says there could be a losing of your \nlicense. Well, that is not what his substitute says. It says the State \nhas to develop procedures and requirements for what would happen if \nthese things are violated. It does not say license revocation. It does \nnot say that at all. It says they have to develop standards. And it \ncould be suspension for a day for the first offense, 2 days for the \nsecond offense--half a day--it could be whatever the State would \nrequire it to be. And for the second offense, it is not that it must be \nrevoked, it is not a must. It is an either/or. They could assess a \nfine. And the fine could be a dollar. It says up to $250,000, but it \ncould be a dollar.\n  So now, having removed any criminal sanction, you are left with it \nbeing completely open-ended, with potentially no consequence for \nsomeone not telling the truth in this circumstance.\n  There are a whole host of other reasons this amendment does not work. \nBut this amendment is fatally flawed. It was poor, in my opinion, as a \nsubstitute. But now it does not even have the criminal sanctions as \neven one potential hope for getting maybe some very late, third-\ntrimester abortions banned. So I just suggest, while I understand why \nthe Senator from Illinois modified his amendment--to try to get more \nfolks to be supportive of his amendment--in so doing, he guts whatever \nis left of this amendment to actually ban any abortions in this \ncountry. As a result of that, I strongly oppose the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment to \nS. 3 that has been offered by my friend and colleague from Illinois. \nWhen the Senate considered the partial-birth abortion ban in 1999, we \ndecisively rejected, in a vote of 61 to 38, a very similar amendment \nsponsored by my friend from Illinois. And, once again, I believe we \nshould reject this amendment today.\n  Let me say to my colleague and dear friend from Illinois, he is a man \nof great integrity, great passion, and great compassion. He is someone \nwith whom I have worked on this floor on many different issues. I know \nwe will work together again on other issues. We worked together a few \nweeks ago on an amendment that we were successful in getting the Senate \nto pass to add additional money for the worldwide AIDS effort.\n  But I do believe the amendment he has offered--however well intended \nit is--is tragically flawed. The Senator from Illinois contends his \ncurrent amendment would ban all partial-birth abortions after a fetus \nis viable unless two doctors certify that continuing the pregnancy \nwould threaten the mother's life or risk grievous injury to her \nphysical health. Now, this may sound very reasonable, and does. But in, \nreality, this amendment has loopholes so big that abortion providers \nwould be able to continue to perform virtually all the partial-birth \nabortions they perform today.\n  Why? Why do I say that?\n  First, the amendment ties the availability of late-term abortions to \nthe risk of grievous injury to the mother. That sounds reasonable. But \nlet's be clear about this. Grievous injury is, of course, by \ndefinition, necessarily subject to the so-called medical judgment of \nthe abortion provider. The effect of this amendment is ambiguous on its\n\n[[Page S3574]]\n\nown terms because the term ``medical judgment'' has, of course, a great \ndeal of built-in flexibility. Specifically, under the precedent set by \nthe U.S. Supreme Court, in 1973, in the Doe v. Bolton case:\n\n       Medical judgment may be exercised in the light of all \n     factors--physical, emotional, psychological, familial, and \n     the woman's age--relevant to the well being of the patient. \n     All these factors may relate to health. . . .\n\n  That is from Doe v. Bolton.\n  Clearly, this precedent shows us there is a wide range of factors \nthat can legally be taken into account in assessing medical judgment, \nso many factors that they create a host of loopholes through which many \npartial-birth abortionists--such as Dr. Martin Haskell, whom I have \nreferenced on the floor before, who lives in my home State of Ohio, in \nDayton--could easily slip through.\n  Further, under this amendment, who would make the call that the \nmother's life is threatened or that her physical health is at risk? We \nknow the answer. Naturally, it would be primarily up to the abortion \nprovider.\n  Although in nonemergencies, the abortionist would need to get one \nother doctor to agree with him, the amendment of the Senator from \nIllinois contains a medical emergency clause which permits the \nabortionist to decide to do an abortion without certifying anything \nprior to doing the procedure. Even worse, Mr. President and Members of \nthe Senate, in those situations when the abortionist declares an \nemergency, he or she does not need to get independent confirmation from \nanyone--from no one. In other words, it is totally up to the \nabortionist's discretion.\n  In practice, in the real world, this likely means there will be \nabsolutely no limit on the will of the abortionist. The doctor who will \nbe certifying these procedures is a person like Dr. Haskell, a man who \nadmitted that most of the abortions he already performs are elective--\nelective. That is Dr. Martin Haskell, and that is what he does.\n  Why do I talk about Dr. Haskell? I talk about him because I am \nfamiliar with him because he lives in my home State, but much more \nimportantly, because he is typical of the people who provide these \nabortions. They are not your ``Dr. Welbys.'' They are not your typical \nOB/GYNs. They are not surgeons. They are people who do this day in and \nday out, and that is what they do.\n  Let there be no misunderstanding. I want my colleagues, and I want \nthe American people, to understand exactly who Dr. Haskell is and what \nit is that this man does for a living, what his livelihood is, what his \nmission is, what it is he does day in and day out to these innocent \nlittle babies. He kills them. That is what he does for a living.\n  Let's make no mistake about it. This man is going to do everything he \ncan to maintain his livelihood.\n  He has a vested interest in performing partial-birth abortions. This \namendment before us now is going to give him the ticket he needs to \ncontinue these procedures. The amendment by definition creates a \nloophole so big that Dr. Haskell and the other abortionists just like \nhim could drive trucks through it. This amendment will allow them to \ncontinue to do what they do on a daily basis; that is, kill innocent \nbabies, babies who, if given the chance, could be born and could grow \nup and could thrive and live productive lives and make positive \ncontributions to our country.\n  Ultimately my colleagues need to know and the American people need to \nknow that Dr. Martin Haskell in Dayton, OH is not your family practice \nphysician. He is not ``Dr. Welby.'' He kills babies. That is what he \ndoes for a living. This is the person who, under this amendment, \ntragically, would be charged with making the medical judgments. When \nDr. Haskell needs to seek a second opinion, which is provided under \nthis amendment, from a so-called independent physician as required \nunder the amendment to determine if the procedure is necessary, who do \nyou think he is going to ask? Do you think he is going to really ask \nthe local family practice doctor nearby? We know he is not going to. He \nis going to ask one of his other abortion provider friends. We know \nthat is what the truth is.\n  That is the way the world works. That is what is going to happen. If \nanyone believes otherwise, they are not living in the real world. That \nis the world of abortionists; that is the way it is.\n  In practice, this amendment would likely put no limit on the will of \nthe abortionist. The doctor who will be certifying is a Dr. Haskell or \nsomeone like him or perhaps a third-trimester abortionist such as Dr. \nWarn Hern who wrote the textbook ``Abortion Practice.'' Dr. Hern has \nargued that the fact of an occasional death in childbearing can justify \nany abortion, no matter how late in pregnancy it is performed. As he \nstated in the May 15, 1997 Washington Times:\n\n       I will certify that any pregnancy is a threat to a woman's \n     life and could cause grievous injury to her physical health.\n\n  So even a so-called grievous injury exception potentially would allow \nan abortionist to perform a partial-birth abortion on any pregnant \nwoman.\n  The second problem with the Durbin amendment is that its ban on \npartial-birth abortions is practically meaningless because the \namendment on its own terms only applies to a fetus that is already \nviable. It does not apply to a fetus that is not viable. We know the \noverwhelming majority of partial-birth abortions--it has been estimated \nover 90 percent--occur between 20 and 26 weeks of pregnancy, not during \nthe third trimester. Clearly, this amendment would not even apply to \nvery many partial-birth abortions at all.\n  Even worse, the determination of viability is left entirely within \nthe discretion of the abortionist. In other words, this amendment would \nallow someone like Dr. Martin Haskell to make the very subjective \ndecision whether or not a fetus is viable. The amendment would allow \nDr. Haskell to decide whether or not he even wanted to comply with the \namendment. We all know what his decision would be in these cases. In \nfact, my fear is this amendment would allow thousands of these gruesome \nprocedures to continue to be performed in the fifth and sixth months of \npregnancy, horrific and painful and inhumane procedures performed on \nhealthy babies of healthy mothers.\n  Yesterday I talked about Brenda Pratt Shafer, an experienced \nregistered nurse who was assigned to an Ohio abortion clinic in the \nearly 1990s. She witnessed partial-birth abortions. She saw what Dr. \nHaskell does for a living because she worked for a short time at Dr. \nHaskell's office. She testified before Congress about it. I would like \nto conclude today with her story because it clearly shows what happens \nwhen an abortionist like Dr. Haskell is left unrestrained. Here is what \nshe said in describing one of the horrifying procedures she witnessed:\n\n       The young woman was 18, unmarried, and a little over 6 \n     months pregnant. She cried the entire 3 days she was at the \n     abortion clinic. The doctor told us, ``I'm afraid she's going \n     to want to see the baby. Try to discourage her from it; we \n     don't like them to see the babies.'' We gave her some IV-\n     valium to calm her down, but she was never totally knocked \n     out.\n       The baby's heartbeat was clearly visible on the ultrasound \n     screen. I stood 3 feet from the doctor as he took the forceps \n     and brought the baby's legs down through the birth canal.\n       He delivered the baby's body and arms, everything but his \n     little head. The baby's body was moving. His little fingers \n     were clasping together.\n       He was kicking his feet. The baby was hanging there, and \n     the doctor was holding his neck to keep his head from \n     slipping out. The doctor took a pair of scissors and inserted \n     them into the back of the baby's head, and the baby's arms \n     jerked out in a flinch, a startle reaction, like a baby does \n     when he thinks he might fall. Then the doctor opened up the \n     scissors, stuck the high-powered suction tube into the hole \n     and sucked the baby's brains out. The baby went completely \n     limp. Then, the doctor pulled the head out, and threw the \n     baby into a pan.\n       When the mother started coming around, she was crying ``I \n     want to see my baby.'' So we cleaned him up and put him into \n     a blanket. We put her in a private room and handed her the \n     baby. She held that baby in her arms and when she looked into \n     his face, she started screaming ``Oh my God, what have I \n     done? This is my baby.''\n       At that point, I couldn't take it. In my 14 years of \n     nursing, I had been pretty strong. But this was different. I \n     started choking. I excused myself and ran to the bathroom. It \n     was horrible, and I didn't fully understand my reaction. \n     Then, I had to go back and take that baby away from his \n     mother. She was so hysterical, and all she kept saying was, \n     ``It was a baby; he was so beautiful.''\n\n  Many other beautiful babies are dying the same tragic deaths. Quite \nsimply, we as a country, as a people, should not tolerate it. We should \nnot tolerate it anymore. We must not allow\n\n[[Page S3575]]\n\nit to continue. We must not pass amendments that would allow it to \ncontinue even under a legal ban of the partial-birth abortion \nprocedure.\n  No matter how well-intentioned the amendment is, it is abundantly \nclear it would allow this partial-birth abortion procedure to continue. \nTherefore, I ask my colleagues to defeat the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to my colleague, the \nSenator from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized for \n10 minutes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise to speak to this important issue \nfor a few moments and begin by saying that the event the Senator from \nOhio described is indeed extremely troubling and would be classified as \nhorrific by most people. If the Durbin amendment were adopted, that \nwould not happen again unless the mother's life, through the \ndetermination of the physician, was in jeopardy, or her grievous \nphysical health.\n  I argue with the Senator from Ohio and the Senator from Pennsylvania \nthat if they were indeed--and I respect both Senators--serious about \nstopping what Senator DeWine just described, the Durbin amendment has \nthe best chance of stopping that from ever happening again than the \npending bill by the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  That is why I support the Durbin amendment. That is why I am a \ncosponsor of the Durbin amendment. Many of us come to the floor with \nvery good intentions, to try to work to help fashion some compromises \nthat would end what was just described, but also allowing for the \nConstitution to provide a framework according to Roe v. Wade, which \ndoes not represent--although it has been characterized inappropriately, \nand not clearly by both sides, because this debate, unfortunately, for \n30 years or more, has been held hostage by the extremes on both sides.\n  I want to review, for the purpose of this debate, some writings from \nRoe v. Wade. To my friends on the pro-choice side, let me remind them \nof a paragraph in Roe v. Wade, written by Justice Blackmun:\n\n       Some argue that a women's right is absolute and that she is \n     entitled to terminate her pregnancy at whatever time, in \n     whatever way, and for whatever reasons she alone chooses. \n     With this we do not agree.\n\n  Roe v. Wade does not support that proposition. Let me read, for the \npro-life community, from this decision, which was delicately crafted to \naddress a very complex constitutional provision that was framed \ninitially in the Bill of Rights, supported by the Constitution, and \nthose principles are the principles of life, liberty, and happiness, \nnot just for the fetus, for the unborn, for young children, but life, \nliberty, and happiness for people of all ages and all conditions in \nlife, male and female, slave and free.\n  For the pro-life community, let me read what the Justices said:\n\n       A State criminal abortion statute of the current Texas \n     type, that excepts from criminality only a lifesaving \n     procedure on behalf of the mother, without regard to \n     pregnancy stage and without recognition of the other \n     interests involved [obviously], is violative of the Due \n     Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n  I suggest unless there are a majority of Senators willing to change \nthe Constitution and remove the 14th amendment, this debate is going \nnowhere. The fact is that the Constitution supports a framework in \nwhich life and liberty for everyone, including the unborn, have to be \ntaken into consideration.\n  I argue that the Senator from Illinois puts forth a very good \namendment on the floor because we want to attempt, as a society, to \noutlaw late-term abortions, which violates our sense of decency and \nmorality, within the framework of the Constitution, unless the woman's \nlife is at risk or unless the woman is in grave physical health.\n  The American people do not agree with the extremes on both sides. The \nfact is, with all due respect to the Senators from Pennsylvania and \nOhio, this is not an amendment that anybody could put on the floor that \nthey would agree to, because they are opposed to abortion in every \ncase, under every circumstance. They believe it should be outlawed. \nThey are entitled to that position, to represent it, and they are \nentitled to run on it, which they have, and they have gotten elected. \nBut I say that the majority of people in the country believe that in \nsome situations abortion should be legal and safe, and we are \nattempting to make it more rare. But without the support of either the \nright or the left, the Senator from Illinois puts forth this amendment \nin good faith, and I support him, and so do some Republican Senators.\n  The country is very torn. In reading this decision, as I just \nreviewed portions of it, you can understand that the Justices \nthemselves thought it was a very delicate compromise that had to be put \ntogether based on the Constitution and the laws and views of the \nAmerican public.\n\n  According to recent polling, only 33 percent, or less, of the \npopulation would ban all abortions under all circumstances; 29 percent \nwould allow unfettered abortions; and the vast majority of Americans \nfall in the middle, which is understandable.\n  Late-term abortions are one of those positions we can actually do \nsomething about. While people have mixed views about it, this amendment \nwould in fact outlaw all late-term abortions, all procedures.\n  The Santorum amendment only attempts to outlaw one procedure. I argue \nthat once the Court is faced with it, it is not going to uphold it. So \nthe end result of this debate is going to be not stopping one late-term \nabortion, when Senator Durbin's amendment would actually accomplish \nthat end.\n  The Durbin amendment draws a line at a place that--well, it is not \ncrystal clear, but I ask you, what could possibly be crystal clear \nabout this debate? Is anything crystal clear about it? Even though we \nthink we are the smartest 100 people around, I think we can argue that \nwe could not even make this debate crystal clear. There is no clarity \nabout it. All you can do is do your very best. The Durbin amendment \nattempts to draw the line of viability. I argue that somebody else \ncould put up another line. But at least viability has some clarity in \nmedical terms. It is understandable, and I think acceptable, to the \nAmerican people.\n  Viability is a line that was recognized by the Supreme Court as part \nof the original decision. As medical research gets clearer--not \nperfectly crystal clear, but as it brings forth new information, it is \nsomething we can use in terms of the measurement.\n\n       The State has still another important and legitimate \n     interest in protecting the potentiality of human life. These \n     interests are separate and distinct. Each grows in \n     substantiality as the woman approaches term and, at a point \n     during pregnancy, each becomes compelling.\n\n  That was also written by the Court.\n  The Durbin amendment says that when we reach the point of viability, \nthe interest in the potential of human life is compelling; it cannot be \nended without serious cause. This amendment raises the standards for \nlate-term abortions from its current just general health to physical \nhealth, which is why many on the left cannot support it.\n  I think given the urgency of the Court and the Congress to protect \nviable life, perhaps raising the standard is necessary and I hope will \nbe upheld by the Court.\n  If my colleagues are interested in actually banning late-term \nabortion--which I most certainly support, and the vast majority of \npeople in Louisiana support--we should not engage in the politics of \ndivision but try to reach common ground to do this. I believe the \nDurbin amendment offers us that very opportunity.\n  I urge my colleagues to look beyond the rhetoric and to leave the \nfringe and move to the middle. Is this the answer to this whole \nquestion? No. But is it a step in the right direction to minimize \nabortions in this country? Yes. Is it something that would meet the \nconstitutional test? Yes. Is it something that could be perfected over \ntime? Yes. It is something that could have a direct impact on building \nthe kind of compromise of which I think we could be proud. So I \nstrongly urge my colleagues to support the Durbin amendment based on \nall that I have outlined.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Ms. MILULSKI. Mr. President, I express my strong support for the \nDurbin amendment.\n\n[[Page S3576]]\n\n  I support the Durbin amendment because it is consistent with my four \nprinciples. These are my principles: It respects the constitutional \nunderpinnings of Roe v. Wade. It prohibits all post-viability \nabortions, regardless of the procedure used. It provides an exception \nfor the life and health of a woman, which is both intellectually \nrigorous and compassionate. And it leaves medical decisions in the \nhands of physicians--not politicians.\n  The Durbin alternative addresses this difficult issue with the \nintellectual rigor and seriousness of purpose it deserves. We are not \nbeing casual. We are not angling for political advantage. We are not \nlooking for cover.\n  The Durbin amendment offers the Senate a sensible alternative, one \nthat would prohibit post-viability abortions while respecting the \nConstitution and protecting women's lives. I believe it is an \nalternative that reflects the views of the American people.\n  I support the Durbin amendment because it is a stronger, more \neffective approach to banning late term abortions. The Durbin amendment \nrespects the Constitution and the Supreme Court's ruling in Roe v. \nWade. The Santorum bill before us does not. It is unconstitutional.\n  In fact, the Supreme Court ruled in Stenberg v. Carhart just 3 years \nago that a Nebraska state law that bans certain abortion procedures is \nunconstitutional. The Supreme Court ruled it was unconstitutional for \ntwo reasons. First, it did not include an exception for a woman's \nhealth. Second, it does not clearly define the procedure it aims to \nprohibit and would ban other procedures, sometimes used early in \npregnancy.\n  The bill before us, the Santorum bill, is nearly identical to the \nNebraska law the Supreme Court struck down. The proponents of this \nlegislation say they have made changes to the bill to address the \nSupreme Court's ruling. They have not. It still does not include an \nexception to protect the health of the woman. It still does not clearly \ndefine the procedure it claims to prohibit. Let me be clear about this. \nThe Santorum bill is unconstitutional.\n  The Santorum bill violates the key principles of Roe v. Wade and \nother Court decisions. When the Court decided Roe, it was faced with \nthe task of defining. ``When does life begin?'' Theologians and \nscientists differ on this. People of good will and good conscience \ndiffer on this.\n  So the Supreme Court used viability as its standard. Once a fetus is \nviable it is presumed to have not only a body, but a mind and spirit. \nTherefore it has standing under the law as a person.\n  The Roe decision is quite clear. States can prohibit abortion after \nviability so long as they permit exceptions in cases involving the \nwoman's life or health. Under Roe, states can prohibit most late term \nabortions. And 41 states have done so.\n  In my own state of Maryland, we have a law that does just that. It \nwas adopted by the Maryland General Assembly. It prohibits post \nviability abortions. It provides an exception to protect the life or \nhealth of the woman, as the Constitution requires. It also provides an \nexception if the fetus is affected by a genetic defect or a serious \nabnormality. This law reflects the views of Marylanders. It was \napproved by the people of Maryland by referendum.\n  Like the Maryland law, the Durbin alternative is consistent with Roe. \nIt is a compassionate, Constitutional approach to prohibiting late term \nabortions.\n  It says that after the point of viability no woman should be able to \nabort a viable fetus. The only exception can be when the woman faces a \nthreat to her life or serious and debilitating risk to her health as \nrequired by the Constitution.\n  The Durbin amendment is stronger than the Santorum bill. It bans all \npost viability abortions. Unlike the Santorum bill, the Durbin \namendment doesn't create loopholes by allowing other procedures to be \nused.\n  I believe there is no Senator who thinks a woman should abort \na viable fetus for a frivolous, non-medical reason. It does not matter \nwhat procedure is used. It is wrong, and we know it. The Durbin \nalternative bans those abortions. It is a real solution.\n\n  On the other hand, Senator Santorum's bill does not stop a single \nabortion. It does not ban all late term abortions. It bans certain \nprocedures and diverts doctors to other procedures. This approach is \nboth hollow and ineffective. It bans procedures that may be the safest \nfor a woman's health. But let me be clear. Under Santorum, late term \nabortions would still be allowed to happen.\n  It does not make late term abortions more rare. It makes them more \ndangerous. And for that reason, the Santorum approach is ineffective.\n  The Durbin amendment providers a tough and narrow health exception \nthat is both intellectually rigorous and compassionate. It will ensure \nthat women who confront a grave health crisis late in a pregnancy can \nreceive the treatment they need. The Durbin amendment defines such a \ncrisis as a ``severely debilitating disease or impairment caused or \nexacerbated by pregnancy'' or ``an inability to provide necessary \ntreatment to a life-threatening condition.''\n  And we don't leave it up to her doctor alone. We require that a \nsecond, independent physician also certify that the procedure is the \nmost appropriate for the unique circumstances of the woman's life.\n  I want to be very clear in this. The Durbin amendment does not create \na loophole with its health exception. We are not loophole shopping when \nwe insist that an exception be made in the case of serious and \ndebilitating threats to a woman's physical health. This is what the \nConstitution requires--and the reality of women's lives demands.\n  Let's face it. Women do sometimes face profound medical crises during \npregnancy. Breast cancer, for example, occurs in one in 3,000 \npregnancies. In some unfortunate circumstances, pregnant women in their \nsecond trimester discover lumps in their breasts and are diagnosed with \ninvasive breast cancer. Continuing the pregnancy--and delaying medical \ntreatment--would put a woman's health in grave danger.\n  The Durbin amendment recognizes that to deny a woman in a situation \nlike this access to the abortion that could save her life and physical \nhealth would be unconscionable. To deny her other children a chance to \nknow a healthy mother would be unconscionable.\n  When the continuation of the pregnancy is causing profound health \nproblems, a woman's doctor must have every tool available to respond. I \nreadily acknowledge that the procedure described by my colleagues on \nthe other side is a grim one. I do not deny that. But there are times \nwhen the realities of women's lives and health dictates that this \nmedical tool be available.\n  I support the Durbin alternative because it leaves medical decisions \nup to doctors, not legislators. It relies on medical judgement, not \npolitical judgement about what is best for a patient.\n  Not only does the Santorum bill not let doctors be doctors, it \ncriminalizes them for making the best choice for their patients.\n  Under this bill, a doctor could be sent to prison for up to two years \nfor doing what he or she thinks is necessary to save a woman's life or \nhealth. I say that's wrong.\n  In fact, those who oppose the Durbin amendment say it is flawed \nprecisely because it leaves medical judgements up to physicians. Well, \nwho else should decide? Would the other side prefer to have the \ngovernment make medical decisions?\n  I disagree with that. I believe we should not substitute a political \njudgment for medical judgement. We need to let doctors be doctors. This \nis my principle whether we are talking about reproductive choice or any \nhealth care matter.\n  Physicians have the training and expertise to make medical decisions. \nThey are in the best position to recommend what is necessary or \nappropriate for their patients. Not bureaucrats. Not managed care \naccountants. And certainly not legislators.\n  The Durbin amendment provides sound public policy, not a political \nsoundbite. It is our best chance to address the concerns many of us \nhave about late term abortions.\n  Today, we have an opportunity today to do something real. We have an \nopportunity to let logic and common sense win the day. We have an \nopportunity to do something that I know reflects the views of the \nAmerican people. Today, we can pass the Durbin amendment.\n  We can say that we value life, and that we value our Constitution. We \ncan\n\n[[Page S3577]]\n\nmake clear that a viable fetus should not be aborted. We can say that \nwe want to save women's lives and protect women's health.\n  The only way to do this, Mr. President, is to vote for the Durbin \namendment. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I thank Senator Durbin for introducing this \nvery important measure for the women of this Nation. Today, we continue \ndebate on the critical issue of allowing women to choose what is right \nfor them, their health and their families.\n  In 1973--26 years ago now--the Supreme Court affirmed for the first \ntime a woman's right to choose. This landmark decision was carefully \ncrafted to be both balanced and responsible while holding the rights of \nwomen in America paramount in reproductive decisions. It is clear that \nthe underlying Santorum bill does not hold the rights of women \nparamount--instead it infringes on those rights in the most grievous of \ncircumstances.\n  Indeed, S. 3 undermines basic tenets of Roe v. Wade, which maintained \nthat women have a constitutional right to an abortion, but after \nviability--the time at which it first becomes realistically possible \nfor fetal life to be maintained outside the woman's body--States could \nban abortions only if they also allowed exceptions for cases in which a \nwoman's life or health is endangered. And the Supreme Court reaffirmed \ntheir support for exceptions for health of the mother just three years \nago.\n  In Stenberg vs. Carhart, a case involving the constitutionality of \nNebraska's partial birth abortion ban statute, the Supreme Court \ninvalidated the Nebraska statute because it lacks an exception for the \nperformance of the D & X, dilation and extraction, procedure when \nnecessary to protect the health of the mother, and because it imposes \nan undue burden on a woman's ability to have an abortion. This case was \nrepresentative of 21 cases throughtout the Nation. Regrettably, \nhowever, Senator Santorum's legislation disregards both Supreme Court \ndecisions by not providing an exception for the health of the mother \nand providing only a narrowly defined life exception.\n  And let there be no mistake--I stand here today to reaffirm that no \nviable fetus should be aborted--by any method--unless it is absolutely \nnecessary to protect the life or health of the mother, period.\n  Senator Durbin's amendment, which I have cosponsored in the past and \nagain this year, specifies that post-viability abortions would only be \nlawful if the physician performing the abortion and an independent \nphysician certified in writing that continuation of the pregnancy would \nthreaten the mother's life or risk grievous injury to her physical \nhealth. It mirrors laws already on the books in forty-one states, \nincluding my home state of Maine, which ban post-viability abortions \nwhile at the same time including life and health exceptions mandated by \nthe Supreme Court under Roe v. Wade.\n  Furthermore, this amendment will lower the number of abortions \nbecause it bans all post-viability abortions. S. 3, in contrast, will \nnot prevent a single abortion. Sadly, it will force women to choose \nanother, potentially more harmful procedure.\n  Is this what we really want? To put women's health and lives at risk? \nAnd shouldn't these most critical decisions be left to those with \nmedical training--not politicians?\n  The findings in S. 3 would have you believe that this procedure is \nnever necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother and that \nin fact it poses significant health risks to a woman. This is simply \nnot true. Let me explain why there must be a health exception for \n``grievous physical injury'' in two circumstances:\n\n  First, the language applies in those heart-wrenching cases where a \nwanted pregnancy seriously threatens the health of the mother. The \nlanguage would allow a doctor in these tragic cases to perform an \nabortion because he or she believes it is critical to preserving the \nhealth of a woman facing: Peripartal cardiomyopathy, a form of cardiac \nfailure which is often caused by the pregnancy, which can result in \ndeath or untreatable heart disease; pre-eclampsia, or high blood \npressure which is caused by a pregnancy, which can result in kidney \nfailure, stroke or death; and uterine ruptures which could result in \ninfertility.\n  Second, the language also applies when a woman has a life-threatening \ncondition which requires life-saving treatment. It applies to those \ntragic cases, for example,when a woman needs chemotherapy when \npregnant, so the families face the terrible choice of continuing the \npregnancy or providing life-saving treatment. These conditions include: \nBreast cancer; lymphoma, which has a fifty percent mortality rate if \nuntreated; and primary pulmonary hypertension, which has a 50 percent \nmaternal mortality rate.\n  Now, I ask my colleagues, who could seriously object under these \ncircumstances?\n  Mr. President, I believe this is a common sense approach to a serious \nproblem for American women and a contentious issue for the United \nStates Congress. I am grateful to my colleague, Senator Durbin, for \nchampioning this approach and I urge my colleagues--pro-life and pro-\nchoice--to join together to support this amendment to ban all abortions \nafter viability. Let's reduce the number of abortions in this country \nat the same time we protect the lives and health of women.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I want to review what the Senator from \nLouisiana said with respect to abortion. I think the Senator from \nLouisiana expressed her view as to what Roe v. Wade means. I sincerely \nbelieve that she feels that way. She would like the law to be that way, \nand I think most Americans would like the law to be more toward her \ndirection than where it really is.\n  The law is pretty clear--Roe v. Wade and the companion cases--that in \nfact the right to an abortion is, in America today, at any time for any \nreason.\n  That is what happens. You can cite the case in Roe that talks about \nthe issue of viability, but there was the Doe v. Bolton case that was \ndecided with it; it was read together.\n  In Doe v. Bolton, the Court ruled abortion could be performed after \nfetal viability if the operative physician judged the procedure \nnecessary to protect the life or health of the woman. That is where we \ncome down, health of the woman. Under Doe v. Bolton, the health of the \nwoman is anything--is anything. The Senator from Ohio just read this, \nand I will read it again:\n\n       Medical judgments may be exercised in light of all \n     factors--physical, emotional, psychological, familial, the \n     woman's age--relevant to the well-being of the patient. All \n     these factors may relate to health, and this allows the \n     attending physician the room he needs to make his best \n     medical judgment.\n\n  There is simply no restriction there. There is no limitation there, \nand there are people on the Court today who have interpreted that \ndecision consistently with that no limitation. In fact, I would argue \nthe Court is going even further in that direction. There is some scary \nlanguage--this is the Carhart case--there is some downright scary \nlanguage in this decision. I just wish the public understood how \nabsolute this right is, how unfettered this right is, and how \nabsolutely resistant the pro-abortion side is at keeping that pure \nright in place--unrestricted, unfettered right in place. But we are \ngoing even further than that.\n  We have a case here where we have two Justices of the U.S. Supreme \nCourt, Justice Stevens and Justice Ginsburg, in a concurring opinion--\nthank God it is not the majority opinion--but in a concurring opinion \nin the U.S. Supreme Court, this is what Justice Stevens says, and this \nis what the Senator from Louisiana was saying:\n\n       The liberty clause--\n\n  Oh, how words can be twisted.\n\n       The liberty clause in the fourteenth amendment includes a \n     woman's right to make this difficult and extremely personal \n     decision, makes it impossible for me to understand how a \n     State has any legitimate interest in requiring a doctor to \n     follow any procedure other than the one he or she reasonably \n     believes will best protect the woman in her exercise of this \n     constitutional liberty.\n\n  Do you know what this means? This means he can do anything he wants, \nany procedure, none of them reviewable. That is why we had to pass a \nbill last year called the Born Alive Infant Protection Act. Why? \nBecause Justice Stevens, one of the nine imperial Judges on the U.S. \nSupreme Court, unelected, had decided that if a doctor\n\n[[Page S3578]]\n\nwants to deliver a live baby and then kill it, that is a procedure. Do \nyou know what. Justice Stevens said that if that is what the doctor \nbelieves, fine. That is how far we are going. That is the corruption of \nthis entire issue of abortion. It is just so corrosive that it takes \npeople who see words such as ``liberty'' and turns them into murder. \nLiberty means now murder, in the eyes of Justice Stevens and Justice \nGinsburg. Oh, this is such a caustic issue that just corrodes the \nessence of the spirit of America.\n  Senator Durbin--I have said it repeatedly--I believe in good faith is \ntrying to put some restriction in place to what has gone off. By the \nway, Justice Stevens, unfortunately, and Justice Ginsburg are not \nalone. You have Peter Singer, whom the New Yorker magazine calls ``the \nmost influential living philosopher''--the most influential living \nphilosopher. As you will hear these statements, you may wonder, no, \nthis is just some kook. No, Professor Peter Singer, distinguished \nchair, where? Princeton University. Peter Singer has argued that when \nthe death of--what he argues--I will not quote him. I will submit this \nfor the Record so there will be plenty of quotes in here because I do \nnot have much time.\n\n  What he argues is that a child once born should be allowed to be \neuthanized up until--he has updated his opinions here. He believed it \nwas only waiting 28 days after birth before deciding whether the baby \nhas rights, but now he has said that is an arbitrary figure and it \nshould be--``Oh, I think it should be somewhat short of 1 year but the \npoint is not for me or anyone else to say, it should be up to the \nparents and, of course, the doctor.''\n  You say this is crazy, allowing a parent or society, in the case \nwhere the parent is not there, to euthanize a child; that is crazy. I \ncan guarantee, go back 50 years and maybe there were debates on this \nfloor that thought abortion would be a crazy thing and that could not \nhappen in our society; we could not have 1.3 million abortions.\n  I heard the Senator from California, and I hear this over and over: \nWe want abortion to be safe, legal, and rare. Twenty-five percent of \nall pregnancies in this country end in abortion. By anybody's \nestimation, is that rare? Twenty-five percent, is that rare? Forty-\nseven percent of abortions in this country are a woman's second \nabortion or more. Is that rare? Is there something corrupting our \nsociety here?\n  I understand the Senator from Illinois is trying to get at least some \npiece of it, but he fails. He fails. He fails on four counts, and let \nme quickly go through them, and more actually, the Senator from Ohio \nlisted a few more.\n  Four major counts: No. 1, there is a substitute. It eliminates the \nban on partial-birth abortion. Most partial-birth abortions are done in \nthe 20- to 26-week area where there is a question of viability. You \nhave--and I entered those in the Record--you have up to 75 percent \nviability at the time of 26 weeks. But, again, it is a substitute that \neliminates all previous viability abortions. No. 1.\n  No. 2, it does not define viability, and it leaves it up to the \ndoctor to determine what is viable. If the doctor says this child is \nnot viable, there is no review, and as soon as you say it is not \nviable, the statute does not apply. So all you have to do, if you want \nto have an abortion, is say it is not viable; nobody has to review it \nand the statute is not operable.\n  No. 3, risk of grievous injury to the physical health of the mother. \nAgain, it uses the term ``risk.'' It does not say how much risk. It can \nmean any amount of risk--one-half of 1 percent risk.\n  We have Dr. Warren Hern, who wrote the textbook on third-trimester \nabortions, the leading expert in this country, saying:\n\n       I have very serious reservations about this procedure. You \n     really can't defend it.\n\n  He also has a quote that says he would certify that every pregnancy \nhas a risk of grievous physical injury to a mother--every pregnancy. \nWhat if he makes that statement and it is not true? What happens? The \nSenator from Illinois had criminal penalties potentially for perjury. \nThose are now removed from the bill. There is no criminal problem with \nthat physician or the other physician who has come in to look at this \nfrom having any criminal sanctions.\n  What are the sanctions? He could lose his license. Not really. The \nState has to promulgate regulations under this statute to suspend or \nrevoke a license. It does not say they have to revoke it or say how \nlong the suspension is. It could be 1 day. I suspect in States such as \nNew York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts, where abortions are \noverwhelmingly supported, you could have 2 hours of revocation, or \nsomething like that. It would be a ridiculous standard.\n  The bottom line is it mandates no revocation or suspension of license \nof any weight, and even at that, it is revocation or suspension or a \nfine up to $100,000 in the first case, $250,000 in the second, but it \ncould be a dollar.\n  Again, there is no floor in the amount of money. So there really is \nthe potential for no consequences in a lot of States, or maybe even in \nmost States. It is a substitute. If one is against partial birth, they \ncannot be for this amendment. If it is understood that viability kicks \none out of this statute to begin with, and it is only the decision of \nthe doctor that determines viability and there is no review of that, \nthat makes this statute basically inoperable, I would argue, for every \nabortion that is done in America.\n  Then if one gets in, there is the risk question, which again \nnullifies, really, any weight on the physician because risk can mean \nsuch a small amount of risk to make it almost inconsequential. Finally, \nthere is no penalty if all that does apply.\n  So I suggest that while I believe the Senator from Illinois was \ntrying to do something to attack what I described as an unfettered \nright to an abortion is the preeminent right in America--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Lincoln be added as \na cosponsor to my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield 30 seconds to the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. First, anyone who reads Roe v. Wade knows it is not an \nunfettered right. Clearly, at the later stages, Government can in fact \nrestrict abortion. Secondly, the kind of talk we just heard on the \nSenate floor, where two Supreme Court Justices were essentially called \nmurderers--if one reads back the words, it is essentially calling them \nmurderers--I think is beyond inflammatory. I think it is dangerous \nrhetoric. It is wrong, and I am very sad that the debate has \ndeteriorated to this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if one takes a walk through this Capitol \nbuilding, a few feet from where we are standing is the old Senate \nChamber. If one reads the history of the Senate, they will find that in \nthe 19th century, in the 1800s, that Chamber was divided over the issue \nof slavery to the point where one Senator was almost beaten to death on \nthe floor of the Senate.\n  It is hard to think of issues in America that divide us the way \nslavery divided us then and the issue of abortion divides us today. \nThere is such strong emotional, honest, and heartfelt feeling that \ncomes into this issue on both sides.\n  I greatly respect the Senator from Pennsylvania, even though I may \ndisagree with him on this issue. I believe he is speaking from the \nheart. I equally respect the Senator from California, who is on the \nopposite side of the issue. I have known her for 20 years. I know she \nspeaks from the heart.\n  So many of us come to this issue understanding that if we walked into \na town meeting in my home State of Illinois and brought up the issue of \nabortion, we would see people folding their arms and would know what \nthey are thinking. Some of them are thinking: I do not like it; I do \nnot want you to talk about it; I do not know why it is legal in this \ncountry, and we are a worse nation for having it. With their arms \nfolded, you just know what they are thinking.\n\n  Then we will see another group with their arms folded and we will \nknow what they are thinking: I do not think\n\n[[Page S3579]]\n\nthe Government ought to stick its nose in a woman's business when her \nhealth and her life are at stake. She, her doctor, her family, and her \nGod ought to make that decision, not some politician. That is what we \nare going to get in most town meetings in most townhalls across \nAmerica. But there is a group of people in the middle who are sitting \nthere saying: I see both sides. I do not like the fact there are so \nmany abortions in America. I do not like the fact you have \ncircumstances where people need an abortion. We ought to find some way \nto work this out reasonably.\n  That is what the Supreme Court tried to do in the Roe v. Wade \ndecision. They said: We are not going to allow abortions any time, \nanyplace, under all circumstances. We are going to kind of limit when a \nwoman can have it, and under what circumstances.\n  Then the national debate started, and it has not ended. I do not know \nif it ever will. So I come today understanding that division in \nAmerica, that division in my State, even that division of opinion \nwithin my own family. I understand this, I feel it, and I am trying \nwith this amendment to strike a reasonable compromise.\n  Oh, the people with their arms folded on both sides of the hall will \nnot like it. It does not ban abortion, which is what some people want. \nAnd it does not get the Government out of the picture completely, which \nis what others want. Instead, it tries to draw a reasonable, sensible \nline, a good-faith line, of where we will allow abortions in late-term \npregnancies.\n  When we look at the sponsors of this amendment, unlike any other \namendment on this subject, we will find we have the spectrum of opinion \non abortion. Watch the rollcall vote. We are going to see Senators come \nforward who are pro-life and pro-choice who will support the Durbin \namendment, and that says something, that when they have thought about \nit, maybe this is a reasonable middle ground.\n  I hope a majority of my colleagues will believe that it is. It says: \nLate in the pregnancy, after the fetus within the mother is viable and \ncould survive, we are not going to allow you to terminate that \npregnancy except under the most extreme situations.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania says: What is viability? How do we know \nthe fetus is viable? I cannot answer that question. No legislator can \nanswer that question. The Supreme Court, in the case of Planned \nParenthood of Central Missouri v. Danforth, said the determination of \nwhether a particular fetus is viable is and must be a matter for the \njudgment of the responsible attending physician. They went on to say \nthe time of viability is different in every pregnancy.\n  So I am using a standard the Supreme Court uses. The doctor has to \ndecide: Have you reached a point where that fetus is more likely than \nnot to survive outside the womb? If the answer is yes, then a woman \nknows she is very late in a pregnancy. Then, and only then, do two hard \nquestions have to be asked before a pregnancy can be terminated. One, \nif that pregnancy is continued, will the mother die? If the answer is \nyes, certified not by one doctor but by two doctors, one being an \nindependent doctor, that she is going to lose her life if she continues \nthe pregnancy, then a consideration can be given to terminating the \npregnancy, or one other possibility: If two doctors come forward, one \nindependent as well as the one treating, and they conclude if the \nmother continues this pregnancy, at this point she runs the risk of \nsuffering grievous physical injury. Those are the only two conditions, \nand that is it. Not if a woman feels like she wants to end the \npregnancy. I cannot imagine a woman in that stage of her pregnancy even \nconsidering that possibility.\n\n  It goes beyond that. It goes to tangible, physical medical evidence, \nbacked up by real doctors who are willing to certify. And this second \ndoctor who has been written off by the critics of this amendment as \njust another ``abortionist,'' that is not what it says at all. The \nsecond doctor's opinion has to be an independent physician who will not \nperform nor be present at the abortion and who was not previously \ninvolved in the treatment of the mother. If one does not have that \nsecond doctor agreeing with the first doctor, the pregnancy cannot be \nterminated.\n  What is the risk for the doctor if they falsify it, if they lie about \nit, if they say, oh, we want to make a dollar here, so we are just \ngoing to put the certification down? If they lie about it, they run the \nrisk of having their medical licenses suspended, on the second occasion \nrevoked, facing fines up to $250,000. Is that a light penalty, that a \ndoctor would lose his license for a lifetime? That is a pretty serious \npenalty. Would not any doctor think twice before conspiring to go ahead \nand certify it when, in fact, there is not medical evidence?\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania says we want abortions to be rare, but \nwe do not do anything about it. The Durbin amendment will restrict more \nabortions and abortion procedures than the Santorum bill, S. 3.\n  Mr. Santorum's bill addresses one procedure, the partial-birth \nprocedure, throughout a woman's pregnancy. My amendment addresses all \nlate-term abortions, whatever the procedure.\n  Finally, when it comes to risk, he takes exception to the fact that I \nuse the words ``risk of grievous physical injury.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, before the vote begins, I ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Dodd be added as a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I move to table the Durbin amendment and ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The question now occurs on the Boxer \namendment. There are 2 minutes equally divided for each side.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, regardless of the vote on final passage of \nthis bill, I think you ought to think about why it is important to \ncommit this bill to the Judiciary Committee. Since we last debated this \nbill, the Supreme Court has ruled that an identical bill is \nunconstitutional based on two principles that I have here behind me.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, may we have order. The Senator is \nentitled to be heard. This is an important matter.\n\n[[Page S3580]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will suspend.\n  May we have order. Please take your conversations off the floor.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, since we last debated this bill, the \nSupreme Court has ruled an identical bill unconstitutional based on two \nprinciples: No. 1, there was a health exception; and this bill has \nnone; and, No. 2, because of an undue burden on women because the \nprocedure ban is so vaguely defined that it banned more than one \nprocedure.\n  It has those same flaws and should be examined by the committee of \njurisdiction.\n  The ranking member of the committee, Senator Leahy, agrees. In his \nstatement, Senator Leahy said: ``Senators deserve the benefit of full \nconsideration''----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 1 minute.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will take another 30 seconds.\n  --``of full consideration and vigorous debate before they are asked \nto cast a vote on such a significant and complicated issue.''\n  We are talking about--and I will show a picture of one of them--women \nsuch as Coreen Costello, a religious, self-described pro-life \nconservative woman who had no other option but this procedure if she \nwanted to preserve her health and have more children.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 30 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I retain those 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, we have debated this issue on the floor \nof the Senate for the fifth time. The issue is the same. There is a \nslight variation in the language of this bill--some 20 words. I think \nthe Senate is perfectly capable of dealing with these changes and to \naddress the issue of vagueness. I don't believe that after two hearings \nof the Judiciary Committee, after having gone through the committee on \na couple of occasions and being debated here now for the fifth time, we \nneed to commit this bill back to committee.\n  It has been asserted on the floor by the Senator from South Dakota \nthat we are bypassing the committee, as was complained about in the \npast. I would just say that we are bypassing the committee on a bill \nthat is this size with 20 different words--not this, which is the \nenergy bill that bypassed the committee last year or the agriculture \nbill that bypassed the committee last year or on the prescription drug \nbill.\n  This has 18 titles in it.\n  I think there is a fundamental difference between asserting bypassing \na committee with a bill which has been on the floor on five different \noccasions and one that is a brandnew piece of legislation with 18 \ntitles and some 400 or 500 pages.\n  The Senate is ready to vote. The issue is well known. I hope we \ndefeat the motion to commit and proceed to finish the bill in a timely \nmanner.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, women such as the one shown in this \npicture deserve to have another hearing. These are the things that \ncould go wrong if a woman is denied this procedure without a health \nexception: They could hemorrhage; they could have a uterine rupture, \nblood clots, an embolism, a stroke, have damage to nearby organs, or \nhave paralysis.\n  We have not had a hearing on this bill since 1997, my friends. We \nhave since had a Supreme Court decision that faults the bill because it \ndoes not have a health exception. At least vote with us, please, to \ncommit this to the Judiciary Committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, the facts are as evidenced from the \nJudiciary Committee hearings, which basically have not changed. The \nfacts are the same. The procedure that we are attempting to ban is \nriskier and has a greater likelihood of causing all those things than \nthe alternative procedures which are taught in medical schools, done in \nhospitals, by obstetricians. This is not done in hospitals, not done by \nobstetricians, not taught in medical schools.\n  This is a rogue procedure that was designed for one reason. The \nabortionist who designed it said why. It was designed so he could do \nlate-term abortions in 15 minutes as opposed to 45 minutes, so he could \ndo more in one day; that is, all of these health risks are, in fact, \nbogus. It is a riskier procedure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 3, the Partial-\nBirth Abortion Ban Act. It is totally unbelievable to me that Congress \nyet again is working on legislation to make partial-birth abortions \nillegal.\n  This is the fourth Congress in which the Senate will have considered \nthis issue. In that time, innocent babies have been killed by this \ncruel and horrible practice. It is time to finally end it once and for \nall.\n  The Senate voted to ban partial-birth abortions in the 104th \nCongress, the 105th Congress, and the 106th Congress. The first two \nattempts to ban this gruesome act were sent to the White House and \nvetoed by President Bill Clinton.\n  In the last Congress, the House passed a partial-birth abortion ban. \nHowever, the Senate leadership refused to bring the issue up for \nconsideration. I commend our leader, Senator Frist, for moving quickly \nto address this issue early in the 108th Congress, and I commend \nSenator Santorum for his lead in this effort. I am confident that the \nPresident at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue will act in defense \nof life by signing this proposal into law.\n  All forms of abortion are gruesome procedures, but I cannot imagine \nanything more hideous than partial-birth abortion. I will spare my \ncolleagues a detailed description of this heinous procedure since it is \nso repulsive. We have already seen graphic pictures and illustrations \noutlining this infanticide. It is really hard to believe we have to go \nthrough this exercise every Congress because nobody, with a straight\n\n[[Page S3581]]\n\nface and a clear conscience, can stand up and defend this procedure.\n  The only way anyone can justify it is to say, hey, it doesn't matter \nbecause not that many partial-birth abortions are actually performed or \nthey can try to cloud the issue by saying partial-birth abortions are \nonly utilized in cases where the mother's life is in jeopardy. We know \nthis just is not true. We know that some of the most ardent and visible \ndefenders of abortion have actually lied about the numbers. It is not \njust a few hundred a year--it is in the thousands.\n  But the numbers really should not make any difference. If it is wrong \nand inhumane, we should ban it, whether it affects 1 or 1 million. But \nmisleading facts about the numbers--trying to play down the prevalence \nand frequency of this procedure--are no justification for allowing this \npractice to continue.\n  This bill does not ignore the health needs of women. It clearly makes \nan exception when the life of the mother is in jeopardy. The plain \nlanguage of this legislation clearly says that the ban on partial-birth \nabortions does not apply when such a procedure is considered necessary \nto save the life of a mother whose life is endangered by a physical \ndisorder, illness, or injury. So even though many medical experts \ninsist that there is never any medical justification for a partial-\nbirth abortion, this bill goes the extra mile and permits it if the \nmother's life is in jeopardy.\n  Personally, I don't think this makes much sense, but it just goes to \nshow that those of us who support the bill are doing what we can to try \nto find a middle ground and to answer concerns that some of our \ncolleagues still have.\n  No one can deny that partial-birth abortion is cruel. No one can deny \nthat it is patently inhumane. No one can deny that it is gruesome and \ngrotesque. In fact, in the 8 years we have been debating this bill, no \none has really come up with a defense of partial-birth abortions that \nholds any water.\n  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, support this \nban; it is simply a matter of respect for human life.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield to my friend from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nthe disposition of the Boxer motion to commit, Senator Harkin be \nrecognized to offer an amendment, the text of which is at the desk, \nprovided that there be 2 hours 30 minutes for debate, equally divided \nin the usual form, prior to a vote in relation to the amendment, with \nno second-degree amendments in order prior to the vote.\n  I further ask that following the disposition of the Harkin amendment, \nSenator Feinstein be recognized in order to offer an amendment, the \ntext of which is at the desk, provided that there be 2 hours for \ndebate, equally divided, in the usual form prior to a vote in relation \nto the amendment, with no second-degree amendments in order prior to \nthe vote.\n  I further ask consent that following the disposition of the Feinstein \namendment, the bill be read the third time, with no intervening action \nor debate. I finally ask consent that at 9:30 a.m. on Thursday, \nprovided that the bill has been read a third time, the Senate proceed \nto a vote on passage of the bill, again with no intervening action or \ndebate; provided further that any second-degree amendments to the \naforementioned amendments be relevant to the first degree.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that following that vote, the Senate \nproceed to executive session and vote on the confirmation of Calendar \nNo. 53, Thomas Varlan, to be U.S. District Judge for the Eastern \nDistrict, with no intervening action; further, that following that \nvote, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and \nthe Senate proceed to a period for morning business until 11:30 a.m., \nwith the time equally divided in the usual form.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that at 11:30 a.m., the Senate \nresume consideration of the Estrada nomination in executive session and \nthe time until 12:30 p.m. be equally divided in the usual form, with a \nvote on the motion to invoke cloture occurring at 3:30 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. As I understand it, we will have the Harkin amendment and \nthe Feinstein amendment and final passage.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The Harkin and Feinstein amendments will be voted on \nthis afternoon or this evening potentially, and tomorrow morning a vote \non final passage as the first order of business when we reconvene.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend, at the end of the first \nparagraph of the consent request, after the words ``further that''--it \nis the first long paragraph.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Yes, ``further that.''\n  Mr. REID. I ask that the words ``if the above amendments are not \ntabled, if a tabling motion is made, any second-degree amendments'' be \ninserted and then it would be just as the Senator said it, ``and that \nthey be debatable.''\n  Mr. SANTORUM. We can accept that.\n  Mr. REID. So I accept that, other than this, Mr. President: The \njunior Senator from Iowa, the author of this amendment, would like an \nup-or-down vote on his amendment. I was just informed of that.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I am fine with giving him an up-or-down vote.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Pennsylvania does \nnot like this, but we have given and taken, for lack of a better \ndescription, trying to work our way through this. I very much \nappreciate his allowing us to go forward. I ask that the consent \nrequest be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification? \nWithout objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator from Nevada. The Senator hit the \nnail on the head, the head on the nail, whatever the case may be. The \nfact is, the Senator from Nevada has been very cooperative. This is not \nan extraordinary request. Even though I rather would have a motion to \ntable, I am glad to accommodate the Senator. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 260\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate concerning the decision of \n                   the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade)\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk, and I ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 260.\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING ROE V. WADE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) abortion has been a legal and constitutionally \n     protected medical procedure throughout the United States \n     since the Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade (410 U.S. 113 \n     (1973)); and\n       (2) the 1973 Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade \n     established constitutionally based limits on the power of \n     States to restrict the right of a woman to choose to \n     terminate a pregnancy.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the decision of the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade (410 \n     U.S. 113 (1973)) was appropriate and secures an important \n     constitutional right; and\n       (2) such decision should not be overturned.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the amendment I have offered basically \nexpresses the sense of the Senate in support of the Supreme Court \ndecision in Roe v. Wade. With all of the legislation that continues to \ncome up and chip away at Roe v. Wade, I decided it was important for us \nin the Senate to go on record that this historic decision was \nappropriate and should not be overturned.\n  I let the clerk read the full text of the amendment because it is \nvery short and to the point. I offered this amendment 4 years ago on \nsimilar legislation that came before this body. The disposition of that \namendment at that time, if I am not mistaken, was 51 to 47 in passage. \nThere were some who were\n\n[[Page S3582]]\n\nconcerned about a couple of the findings. The difference between this \namendment and the one I offered 4 years ago is basically two findings \nhave been removed and the only findings left are just the findings that \npertain only to Roe v. Wade.\n  This amendment is very simple, very straightforward. Basically, it \nputs us on record of saying the decision in Roe v. Wade on January 22, \n1973, was appropriate and should not be overturned. I believe it is \nimportant that we remind ourselves about this decision as we get into \nthe debate on this so-called partial-birth abortion--especially when \nthis bill changes. That is different than what it was 4 years ago, as \nwe try to parse words, trying to anticipate every medical procedure \nthat might be performed by a doctor, getting into issues this Senator \ndoes not believe we are adequately prepared or equipped to do in terms \nof knowledge of all of the ramifications of certain medical procedures.\n  I want to make sure with all of this going on that we send a strong \nsignal to the women of this country that Roe v. Wade is appropriate, it \nwas a good decision, and it is not going to be overturned.\n  I assume maybe there are those in this body who want to see it \noverturned. I can accept that as their opinion and their view, but I \nthink it is important for people to know where we stand on that \ndecision.\n  As we all know, the U.S. Supreme Court announced its decision in Roe \nv. Wade as a challenge to a Texas statute that made it a crime to \nperform an abortion unless the woman's life was at stake. The case had \nbeen filed by Jane Roe, an unmarried woman, who wanted to safely and \nlegally end her pregnancy.\n  Siding with Roe, the Court struck down the Texas law. In its ruling, \nthe Court recognized for the first time that the constitutional right \nto privacy ``is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or \nnot to terminate her pregnancy.'' But the decision also set some rules.\n  The Court recognized that the right to privacy is not absolute, and \nthat any State has a valid interest in safeguarding maternal health, \nmaintaining medical standards, and protecting potential life. A State's \ninterest in ``potential life'' is not compelling, the Court said, until \nviability, the point in pregnancy in which there is a reasonable \npossibility for the sustained survival of the fetus outside the womb.\n  A State may, but is not required, to prohibit abortion after \nviability, except when it is necessary to protect a woman's life or her \nhealth. I add that for emphasis, ``or her health.''\n  This is what my resolution is all about: To say that we agree that \nRoe v. Wade was an appropriate decision and it should not be \noverturned.\n  The constitutional right to a private decision in this matter is no \nmore negotiable than the freedom to speak or the freedom to worship.\n  Before the 1973 landmark ruling of Roe v. Wade, it is estimated that \neach year 1.2 million women resorted to illegal abortion, despite the \nknown hazards of frightening trips to dangerous locations in strange \nparts of town; of whiskey as an anesthetic; of ``doctors'' who were \noften marginal or unlicensed practitioners, sometimes alcoholic, \nsometimes sexually abusive; unsanitary conditions; incompetent \ntreatment; hemorrhage; disfiguration and death.\n  By invalidating laws that forced women to resort to back-alley \nabortion; Roe was directly responsible for saving women's lives.\n  Only 10 pieces of legislation were introduced in either the House or \nSenate before the Roe decision. But in the 30 years since the ruling, \nmore than 1,000 separate legislative proposals have been introduced. \nThe majority of these bills sought to restrict a womans right to \nchoose.\n  Unfortunately, what is often lost in the rhetoric and in some of \nthose proposals--is the real significance of the Roe decision.\n  The Roe decision recognized the right of women to make their own \ndecisions about their reproductive health. The decision whether to bear \na child is profoundly private and life-altering. As the Roe Court \nunderstood, without the right to make autonomous decisions about \npregnancy, a woman could not participate freely and equally in society.\n  Roe not only established a woman's reproductive freedom, it was also \ncentral to women's continued progress toward full and equal \nparticipation in American life. In the 26 years since Roe, the variety \nand level of women's achievements have reached a higher level. As the \nSupreme Court observed in 1992:\n\n       The ability of women to participate equally in the economic \n     and social life of the Nation has been facilitated by their \n     ability to control their reproductive lives.\n\n  As I have said on many occasions in the past, going back almost 20 \nyears, I do not believe that any abortion is desirable. I do not think \nanyone does. As a father, I have struggled with this issue many times \nin the past. However, I do not believe that it is appropriate to insist \nthat my personal views be the law of the land, just as I do not think \nthe personal views of the Senator from Pennsylvania, however strong he \nmay hold them, ought to be the law of the land.\n  So what should Congress do?\n  If we are truly interested in both maintaining a woman's \nconstitutional right to control her own reproductive life, and at the \nsame time trying to limit the number of abortions in our society, there \nis action we can take. We can increase funding for family planning. Try \ngetting that through on the floor of the Senate. We can increase \nfunding for abstinence-only education. We have done some of that. We \ncan mandate insurance coverage for contraception. We still need to do \nthat. We do not, but we should mandate it.\n  We can provide more support for contraception research. \nUnfortunately, the Senate yesterday decided not to take these steps \nthat could reduce the number of abortions. That was the amendment \noffered by my colleague from Washington, Senator Murray.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this resolution. I believe \nit would establish the one important principle that we should agree \non--that we will not strip away a woman's fundamental right to choose, \nand that is what this amendment does.\n  Further, I quote from Justices O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter in \nCasey:\n\n       At the heart of liberty is the right to define one's own \n     concept of existence, of meaning of the universe and of the \n     mystery of human life. Beliefs about these matters could not \n     define the attributes of personhood were they formed under \n     compulsion of the State.\n\n  I am going to read that again because it is such a profound \nstatement:\n\n       At the heart of liberty is the right to define one's own \n     concept of existence, of meaning of the universe and of the \n     mystery of human life. Beliefs about these matters could not \n     define the attributes of personhood were they formed under \n     the compulsion of the State.\n\n  I think that is the essence of this issue, whether we will use the \nheavy hand of the State to enforce certain individuals' concepts of \nwhen life begins, how life begins, when a person can have an abortion, \nwhen a person cannot.\n  Yes, it is true, people are divided on this issue. Some people are \nuncertain about it. I quarrel with myself all the time about it, \nbecause it is as multifaceted as there are numbers of humans on the \nface of the Earth.\n  I would not sit in judgment on any person who would choose to have an \nabortion, especially a woman who went through the terrifying, \nagonizing, and soul-wrenching procedures of having a late-term abortion \nbecause her health or her life is in danger. That must be one of the \nmost soul-wrenching experiences a person can go through. I just do not \nunderstand how we can be so presumptuous to think that we in the Senate \ncan answer each one of those individual cases, with all the different \nfacets that may be involved, and yet that is what some in the Senate \nbelieve the Senate and the Congress should do.\n  No, I do not want to sit in judgment on that, and I do not believe \nany of us ought to.\n  That is why, again, I think it is particularly important that we cut \nthrough all the folderol that surrounds this issue and get to the heart \nof it, which is Roe v. Wade. This is the heart of what we are talking \nabout.\n  There are those who want to come along and change it and make it more \ncomplex, indecipherable, benefiting maybe one person one way, adding to \nthe detriment of another person another way, so that we are right back \nwhere we were before Roe v. Wade was decided.\n\n[[Page S3583]]\n\n  I believe very strongly that we need to express ourselves on this \nsense of the Senate resolution. I appreciate the agreement from the \nmanager of the bill and our majority whip to have an up-or-down \nrollcall vote. I believe it is that important, and I appreciate their \nwillingness to have that up-or-down vote.\n  I am sure I will have more to say later on. I believe there are 2 \\1/\n2\\ hours of time divided equally, if I am not mistaken.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two hours and 20 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time have I consumed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 61 minutes and 3 seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment. \nBefore I make a statement, I encourage Members who have statements on \nthis amendment or on the bill--we have roughly 2 hours of time \nremaining to debate this amendment, but obviously I encourage anybody \nwho has statements on the bill itself to come down. Senator Kennedy is \nin the Chamber, Senator Harkin and myself. So there is ample \nopportunity and time. There is not much of a wait.\n  Does the Senator from Massachusetts wish to proceed?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will be ready in about 2 minutes, and I \nwould like to have 10 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield whatever time the Senator desires.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I appreciate that.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The Senator from Massachusetts needs a couple of \nminutes before he is ready. Therefore, I yield 2 or 3 minutes to the \nSenator from South Carolina for a statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Senator Harkin is right. This is a \ndifficult situation. I am often asked at town meetings: Why should the \ngovernment be involved in the regulation of abortion? It is a personal \nmatter. I suppose it depends upon who you believe the interested \nparties are. Obviously, the interested parties are the mother, but many \nin the country believe there is another party to the decision process, \nand the unborn child. Someone has to speak for the unborn child.\n  In a country where people are free to express themselves, that they \nwould outlaw abortion--I find it amazing people who believe it is a \nwoman's right to choose would idly sit by and not petition the \ngovernment to change that. The converse is true. This is why we are \nhere. This is part of democracy, defining what the law of the land is \nin terms of the beginning of life, the taking of life, and the \nterminating of a life.\n  I don't find it odd at all we have these debates. This is exactly \nwhat a democracy is built upon--the rule of law. There are no \nunderstandings about the basics of life--when it begins, who can \nterminate it, under what conditions it can be terminated. If it is left \nto everyone's whim and personal desire, that is chaos.\n  What we are trying to do in a very reasoned way, with much emotion \nbehind the reason, is give our views about how the government, society, \nshould deal with the issue of when life begins, what is life, and who \nhas the right to terminate it, and under what circumstances. To me, \nthat is the essence of the rule of law. I look forward to hearing my \ncolleagues express themselves. I do disagree with the concept that the \ngovernment has no role in determining when life begins, how it should \nbe ended, and who can end it, in a democracy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I say to the Senator from South Carolina, I appreciate \nthe comments.\n  The Senator from Iowa read the famous clause out of the Casey \ndecision, determining one's own concept of meaning of existence, of the \nuniverse, of the meaning of the universe, of the mystery of human life. \nThe Senator from South Carolina hit the nail on the head. If everyone \nhas their own right to decide what life is, what existence is, what the \nuniverse means--if we are not bound at all by any kind of societal \nnorms, if we have the right to decide all these things, the kids who \nrushed into Columbine had it right because they said: I am law. My view \nof the world is what counts and that is all that counts. That is what \nthis clause says: What I say goes.\n  That is what this clause says. That is where we are. That is where \nthe line of cases have taken us. It is simply about our brute force, \nour positive rights. Society does not matter; it is what we want. The \nCongress should not be involved in this. It is what you want.\n  That is not the country that our Founding Fathers put together. That \nis not the Constitution they drafted. That, by the way, is why the \nright to abortion is not written in the Constitution.\n  This is a slippery slope we are heading down. In deference to the \nSenator from Massachusetts who is in the Chamber, I will define that \nslope momentarily.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, the Republican leadership is wrong to \nask the Senate to support legislation that has been ruled \nunconstitutional by numerous courts. Since the last debate in the \nSenate in 1999, the Supreme Court found a very similar law enacted by \nthe State of Nebraska to be unconstitutional. This bill is \nunconstitutional as well.\n  The Republican leadership has chosen to make as its top priority a \nflatly unconstitutional piece of legislation at a time when so many \nfamilies across the country are facing economic hardship, when \ncommunities are struggling to deal with homeland security needs, and \nbeing forced by State budget crises to cut back on education and health \ncare.\n  Because of the Republican leadership's decision to act on this bill, \nwe will do nothing this week to provide an economic stimulus plan for \nthe Nation's families and workers. We will do nothing to provide new \nfunding for communities struggling to protect themselves from \nnew terrorist attacks. We will do nothing to help the millions of \nuninsured children in this country get the health care they need. We \nwill do nothing for schools struggling to meet higher standards under \nthe No Child Left Behind Act. We will do nothing to help college \nstudents struggling to pay tuition and relieve their debt. We will do \nnothing to help the millions of families across the Nation who are \nworried about their economic future.\n\n  Let us be clear as to what this bill does not do. This bill does not \nstop one single abortion. The proponents of this bill distort the law \nand the position of our side with inflammatory rhetoric, while \nadvocating a bill that will not stop one single abortion. This bill \npurports to prohibit a medical procedure that is only used in rare and \ndire circumstances. It is not used for unhealthy mothers carrying \nunhealthy babies. If this bill is passed, a doctor could be forced to \nperform another, more dangerous procedure if it becomes necessary to \nterminate a pregnancy to protect the life, the health of the mother.\n  This bill does not protect the health of the mother. Nowhere is there \nlanguage that will allow a doctor to take the health of the mother into \nconsideration, even if she were to suffer brain damage or otherwise be \npermanently impaired if the pregnancy continued. And this bill is not \nneeded to protect the life of the babies who could live outside the \nmother's womb because those babies are already protected under the law \nof the land.\n  In Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court specifically held that unless there \nwas a threat to the life, health of the woman, she did not have a \nconstitutional right to terminate a pregnancy after viability.\n  So what is this legislation all about? It is about politics and \ninflammatory language and hot-button topics, but it is not about \nstopping abortion.\n  Because of the sound and fury and high emotion that surrounds this \nissue, I make my own personal views clear. I am pro-choice. But I \nbelieve that abortion should be rare. I believe we have an obligation \nto create an economy and the necessary support systems to make it \neasier for women to choose to bring children into the world. If the \nproponents of this legislation were serious\n\n[[Page S3584]]\n\nabout limiting the number of abortions in this country, then we would \nbe debating access to health care, quality education, the minimum wage, \nand other issues of economic security that are so important to parents \nbringing up children. Those issues are not on the Republican \nleadership's agenda.\n  Instead, for rank political reasons we are here this week debating \nthe so-called partial-birth abortion. I do not believe it is the role \nof the Senate to interfere with or regulate the kind of medical advice \nthat a doctor can give to a patient. The doctor-patient relationship \nand the protection of the health of the mother is what is in jeopardy \nwith this legislation.\n  From the time of the 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade through to the \nStenberg-Carhart decision, the Constitution allows States to restrict \npostviability abortion as long as there are protections for the life \nand the health of the mother. Indeed, 41 States already ban \npostviability abortions regardless of the procedure used. My own State \nof Massachusetts prohibits these abortions except when the woman's life \nis in danger, or the continuation of the pregnancy would impose a \nsubstantial risk of grave impairment of a woman's health. I would vote \nfor a postviability ban that protects women's life and health today.\n\n  The role of the Senate is to protect and defend the Constitution of \nthe United States. Each of us in this body has taken that oath of \noffice, and that oath of office and the Constitution require me to \noppose this legislation. This bill unconstitutionally seeks to restrict \nabortion in cases before viability. It does not provide an exception to \nprotect the mother's health after viability. It also impermissibly \nattempts to interfere with the doctor-patient relationship. For all \nthese reasons, I oppose this bill.\n  Finally, I commend my friend and colleague, Senator Harkin, and \nindicate my strong support for his amendment. This is a reaffirmation \nof the 1973 Supreme Court decision. It gives focus to the underlying \ndebate and the policy issues which surround this whole issue.\n  As the Senator remembers so well, before Roe as many as 5,000 women \ndied from illegal abortions each year. Many others suffered serious \ncomplications. In the years since 1973, the number of deaths resulting \nfrom abortion procedures has decreased dramatically. In order to keep \nabortion safe, we must keep it legal. That is why I support Senator \nHarkin's amendment and strongly urge my colleagues to do so as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I will spend a little time today talking \nabout the amendment. But I also want to talk about the underlying bill.\n  This is an incredibly emotional issue for people across America. It \nis an incredibly emotional issue for people in this body. There truly \nare good people on both sides of this issue.\n  I believe the people who support abortion are wrong. Those who \nsupport abortion look at myself and others on this side of the issue, \nand think that we are wrong. But I do not look at the other side, and \nthink that the people are evil or that they have evil intentions. I \njust think that they are not seeing the truth about what abortion truly \nis.\n  To talk about the bill itself: it has been described--it cannot be \ndescribed too often, what a so-called partial-birth abortion really is; \na D procedure--whatever you want to call it. So let me describe that.\n  I am a veterinarian by profession, so I understand a little bit about \nsurgery and medical procedures. When I read through this particular \nprocedure, it is amazing to me, as a health care worker, how any \nphysician or any nurse could participate in this procedure and not be \nhorrified.\n  What happens is a woman goes in the first day, and she has some local \nanesthetic put on her cervix. Then she has some clips put on that will \nhelp her dilate. She comes in the next day; same procedure; it helps \nher dilate some more. The third day she comes in, she is treated with \nsome medication, including pitocin, which is something to help--just \nlike when a woman is having trouble delivering--it helps to stimulate \nthe birthing process, to put it in the simplest of terms.\n  While the woman is on that drug, they use an ultrasound to look at \nthe woman's abdomen; to look inside the uterus. Looking at the \nultrasound picture, the doctor can insert a clamp--basically some \nforceps--to grab one of the legs of the baby. The baby is in there, \nmoving around. This ultrasound allows them to grip one of the baby's \nlegs and not grab part of the uterus, because obviously that would be \nvery dangerous to the woman.\n  As he or she grabs that leg, they then pull it down into the birth \ncanal. That one leg then comes out of the cervix. The physician then \ntakes one of his other fingers and grabs the other leg and brings them, \nboth of the legs, down. Once into the birth canal, the doctor kind of \nwriggles them down a little bit and gets them to where (this would be \nthe back of the baby) everything except the head--the head is still \ninside what is called the cervical os, and at that point the head is \nusually too large to come down.\n  That is the point where the physician puts his fingers around this \nlittle--I will call it what it is. They call it a fetus, but it is a \nlittle human being, whether you call it a fetus or baby or whatever you \ncall it. It is a little human being.\n  This little human being is alive. You can feel it. You can feel the \nheart beating. You can feel movement in the legs. There is no question \nthat the person who is performing this procedure can feel life in their \nhands.\n  As he puts his fingers around there, he brings usually a pair of \nMetzenbaum scissors, a kind of curved scissor, around the back and has \nto make sure he doesn't cut the cervix, so he has to elevate the cervix \naway from the baby's skull. Then right at the back of the baby's skull \nhe inserts some kind of a forceps, usually the scissors, and makes an \nopening right at the back of the skull; then he will slide an \ninstrument in that will suck the baby's brains out.\n  Try to imagine this. You have this little baby in your hands, and you \nare going to suck that brain out. As you do, you will feel the life go \nout of that little baby. Anybody who can listen to what is done in this \nprocedure and say that as a civilized country we should allow this to \ngo on--it boggles my mind. At that point, the skull collapses and the \nbaby is allowed to be delivered.\n  In our society, under our current laws, if for some reason that \ncervix dilated a little more and this baby, while it was being brought \ndown, slipped out, came fully out, this doctor who performed that same \nprocedure, now, this much farther down--that would be considered murder \nunder our laws. So this procedure really is a question of distance. We \nare 3 inches away from murder by our own laws.\n  If the baby is 3 inches up the birth canal, it is just an abortion. \nThree inches down, it is considered murder. This procedure is \ninfanticide. A civilized society should never allow this kind of thing \nto go on. That is why we need to ban it.\n  A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine reports \nthat--we have heard the exception for the health of the mother. For the \nlife of the mother, we all agree. If it is the life of the mother, you \ncan't have them both live, so you have to choose. But at 15 to 16 weeks \nof gestation, that is the point at which an abortion becomes more \ndangerous than childbirth. Partial-birth abortion generally happens \nafter 20 weeks of gestation.\n  We have heard that we need to have exceptions for the mother's \nhealth. Abortionists say that if the language that was proposed earlier \nis passed, they would be able to use that language ``health of the \nmother'' to be able to perform an abortion any time, any place, at any \nmonth of pregnancy, and use this procedure. It would be allowed. That \nis why the health of the mother exception we keep hearing about is such \na bogus argument. It is healthier for the mother to allow it, the baby, \nto reach full gestation.\n  In the terrible case of what is called an anencephalic baby, one \nwhich is born with not enough neural tissue to develop, we know they \nare going to die a very short period of time after they are born; it is \nsafer for the mother to have that child. I would even argue that it is \nsafer for them from a mental\n\n[[Page S3585]]\n\nhealth standpoint. It is part of the grieving process we need to go \nthrough when we lose a child, just holding that child.\n\n  To just dismember it, or suck out its little neuro tissue, and \ndeliver it that way can be worse for the mental health of the mother \nthan actually allowing it to go full term, and then to go through the \nnormal grieving process. All the mental health professionals tell us \nthat denying mental grieving processes can actually be worse for \npeople.\n  I think the health arguments are really not very good arguments. I \nthink they are weak on their merits. It is just impossible to justify \nthe type of things that go on with this procedure. We really should be \nbanning it.\n  I appreciate the sponsor of the bill for the work he has done on \nthis, and leading this country, I believe, in the right direction.\n  I want to make a couple of other comments on the underlying \namendment, which is an amendment talking about Roe v. Wade.\n  Once again, really good people disagree on this issue. They look at \nit differently. I am the father of three. Actually, with my third \nchild, the doctor didn't get there on time, and I, along with the \nnurse, delivered our third child. We could see him on the ultrasound \nthroughout the process. Just being through the miracle of childbirth \nwhen every one of my children was born, I cried like a little baby. I \ndidn't know which one was crying harder, the baby when it came out, or \nthe father.\n  Appreciation for life is so important, I believe, in society. I think \nthe whole idea of abortion has degraded the value of life in our \nsociety. We need to get back to valuing life. Life is so precious. We \ncannot take it for granted.\n  While I don't want to say anything against somebody else who feels or \nbelieves differently on the other side; if you really believe it is a \nbaby, then we shouldn't be taking that innocent life. We should value \nit instead. I believe it is a baby from the time of conception. I \nbelieve that what we should be protecting are the babies, as human \nbeings.\n  If you know anything about embryology--obviously veterinarians study \na lot of embryology. Physicians study it, nurses, and any health care \nprofessional studies embryology. When a human being is conceived, it is \nnot going to be anything but a human being. When you see the \nembryological picture, they may look like something else early on, but \nthey are fully human. The full human chromosome complement is there \nfrom the time of conception. It isn't something that is added later. It \nis just in a different stage of development. It is very analogous to \nhow my 5-year-old is at a different stage of development than that of \nmy 11-year-old. They are both fully human, but they are at a different \nstage of development. A 1-month-old baby is not capable of taking care \nof itself. It is in a different stage of development than an adult. An \n18-week or 16-week or 14-week human being in the womb is just at a \ndifferent stage of development.\n  If we learn to protect and value human life, I would submit we would \nbe better off as a country.\n  I think this debate gets too personal because we don't give credit to \neach side for having legitimate feelings on this issue sometimes. I \nrespect people on the other side of this issue. I disagree with them, \nbut I respect them. I hope more and more people will form relationships \nwith people on both sides of this issue so that more and more dialog \ncan happen and we can sit down together and try to look at this issue \nfor what it really is. I believe that if we start seeing ourselves as \nchildren of God, that we, in the long run, will value human life, and \nsome day we will stop abortion from happening in America.\n  I thank the author of this bill. I thank him for all of his great \nwork on this. I consider him a great friend and a great American for \ndoing this.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I yield 15 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, I thank my friend from Iowa. I thank \nhim for introducing this important sense-of-the-Senate resolution \namendment that will reaffirm Roe v. Wade, making it very clear that the \npolicy of this Senate is for abortion to be legal, safe, and rare.\n  But I have to confess I am somewhat bewildered that we are having \nthis debate at this time in our Nation's history. Obviously, the \nRepublican leadership here in the Senate--along with the House and the \nWhite House--has made a choice. Of all the grave challenges facing our \nNation at this moment in history, we want to work together to \ncriminalize a private medical decision made by women and their \nphysician. With so much at stake, and when our economic security, \nnational security, and domestic security are at stake, I believe that \nis an unusual and, in my view, a misguided choice.\n  Today, 300,000 men and women wearing the uniform of our military \nstand in harm's way in the Persian Gulf. The other day we learned that \nIran has progressed at an alarming rate for developing its own nuclear \nweapon capacity. North Korea continues to lob both rhetoric and \nmissiles to demonstrate that it is wanting to be taken seriously as to \nthe threat it poses to our immediate, imminent security.\n  Thousands of Americans continue to fight against al-Qaida in \nAfghanistan and search for Osama bin Laden. With so many American lives \non the line, the Republican leadership has decided to spend its time \nworking to criminalize a medical procedure that is used in very few \ncases and only when the health and safety of the woman is at stake.\n  Today, we know with all of these global uncertainties that we have a \ndeepening economic crisis made worse because of the potential for war. \nLast month, we lost 312,000 private sector jobs--the steepest decline \nsince the days following the attack of September 11. Consumer \nconfidence has dropped to its lowest level since October 1993. The \nnumber of Americans who have been out of work for 6 months or longer \nhas climbed to nearly 2 million. February marked the 20th consecutive \nmonth the private sector experienced negative job growth--the longest \nstretch of negative job growth since World War II.\n  With so many American families struggling to make ends meet until \nthey can find work, the Republican leadership has made the choice to \ndebate how best to criminalize a private medical decision made by women \nand their doctors.\n  Just last week, we learned the Federal budget crisis is far worse \nthan was previously reported. The deficit is at a record $304 billion \nand climbing. Projections to eliminate our debt by 2008 have been \nreplaced with new projections that have our debt level rising to \nhistoric highs.\n  You know about the $5.6 trillion surplus this administration \ninherited. It is gone, along with our Social Security and Medicare \ntrust funds. Out in our States, our States, our cities, and our \ncounties are facing incredibly difficult economic times. The States are \nfacing a combined budget deficit of $85 billion--the worst financial \ncrisis in a generation. We still have billions and billions of dollars \nof unmet homeland security needs.\n  With so much uncertainty here at home, the Republican leadership has \nmade the choice to debate how best to criminalize a medical procedure \nfor women.\n  I have to ask myself: Why was this moment chosen for this debate? Why \naren't we debating the steps we could take to help the 8.5 million \nAmericans who are out of work? Why aren't we debating how we can get \nour Federal budget back on the road to balance and begin to diminish \nthese overwhelming deficits and this increasing debt load we will leave \non the backs of our children?\n  Why are we not debating the necessity of our paying our bills? Why \nare we not debating what needs to happen if and when those 300,000 men \nand women in the military in the Persian Gulf are called to action, and \nin the days that would follow a military victory?\n  As I travel around, talking with people in my State, that is what \nthey talk to me about: What about this war, Senator Clinton? What is \ngoing to happen after a war, if it happens? What about homeland \nsecurity? Are we as safe as we need to be here at home? Senator,\n\n[[Page S3586]]\n\nwhat can we do about the jobs that are disappearing, the stagnant \neconomy? How on Earth can we deal with this overwhelming budget \ndeficit? What about not funding No Child Left Behind and the burdens \nthat are being put on public education as a result? When are we going \nto get around to a prescription drug benefit for our seniors who are \nsuffering and having to face these large bills? What are we doing to \nprotect our environment? We are, after all, stewards of our natural \nenvironment for future generations.\n  Those are the questions I am being asked. Not only do I believe this \nis an inappropriate and unfortunate time for this debate to be \noccurring, but I find it deeply ironic that it is taking place in the \nmonth of March, Women's History Month.\n  Apparently, some people believe that the purpose of Women's History \nMonth is to literally bring us back to a time in history when women had \nno choices. Instead of celebrating our accomplishments and improving \nthe health and safety of women in the United States and \ninternationally, there are those who would put women's health at risk.\n  But if we are to debate this emotional issue, then we must do so with \ngreat care--care about the words we use and the laws we write. Every \ntime we use inflammatory language in this Chamber, it limits our \nability to talk about this very private, personal decision between a \nwoman, her loved ones, and her doctor.\n  Emotions run high with this issue. And I deeply appreciate my good \nfriend from Nevada and the way he acknowledged we have very serious \ndifferences. But this is not a place nor is this a subject where we \nshould be using language as a weapon to divide Americans.\n  So I am very concerned about some of the words I have heard used on \nthis floor over the last several days. ``Execution,'' ``murder''--those \nare very inflammatory words that do not do justice to this great \nChamber, nor to the seriousness of this debate.\n  I am also concerned about some of the visual aids that have been used \nby some of my colleagues. They are as deceptive as they are \nheartbreaking. Because what do they show? They show a perfectly formed \nfetus, and that is misleading. Because if we are really going to have \nthis debate, then we should have a chart that demonstrates the tragic \nabnormalities that confront women forced with this excruciatingly \ndifficult decision. Where are the swollen heads? Where are the charts \nwith fetuses with vital organs such as the heart and the lungs growing \noutside the body? Why would we choose not to demonstrate the reality of \nwhat confronts the women I know, women who come with medical diagnoses \nthat have said the brain in the head is so swollen that the child, the \nfetus, your baby, is basically brain dead? Now, it can be kept alive \nbecause it is on life support in the mother's body, but let me tell you \nwhat the realities are: these children cannot live outside the womb for \nmore than mere seconds or minutes. That is what these women hear when \nthey go in for their medical examinations and get the worst news that \nany potential mother could receive.\n\n  So a picture is worth a thousand words, as long as it is a realistic \npicture about what it is we are confronting, because a large part of \nthis debate is about words, the words that are left out of this bill: \nthe health and well-being of the mother.\n  The way this bill is written, the choice of language eliminates the \ndistinction of trimesters. The vagueness makes this bill applicable to \nmany other procedures in addition to the ones explicitly named. This \nbill is extreme, deceptive, and unconstitutional.\n  As my colleague from Pennsylvania stated: This is the beginning of \nthe end. And that is absolutely what he means. If this bill passes, it \nis the beginning of the end of Roe v. Wade, it is the beginning of the \nend of the right of women in this country to make the most personal and \nintimate decisions that any of us would ever be called upon to make.\n  Yesterday, I had the opportunity to sit down with several women who \nhave gone through this terribly difficult decision. What was so sad \nabout each of these women's stories was how much each of them wanted \nthe child they were carrying--only to learn that a fatal abnormality \nhad inflicted each one, creating an unshakable sorrow. Each woman knew \nthat her baby would not live long in utero or for no more than seconds \nor minutes outside her womb.\n  One of the women in my office told such a sad tale of what had \nhappened to her and her husband. After trying so hard to become \npregnant, they were thrilled when she discovered she was pregnant. But \nher happiness quickly turned to grief when doctors explained that her \ndaughter had a genetic syndrome called Trisomy 13.\n  Now, many fetuses with Trisomy 13 die in utero. And those who survive \nbirth do not live for long.\n  Her choice was not easy, and it was a choice she made with \nprofessional medical advice and with her family.\n  This young woman, Audrey Eisen, a Ph.D. student, articulated her \nconcern perfectly when she wrote:\n\n       Along with my sadness came a realization that if such \n     legislation passed the right to safe second trimester \n     termination of pregnancies might not remain available to \n     those women who come after me. In this event, I don't know \n     how these women will endure; I don't know how I would have \n     endured.\n\n  I also met with Maureen Britell yesterday. Her daughter had developed \na disorder where the brain stem develops. It is a disorder instead of a \nbrain. After consulting with the experts at New England Medical Center, \nher family, and friends, she terminated her pregnancy. And listen to \nwhat she says:\n\n       Now I'm sharing my story not only as a mother who would be \n     banned from having an abortion, but as a military wife. I \n     find the timing of this bill highly offensive, as we military \n     families are just days away from sending our loved ones into \n     armed combat. I resent the administration using families like \n     mine as a cloak in their effort to ban reproductive health \n     care in this country.\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the full statements of \nboth of these women be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Audrey Eisen in Opposition to S. 3\n\n       I believe that I am not atypical--34 years old and \n     desperately wanting children. My husband and I are both \n     graduate students, pursuing our PhDs in physics and \n     microbiology, respectively. Tom and I have been together for \n     eight years, married for four, and trying to have a baby for \n     two. In November of 2002, after successfully fighting \n     hormone-related infertility and experiencing the sadness of a \n     miscarriage in July, we were thrilled to find ourselves \n     pregnant!\n       While still apprehensive, we consciously decided to be \n     excited--another loss would hurt just the same, regardless of \n     whether or not we had allowed ourselves to be happy. In the \n     first few months, my endocrinologist performed ultrasounds \n     about every week and a half to ensure that the embryo was \n     developing normally. It was such a treat to be able to see \n     our child growing. I keep the pictures and my thoughts in a \n     pregnancy journal.\n       When it became evident that we were going to make it \n     through the first trimester, my endocrinologist referred me \n     to an obstetrician (OB). At my first appointment the nurse \n     put a Doppler to my belly and, much to my amazement, from a \n     seemingly great distance I hear the characteristic ``whoosh'' \n     of my child's heartbeat. We were on top of the world thinking \n     that, for sure, this one was going to make it.\n       At 13 weeks we had a special ultrasound scheduled. Upon \n     examination of the fetal anatomy we discovered that the child \n     had polydactyly (more than the normal number of digits). \n     While at first we thought it was just the hands, we later \n     learned that the feet were affected as well. At the time, my \n     husband and I thought that this was no big deal--we had both \n     known people with an extra finger. However, we soon found out \n     that polydactyly is associated with over 100 syndromes, most \n     commonly Trisomy 13.\n       Trisomy 13 is a chromosomal abnormality in which there are \n     three, rather than two, of the 13th chromosome. This syndrome \n     is characterized by multiple abnormalities, many of which are \n     not compatible with life beyond a couple of months. Most \n     fetuses with Trisomy 13 die in utero; of those who make it to \n     birth, almost half do not survive past the first month; \n     roughly three-quarters die within 6 months. Long-term \n     survival is one year. Unfortunately, neither life nor death \n     come easily for these children--theirs is a painful \n     experience marked by periods of breathing cessation (apnea) \n     and seizures. Because my OB was unable to get a good image of \n     the brain during the 13th week ultrasound, we returned at 15 \n     weeks.\n       The first thing my OB examined during this ultrasound was \n     the fetal brain. He did not say anything. I could tell he was \n     holding something back and asked that he tell me what he saw. \n     He said, ``It is not normal.'' The rest of the scan was a \n     blur as tears ran down my cheeks and those of my mother and \n     husband, who had accompanied me. Following the scan, the \n     doctor left us alone to compose ourselves, after which we met \n     with\n\n[[Page S3587]]\n\n     a genetic counselor. I cried with my whole body, from the \n     depths of my soul.\n       Shortly thereafter, I had amniocentesis. My doctor informed \n     us that the full amnio results would take two weeks, but we \n     could have FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) results \n     in a couple of days. We had both studies done. The FISH \n     results were as expected; our baby had Trisomy 13.\n       At this point we discussed our options with the genetic \n     counselor. My husband and I both felt strongly that it was in \n     both the child's and our best interest to terminate as \n     quickly as possible. The genetic counselor told us that we \n     could either have a D or be induced. My doctor described \n     both procedures, and we decided that a D was clearly best \n     for me. The procedure was performed four days later, on the \n     first day of my 16th week of pregnancy.\n       Upon arriving home from the hospital following my D, a \n     news story appeared on the television describing new \n     legislation in the state senate aimed at banning ``partial \n     birth abortion.'' I don't think that I really understood this \n     issue, emotionally or intellectually, until I was in the \n     position of having to terminate my much-desired pregnancy. \n     Along with my sadness came a realization that if such \n     legislation passed the right to safe second trimester \n     termination of pregnancies might not remain available to \n     those women who come after me. In this event, I don't know \n     how these women will endure; I don't know how I would have \n     endured.\n       Two weeks following the procedure, we received a letter \n     from the genetic counselor with the full results of the amnio \n     and a summary of the ultrasonic findings. Our child had a \n     complete duplication of the 13th chromosome and exhibited \n     holoprosencephaly, a failure of the forebrain to properly \n     develop and separate from the rest of the brain, a \n     ventricular septal defect in the heart, and omphalocele, a \n     herniation of a portion of the abdominal organs into the \n     umbilical cord. Our child was also a girl and we miss her \n     very much. In our case, abortion was the only choice.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  Statement by Maureen Britell on S. 3\n\n       In February 1994, my family was happily awaiting the birth \n     of Dahlia, our second daughter. My pregnancy was progressing \n     smoothly and we were getting more excited as the days and \n     weeks passed. At the time, my husband, Andrew, was on active \n     duty in the Air Force and had been unable to come to any of \n     my routine prenatal checkups. He wanted to share in the \n     excitement, so when I was five months pregnant, we scheduled \n     an additional ultrasound.\n       When we went in for our appointment, that joy dissipated. \n     The technician was unable to locate my daughter's brain. \n     After my doctor came in, he informed us that Dahlia had a \n     fatal anomaly called anencephaly, where the brain stem \n     develops, but not the brain.\n       I went to the New England Medical Center for a high level \n     sonogram, which confirmed what my doctor had told me. The \n     medical experts at the New England Medical Center reviewed \n     our options with Andrew and me, but they all recommended the \n     same thing: to protect my health, we should induce labor.\n       I am a Catholic and the idea of ending my pregnancy was \n     beyond my imagination. I turned to my parish priest for \n     guidance. He counseled me for a long time, and in the end, he \n     agreed that there was nothing more I could do to help my \n     daughter. With the support of our families and our priest, \n     Andrew and I made the decision to end the pregnancy.\n       I was scheduled for a routine induction abortion in which \n     medications are used to induce labor. My doctors anticipated \n     that it would be a standard delivery and that because Dahlia \n     had no brain she would die as soon as the umbilical cord was \n     cut. After 13 long hours of labor, I started to deliver \n     Dahlia. Unexpectedly, complications arose and Dahlia lodged \n     in my birth canal. The placenta would not drop. Our doctors \n     had to cut the umbilical cord to complete the delivery, and \n     avoid serious health consequences for me. Dahlia died while \n     still in my birth canal--the same description used in the so-\n     called ``partial birth abortion.''\n       My husband and I still mourn the loss of Dahlia. However, \n     because of the excellent medical care I received, I was able \n     to become pregnant again and in June 1995, we welcomed \n     Nathaniel into our family.\n       Now I'm sharing my story not only as a mother who would be \n     banned from having an abortion, but as a military wife. I \n     find the timing of his bill highly offensive, as we military \n     families are just days away from sending our loved ones into \n     armed combat. I resent the administration using families like \n     mine as a cloak in their effort to ban reproductive \n     healthcare in this country.\n       In a perfect world, I would never have to write you this \n     letter. Every pregnancy would be wanted, healthy and happy--\n     and no loved ones would be going off to war. Until that time, \n     however, there will be other families like mine. And until \n     that time, abortion must be kept safe, legal and accessible.\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Now, if these bills were to pass, each of these women \nwould have been forced to carry their babies to term, only to see a \nchild with such severe abnormalities die upon or shortly after birth. \nTheir choices would have been limited not because of their moral and \nreligious beliefs--which I deeply respect--nor because of their medical \nadvice--which I can't possibly second-guess--but because of their \nGovernment.\n  I have to respectfully disagree with my colleagues about mental \nhealth. If we have learned anything in the last several decades, it is \nthat there is no artificial divide between mental and physical health. \nThe mind and the body are a totally integrated system. One affects the \nother. I believe that mental health is health. And I believe that \nforcing a woman to carry a child she knows will die is an assault not \nonly on her mental health but on our values as a nation and a free \npeople.\n  Part of the reason I feel so strongly about this is because as First \nLady, I had the great privilege of traveling around the world \nrepresenting our country. I have been to many places I never thought I \nwould have gone in the past. I have seen what happens in other \ncountries. I listened to women throughout the world.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 15 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield an additional 5 minutes to the Senator from New \nYork.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I have listened to women throughout the world who have \nstruggled against government regimes that forced them to bear children \nor to abort them. The decision was taken totally out of their hands. It \nwas left to chambers such as this to make those most personal and \nintimate of decisions. I will give you a few quick examples.\n  In pre-democratic Romania, they had a leader named Ceausescu, a \nSoviet style Communist dictator, who decided it was the duty of every \nRomanian woman to bear five children so they could build the Romanian \nState. So they eliminated birth control, they eliminated sex education, \nand they outlawed abortions.\n  Here is what happened to you if you were a woman in Romania during \nthe Ceausescu regime: Once a month you would be rounded up at your \nworkplace. You would be taken to a government-controlled health clinic. \nYou would be told to disrobe while you were standing in line. You would \nget up on the table. You would be examined by a government doctor with \na government secret police officer watching. And if you were pregnant, \nyou would be monitored to make sure you didn't do anything to that \npregnancy.\n  When I first heard this, I was dumbfounded. I said: ``Please, that \ncannot be true.''\n  That is what happened. If a woman failed to conceive, her family was \nfined a celibacy tax of up to 10 percent of their monthly salary.\n  The terrible result was many children were born who were abandoned, \nwho were left to be raised in government-run orphanages. We all know \nwhat happened when unfortunately HIV-tainted blood was used to help \nsome of those children for medical reasons, and there was a huge \noutbreak of HIV/AIDS among these Romanian orphans.\n  Now go to the opposite side of the world and the opposite side of \nthis debate. In China, local government officials used to monitor \nwomen's menstrual cycles and their use of contraceptives because they \nhad the opposite view--no more than one child. So whether it was \nRomania saying you have to have children for the good of the state, or \nChina saying you can only have one child for the good of the state, the \ngovernment was telling us what we were supposed to do with our bodies.\n  If you wanted to have a child in China, you needed to get permission \nor face punishment. After you had your one allotted child, in some \nparts of China, you could be sterilized against your will or forced to \nhave an abortion.\n  Today women in Romania and China are working to ensure their \ncountries' family planning practices are voluntary and respectful of \nindividual rights.\n  I don't think we could dismiss these examples. I have seen where \ngovernment gets this kind of power, it can be quickly misused. The old \nstandard maxim by Lord Acton: Power corrupts; absolute power corrupts \nabsolutely.\n  I raise these issues not because they are part of the past or because \nthey happened somewhere far away, but because I can guarantee you, \nstanding here as a Senator, if we go down this path, you are going to \nhave the same kind of overzealous, interfering prosecutors and police \nofficials doing the\n\n[[Page S3588]]\n\nvery same kinds of things in this country.\n\n  Why did we ever have to do Roe v. Wade to begin with? Some States \nlike mine, let abortion, as long as it was done safely and legally, \noccur under certain circumstances before Roe. Why did we have to have a \nSupreme Court decision? We had to have it because in many parts of the \ncountry these kinds of decisions were not permitted to be made by \nindividual women.\n  Look at the progress we have made. The U.S. abortion rate is now at \nthe lowest level it has been since 1974. When I was First Lady, I \nhelped to launch the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy. We \nincreased education and public awareness. And since 1991, teen \npregnancy has also declined. We learned that prevention and education, \nteaching people to make good decisions, really did work. But that is \nnot what we are talking about here. We are talking about those few rare \ncases.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield the Senator an additional 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. We are talking about those few rare cases when a doctor \nhad to look across a desk at a woman and say, I hate to tell you this, \nbut the baby you wanted, the baby you care so much about, that you are \ncarrying, has a terrible abnormality.\n  We had a chance yesterday to build on these successes and do even \nmore for women's health and to prevent unwanted and unsafe pregnancies. \nSenator Murray's amendment would have increased access to contraceptive \ncoverage by ensuring basic fairness for women in preventing health \nplans from discriminating against contraceptive coverage in their \nprescription drug plans. Yet my colleagues did not vote for that. They \nwould much rather criminalize a health procedure than improve women's \nhealth. Senator Murray's amendment would have also provided Medicaid \nand CHIP coverage for pregnant women and their newborns. Yet again, we \ndefeated that on a budget point of order because we are not really \ninterested in women's health. That is not really what this debate is \nabout.\n  I have to ask myself, why do we, as government officials, expect we \ncan make these decisions? We know that people of means will always be \nable to get any health care procedure they deem necessary. That is the \nway it was before Roe v. Wade. That is the way it will be after this \npasses the Senate.\n  So who are we really leaving out? We are leaving out the vast \nmajority of American women, middle income women, working women who \ncan't get on an airplane to go to Sweden or some other place. I have \nalso seen the results of that. In a hospital in northeast Brazil, a \nwoman's hospital I visited, I went up and down the corridors. Half the \nwomen were there for the most wonderful of reasons, because they just \nhad a baby. The other half were there because of problems they had \nencountered, mostly because of botched back-alley, illegal abortions. \nSome of them lost their fertility forever; some of them lost their \nlives.\n  When I asked the minister of health what they were going to do about \nthis, he said to me: This is a classic case where it is the poor, the \nmiddle class that suffer. The rich can get whatever health care they \nneed. We can make it illegal to get abortions. That doesn't bother the \nrich. There has always been a double standard. If you are rich, you get \nwhat you need. If you are poor, you are left to the back alleys.\n  That is one of the other reasons we had to do Roe v. Wade, because is \nit fair that we have that kind of distinction made on the basis of \nclass or income instead of the basis of law?\n  We are facing a moment of historic importance, but not about what we \nshould be debating at this time in our history. I only wish this \nlegislation were not before us. But now that it is, we have to educate \nthe American public.\n  I will end by referring again to the young woman, Mrs. Eisen, who was \nin my office yesterday, about 25 years younger than I am. Hard to \nimagine. She said: I had no idea that the decision I made with my \nhusband and my doctor to deal with this genetic abnormality was \nsomething I could have never had under the laws of where I lived \nbefore, and that if this passes, it will become illegal in the future.\n  I said: Well, you didn't have to think about that. That was something \nthat, thankfully, we took off the national agenda. But there are those \nwho, from very deeply held beliefs, which I respect, would wish to \nsubstitute the Government's decision, just like they did in Romania and \nChina, or substitute the roll of the economic dice, such as happens in \nBrazil and elsewhere for what should be a difficult, painful, intimate, \npersonal decision.\n  This bill is not only ill-advised, it is also unconstitutional. I \nunderstand what the other side wants to do. They are hoping to get \nsomebody new on the Supreme Court and to turn the clock back \ncompletely, to overrule Roe v. Wade, which is why the Senator from Iowa \nhas such a timely amendment.\n  Is this bill really about what the sponsors say, or is it, as they \ncandidly admit, the beginning of the end--to go back in this country to \nback-alley abortions, to women dying from botched, illegal procedures? \nI think you can draw your own conclusions.\n  It is up to the American public to determine whether they want \nmedical decisions being criminalized by this Senate. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Yes, on the Senator's time.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Yes. The Senator from New York said that the women she \nhad in her office who had late-term abortions--you characterized it \nthat they would be ``forced to carry their children to term'' if this \nbill passed. Do you stand by that statement?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Yes, I do.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. So you believe if this legislation passes outlawing \npartial-birth abortion, no late-term abortions would be available?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. That is what I believe based on what I consider to be \nthe slippery slope of the legislative language that you have carefully \nand cleverly crafted in this bill.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. OK. I suggest that the Senator from New York examine \nthe language. It is very clear that this is one particular kind of \nabortion we have addressed, and we have addressed the vagueness, as put \nforth by the U.S. Supreme Court. And there are other techniques \navailable for abortion that are late term in nature, and this bill \nwould in no way stop other abortions. In fact, the previous speaker on \nthe Democrat side, Senator Kennedy, made that very point. He made the \npoint that this will not stop abortions.\n  I respect your feelings and I also respect Senator Kennedy's. You \nboth oppose the bill and you have opposite opinions on this issue.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Will the Senator permit me to respond to his statement?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Yes.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I heard the Senator from Massachusetts referencing the \nfact that, legal or illegal, this is not going to prevent abortions \nwhere they are necessary.\n  My reading of the legislative language you have put forth, makes a \nvery clear argument that this is a slippery slope; that there are going \nto be not only difficulties in defining procedures, but the fact is \nthat once you have criminalized this procedure, what doctor will \nperform any medically necessary procedure? There is no reason to \nbelieve any doctor would put his practice and his life at risk.\n  As we know right now, a trial is going on in Buffalo, NY, for the \nmurder of a doctor who provided such services.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator. I gave her an opportunity to \nanswer, and I have a couple more questions. No. 1, you suggested that \nthis procedure was extreme. Does the Senator know the most recent \nGallup polls--the polls consistently have shown that the banning of \nthis procedure is supported by anywhere from 65 to 75 percent of the \nAmerican public? What is your definition of ``extreme''?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I respond to the Senator from Pennsylvania that I think \nit is extreme when the Government prescribes medical procedures that \nmay--despite their not being ones that most of us would ever hope to \nhave experienced by any loved one--be necessary in certain specific \nevents, that were medically determined.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. So you would suggest that something that is supported \nby--you are going to maintain your\n\n[[Page S3589]]\n\ncomment that something that is supported by 70 percent of the American \npublic is extreme?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Well, I think the Senator from Pennsylvania is posing a \nfalse syllogism. Clearly, if people are told in a poll about the kinds \nof procedures that might be medically necessary out of context, I can \ncertainly understand why the reaction might be that is not something \nthat we want to talk about, not something we want to think about. But \nwhat I do think is extreme is making a decision in this body to outlaw \na medical procedure that may be required and medically necessary.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. So you don't think the American public understands this \nissue well enough to be able to form a judgment--I think that is what \nyou are saying--even though we have debated this issue and it has been \nvery much in the literature across America now for 7 years. There have \nbeen referendums in States and wide debate. You just don't think the \npublic understands it. I beg to differ with you on that. I think I \ncould stipulate that something that has the support of 70 percent of \nthe public is, by definition, not extreme. So if you don't agree, that \nis your position, and I respect that.\n  The other thing you said was the chart I had up is ``deceptive.'' I \nam very curious about how you came to that conclusion. Is it deceptive \nbecause it shows a perfectly formed baby?\n  Is the Senator aware of Ron Fitzsimmons who runs the Association of \nAbortion Clinics? He has said, when the argument was made by many of \nthe people Senator Boxer and Senator Murray and yourself referred to, \nwho came forward and talked about this being medically necessary or \nnecessary because of complications late in pregnancy--Ron Fitzsimmons \nsaid he lied through his teeth when he gave that argument? That was his \nterm. He said, ``I lied through my teeth'' that this was the case. He \nsaid it is a dirty little secret, and we all know--those are his \nterms--that late-term abortions are performed, and the vast majority of \nlate-term abortions are performed on healthy mothers with healthy \nbabies.\n  So do you believe it is deceptive to put before the American public \nthe typical case of where a partial-birth abortion is performed, or \nwould it be more deceptive to try to convince the American public that \nthis is done for medical reasons, or on sick babies in the majority of \ncases, when it is not true?\n  Which would you say is more deceptive?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. You know, on the Senator's point, I am not arguing \nagainst any public education effort, any proselytizing, any means \nwhatsoever to persuade people about what choice they should make. I \ndon't, in fact, think that we have done enough to educate the public \nabout reproductive health, about how to prevent unsafe and unwanted \npregnancies, about how to improve contraception, and about what is \nreally at stake in this debate over a women's right to make decisions \nabout her own reproductive health. But for the Senator to imply that \nthere are never instances of abnormalities and problems like the ones \nrepresented by the women in my office yesterday, which would be \noutlawed by your legislation, I believe is deceptive.\n  We could solve this, as we have now for 20, 30 years, by saying this \nis a debate that does not belong in the United States Senate. It \nbelongs in the hearts, minds, consciences of women and their loved \nones, and in the medical offices of America, not the U.S. Senate.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I will challenge you to find anyplace in the record \nover the last 7 years where I said that was never the case. I have \nnever said there are not difficult cases. What I have said repeatedly, \nbecause I wanted to be truthful with respect to the factual situations \nwith which we are presented on the issue of late-term abortions and the \ninstances in which partial-birth abortions are used--I refer the \nSenator to the State of Kansas where they have to report the reason for \na partial-birth abortion; 182 were done last year, or the year before, \nand of those 182, none--zero--were done because of a problem with the \nchild or a physical problem with the mother. They were classified as \nmental health.\n  So I suggest to the Senator that those in the abortion industry \nthemselves say this is the typical procedure on the typical baby. There \nmay be--and there are--a small number of cases that are late-term where \nyou find out the child within the womb has a fetal abnormality and may \nnot live. I just suggest--and you used the term--where is the brainless \nhead? Where are the lungs outside the body? I will just say I will be \nhappy to put a child with a disability up there. But, frankly, I don't \nsee the difference in my mind--and I am not too sure the public does--\nwith respect to that being any less of a child.\n  It is still a child, is it not? Maybe it is a child that is not going \nto live long, but do we consider----\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. In a moment. Do we consider a child that may not live \nlong, or may have an abnormality, to be less of a child? Is this less \nof a human because it is not perfect? Have we reached the point in our \nsociety where because perfection is so required of us, that those who \nare not perfect don't even deserve the opportunity to live for however \nlong they are ticketed to live in this country?\n  Are we saying we need these kinds of infanticides to weed out those \nwho are not going to survive or those who are not perfect, and that \nsomehow or another we have to have a method available that we only \nallow perfect children to be born? If that is the argument, I am \nwilling to stand here and have that debate. If that is what you want us \nto show, I am willing to stand and show that.\n  I suggest this is the typical abortion that goes with partial-birth. \nThat is exactly what the industry says is the case. If the Senator \nwould like me to find a child that has a cleft palate, I can do that. \nThat doctor from Ohio performs a lot of abortions. He says he did nine \nin one year because of that. If she would like me to show a case of \nspina bifida, I can do that. That may be a reason someone has to have a \nlate-term abortion.\n  I would be happy to show those, but those are the exception rather \nthan the rule, and I think it is imperative----\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I will be happy to. It is imperative upon us to present \nthe standard, the predominant case in which partial-birth abortions are \ndone, and that is what we are doing. I will be happy to yield for a \nquestion.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. The Senator from Iowa got in first.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Go ahead. The Senator is engaged in debate. I have a \nquestion.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Fine.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Does the Senator's legislation make exceptions for \nserious life-threatening abnormalities or babies who are in such \nserious physical condition that they will not live outside the womb?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. No, if----\n  Mrs. CLINTON. That is the point.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I understand the Senator's point. I guess my point in \nrebuttal is that if you want to create a separation in the law between \nthose children who are perfect and those children who are not----\n  Mrs. CLINTON. No----\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Please, let me finish. If a child is not perfect, then \nthat child can be aborted under any circumstances. But if that child is \nperfect, we are going to protect that child more. I do not think the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act would fit very well into that \ndefinition. The Americans with Disabilities Act--of which I know the \nSenator from Iowa has been a great advocate, and I respect him greatly \nfor it--says we treat all of God's children the same. We look at all--\nperfect and imperfect--as creatures of God created in his image.\n  What the Senator from New York is asking me to do is separate those \nwho are somehow not the way our society sees people as they should be \ntoday and put them somewhat a peg below legal protection than the \nperfect child. I hope the Senator is not recommending that because I \nthink that would set a horrible precedent that could be extrapolated, I \nknow probably to the disgust of the Senator from Iowa, certainly to me.\n  No, I do not have an exception in this legislation that says if you \nare perfect, this cannot happen to you; but if you are not perfect, \nyes, this can occur. The Senator is right, I do not.\n\n[[Page S3590]]\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. To respond, if I could, to the Senator from \nPennsylvania, my great hope is that abortion becomes rarer and rarer. I \nwould only add that during the 1990s, it did, and we were making great \nprogress. These decisions, in my view, have no place in the law, so \nthey should not be drawing distinctions in the law. This ought to be \nleft to the family involved.\n  The very fact the Senator from Pennsylvania does not have such a \ndistinction under any circumstances, I think, demonstrates clearly the \nfallacy in this approach to have a government making such tremendously \npainful and personal and intimate decisions.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I certainly respect the difference of opinion the \nSenator and I have on the underlying issue of abortion. Again, I think \npeople can disagree on that. I, frankly, do not agree there should be a \ndifference between children who are ``normal,'' in society's eyes--I do \nnot know what that means anymore, what a society sees as normal--and \nthose who happen to have birth defects, severe or not. I do not believe \nwe should draw distinctions.\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. If the Senator will yield for one final point, I want \nthe Record to be very clear that I value every single life and every \nsingle person, but if the Senator can explain to me how the U.S. \nGovernment, through the criminal law process, will be making these \ndecisions without infringing upon fundamental rights, without imposing \nonerous burdens on women and their families, I would be more than happy \nto listen. But based on my experience and my understanding of how this \nhas worked in other countries, from Romania to China, you are about to \nset up----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. To liken a ban on a brutal procedure such as partial-\nbirth abortion to the forced abortion policies of China is a fairly \nsubstantial stretch, and I do not accept that as an analogy. I do not \nthink it holds up under any scrutiny.\n  With respect to the other issue, let the record speak for itself.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, if I can ask the Senator for one final \npoint.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. On the Senator's time. I have been more than generous \non my time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask the Senator to yield.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. On the Senator's time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator has been very good about yielding for \nquestions. If the Senator needs more time, I will join him in getting \nunanimous consent to give the Senator more time, if he needs it, \nbecause he has been very good about getting into a discussion. Do not \nworry about time. We will give you whatever time you want.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Is the Senator aware that in the very poll he cited, \nthere is another finding? When Americans were asked if a law should be \npassed with no health exemption, 59 percent said no, it should not \npass.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I appreciate that. Again, that is a good open item for \ndebate. I would suggest that most Americans--and that is why this \ndebate the Senator from Iowa has brought up is so important--do not \nunderstand what the breadth of health exception means. I suspect most \nAmericans understand when they hear health exception, they believe \nthere is some imminent danger to the health of the mother. Of course, \nthat is not what Doe v. Bolton says.\n  Doe v. Bolton talks very broadly of health. I will be happy to give \nthe actual language. Doe v. Bolton is very broad on health to include \neverything from emotional and mental health to familial health, age of \nthe mother. It is as broad a term--in fact, the courts have interpreted \nit to mean anything. It is an exception that, frankly, swallows up any \nlimitation, restriction on abortion.\n  Does the Senator from Iowa have a question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would like the Senator to yield, on my time or his.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Yield on mine. If I need time, I will let the Senator \nknow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I wish to ask the Senator a question. \nThere are a number of issues about the Senator's bill that bothers me. \nOne is how tightly it is drawn and it affords no leeway whatsoever for \ncertain special cases. We talked about the health of the mother. A \nwoman who came to see me some time ago--I do not know if this case is \natypical, but I know it happened to one person. I know it is happening \nto others.\n\n  She and her husband had been trying to have children. She became \npregnant. She found out the child's--basically the brain was outside \nthe head.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Anencephaly is no brain, just a brain stem.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I do not know exactly what that all means. Anyway, I do \nknow she was told by her doctor that there was a possibility--he did \nnot know how remote--but there was a distinct possibility that if she \ncarried this child to term, which was going to die right away, that \nbecause of other complications she had, she might not be able to have \nother children. I am telling you this is what was told----\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If I can respond to the Senator from Iowa, the Senator \nfrom Iowa brings up a very valid point. We reviewed this over and over \nin previous years, and I will address it again.\n  No. 1, there are cases where late in pregnancy there are health \nconsiderations that may cause the child to have to be separated from \nthe mother. There is no question about that. The question is, Is there \na need for this procedure? First off, is there a need for an abortion? \nI think most obstetricians would tell you, no, there is no need for an \nabortion, but there is a need for separation.\n  Separation can be through a normal delivery. It can be through a \ncesarean section. So separation is necessary; abortion is not \nnecessary.\n  The point I am making is this procedure is never medically necessary. \nI have repeated that over and over, and I have asked the Senator from \nCalifornia and the Senator from Washington, and many others, if they \ncan come forward with a case where this procedure is medically \nindicated, medically necessary. They have not come up with a case \nbecause there are none.\n  There may be cases that the Senator from Iowa has discussed where \nthere may be a need for separation, but I would argue not necessarily \nfor abortion. If there is such a case--and I am not that much of an \nexpert to know that because I am focused on this procedure solely, but \nif there is such a case for abortion, then the answer would be there \nare other, safer--this is what I underscore--procedures done in \nhospitals, by obstetricians, who are trained in medical schools.\n  This procedure is done not by obstetricians, not in hospitals, not by \ndoctors trained in medical schools.\n  I ask the Senator, if it was his daughter, would he want to send her \nto someone to have this procedure who is not an obstetrician, not in a \nhospital, someone who is not trained in medical schools or would he \nrather have her go to a board-certified obstetrician in a hospital and \nhave a procedure that is taught in medical schools and has been peer-\nreviewed?\n  What would the Senator prefer?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would prefer we stick with Roe v. Wade which would \nallow my daughter to go to a hospital and to have a doctor perform a \nprocedure on her that in the doctor's best judgment was the safest for \nher.\n  If I can just respond further, if the doctor decided this type of \nprocedure was safer than a cesarean section, for example, which I would \nsubmit to my friend from Pennsylvania is every bit as gruesome if you \nwould like to describe it, but it is up to the doctor to decide what is \nthe safest procedure. That is what I would want my daughter to have, so \nthat is why I have my amendment on Roe v. Wade.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I understand the Senator from Iowa. I would say if the \nSenator wants his daughter to go to the hospital and have an \nobstetrician give her the best procedure she wants, let me assure the \nSenator she will never have this procedure, because this procedure is \nnot done by obstetricians and hospitals. It is not done.\n  I suggest to the Senator what we are doing is getting rid of a rogue \nprocedure that has been demonstrably testified to that this is \ncontraindicated. The AMA: Bad medicine. Their term, not mine.\n  I am saying this is a rogue procedure that is outside the medical \narena. This is outside the standard of care.\n\n[[Page S3591]]\n\n  The Senator knows about the issue of standard of care. He is involved \ngreatly in health issues as the ranking member of the Health \nSubcommittee on Appropriations. I know he cares deeply about that and \nhe knows the issue of standard of care.\n  Nowhere in the literature is this considered to be standard of care. \nAs a result of that, I make the argument--in fact, I have made the \nargument--that this procedure is not healthy to women and as a result \nshould be banned because it is the least safe procedure, and it is not \nappropriate.\n  I will answer one more question and then I would like to speak.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend from Pennsylvania, I am not a doctor. \nI do not know. That is why these are the kinds of things that are not \nreally up to us to decide to tell a doctor what is the safest and what \nis not the safest, or how to go about it.\n  Now, maybe we are getting somewhere. I heard my friend ask me about \nwhat I would want my own daughter to do if she was ever confronted with \nthis, and I said I would want her to have the best care. I would want \nher to have a board-certified obstetrician/gynecol-\nogist take care of her in a safe, healthy, legal setting. That is why I \nhave offered my amendment. That is why my amendment is pending right \nnow because I want us to say once and for all again that Roe v. Wade is \nthe law of the land, that if, God forbid, my daughter ever had a \nsituation like that, she could go into a hospital, that she would not \nhave the law hounding her, and that she could have a board-certified \nobstetrician.\n  So maybe we are getting somewhere. Maybe my friend is now going to \nsupport my amendment.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. No, I am not going to support the amendment of the \nSenator, but I would like an opportunity to speak.\n  Madam President, how much time is remaining on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 30 minutes \nand 15 seconds. The Senator from Iowa has 23 minutes and 27 seconds.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, first, I say again that in many of \nthese difficult cases, if not all of them, to my knowledge--and I would \nbe curious to hear if there is a case I am not aware of where there \nneeds to be a separation of the mother from the child. I am not aware \nof any case, and I would certainly be anxious to hear any testimony to \nthe contrary where separation necessarily means abortion. Separation \ndoes not necessarily mean abortion, and there are other ways to protect \nboth the health of the mother and the health of the child. As a \nsociety, I think if that is possible, then that should be our \npreference.\n  Let me go back and talk about the overall issue of Roe v. Wade and \nwhere we have come as a result of that. Roe v. Wade was decided in \n1973. Maybe the biggest problem I have with Roe v. Wade was that \nabortion was a matter that was decided by the people and by its elected \nrepresentatives. It was, as every other issue is in America, decided in \nthe public square, decided by this kind of debate.\n  I think this is wonderful. I think the people need to hear this. We \ndo not get enough debate on the issue of abortion. It has sort of been \nput away in a corner. Why? I would argue this is the great moral issue \nof our time. It parallels very closely the issue of slavery back in the \nearly 1800s, and the reason is because it is really the same issue.\n  The slavery issue was: Here is the African American, here is the \nblack man and woman, and what we said in this country was we could look \nat this person, we could see this person, but under the Constitution it \nwas not a person. We said this individual, this human being, was not \nconferred personhood under the Constitution. That is what slavery was \nall about. As a result, that person was property. What all of us knew \nto be a human being became property, and we had to fight a war to \neventually overturn that.\n  Where are we with the issue of abortion? The child in the womb is not \nconsidered a person under the Constitution. Now, we can see it in a \nsonogram. That is one of the things that makes partial-birth abortion \nsuch an important debate because the baby can really be seen. One can \nsee this is a human being; it is nothing but. But according to the \nConstitution, this child is not a person.\n  It is the same debate. It is the same argument. William Wilberforce \nin England, when he fought to overturn the slave trade, put together a \nposter. It was a picture of a black man. Underneath the picture, it \nsaid: Am I not a man?\n  I would simply say, look at this chart and under this picture could \nwe not say: Am I not a child?\n  According to Roe v. Wade, according to the law of this great land, \nthe answer to that question is, emphatically, no, and look what we can \ndo to you.\n  Why? Because you are property. You are like the slave. You have no \nrights.\n  How we have twisted our Constitution, which is based on life and \nliberty. What is first, liberty or life? Think about that. Life, \nliberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Do we think the Framers sort of \njust threw those words together? Do we think they could have said, \nhappiness, liberty, life, they sort of played around and said, which \none of these is the right one? Did they put them in order for any \nreason? We can bet they put them in an order for a reason.\n  Can someone have liberty without life? No. There is no way possible, \nif one does not have the right to life, that they can have any liberty.\n  Can someone have true happiness without liberty? No. Life is a \nprerequisite to liberty. But what have we done in the case of Roe v. \nWade? We have taken life and liberty and we have flipped them.\n  In Roe v. Wade, the Court put liberty ahead of life, and said the \nrights of a woman, liberty--this is the liberty clause, this is the \ngrounds from which Roe v. Wade was derived. Of course, the right to \nabortion is not in the Constitution. But where does it come from? It \ncomes from the what clause? The liberty clause.\n  So we took liberty and moved it ahead of life. What are the \nconsequences of that? Obviously, we know what the consequences of that \nare for the child. What are the consequences of that for all of us? The \nconsequences of that for all of us are that now one's freedom to do \nwhat one wants trumps someone else's right to exist.\n  In this case, it is just this little child in the womb. But if we set \nthis precedent, which we have, that my right to my liberty trumps \nanother's right to life--the Senator from New York talks about the \nslippery slope. Oh, what a slope we are on now. The Senator from New \nYork talked about, you did not show the deformed child. Well, there is \na guy in Princeton, NJ, by the name of Peter Singer who talks just \nabout that issue. He talks about the deformed child. And what does he \nsay? He says Roe v. Wade has it right. They put liberty in front of \nlife, and that is right because some people are not worth having \naround. Yes, that is what he says. Is this guy a kook? Is this guy some \nsort of flake who is out there in the ether? No. He is a professor. Is \nhe a professor at XYZ State University at Blackwater, PA? No. He is at \nPrinceton University--a ``distinguished'' chair at one of our great \nuniversities.\n\n  What does he say? He writes: I should think it should be somewhat \nshort of one year.\n  What does he mean, ``somewhat short of one year''?\n  Somewhat short of 1 year after birth that we should be able to--what? \nKill these little deformed children who happen to be born. Why? Well, \nbecause they are not really useful. Their life doesn't mean much. Our \nliberty means more than their life. Here again, moving life in front of \nliberty. Oh, what a tangled web we weave.\n  This is the product of Roe v. Wade. This is the product of the Court \ntaking from us who understand ordered rights--that rights are put in \norder for a reason. Our Founders had it right.\n  Those who proclaim the virtue of abortion as a right said this would \nbe a blessing to our society. They said: This would be a great \nblessing. So many positive things will happen. Divorces will come down. \nSpouse abuse will come down. Infant abuse will come down. Child abuse \nwill come down. Abortions, of course, will go up, but the benefit is \ndomestic violence will go down, teen pregnancy will go down, \ninfanticide will go down, abandoned children will go down. And of \ncourse, none of them did. None of them did. Quite the contrary. All of \nthem have at least doubled since 1973 as a percentage.\n\n[[Page S3592]]\n\n  So this nirvana that getting rid of these--because, see, they argue \nthat since we are going to get rid of 1.3 million children--25 percent \nof all pregnancies end in abortion--since we are going to get rid of \nall these unwanted stresses in people's lives, problems in people's \nlives, then people will be better off, people will be happier, people \nwill be more free; people won't do bad things because they won't have \nthis stress that complicates their life.\n  But is that the lesson that people learn? No. Sadly, people are much \nsmarter than that. They learned from the leaders of our great country \nthat the value of life was diminished. And they learned from our great \ncountry that their personal liberty was more important than your life. \nTheir liberty, their rights, trump you. That is what they learned.\n  As I mentioned earlier, that is why the two guys ran into Columbine, \ntoting their guns and shooting people, screaming, ``I am the law,'' \nbecause that is what Roe v. Wade taught us. They taught us we can put \ndown our neighbor, just like in the early years of this country we \ncould put down the black man and woman.\n  We are on a very dangerous practice. I know we will celebrate and \naffirm Roe v. Wade. Our colleagues will support it because it is the \nlaw of the land and it is well accepted. I accept the fact that in this \nbody I am a voice in the wilderness. But I will speak. This is not the \nmost popular thing to come and talk about. These halls are not filled \nwith people who want to speak on this issue. I understand, this is a \ntough one. You make a lot of people mad when you get up and talk about \nabortion because it is personal. I know. It is personal. But we have to \nstep back.\n  I thank the Senator from Iowa for giving us an opportunity to step \nback and look at what we are doing, look at what we have done, and look \nat what may come of us if we do not turn away and give back to the \npeople.\n  I was at a briefing the other day, and someone talked about the \nIraqis and said: We are worried about them transitioning to democracy \nbecause historically they like being ruled. And I thought to myself: \nJust like Americans on abortion. They like being told what their \nposition should be. They like the Court taking it and ruling. They do \nnot want to have to think about it. They know they do not like it, but \nthey do not want to talk about it, think about it, vote. They want \nsomeone else ruling for them. It is easier to give someone else your \nrights and let them make decisions for you. It makes your life a lot \nsimpler.\n\n  I argue it is not making your life much better. No, what Roe v. Wade \nhas done is separate the person, the human being--and there is no \ndoubt, from the moment of conception this is a genetically human \norganism. It is human, fully human. Nothing is added. It is fully \nhuman. And it is, by definition, alive. How do we know? Because the \ndefinition of life is something that metabolizes, and this clearly is \nmetabolizing. It is human life.\n  What did Roe v. Wade do? It took away the instantaneous bonding of \nhuman life and human person under the Constitution. It separated them. \nI repeat this for emphasis. It separated the human person from the \nhuman being. That precedent is now the law of the land. And you know \nwhat happens with precedent in this country; it is followed. Today for \nthe unborn, tomorrow for--watch out. Watch out.\n  I remember in one of the early debates on this bill, I got an e-mail \nfrom a man from London who said he was sitting there watching the \ndebate, hearing people talk about all these people with disabilities \nwho needed to be destroyed through partial-birth abortion. Not because \nthe mother's health was in danger--because they just were not perfect. \nHe said: I am sitting in my wheelchair as a disabled man with spina \nbifida, knowing that they are talking about me. They are talking about \nme.\n  Today the child in the womb. Tomorrow?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 23 minutes 27 seconds, and the \nother side has 15 minutes 31 seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, it is really very interesting when we \ntalk about disabled children that the man offering this amendment to \nreaffirm Roe v. Wade is the champion for the disabled. He has fought \nfor the disabled all his life.\n  To somehow put out the idea that those who are pro-choice are not for \nthe disabled is another terrible thing to say in this Senate. I have \nbeen in many of these debates over the years, and the comments made by \nsome of my colleagues on the other side of this issue--in terms of \ntheir view toward women, women who want more than anything else to bear \nhealthy children and have those children and, yes, even bear them if \nthey are disabled--are extremely disturbing. The kind of comments we \nhave heard about Supreme Court Justices border on, worse than \ninflammatory, dangerous comments. The comments we have heard about \ndoctors and health professionals are very disturbing to me.\n\n  Let me reiterate that the AMA opposes this bill--my colleague keeps \ntalking about the AMA--and they oppose it because it imposes criminal \npenalties on physicians who they say perform these procedures. So they \nare not in agreement with this bill at all. They find that S. 3 is \nsomething they must oppose.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania keeps asking for specific cases of \nwomen who were told that this procedure was necessary as the safest \nprocedure to save their health and their life. He keeps saying no one \nhas come up with these.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the full text \nof 10 statements by 10 women who so testified.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Statement of Viki Wilson, California in Opposition to S. 3\n\n       I urge you to oppose S. 3. I understand that this bill is \n     very broad and would ban a wide range of abortion procedures. \n     Mine is one example of the many families that could be harmed \n     by legislation like this.\n       In the spring of 1994, I was pregnant and expecting \n     Abigail, my third child, on Mother's Day. The nursery was \n     ready and our family was ecstatic. My husband, Bill, an \n     emergency room physician, had delivered our other children, \n     and would do it again this time. Jon, our oldest child, would \n     cut the cord. Katie, our younger, would be the first to hold \n     the baby. Abigail had already become an important part of our \n     family. At 36 weeks of pregnancy, however, all of our dreams \n     and happy expectations came crashing down around us. My \n     doctor ordered an ultrasound that detected what all of my \n     previous prenatal testing had failed to detect, an \n     encephalocoele. Approximately two-thirds of my daughter's \n     brain had formed outside her skull. What I had thought were \n     big, healthy, strong baby movements were in fact seizures.\n       My doctor sent me to several specialists, including a \n     perinatologist, a pediatric radiologist and a geneticist, in \n     a desperate attempt to find a way to save her. But everyone \n     agreed, she would not survive outside my body. They also \n     feared that as the pregnancy progressed, before I went into \n     labor, she would probably die from the increased compression \n     in her brain.\n       Our doctors explained our options, which included labor and \n     delivery, c-section, or termination of the pregnancy. Because \n     of the size of her anomaly, the doctors feared that my uterus \n     might rupture in the birthing process, possibly rendering me \n     sterile. The doctors also recommended against a c-section, \n     because they could not justify the risks to my health when \n     there was no hope of saving Abigail.\n       We agonized over our options. Both Bill and I are medical \n     professionals (I am a registered nurse and Bill is a \n     physician), so we understood the medical risks inherent in \n     each of our options. After discussing our situation \n     extensively and reflecting on our options, we made the \n     difficult decision to undergo an Intact D and E.\n       It was important to us to have Abigail come out whole, for \n     two reasons. We could hold her. Jon and Katie could say \n     goodbye to their sister. I know in my heart that we have \n     healed in a healthy way because we were able to see Abigail, \n     cuddle her, kiss her. We took photos of her. Swaddled, she \n     looks perfect, like my father, and Jon when he was born. \n     Those pictures are some of my most cherished possessions.\n       The second reason for the intact evacuation was medical: \n     Having the baby whole allowed a better autopsy to be \n     performed, to give us genetic information on the odds of this \n     happening again.\n       Losing Abigail was the hardest thing that has ever happened \n     to us in our lives, but I am grateful that Bill and I were \n     able to make this difficult decision ourselves and that we \n     were given all of our medical options. There\n\n[[Page S3593]]\n\n     will be families in the future faced with this tragedy. \n     Please allow us to have access to the medical procedures we \n     need. Do not complicate the tragedies we already face.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   Testimony of Coreen Costello--1996\n\n       My name is Coreen Costello and I am writing to you on \n     behalf of my family. I have testified before both the Senate \n     and the House concerning the so-called ``partial birth \n     abortion'' ban and my family was with the President when he \n     vetoed this legislation. I have personal experience with this \n     issue for at 30 weeks pregnant I had a procedure that would \n     be banned by this legislation.\n       On March 24, 1995, when I was seven months pregnant an \n     ultrasound revealed that our third child, a darling baby \n     girl, was dying. She had a lethal neurological disorder and \n     had been unable to move any part of her tiny body for almost \n     two months. Her muscles had stopped growing and her vital \n     organs were failing. Her lungs were so underdeveloped, they \n     barely existed. Her head was swollen with fluid and her \n     little body was stiff and rigid. She was unable to swallow \n     amniotic fluid and as a result, the excess fluid was puddling \n     in my uterus (a condition know as polyhydramnios). When we \n     learned about our baby's condition, we sought out many \n     specialists and educated ourselves to see what we could do to \n     save our child. My husband is a chiropractor and we are very \n     proactive about our health care. We are generally skeptical \n     about the medical profession and would never rely on the \n     advice or diagnosis of just one doctor. However, our doctors \n     (five in all) agreed that our little girl would come \n     prematurely and there was no doubt that she would not \n     survive. It was not a matter of our daughter being affected \n     by a severe disability--her condition was fatal.\n       Our physicians discussed our options with us. When they \n     mentioned terminating the pregnancy, we rejected it out of \n     hand. We are Christians and conservative. We believe strongly \n     in the rights, value and sanctity of the unborn. Abortion was \n     simply not an option we would ever consider. This was our \n     daughter.\n       Instead, we wanted our baby to come on God's time and we \n     did not want to interfere. We chose to go into labor \n     naturally. It was difficult to face life knowing we were \n     losing our baby. But it became our mission to make the last \n     days of her life as special as possible. We wanted her to \n     know she was loved and wanted. We asked our pastor to baptize \n     her in utero. We named her Katherine Grace--Katherine meaning \n     pure, and Grace representing God's mercy.\n       Another ultrasound determined Katherine's position in my \n     womb. It was not conducive for delivery. Her spine was so \n     contorted it was as if she was doing a swan dive, the back of \n     her feet almost touching the back of her head. Her head and \n     feet were at the top of my uterus. Her stomach was over my \n     cervix. Due to swelling, her head was already larger than \n     that of a full term baby. For two weeks I tried exercises in \n     an attempt to change her position, but to no avail. Amniotic \n     fluid continued to puddle into my uterus at a rate of great \n     concern to my doctors. I was carrying an extra nine pounds of \n     fluid. It became increasingly difficult to breathe, to sit or \n     walk. I could not sleep. My health was rapidly deteriorating. \n     My family and friends were much more aware of my health \n     decline that I was. My complete focus was on Katherine.\n       As my condition worsened, we again considered our options. \n     Natural birth or an induced labor were not possible due to \n     her position and the swelling of her head. We considered a \n     Caesarean section, but experts at Cedars-Sinai Hospital felt \n     that the risks to my health and possibly to my life were too \n     great. A Caesarean section is done to save babies. It can be \n     a life saving procedure for a child in stress or one who \n     cannot be delivered vaginally. It is not the safest for a \n     woman. There is an increased mortality rate with Caesarean \n     section. In my case, even if a Caesarean could be done, \n     Katherine would have died the moment the umbilical cord was \n     cut. There was no reason to risk my health or life, if there \n     was no hope of saving Katherine. She would never be able to \n     take a breath.\n       Our doctors all agreed that an intact D procedure \n     performed by Dr. James McMahon was the best option. I was \n     devastated. I could not imagine delivering my daughter in an \n     abortion clinic. But Dr. McMahon was an expert in cases \n     similar to mine. My situation and Katherine's condition were \n     not new to him. He explained the procedure to us. My cervix \n     would be gently dilated to maintain its integrity. Once I was \n     dilated enough, Dr. McMahon could being the procedure. In \n     order for Katherine to be delivered intact, cerebral fluid \n     would be removed, which would allow her head to be delivered \n     without damage to my cervix.\n       It took almost three hours to deliver our daughter. I was \n     given intravenous anesthesia. Due to Katherine's weakened \n     condition, her heart stopped beating during the procedure. \n     She was able to pass away peacefully in my womb.\n       Some who support this bill have stated that I do not fit \n     into the category of someone who had a so-called ``partial \n     birth abortion'' because I contend my baby died while still \n     in my womb. Is this relevant? When the procedure began, her \n     heart was still beating--who could predict for certain when \n     she would actually pass away? If this legislation were \n     passed, an intact D would not have been an option for me. \n     The fact is, I had the procedure outlined in this \n     legislation. Since I present the procedure as humane, \n     dignified, and necessary, somehow this means I must have had \n     a different procedure and am not relevant to this bill. This \n     is simply not true.\n       I come to you with no political motivation, rather I come \n     with the truth. I have experience of an intact D Some want \n     you to believe their horrific version of this procedure. They \n     have never experienced an intact D I have. This procedure \n     allowed me to deliver my daughter intact. My husband and I \n     were able to see and hold our daughter. I will never forget \n     the time I had with her, nor will I forget her precious face. \n     Having this time with her allowed us to start the grieving \n     process. I don't know how we would have coped if we had not \n     been able to hold her. Moreover, because I delivered her \n     intact, experts in fetal anomalies and genetics could study \n     her condition. This enabled them to determine that her \n     condition was not genetic. This was crucial for us in \n     deciding whether or not to have another child.\n       No one can predict how a baby's anomalies will affect a \n     woman's pregnancy. Every situation is different. We cannot \n     tie the hands of physicians in these life and health saving \n     matters. It is simply not right.\n       With my health maintained, my cervix intact and my uterus \n     whole, we were able to have another child. On June 4, we were \n     blessed with a beautiful healthy baby boy. He is our delight! \n     He is not a replacement for his sister. There will always be \n     a hole in our hearts where Katherine Grace should be. He is, \n     to us, a sign that life goes on. We cherish every moment we \n     have with Tucker, and with our two other children, Chad and \n     Carlyn. What precious gifts God has given to us.\n       Losing our daughter was the hardest thing we have \n     experienced. It's been difficult to come to Washington and \n     relive our loss. And it's ironic that I, with my profound \n     pro-life views, would be defending an abortion procedure. God \n     knows I pray for the day when no other woman will need this \n     procedure. But until there is a cure for the cruel disorders \n     that can affect babies, women must have access to this \n     important medical option.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 Testimony of Claudia Crown Ades--1999\n\n       My name is Claudia Crown Ades. I live in Santa Monica, \n     California. I have been married to Richard Ades for five \n     joyous years.\n       Three years ago, when I was 26 weeks into what seemed a \n     perfect pregnancy, I made the decision along with my doctor \n     not to have an amniocentesis. At 33, there seemed no need. \n     Then one day, feeling anxious and worried about declining \n     that test, I went to my doctor. There was no basis for my \n     anxiety; it was just an instinct. However, to set my mind at \n     ease, I was sent to a radiologist, an ultrasound expert. \n     ``Don't worry,'' my doctor told me. ``He can see a vein out \n     of place.'' I was never expecting what came next.\n       The radiologist spent far too long conducting what was \n     supposed to be a routine examination of a healthy baby. He \n     told us that he wanted to review the images and that he would \n     call us. The next day, when we returned from Rosh Hashana \n     services, there was a message on the answering machine. ``I'd \n     like you to come back in so that my partner can take a look \n     at your ultrasound. Please don't worry. I don't think it's \n     anything,'' he said. You can't tell a pregnant woman not to \n     worry.\n       His partner, who wrote the authoritative book on \n     ultrasound, immediately determined that there was a sac of \n     fluid in my baby's brain. He called it a Dandy Walker \n     Syndrome. He also told us that many people walk around with \n     Dandy Walker Syndrome without any impairment. On the other \n     hand, it could be more serious and he referred us to a \n     perinatologist for more expert opinion. The doctor put his \n     hand on Richard's shoulder and told him not to lose hope and \n     that everything could be ok. You don't console someone if \n     nothing is wrong.\n       Because of his suspicions, which we were unaware of at the \n     time, the perinatologist rearranged her schedule to see me \n     the next day resulting in an agonizing night of emotional \n     torture.\n       The next day, we went into the perinatologist's office, \n     apprehensive about what we might discover. She prepped me for \n     an ultrasound, and within thirty seconds, the perinatologist \n     said, ``I concur with your doctor.'' Concur with what? At \n     this point we had no idea.\n       This was when our worst fears were realized. At that moment \n     we learned that our son's Dandy Walker Syndrome was more \n     serious than we had known. In addition to a fluid filled \n     nonfunctional brain, he had a malformed heart with a large \n     hole between the chambers that was preventing normal blood \n     flow. He had also developed an extremely large cyst filled \n     with intestinal matter, and hyperteloric eyes which was \n     another indication of severe brain damage. We later found out \n     that these symptoms added up to Trisomy 13, a fatal \n     chromosomal disorder.\n       With each new bit of information, the tears flowed harder. \n     Richard was holding me. I thought we were the only parents in \n     the world who had ever heard such devastating news about \n     their child. What were we going to do? We loved this baby. We \n     wanted this baby desperately. This was our son. We were \n     preparing our family and our world for him. And now, we had \n     to prepare for a tragedy. Away went the baby name books. Away \n     went the shower invitations. Away went the first birthday \n     party, the baseball games, the bar mitzvah. Away went our \n     dream.\n\n[[Page S3594]]\n\n       Along with the tears, the questions flowed. Could a \n     cardiologist fix our son's heart? Could a neurosurgeon repair \n     his brain? Could an eye surgeon help him to see? Could this \n     baby survive? Was there anything, anything at all, that could \n     be done? The answers were emphatically no. It was our worse \n     nightmare and it was real. Even if my son survived the \n     pregnancy, he had no chance of life. Every day meant pain \n     and torture for him. As his mother I could not, in good \n     conscience, allow my child suffer.\n       By this time, a geneticist had joined us to discuss our \n     options. We went through them all. I could carry to term. I \n     could have a cesarean. I could induce pre-mature labor in the \n     maternity ward. All of these posed risks for me. The doctors \n     choose a procedure that would be the most appropriate for me, \n     my baby, and for my future children.\n       The entire process took three days. No scissors were \n     stabbed in the back of my baby's head; his brains were not \n     sucked out and his skull was not crushed.\n       Ironically, the final day of the procedure was Yom Kippur, \n     the holiest day of the Jewish year. On Yom Kippur, we are \n     asked to mourn those who have passed and pray to God to \n     inscribe us into the Book of Life. I prayed more than one \n     person can pray. I was praying for all of us.\n       Although I never imagined I would be faced with such a \n     difficult and painful decision I can honestly say that for \n     many reasons, I feel very blessed. First, I was able to find \n     out when I did. Second, I had access to the finest medical \n     care in the world. And third, I live in a place where my \n     rights as an individual have not been compromised.\n       Though I hope and pray that no one has to go through what \n     my husband and I have, there are people who will. It can \n     happen to anyone--to you, your wife, your sister, your \n     daughter, your friends. All women should have the protection, \n     the guidance and the access that modern medicine allows.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Erica Fox\n\n       In October of 1995 I was pregnant with my first child. I \n     had had amnio and that all came back fine. But at 23 weeks I \n     had another ultrasound, which found that the fetus was \n     suffering from Intra Uterine Fetal Growth Retardation. \n     Further ultrasounds showed that the heart and other organs \n     were very stressed. Two of the top neo-natal specialists told \n     me that the fetus was in the process of dying and that if it \n     made it to term, it would live a short and very painful life. \n     I made the only decision that I, as a mother, could make. I \n     chose to have an abortion. For the sake of my fetus and my \n     health. I was sent to the best clinic in Los Angeles. And \n     over the course of two days the intact D was performed. The \n     doctor and nurses were the most compassionate people I have \n     known. But it was a terrible time. And it was a time made \n     more terrible when a few days later, the United States House \n     of Representatives voted to ban the procedure. I watched with \n     horror the lies about scissors stabbing the Gerber-like baby \n     in the neck. The pain endured. The suffering. I knew the \n     truth was different. The fetus I was carrying was not a \n     Gerber baby. That it was not viable. That the sedatives used \n     on me worked on the fetus. That the fetus was most likely \n     dead long before it was ever taken from my body. I knew that \n     the procedure had saved my reproductive system so that today \n     I have a wonderful five-year-old son. Here he is. A boy so \n     full of life and happiness.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                           Tammy Watts--1995\n\n       We found out I was pregnant on October 10, 1994. It was a \n     great day in so many ways, because on the same day, my \n     nephew, Tanner James was born. My husband and I ran through \n     the whole variety of emotion--scared, happy, excited, the \n     whole thing. We immediately started making our plans--we \n     talked about names, what kind of baby's room we wanted, would \n     it be a boy or girl. We told everyone we knew . . . and I was \n     only three weeks pregnant!\n       It wasn't an easy pregnancy. Almost as soon as my pregnancy \n     was confirmed, I started getting really sick. I had severe \n     sickness, and so I took some time off work to get through \n     that stage. As the pregnancy progressed, I had some spotting \n     which is common, but my doctor said to take disability leave \n     from work and take things a month at a time. During my leave, \n     I had a chance to spend a lot of time with my newborn nephew \n     and his mom, my sister-in-law. I watched him grow day by day, \n     sharing all the news with my husband. We made our plans, \n     excited by watching Tanner grow, thinking ``this is what our \n     baby's going to be like.''\n       Then, I had more trouble in January. My husband and I had \n     gone out to dinner, came back & were watching TV, when I \n     started having contractions. They lasted for about half an \n     hour and they stopped. But then the doctor told me I should \n     stay out of work for the rest of my pregnancy. I was very \n     disappointed that I couldn't share my pregnancy with the \n     people at work, let them watch me grow. But our excitement \n     just kept growing, and we made our normal plans, everything \n     that prospective parents do.\n       I had had a couple of earlier ultrasounds which turned out \n     fine, and I took the alphafetoprotein test, which is supposed \n     to show fetal anomalies--anything like what we later found \n     out we had. It came back clean.\n       In March I went in for a routine 7-month ultrasound. They \n     were saying this looks good, this looks good, then suddenly \n     they got really quiet. The doctor said ``This is something I \n     didn't expect to see.'' My heart just dropped.\n       He said he wasn't sure what it was, and after about an hour \n     solid of ultrasound, he and another doctor decided to send me \n     to a perinatologist. That was also when they told us it was a \n     girl. They said, ``Don't worry, it's probably nothing, it \n     could even be the machines.''\n       We got home and were a little bit frightened, so we called \n     some family members . My husband's parents were away and \n     wanted to come home, but we told them to wait. The next day, \n     the perinatologist did ultrasound for about two hours, and he \n     said he thought the ultrasound showed a condition in which \n     the intestines grow outside the body, something that's easily \n     corrected with surgery after the birth. But just to make \n     sure, he made an appointment for me in San Francisco with a \n     specialist.\n       After another intense ultrasound with the specialist, the \n     doctors met with us, along with genetic counselor. They \n     absolutely did not beat around the bush. They told me, ``She \n     has no eyes, six fingers and six toes and enlarged kidneys \n     which are already failing. The mass on the outside of her \n     stomach involves her bowel and bladder, and her heart & other \n     major organs are also affected.'' This is part of a syndrome \n     called Trisomy-13, where on the 13th gene there's an extra \n     chromosome. They told me, ``Almost everything in life if \n     you've got more of it, it's great. Except for this. This \n     is one of the most devastating syndromes, and your child \n     will not live.''\n       My mother-in-law just collapsed to her knees. What do you \n     do? What do you say? I remember just looking out the window. \n     . . . I couldn't look at anybody. My mother-in-law asked, \n     ``Do we go on, does she have to go on?'' The doctor said no, \n     that there was a place in Los Angeles that could help if we \n     could not cope with carrying the pregnancy to term. The \n     genetic counselor explained exactly how the procedure would \n     be done, if we chose to end the pregnancy, and we made an \n     appointment for the next day.\n       I had a choice. I could have carried this pregnancy to \n     term, knowing everything that was wrong. I could have gone on \n     for two more months, doing everything that an expectant \n     mother does, but knowing my baby was going to die, and would \n     probably suffer a great deal before dying. My husband and I \n     would have had to endure that knowledge, and watch that \n     suffering. We could never have survived that, and so we made \n     the choice together, my husband and I, to terminate this \n     pregnancy.\n       We came home, packed, and called the rest of our families. \n     At this point there wasn't a person in the world who didn't \n     know how excited we were about the baby. My sister-in-law and \n     best friend divided up a phone book and called everyone. . . \n     . I didn't want to have to tell anyone. I just wanted it to \n     be over with.\n       On Thursday morning we started the procedure, and it was \n     over about six pm Friday night. The doctor, nurses and \n     counselors were absolutely wonderful. While I was going \n     through the most horrible experience of my life, they had \n     more compassion than I've ever felt from anybody. We had \n     wanted this baby so much. We named her Mackenzie. Just \n     because we had to end the pregnancy didn't mean we didn't \n     want to say goodbye. Thanks to the type of procedure Dr. \n     McMahon uses in terminating these pregnancies, we got to hold \n     her and be with her and have pictures for a couple of hours, \n     which was wonderful and heartbreaking all at once. They had \n     wrapped her up in a blanket. We spent some time with her and \n     said our good-byes and went back to the hotel. Before we went \n     home, I had a checkup with Dr. McMahon, and everything was \n     fine. He said, ``I'm going to tell you two things: first, I \n     never want to see you again. I mean that in a good way. And \n     second, my job isn't done with you yet until I get the news \n     that you've had a healthy baby.'' He gave me hope that this \n     tragedy wasn't the end, that we would have children just as \n     we'd planned.\n       I remember getting on the plane, and as soon as it took off \n     we were crying because we were leaving our child behind. The \n     really hard part started when I got home. I had to go through \n     my milk coming in, everything you go through if you have a \n     child. I don't know how to explain the heartache. There are \n     no words. There's nothing I can tell you, express or show you \n     that would allow you to feel what I feel. Think about the \n     worst thing that's happened to you in your life and multiply \n     it times a million . . . maybe then you might be close. I \n     couldn't deal with anybody, couldn't see anybody--especially \n     my nephews. It was too heartbreaking.\n       Eventually I came around to being able to see and talk to \n     people. I am a whole new person, a whole different person. \n     Things that used to be important now seem silly. My family \n     and my friends are everything to me. My belief in God has \n     strengthened. I never blamed God for this, I'm a good \n     Christian woman . . . however I did question. Through a lot \n     of prayer and talk with my pastor, I've come to realize that \n     everything happens for a reason, and Mackenzie's life had \n     meaning. I knew it would come to pass someday that I would \n     find out why it happened, and I think it's for this reason: \n     I'm supposed to be here to talk to you, and say, ``You can't \n     take this away from women and families. You can't. It's \n     so important that we be able to make these decisions, \n     because we're the only ones who can.''\n       We made another painful decision shortly after the \n     abortion. Dr. McMahon called and\n\n[[Page S3595]]\n\n     said, ``This will be very difficult, but I have to ask you \n     this. Given the anomalies she had, so vast and different, \n     there is a program at Cedars-Sinai, which is trying to find \n     out the causes for why this happens. They would like to \n     accept her into this program.'' I said, ``I know what that \n     means. Autopsies and the whole realm of testing.'' But we \n     decided, how can we not do this? If I can keep one family \n     from going through what we went through, it would make her \n     life have some meaning. So they're doing the testing now. And \n     because Dr. McMahon does the procedure the way he does, it \n     made the testing possible.\n       I can tell you one thing--after our experience, I know more \n     than ever that there is no way to judge what someone else is \n     going through. Until you've walked a mile in my shoes, don't \n     pretend to know what this was like for me . . . and I don't \n     pretend to know what someone else is going through. \n     Everybody's got a reason for what they have to do. Nobody \n     should be forced into having to make the wrong decisions. \n     That's what you'll be doing if you pass this legislation. Let \n     doctors be free to treat their patients in the way they think \n     is best, like my doctor did for me.\n       I understand that this legislation would make doctors like \n     mine criminals. My doctor was the furthest thing from a \n     criminal in the world. Many times I've called him my angel . \n     . . they say there are angels walking around the world \n     protecting us, and I know he was one. If I wasn't led to Dr. \n     McMahon, I don't know how I would have lived through this. I \n     can't imagine where we'd be without my doctor. He saved my \n     family, my mental stability, and my life. I couldn't have \n     made it through this without him, and I know there are a \n     great many women out there who feel the same way.\n       I've still got my baby's room, and her memory cards from \n     her memorial service, her foot and handprints. Those are good \n     things, good memories . . . but she's gone. The best thing \n     that I can do for her is to continue this fight. I know she \n     would want me to. So, for her, I respectfully ask you to \n     reject this legislation.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   Teresa M. Tauchi--October 11, 2000\n\n       I consider Julia Kiyono to be our first child. She was born \n     on Thursday, April 20, 2000, but did not live long enough to \n     receive a social security number. I have never seen her birth \n     or death certificate. Outside of the hospital in which she \n     was born and beyond our circle of family and friends, she \n     never existed. But she will always be our first child.\n       The story of my pregnancy with Julia is like that of so \n     many other women who receive poor fetal diagnoses. Shock. \n     Denial. Bargaining with God. Hope. Anger. Grief. Acceptance. \n     Moving forward. It has been the longest six months of my \n     life.\n       At 23 weeks gestation, our baby was diagnosed with a lethal \n     form of skeletal dysplasia, a bone development disorder more \n     commonly known as dwarfism. The length of her femur and \n     humerus were five-to-six weeks behind in growth. Her thorax \n     was also measuring abnormally small--her heart nearly filled \n     her chest cavity and her lungs had no room to develop. Two \n     separate perinatalogists predicted respiratory failure \n     shortly after birth. For our baby, survival outside of the \n     womb was impossible.\n       We received the news on a Friday. Sam and I passed the \n     entire weekend by ourselves, canceling all social engagements \n     and deflecting the inquiries of our friends. We weren't \n     prepare to tell anyone other than our immediate family. We \n     wouldn't have known what to say.\n       Instead, we spent the weekend installing a gravel patio in \n     our backyard. On that same Friday, several tons of sand, \n     pebble and cobblestone had been dropped off on our driveway, \n     a delivery that was too late to call off. It seems like a \n     strange task to undertake when your world is falling apart, \n     yet we consumed ourselves with the physical labor of moving \n     rocks, and shaping and smoothing our garden. My six-month \n     pregnancy hardly got in the way. The physical exercise seemed \n     to encourage an already-active baby to turn even more \n     somersaults and thrash more karate kicks inside of me. She \n     felt so alive to me and I cherished every moment.\n       In between the loading and unloading of wheelbarrows full \n     of Pamy pebbles, we took turns crying. We leaned on each \n     other, held each other, and told ourselves that we would \n     somehow get through this. We asked each other why this was \n     happening. We talked about the decisions ahead of us and \n     cried some more. We read through the various pamphlets we \n     received from kindly genetic counselors and wept again. By \n     the end of the weekend we had hardly slept and were \n     physically exhausted, emotionally drained. And we knew that \n     we would terminate our pregnancy.\n       It was not a decision we took lightly.\n       Letting go of this baby seemed, at time, unfathomable. Sam \n     and I had been married a little over a year when we conceived \n     her, and as our first child, this baby was the embodiment of \n     our future, of our new life as a family. Yet she inhabited a \n     body that could not sustain life. We chose to release her \n     soul from that body that would only bring her a painful \n     struggle for breath. Moreover, we wanted her to feel nothing \n     but our happiness and our love--a connection that began from \n     the moment of conception. We didn't wish for her to continue \n     inside of a mother's body consumed by so much grief and \n     anguish, to hear a father's voice filled with such sadness \n     and heartache.\n       I checked into the hospital on Monday evening and was \n     relieved to have my own OB admit me. The nurses were \n     extremely kind and ushered us to a private room in a quiet \n     and empty corner of the labor and delivery ward, away from \n     those mothers and fathers who could feel joy in the \n     anticipation of their arrivals.\n       The induction of labor took two and a half days. Our baby \n     was delivered at 12:35 p.m. on Thursday, April 20, 2000. It \n     wasn't until that moment that we learned we had a little \n     girl--Sam had insisted, through everything, that we wait \n     until the birth to find out the sex of the baby. With the \n     assistance of the hospital chaplain and my sister as our \n     witness, we named her Julia Kiyono. Julia was the first \n     girl's name we had ever agreed on, long before we knew \n     anything could be wrong with the pregnancy. Kyono was in \n     honor of my late great-aunt, whom I grew up with as my \n     grandmother and who had lost her only child, a four-year-\n     old boy, in the internment camps during World War II. It \n     wasn't until that moment, when I held our baby in my arms, \n     that I finally understood the heartbreak that my \n     grandmother had carried with her throughout her 99 years.\n       We kept Julia with us for the short time that she was \n     alive. We cradled her and kissed her. We told her how happy \n     we were to finally meet her and how much we loved her. And \n     when her heart stopped beating two hours later, we whispered \n     goodbye.\n       Today, we call the lush flowering vines, the budding fruit \n     trees, and the fragrant sages that inhabit our backyard and \n     surround the pools of gravel Julia's Garden. We have also \n     planted a baby rose bush in her memory. It produces clusters \n     of bright pink flowers that fade to white as they bloom. We \n     have other reminders--her framed footprints that hang on our \n     bedroom wall, a memory box that holds her receiving blanket, \n     cards and photographs--of Julia's eternal presence in our \n     lives.\n       Unfortunately, the legacy of prenatal testing, lethal \n     diagnoses and termination--the memories we want to move \n     beyond--too will endure. We learned shortly after Julia's \n     death that her specific type of skeletal dysplasia was \n     identified as Short-Rib Polydactyly Syndrome, a lethal \n     condition that is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. \n     This means that my husband and I are both carriers of a \n     recessive gene mutation and have a 25% chance of recurrence \n     with each subsequent pregnancy. Through anecdotal evidence \n     and my own research on autosomal recessive disorders, I have \n     learned that carrier parents often have multiple affected \n     pregnancies.\n       While there are plenty of reasons to believe that we will \n     have a healthy child, I am a firm pragmatist. I know that it \n     can happen to us again and that we will need to revisit the \n     same heartbreaking decision every time--a choice that \n     rightfully belongs to us and us alone.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                        Testimony of Kim Koster\n\n       My name is Kim Koster. My husband, Dr. Barrett Koster, and \n     I have been married for more than seven years. We have known \n     since before we were married that we wanted very much to have \n     children.\n       To our joy, in November of 1996 we discovered that we were \n     expecting. The news was a thrill, to us and to our family and \n     friends. We were showered with gifts and hand-me-downs, new \n     toys, books and love. Barry's family gave us a 19th century \n     cradle, which had rocked his family to sleep since before his \n     grandmother Sophie was born more than 100 years ago.\n       Our first ultrasound was scheduled a little more than four \n     months into the pregnancy. On Thursday, February 20, we saw \n     our baby and spent five short minutes rejoicing in the new \n     life, and then the blow fell. The radiologist informed us \n     that he had ``significant concerns'' about the size of the \n     baby's head. His diagnosis was the fatal neural tube defect \n     known as anencephaly, or the lack of a brain. After four \n     months of excitement and joy, our world came crashing down \n     around us.\n       Once the diagnosis was made, there was no further medical \n     treatment available for me in our hometown, and we were \n     referred to the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics in \n     Iowa City. Our first OB appointment there was set for Monday \n     morning. My husband and I spend that long weekend, the \n     longest of our lives, doing research on anencephaly, talking \n     with family and friends, and hearing personal stories about \n     the fate of anencephalic babies.\n       In Iowa City, a genetics OB specialist examined a new \n     ultrasound and immediately confirmed the diagnosis. An alpha-\n     feto-protein blood test and amniotic fluid sample only drove \n     the truth harder home. Our fetus had only a rudimentary \n     brain. There were blood vessels, which enabled the heart to \n     beat, and ganglion, which enabled basic motor function. \n     There was no cerebellum and no cerebral cortex. There was \n     no skull above the eyes.\n       I had been preparing for pregnancy for more than a year \n     with diet, exercise and prenatal vitamins, including the dose \n     of folic acid recommended to prevent neural tube defects. Yet \n     we still lost our child to one of the most severe and lethal \n     birth defects known. Our baby had no brain--would never hear \n     the Mozart and Bach I played for it every day on our great-\n     grandmother's piano, would never look up into our eyes or \n     snuggle close to our hearts, would never even have an \n     awareness of its own life.\n\n[[Page S3596]]\n\n       On Tuesday, February 25, 1997, my husband and I chose to \n     end my pregnancy with a common abortion procedure known as \n     ``D'' As difficult as it was, I literally thank God that I \n     had that option. As long as there are families who face the \n     devastating diagnosis we received, abortion must remain a \n     safe and legal alternative.\n       In 1998, Barry and I discovered to our delight that I was \n     pregnant again. Although we were overjoyed, our happiness was \n     tempered by the knowledge that we had a 1-in-25 chance of a \n     second anencephalic pregnancy. This time, we asked our loved \n     ones to hold off on the baby gifts, we played no Bach, and \n     every week was a mix of excitement and unavoidable worry. And \n     on July 17, 1998, an ultrasound revealed the worst. We had a \n     second anencephalic pregnancy--a second daughter lost to this \n     lethal birth defect.\n       Fortunately for my medical care, the so-called ``partial \n     birth abortion'' bans have been vetoed by President Clinton, \n     and my doctors were able to provide me with a safe, \n     compassionate procedure that brought this second tragic \n     pregnancy to an end. And thanks to those doctors and their \n     ability to give me that care, my recovery has been rapid--\n     enabling Barry and I to plan to try again.\n       But if this bill becomes law, we would not be able to do \n     so. For the chances of our having a third anencephalic \n     pregnancy are all the way up to 1 in 4, and this bill would \n     ban any procedures that would help us. It would force me to \n     carry another doomed child through all nine months. That idea \n     is far more horrifying than all the unreal anti-choice \n     rhetoric that can be manufactured, for the reality is that \n     this is a terrible law, a grievous interference between \n     doctor and patient, and would only compound the tragedy and \n     heartache faced by families like us.\n       Please protect the health of women and families like mine, \n     and reject S. 1692.\n                                  ____\n\n\n   Testimony of Miriam A. Kleiman, Voters for Choice--March 10, 2003\n\n       My name is Miriam Kleiman. I am 36 years old. I have been \n     happily married to my husband Jason Steinbaum for almost six \n     years. We have a child named Zachary who is 19 months old. I \n     am now pregnant again and am unfortunately unable to be with \n     you today.\n       My pregnancy is currently in the 29th week. In July 2000, I \n     was pregnant with another much-wanted child. My husband and I \n     had been married three years and were excited and ready to be \n     parents for the first time. We had selected furniture, car \n     seats, and other items to help us keep our baby comfortable, \n     warm, protected, and loved. As with many expectant mothers, I \n     was scheduled for a regular obstetrical appointment. At that \n     time, I assumed that this sonogram would be just another \n     joyous look at the baby. I insisted that my husband join me \n     for the appointment to share in the excitement and happiness \n     of seeing our baby.\n       The sonogram technician, however, immediately detected \n     severe problems. The OB was called in at once to tell us that \n     the condition was extremely grave. We were transformed from \n     happy, expectant parents to devastated, panicked people in \n     immediate need of advice and options. We were rushed to a \n     variety of hospitals where I was examined by several doctors, \n     including a perinatologist, neonatologist, and radiologist. \n     All told us that the baby had major brain abnormalities, \n     including severe hydrocephalus and a malformed vein of galen. \n     In other words, our precious baby boy would die at some point \n     in utero or shortly after birth. Our world was shattered, and \n     we needed to find a way to pick up the pieces.\n       After our consultations with these specialists, it was \n     clear that there was no medical miracle to correct the baby's \n     condition. Worse still, our doctors informed us that abortion \n     was not an option because the pregnancy was past the legal \n     limit for termination in most states. They said I had no \n     choice but to wait and deliver our baby at term as if the \n     pregnancy were proceeding normally. Third trimester \n     abortions, they explained, are just not done. Desperate, we \n     begged the head of our obstetric practice for any other \n     options. He calmly explained that there were none--that I had \n     no choice but to carry the baby more than two more months \n     until delivery at full term unless the baby died in utero \n     before that. We directly asked him about the possibility of \n     termination. Our doctor glared at us and responded \n     succinctly: ``We call that murder.''\n       We grasped for second, third and fourth opinions as we went \n     from hospital to hospital. The radiologist we visited \n     repeated the grim prognosis: The baby would die in utero or \n     within days of birth. My husband turned to him and asked: \n     ``if this were your wife, what would you do?'' He responded: \n     ``I would find any way possible to terminate the pregnancy.''\n       If we did nothing, we would be on a death watch, merely \n     waiting for our baby to die. This was totally unacceptable to \n     me or my husband. Personally, I was prepared to go anywhere, \n     at any expense to end our anguish and let us move on with our \n     lives. We loved this baby boy too much and were too attached \n     to him to suffer the misery of waking up every morning \n     awaiting his impending death.\n       We made the dreaded phone calls to inform our parents that \n     their long-awaited grandchild would not survive. Because \n     Jason's father and sister are physicians with a network of \n     colleagues, we learned that we had actually received \n     incorrect information. There was, in fact, an option.\n       For the record, my abortion was performed in August 2000--\n     my abortion was NOT a so-called ``partial-birth procedure.'' \n     After the delivery, my husband and I, along with our mothers, \n     held our intact baby, said a blessing, and bid him goodbye. \n     He is buried at a cemetery in Northern Virginia.\n       We feel a strong obligation to tell our story to inform \n     others of why it is necessary to preserve the right to \n     choose. In doing so, we also feel we are remembering the baby \n     we lost, but still hold dearly in our hearts. It is hard to \n     stress strongly enough that we did NOT ``change our minds'' \n     about being parents. This was a desperately wanted child, one \n     who had been planned for, dreamed of, read and sung to, and \n     long-hoped for. The hardest part for us to convey is how much \n     we did then and continue to love our son, how we remember him \n     and mourn his loss, but how we made a decision that we \n     thought would be more humane. Even in retrospect, two years \n     later, we know we made the right choice.\n       This week, the Senate will consider legislation to end \n     abortions. This would effectively eliminate all options for \n     others like us, who have desperately-wanted pregnancies but \n     whose dreams turn to nightmares with news of devastating \n     medical conditions. If this legislation passes, it would end \n     the important work of the very place that helped us through \n     the worst time of our lives.\n       It is my hope that someday in the future when my doctor and \n     his staff face the harsh rhetoric from the so-called ``right \n     to life'' movement or hear about ill-advised congressional \n     restrictions on a woman's right to choose, they will not see \n     the anger of the anti-choice activists, but will envision \n     instead of face of our healthy son whose picture adorns their \n     wall and will know that what they did for my family--and so \n     many others--was right and helped us reach this day.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am going to just read a paragraph out of each of their \nstories. The first is Viki Wilson, who writes:\n\n       Losing Abigail was the hardest thing that has ever happened \n     to us in our lives, but I am grateful that Bill and I were \n     able to make this difficult decision ourselves and that we \n     were given all of our medical options. There will be families \n     in the future faced with this tragedy. Please allow us to \n     have access to the medical procedures we need. Do not \n     complicate the tragedies we already face.\n\n  Coreen Costello writes movingly. All of these are so moving that I \nwould say if every American could read these, they would know that what \nwe are about to do is wrong because it makes no health exception. She \nsays:\n\n       Losing our daughter was the hardest thing we have \n     experienced. It has been difficult [to talk about our loss]. \n     And it's ironic that I, with my profound pro-life views, \n     would be defending an abortion procedure. God knows I pray \n     for the day when no other woman needs this procedure. But \n     until [then] . . . women must have access to this important \n     medical option.\n\n  Claudia Crown Ades, at the end of her beautiful statement, writes:\n\n       Though I hope and pray that no one has to go through what \n     my husband and I have, there are people who will. It can \n     happen to anyone--to you, your wife, your sister, your \n     daughter, your friends. All women should have the protection, \n     the guidance and the access that modern medicine allows.\n\n  All of these women were told by their physician that the safest \nprocedure is the one that the Senator is going to outlaw here, without \nany exception.\n  Then there is Vikki Stella. She is a diabetic. She was told she \nabsolutely needed this. We went through her story.\n  Then there are a number for whom I do not have photographs. Audrey \nEisen--she says: ``Along with my sadness came a realization that if \nsuch legislation passed,'' tragedy would happen to ``those women who \ncome after me.'' Outlawing these procedures, ``I don't know how these \nwomen will endure; I don't know how I would have endured.''\n  Erica Fox said:\n\n       This procedure is not about murder. It's about finding way \n     to go on. In the end, it's about life. A good life. A healthy \n     life. The life I see every day shining at me in the eyes of \n     my son.\n\n  Tammy Watts:\n\n       I understand the Senate is considering legislation that \n     would ban the kind of surgery that I just had. . . .\n\n  She goes on to talk about this terrible decision. She begs us not to \noutlaw this procedure. She says:\n\n       I can't imagine where I would have been without [my doctor \n     who performed this procedure.] He saved my family. . . . [He \n     saved] my life. I couldn't have made it through this without \n     him, and I know there are a great many women out there who \n     feel the same way.\n\n  Theresa Tauchi writes us on October 11, 2000:\n\n       I know that it can happen to us again and that we will need \n     to revisit the same heartbreaking decision every time--a \n     choice that rightfully belongs to us and to us alone.\n\n\n[[Page S3597]]\n\n\n  Kim Koster wrote to us. She said:\n\n       The reality is that this is a terrible law [this S. 3], a \n     grievous interference between doctor and patient, and would \n     only compound the tragedy and the heartache faced by families \n     like us. Please protect [our] . . . families.\n\n  Miriam Kleiman; this is the last one I have.\n\n       It is my hope that someday in the future when my doctor and \n     his staff face the harsh rhetoric from the so-called ``right \n     to life'' movement . . . they will not see the anger of the \n     anti-choice activists, but will envision instead the face of \n     our healthy son whose picture adorns their wall and will know \n     that what they did for my family--and so many others--was \n     right and they helped us reach this day.\n\n  The reason Senator Harkin's amendment is so important is that under \nRoe v. Wade, the right to choose is guaranteed to a woman in the \nbeginning of a pregnancy, the first few months. And after that we can \nrestrict, but always with an exception for the life and health of the \nmother. That is Roe.\n  Let me tell you why it was important that that decision be made. \nBecause before Roe, 5,000 women a year died from back-alley illegal \nabortions. I don't hear anything about these women. It chokes me up.\n  Women had to go and have back-alley abortions in other places--not a \nclean hospital, not a State-licensed facility, no practitioner who knew \nwhat he or she was doing. Money was slipped across the table, and 5,000 \nwomen a year died. That is why this vote is so important. We must not \ngo back. We cannot go back to those dark days before Roe.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, I yield.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for her stalwart support for all the \nyears I have known her, for the principles and the law of Roe v. Wade, \nto ensure that the women of America have the right to choose. I thank \nher for her stalwart support, and I thank her for her comments this \nafternoon on behalf of this amendment I have offered.\n  I ask the Senator this question. We heard from our friend from \nPennsylvania about certain polls that were taken about a certain \nprocedure and this and that. But this amendment is about Roe v. Wade. \nIs the Senator familiar with polls taken in this country from women \nabout whether or not they would support keeping Roe v. Wade or \noverturning Roe v. Wade? Is the Senator familiar with some of those \npolls?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I haven't seen any recent polls. I wonder if my friend \ncould inform me. I assume overwhelmingly the people of this country \nsupport Roe because it is a moderate decision, a moderate mainstream \ndecision.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is exactly right. I say again to the Senator, when \nit is defined to people, both men and women, what Roe v. Wade really \ndoes in terms of the first 3 months and then after that what the State \ncan do, but with exceptions for life and health of the mother, as the \nSenator so rightfully pointed out, the overwhelming majority of the \nAmerican people say yes, that ought to inure to the individual and not \nto the Government.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Absolutely. I think people are horrified at the thought \nthat a Senator would make such a personal, private decision. Our \ncolleague from Pennsylvania wants to see Roe v. Wade overturned, and \nthat is exactly what would happen. Government would be put in the \nmiddle of the lives, the private lives, of the people of this country. \nThe people would no longer be trusted to make these decisions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I further ask the Senator, would she concur in this view, \nthat perhaps what this is all about is really not about a procedure but \nit really is about fundamentally getting at Roe v. Wade? I say that to \nmy friend from California because 4 years ago when this came up, this \nSenator along with the Senator from California offered the same \namendment. It said that Roe v. Wade--we recognize it as the law of the \nland and it should not be overturned.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield another 5 minutes to the Senator from California.\n  Is the Senator familiar with the outcome of that vote? That vote at \nthat time--I remember it precisely--was 51 to 47. Two people who are \nnot here had announced they were opposed to it, so it was 51 to 49. By \n2 votes, the Senate--49 Senators said Roe v. Wade should be overturned. \nThat is how close we are here. That is why the people of this country \nought to recognize that is what this debate is about--getting at Roe v. \nWade; nothing more, nothing less.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend, he is absolutely right. Because there \nis no health exception in S. 3, it is a complete reversal from Roe.\n  What is shocking is my colleagues on the other side won't even make a \nhealth exception that was narrowly drawn by Senator Durbin. They \ncouldn't even go that far. We all know what could happen to a woman if \nshe does not have this safe procedure. Doctors are telling us. We put \nthose statements in writing. They could have a hemorrhage, their uterus \ncould rupture, they could have blood clots, embolism, stroke, damage to \nnearby organs, and paralysis. Yet S. 3 comes to us without a health \nexception.\n  I say to my friend, the rest of the time is his. I have concluded my \nremarks. I am very proud to stand with him. I think it will be a close \nvote, but I am hoping a winning vote, so the message can go out from \nhere that Roe v. Wade, which balanced all the interests--the family \ninterests, the interests of the fetus, and the interests of the mother, \nwhich said that previability a woman has a right to choose, she will \nmake that decision with her God and her doctor and her loved ones--that \nshould stand. Certainly later in the pregnancy there can, in fact, be \nrestrictions, and always exceptions for the life and health of the \nwoman.\n  I thank my colleague for again offering this amendment. I think it is \nvery important. I hope people of the country will watch the vote and \nwill think about the ramifications.\n  I yield the floor. Senator Harkin retains the balance of time.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nKansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I thank my colleague from \nPennsylvania and my colleague on the other side of the aisle for this \nmost spirited debate.\n  We are finally here debating the most difficult and contentious \nsocial issue of our day. This is one of those elephants in the living \nroom that we in the country across America have been going around \nsaying is not there; not wanting to focus on it; not wanting to \nconfront it; but it is there. This is it, the issue of Roe v. Wade.\n  I was listening to colleagues, thinking of Mose's admonition: \n``Choose ye this day life or death.'' Which will it be? We are finally \nhaving the debate, Roe v. Wade.\n  I would like to remind colleagues. I read it again about 3 months \nago. It is about federalizing State laws so we are clear on this. It is \na lengthy opinion where they said we are going to take all of these \nState laws in a patchwork regarding allowing abortions, or not allowing \nit, and we are going to federalize it. We are going to discover a right \nto privacy and say this is built within the overall thinking of the \nConstitution, the original Framers. We are going to say there is a \nright to privacy that applies to reproductive health. We are going to \ntake the State laws of Kansas, California, Iowa, the Pennsylvania and \nNorth Carolina law, we are going to take all of those laws, throw them \nall out, and say this is the law of the land. We are going to say we \nfound it to be constitutional. There are a lot constitutional scholars \nwho have grave questions about the nature of the basic fundamentals in \nRoe v. Wade, regardless of the issue of abortion, but finding this \nconstitutional right. Lots of people have questions about this \ndecision. I hope fundamentally people will recognize that if you repeal \nRoe v. Wade, you go back to allowing the States to decide this issue, \nwhich is the way it was prior to Roe v. Wade. The States decided this \nissue. Kansas had a set of laws. Other States had sets of laws. This is \nhow it was resolved and dealt with across the land. That is what we are \ntalking about.\n\n  People are saying if you repeal Roe v. Wade, everything goes back \ninto a back alley and no abortions would be allowed in the United \nStates.\n  To be factually correct, what happens? This goes back to the States \nto\n\n[[Page S3598]]\n\ndecide how they will handle this particular issue if you do not have \nRoe v. Wade. When people paint such a cataclysmic change, we recognize \nwhat we are truly legally talking about on Roe v. Wade. What has \nhappened since Roe v. Wade? It has been 30 years now, or a little more. \nForty million babies have been aborted in the United States. We are now \nback and debating this fundamental issue.\n  Really, when you boil it all down, it is what is the legal status of \na young human. The Senator from Pennsylvania beautifully put forward \nthe competing issues of interest here of one side--the mother and the \nchild. Fundamentally, you have to look at it and ask yourself and \ndecide why as a country we have not been willing to confront this \nissue. What is the legal status of the child in utero? What is it? Is \nit a person or it is a piece of property? It is one of the two.\n  When the child is out of the mother's womb, we have clearly decided. \nFive seconds ahead of that time when it is in the womb, what is this \nchild? Five months in the womb, what is this child? Is it a person or \nis it a piece of property? You can say that is an odd way of putting \nthe debate.\n  One of the people who inspired me in this legislative arena was a \ngentleman named William Wilberforce, a parliamentarian in England. He \nled the battle for ending the slave trade by Great Britain. They had \nthis debate on the fundamental issue of what is a slave. Is it a person \nor a piece of property? They even did a Wedgewood plate on this. They \nhad a person in chains as a slave. They put a question around it. ``Am \nI not a man and a brother?'' They asked society that question. ``Am I \nnot a man and a brother?''\n  What is the child in the womb? Is it not a person and a brother? When \nwill we decide? We just simply haven't been willing to say it. We have \nbeen willing to duck around different avenues on it. Now we are talking \nabout research on the young human. We decided to treat it as property \nwhen talking about patenting young human life. You can't patent a \nperson. Therefore, it must be property. But we are uncomfortable \nstating that in law because somehow it doesn't seem quite right.\n  When we let the child live, it becomes a person under everybody's \ndefinition. This actually happened in the slave debate. At one point in \ntime in our Constitution we said a slave is three-fifths of a person \nbecause we weren't willing to say it was a person. It is property, so \nit is three-fifths. We all look back, that was horrible, and that was \nwrong. We know it was wrong.\n  Now you are finding that courts are hearing cases about frozen \nembryos and contesting between the mother and the father in a divorce \ncase on whether to implant or not. They are asking the question in the \ndivorce case: What is the frozen embryo, a person or piece of property? \nNow the courts are having to use the same sort of terms that were used \nin the slave debate. They are asking, Is it a quasi-human with \nthe potential for life? They are still trying to get around the \nquestion of person or property. Which is it? It is one or the other. It \nis one or the other. The courts are trying to find that in a contorted \nway. It is not quite either because we don't want to face it now.\n\n  That is the fundamental question of Roe v. Wade. Is it a person or is \nit property? Am I not a man and a brother?\n  We have coarsened our society in a period of time since Roe v. Wade. \nSince 1973, approximately 40 million abortions have taken place in this \ncountry. We now have a debate in the Nation about whether we are going \nto have a culture of life or a culture of death. I think we would all \nagree we want a culture of life.\n  What does that mean? That means we support and stand for life. We \nstand for it in all phases of life. We stand for it in all difficulties \nand all types of life. It doesn't mean somebody who has some physical \nhandicap has any less of a life than what I have or the Presiding \nOfficer or anybody in this room. This is life we want to celebrate. We \nwant to take that celebration to the weakest and most vulnerable in our \nsociety. We want them to be able to celebrate the culture of life. We \nwant to project that and send that around the world, that we believe in \nthe culture of life.\n  That is what this debate is about. Choose today life or death, \nculture of life.\n  Is a young human a person or property? I think scientific evidence \nclearly teaches over time, if it hasn't already, that this is a person. \nYou can't treat it any other way.\n  I am glad we are having this debate. I am glad my colleague from Iowa \nraised this issue. It is an important one for us. I hope we can \nconclude this. We support the culture of life.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of time allotted to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time do I have, Madam President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eleven and one-half minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to support Senator Harkin's \nSense of the Senate that Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision \nrecognizing a woman's constitutional right to choose, was rightly \ndecided and should not be overturned; I also want to express my \nopposition to the underlying legislation.\n  Thirty years ago, the U.S. Supreme Court held that a woman has a \nconstitutional right to privacy when making decisions concerning her \npersonal reproductive choices. That decision, Roe v. Wade, was \ncarefully crafted to be balanced and responsible while holding the \nrights of women in America paramount in reproductive decisions.\n  And Senator Harkin's amendment is very simple: it asks the U.S. \nSenate to reaffirm that Roe v. Wade was rightly decided and should not \nbe overturned. This amendment asks the U.S. Senate to reaffirm a \nwoman's right to privacy in making her own personal medical and \nreproductive decisions.\n  Roe v. Wade held that women have a constitutional right to choose, \nbut after the point of viability, the point at which a baby can live \noutside its mother's body, States may ban abortions as long as they \nallow exceptions when a woman's life or health is in danger. Yet the \nlegislation before us, which lacks an important health exception, fails \nto do just that: provide for a woman when her health or her life is in \ndanger.\n  In June 2000, the U.S. Supreme Court reinforced the importance of a \nhealth exception with its decision in Stenberg v. Carhart, which \ndetermined that a Nebraska law banning the performance of so-called \n``partial birth'' abortions violated the Roe ruling by the Supreme \nCourt.\n  The Supreme Court has stated unequivocally that every abortion \nrestriction, including bans on so-called ``partial-birth abortion,'' \nmust contain a health exception. The Court emphasized that, by failing \nto provide a health exception, the Nebraska law was structured so as to \nplace a woman's life in danger. That's exactly what the legislation \nbefore us today does as well: it places a woman's life in danger.\n  Despite the Supreme Court's very clear mandate, the legislation \nbefore us today does not provide an exception for the health of the \nmother. For this reason, this legislation, like the one struck down in \nStenberg, is unconstitutional.\n  While I assume the author of this legislation is referring to a \nspecific procedure, the legislation is not clear on that fact. In fact \nthe U.S. Supreme Court held in the Nebraska case that even if the \nstatute's basic aim is to ban one specific procedure, its language was \nso broad that it will also ban other medical abortion procedures.\n  Moreover, this legislation imposes an undue burden on a woman's \nability to choose by banning abortion procedures at any stage in a \nwoman's pregnancy. This bill does not ban post-viability abortions, a \nlimit I would support, but unconstitutionally restricts women's rights \nregardless of where the woman is in her pregnancy.\n  This legislation does not have a clear exception for women's health. \nI fundamentally believe that private medical decisions should be made \nby women in consultation with their doctors--not politicians. And this \nincludes the methods by which a physician chooses to treat his or her \npatients. Why should we decide that here on the Senate floor?\n  And I do not believe that congressional findings make up for medical \nconsultation between a patient and her doctor. But this ban would \nundermine a physician's ability to determine the best course of \ntreatment for a patient.\n\n[[Page S3599]]\n\n  Physicians must be free to make clinical determinations, in \naccordance with medical standards of care, that best safeguard a \nwoman's life and health. Women and their families, along with their \ndoctors, are simply better than politicians at making decisions about \ntheir medical care. And I don't want to make those decisions for other \nwomen.\n  Three states, including my home state of Washington, have considered \nthese bans by referendum. All three failed. We considered this debate \nin my home state in 1998. The referendum failed decisively--by a vote \nof 57 to 43 percent.\n  These so-called ``partial-birth'' abortion bans--whether the \nproposals that have been before the Senate in the past or the one \nbefore us today--are deliberately designed to erode the protections of \nRoe v. Wade, at the expense of women's health and at the expense of a \nwoman's right to privacy.\n  I also want to say that I am extremely disappointed that my \ncolleagues voted down Senator Murry's women's health amendment \nyesterday because the easiest way to reduce the number of abortions is \nto prevent unwanted pregnancies in the first place. One critical way to \ndo this is through better access to contraception, both by improvements \nin insurance coverage of contraception, as well as by improving \nknowledge of, and access to, emergency contraception.\n  The Supreme Court, during the thirty years since it recognized the \nright to choose, has consistently required that, when a state restricts \naccess to abortion, a woman's health must be the absolute \nconsideration. This legislation flouts the Supreme Court's explicit \ndirective, the advice of the medical community, and the will of the \nAmerican people. We must continue to ensure that the women of America \nhave the right to privacy and receive the best medical attention \navailable.\n  I urge my colleagues to support Senator Harkin's Sense of the Senate \nthat Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision recognizing a woman's \nconstitutional right to choose, was rightly decided and should not be \noverturned.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I yield myself a couple minutes, and \nthen I will close up. I know we have some people who need to vote here \nshortly.\n  Madam President, let us be clear about one thing. The amendment I \nhave offered is, I think, as straightforward in its approach as Roe v. \nWade is in its decision; that is, it simply just states Roe v. Wade is \nthe law of the land and should not be overturned. That is what we are \nsaying on this amendment.\n  I have not gotten much into the debate on the underlying bill itself. \nI may later on. I have left that to others. I just feel very strongly \nthat in all the smoke and fog and haze and debate about this procedure \nand that procedure, and all of the kinds of philosophical debates that \nare being made--and some of them are very good. I thank the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania. He has been very good about engaging in discussions \non the floor. Maybe later on I will get into a little more \nphilosophical debate with him on some of these things.\n  But this amendment simply is about Roe v. Wade. That is all this \namendment is. It is for us to express ourselves, to express ourselves \nclearly and unequivocally that the Senate believes Roe v. Wade is the \nlaw of the land and should not be overturned.\n  Let us send a signal to the women of this country that we are not \ngoing to turn the clock back, we are not going to turn the clock back \nto what Senator Boxer from California said: the dark days when they \nwent to back alleys.\n  If my daughter, God forbid, ever found herself in a position like \nthat, as I said earlier, yes, I would want her to go to the best \nhospital, have a doctor, have a good obstetrician, and not be forced \ninto a back alley. I want it legal. That is what Roe v. Wade is about, \nand that is what this amendment is about: to keep it safe, legal, and, \nyes, rare in the United States.\n  I yield back my time.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Edwards and \nSenator Cantwell both be added as cosponsors, and Senator Boxer be \nadded as a cosponsor, and Senator Kerry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I want to address a couple issues and \nthen make a closing argument.\n  One issue I want to address is the point Senator Boxer made, that \nthere were 5,000 deaths of women because of abortions prior to Roe v. \nWade.\n  Let me give a quote from the former medical director of the National \nAssociation for the Repeal of Abortion Laws, NARAL:\n\n       How many deaths were we talking about when abortion was \n     illegal? In NARAL, we generally emphasized the frame of the \n     individual case, not the mass statistics, but when we spoke \n     of the latter it was always ``5,000 to 10,000 deaths a \n     year.'' I confess that I knew that the figures were totally \n     false and I suppose that others did too if they stopped to \n     think of it. But in the ``morality'' of our revolution, it \n     was a useful figure, widely accepted, so why go out of our \n     way to correct it with honest statistics? The overriding \n     concern was to get the laws eliminated, and anything within \n     reason that had to be done was permissible.\n\n  So, obviously, it was not just used to get the law eliminated. It \ncontinues to be used to substantiate the law's existence. And what does \nthis law do? It does many things. Let me summarize by mentioning two.\n  It takes from the American people the people's legitimate right to \ndetermine this crucial, moral issue. It was usurped from the people by \nfiat--not elegantly, I would suggest, but inelegantly by nine Supreme \nCourt Justices, who decided to lord over the States and their elected \nrepresentatives of the people their version of the world, their world \nview, their hackneyed interpretation of a constitutional liberty.\n  That is what happened with Roe v. Wade. It took from the people \nrights to decide their own fate, and rested it in an unelected body, at \nthat time of nine old men. That is one thing Roe v. Wade did.\n  The second thing it did is it took a page, unfortunately, from our \npast, a page we thought we had learned a lesson from; and that is the \npage of the history of slavery.\n  Slavery was a situation in our country where we got our priorities \nout of whack. Our Founding Fathers said, we are endowed by our Creator \nwith certain inalienable rights: life, liberty, pursuit of happiness. \nOrdered for a reason, for without life there is no liberty; without \nliberty, there is no happiness. They didn't say happiness, life, \nliberty; liberty, life, happiness. No, they are ordered for a reason. \nLife is a prerequisite to liberty.\n\n  But in the case of slavery, we put the liberty of the slave owner \nahead of the life of the slave and turned the slave into property. We \nput the rights of the white person in America above the life of the \nblack man or woman. We learned our lesson in a very painful way, but we \ndidn't learn it well enough. The old saying: If you don't learn from \nhistory, you are doomed to repeat it. Here we stand, arguing this \nrepetition of history and just like in this Hall, 150-plus years ago, \npeople from areas of the country argued that this was not a reordering \nor a misordering of liberty. And so they do again today.\n  What we have done is put the liberty rights of people ahead of the \nlife right of the unborn child. We have misordered our liberties. The \npain that it has showered across the land of 40-plus million abortions \nand countless other maladies that have gone on, horrible social \nconsequences result from that. We need to get our liberties back to \nwhere our Founding Fathers put them, where our Creator put them: Life, \nliberty, happiness. First among them is the right to life.\n  I know I will not be successful in this debate, but I hope my \ncolleagues listen to the consequences of putting ordered liberties out \nof order. If you do that, the consequences to our society long term, \nthe precedent we set with this constitutional case will poison the well \nof judicial decisions for many years to come. Today, it is the unborn \nchild. Tomorrow and tomorrows after, it may be you.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn).

Under the previous order, the Senator from \nCalifornia is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 261\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 261 and ask \nfor its immediate consideration. It is short, and I would appreciate it \nbeing read by the clerk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 261.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Post-Viability Abortion \n     Restriction Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON CERTAIN ABORTIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--It shall be unlawful, in or affecting \n     interstate or foreign commerce, knowingly to perform an \n     abortion if, in the medical judgment of the attending \n     physician, the fetus is viable.\n       (b) Exception.--This section shall not apply if, in the \n     medical judgment of the attending physician, the abortion is \n     necessary to preserve the life or health of the woman.\n       (c) Civil Penalty.--A physician who violated this section \n     shall be subject to a civil penalty of not to exceed \n     $100,000. The civil penalty provided for by this subsection \n     shall be the exclusive remedy for a violation of this \n     section.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, this amendment is simple and \nstraightforward. It bans any abortion after viability, except when a \ndoctor has determined that it is necessary to save the life or protect \nthe health of the woman.\n  I have been a part of the Judiciary Committee now for 10 years and I \nhave seen this bill come up in three Congresses and listened to or read \ntestimony on this bill for three Congresses.\n  The first time it came up, it became very apparent to me that the \ndefinition of partial-birth abortion was too vague. I wondered why it \nwas so vague. It looked like it covered different medical procedures. \nAnd now, about 8 years later, I believe I know why it is so vague. I \nbelieve it is so vague because it could actually cover all abortions \nand therefore be a major strike against a woman's right to choose. \nEighty percent of the people of this country believe that abortion must \nbe safe and legal to preserve a woman's health. People strongly believe \nthat this is a decision between a woman, her clergy, her doctor, and \nher family.\n  I deeply believe politicians should not be in the business of making \ndecisions about women's reproductive rights. In my view, the Santorum \nlegislation, S. 3, is a Trojan horse. It is not what it purports to be. \nIt supposedly bans one procedure, D, but actually confuses this \nprocedure with another, D, the most commonly used abortion procedure. \nIn fact, its wording is so vague that it could be construed to \ncriminalize all abortions.\n  Yesterday's Congressional Record shows that Senator Santorum--and I \nhave great respect for my distinguished colleague--stated:\n\n       I have not been asking about medical necessity. . . . I \n     have not asked for someone's opinion on what ought to be or \n     what could be. What I have asked for is an example. I wanted \n     a fact circumstance to be provided as to where this would be \n     the best, this would be appropriate, this would be medically \n     indicated.\n\n  I would like to answer Senator Santorum's question at this time, \nthrough a letter. After we heard this question, we called the \nUniversity of California San Francisco Medical Center, the Department \nof Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Sciences, and talked to the \nchief of that department at San Francisco General Hospital, who is also \na full professor. His name is Philip D. Darney. Dr. Darney just sent me \nthis letter, and I would like to read that letter into the Record:\n\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I write to provide examples of the \n     need for a ``medical exemption'' to the proposed restriction \n     of use of the so-called ``partial birth abortion'' technique \n     which is now before the Senate. The medical term for the \n     technique is ``intact D''.\n       I am Chief of Obstetrics and Gynecology at San Francisco \n     General Hospital, SFGH, where my department provides about \n     2,000 abortions yearly to poor women from throughout Northern \n     California. Patients who are in the second trimester and who \n     have special medical problems are referred to SFGH for \n     treatment because our staff has special competence in second \n     trimester abortion and because we can provide specialized \n     care for women who are more likely to have a complicated \n     pregnancy termination. Although I have not reviewed medical \n     records in order to count the number of times we have \n     employed intact D, I will provide examples of cases in \n     which the technique was critical to safe conduct of our \n     surgery:\n       A 25 year old with two previous vaginal deliveries and \n     bleeding placenta previa and a clotting disorder at 20 weeks \n     was referred for termination of pregnancy. After checking her \n     coagulation parameters and making blood available for \n     transfusion, we dilated the cervix overnight with Laminaria \n     and planned uterine evacuation when adequate dilation was \n     achieved or bleeding became too heavy to replace. Within 12 \n     hours cervical dilation was 3 cm and heavy bleeding had \n     begun. We removed the placenta quickly and used the ``intact \n     D'' approach to complete the abortion and accomplish quick \n     control of blood loss. The patient required a transfusion of \n     two units of whole blood and was discharged the next day in \n     good health.\n       A 38 year old with three previous caesarean deliveries and \n     evidence of placenta accreta was referred for pregnancy \n     termination at 22 weeks because her risk of massive \n     hemorrhage and hysterectomy at the time of delivery was \n     correctly estimated at about 75 percent. After SFGH \n     sonographic studies confirmed placenta previa and likely \n     accreta we undertook cervical dilation with laminaria and \n     made blood available in case transfusion was required. To \n     reduce the 75 percent probability of emergency hysterectomy \n     in the situation of disseminated intravascular coagulation \n     (DIC is quite likely with accreta) we decided to empty the \n     uterus as quickly as possible with the intact D procedure \n     and treat hemorrhage, if it occurred, with uterine artery \n     embolization before our patient lost too much blood and \n     hysterectomy was our only option. This approach succeeded and \n     she was discharged in good health two days later.\n       These two patients provide examples from my memory of \n     situations in which the ``intact D'' technique was critical \n     to providing optimal care. I am certain that a review of our \n     hospital records would identify cases of sever pre-eclampsia, \n     for example, in which ``intact D'' was the safest technique \n     of pregnancy termination, I hope the law will not deny our \n     patients the best treatment we can provide them under life-\n     threatening circumstances. Sincerely, Philip D. Darney.\n\n  This letter is from the chief of obstetrics, gynecology and \nreproductive sciences at one of the best hospitals in the country. It \nanswers Senator Santorum's question. It provides two examples of where \nD, or what some also call intact D, may well have been necessary to \nprotect the health of the woman.\n\n[[Page S3601]]\n\n  Heart disease, cancer, and grave fetal abnormalities are among the \nmany conditions that can make pregnancy especially dangerous to a \nwoman's physical health. Under S. 3, these patients would be forced to \ncontinue a dangerous pregnancy. That is why I am offering my health \nexception amendment today.\n  Indeed, there are many tragic situations that face women today, \nsituations that most could never imagine. There is one thing that has \nalways characterized these debates. That is that everyone looks at them \nfrom their own vantage point without taking into consideration the \nsituations of others. If you have not encountered a difficult \nsituation, such as a possibly dangerous pregnancy, it is hard to know \nwhat you would do. But women and their families face these situations \ndaily.\n  That is as good a reason as any why the Senate should not intrude \ninto this area, and why the reproductive choices of women should be \nleft to the women, their clergy, their morality, their families, their \ndoctors, and not to the Senate.\n  Having said that, the amendment I am offering strikes a balance \nbetween protecting a woman's health and ensuring the D procedure is \nnot abused. This amendment would ban all post-viability abortions \nunless a doctor determines that these abortions are necessary to \nprotect the life and health of the woman. To ensure compliance with \nthis ban, a doctor who performs a postviability abortion on a woman \nwhose health or life is not at risk could be fined up to $100,000.\n  What is wrong with S. 3? I will take a moment to explain why I \nbelieve Senator Santorum's bill is a bad bill. To begin with, it is \nunconstitutional because it lacks a health exception. I heard Senator \nSantorum say a health exception is not necessary. It is necessary. A \nreview of the Supreme Court's abortion decisions and the record makes \nclear that any ban on D what supporters of the Santorum bill \nincorrectly call partial-birth abortion--must include a health \nexception. My amendment includes such an exception.\n  In 1973, Roe v. Wade grounded the abortion right in large part on the \nStates' compelling obligation to protect maternal health. In fact, the \nCourt states that the States' interest in preserving the health of a \npregnant woman grows more important as a woman's pregnancy progresses. \nThus, under Roe, the need for a health exception becomes even stronger \nwith second- or third-term abortion procedures.\n  In 1992, as my colleagues have stated this many times on the floor, \nthe Supreme Court explicitly reaffirmed Roe in Planned Parenthood v. \nCasey. Then in the year 2000, in Stenberg v. Carhart, the Supreme Court \nruled that any ban must have a health exception. I have outlined two \nspecific examples of why such a health exception is necessary. Yet \nSenator Santorum's bill does not have such an exception.\n  At the same time, S. 3 attempts to ban a specific medical procedure \nwhich it calls partial-birth abortion. But the bill offers no medical \ndefinition of partial-birth abortion. Now the American College of \nObstetricians and Gynecologists, whose more than 44,000 members \nrepresent approximately 95 percent of all board-certified OB/GYNs \npracticing in the United States, has developed a medical definition of \nwhat is a D procedure. The American College of OB/GYNs's definition \nof the procedure is very different from Senator Santorum's.\n  I have to ask, why? Why wouldn't the proponents of this bill put in a \nmedically acceptable definition so that those physicians who were \npracticing medicine and may encounter this kind of case would know \nprecisely what is prohibited? I believe I know the answer. The answer \nis that the bill is calculated to cover more than just one procedure. I \nthink it is calculated to ban all abortions. I believe if the bill \nbecomes law, it would be struck down as unconstitutional.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter from \nthe American College of OB/GYNs.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        ACOG Statement of Policy\n\n\n             statement on intact dilatation and extraction\n\n       The debate regarding legislation to prohibit a method of \n     abortion, such as the legislation banning ``partial birth \n     abortion,'' and ``brain sucking abortions,'' has prompted \n     questions regarding these procedures. It is difficult to \n     respond to these questions because the descriptions are vague \n     and do not delineate a specific procedure recognized in the \n     medical literature. Moreover, the definitions could be \n     interpreted to include elements of many recognized abortion \n     and operative obstetric techniques.\n       The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists \n     (ACOG) believes the intent of such legislative proposals is \n     to prohibit a procedure referred to as ``Intact Dilatation \n     and Extraction'' (Intact D & X). This procedure has been \n     described as containing all of the following four elements:\n       1. deliberate dilatation of the cervix, usually over a \n     sequence of days;\n       2. instrumental conversion of the fetus to a footling \n     breech;\n       3. breech extraction of the body excepting the head; and\n       4. partial evacuation of the intracranial contents of a \n     living fetus to effect vaginal delivery of a dead but \n     otherwise intact fetus.\n       Because these elements are part of established obstetric \n     techniques, it must be emphasized that unless all four \n     elements are present in sequence, the procedure is not an \n     intact D & X.\n       Abortion intends to terminate a pregnancy while preserving \n     the life and health of the mother. When abortion is performed \n     after 16 weeks, intact D & X is one method of terminating a \n     pregnancy. The physician, in consultation with the patient, \n     must choose the most appropriate method based upon the \n     patient's individual circumstances.\n       According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     (CDC), only 5.3% of abortions performed in the United States \n     in 1993, the most recent data available, were performed after \n     the 16th week of pregnancy. A preliminary figure published by \n     the CDC for 1994 is 5.6%. The CDC does not collect data on \n     the specific method of abortion, so it is unknown how many of \n     these were performed using intact D & X. Other data show that \n     second trimester transvaginal instrumental abortion is a safe \n     procedure.\n       Terminating a pregnancy is performed in some circumstances \n     to save the life or preserve the health of the mother. Intact \n     D & X is one of the methods available in some of these \n     situations. A select panel convened by ACOG could identify no \n     circumstances under which this procedure, as defined above, \n     would be the only option to save the life or preserve the \n     health of the woman. An intact D & X, however, may be the \n     best or most appropriate procedure in a particular \n     circumstance to save the life or preserve the health of a \n     woman, and only the doctor, in consultation with the patient, \n     based upon the woman's particular circumstances can make this \n     decision. The potential exists that legislation prohibiting \n     specific medical practices, such as intact D & X, may outlaw \n     techniques that are critical to the lives and health of \n     American women. The intervention of legislative bodies into \n     medical decision making is inappropriate, ill advised, and \n     dangerous.--Approved by the Executive Board, January 12, \n     1997.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. According to the American College of OB/GYNs, any \ndefinition of D must include all four of the elements I mentioned \nperformed in the proper sequence.\n  The proponents have refused to use this definition, although the \ndefinition has been available for years. Rather, the language in S. 3 \nis so vague that far from outlawing just one particular abortion \nprocedure, the way this bill is written, it virtually outlaws any \nabortion procedure. This, I believe, is the true intent of this bill--a \nmajor strike, and perhaps a fatal strike, against a woman's right to \nchoose.\n  Everyone agrees that S. 3 lacks a health exception. It purposefully \nlacks a health exception. In the Stenberg case, the Supreme Court ruled \n``significant medical authority supports the proposition that in some \ncircumstances this procedure would be the safest.'' In her opinion, \nJustice O'Connor stated:\n\n       Because even a post-viability proscription of abortion \n     would be invalid absent a health exception, Nebraska's ban on \n     pre-viability partial-birth abortions under the circumstances \n     presented here must include a health exception, as well. The \n     statute at issue here only accepts those procedures necessary \n     to save the life of the mother whose life is in endangered by \n     a physical disorder, physical illness, or physical injury. \n     This lack of a health exception necessarily renders the \n     statute unconstitutional.\n\n  Let me repeat her words.\n\n       This lack of a health exception necessarily renders the \n     statute unconstitutional.\n\n  Now, that is not my colleague, Senator Boxer, speaking. That is not \nthe distinguished Senator from New Jersey speaking. That is not the \ndistinguished Senator from Pennsylvania speaking. That is not the \nmajority leader, a distinguished physician, speaking. That is the \nSupreme Court of the United States. That is the law of the land.\n\n[[Page S3602]]\n\n  This language could not be more clear. However, supporters of the \nSantorum bill argue that they can ignore this language by throwing into \ntheir bill some questionable facts that a health exception is \nunnecessary. They argue that the so-called findings make irrelevant the \nSupreme Court's constitutional determination in Carhart that a health \nexception is necessary.\n  Now, it is not only Carhart. There are a series of other cases.\n  One is Richard Medical Center for Women v. Gilmore, in 1999, which \nwas affirmed by the Fourth Circuit Court in 2000. I quote:\n\n       The record contains significant evidence that the D \n     procedure is often far safer than other D procedures.\n\n  Another is Rhode Island Medical Society v. Whithouse, in 1999, \naffirmed by the First Circuit in 2001:\n\n       Defendants claim that a D could never be necessary to \n     save a woman's health, but the evidence at trial failed to \n     support that contention. Therefore, this court finds that the \n     D could be used to preserve a woman's health and must be \n     available to physicians and women who want to rely upon it.\n\n  If that is not enough, let me mention Hope Clinic v. Ryan, a 1998 \ndecision.\n\n       Intact D reduces the risk of retained tissue and reduces \n     the risk of uterine perforation and cervical laceration \n     because the procedure requires less instrumentation in the \n     uterus. An intact D may also result in less blood loss and \n     less trauma for some patients and may take less operating \n     time.\n\n  Another example is Women's Medical Professional Corp. v. Voinovich, \n1995, affirmed in 1997:\n\n       After viewing all of the evidence and hearing all of the \n     testimony, this court finds that use of the D procedure in \n     the late second trimester appears to pose less of a risk to \n     maternal health than does the D procedure. This court also \n     finds that the D procedure appears to pose less of a risk \n     to maternal health than the use of induction procedures.\n\n  These are all clear district court and appellate court decisions, \nplus a number of clear Supreme Court decisions, and yet S. 3 flies in \nthe face of all of them. All it offers is 15 pages of weak factual \nfindings.\n  The Framers of the Constitution did not intend that Congress be able \nto evade Supreme Court precedent and effectively amend the Constitution \nby holding a hearing and generating some questionable testimony from \nhand-picked witnesses. Let me quote former Chief Justice Warren Burger \non this point.\n\n       A legislature appropriately inquires into and may declare \n     the reasons impelling legislative action, but the judicial \n     function commands analysis of whether the specific conduct \n     charged falls within the reach of the statute and, if so, \n     whether the legislation is consonant with the Constitution.\n\n  The supporters of this bill are effectively trying to overturn \nbinding Supreme Court precedent and to rewrite the Constitution by \nenacting a bill that openly violates Stenberg v. Carhart and other \nSupreme Court opinions. This, in my view, clearly oversteps legislative \nauthority.\n  The Santorum bill also presumes guilt on the part of doctors and \nforces them to prove that they did not violate the law. This is putting \na burden on one group of people, the very people charged with \nprotecting pregnant women from harm. The legislation provides that an \naccused physician could escape liability only by proving that he or she \nreasonably believed that the banned procedure--whatever that procedure \nturns out to be, because it is not defined in the legislation--was \nnecessary to save the woman's life and no other procedure would have \nsufficed.\n  It also opens the door to the prosecution of doctors for performing \nalmost any abortion method by forcing them to prove they did not \nviolate a law that can be interpreted in many different ways. Indeed, \nthis bill is a major step toward making all abortions illegal in the \nUnited States.\n  Why does the Federal Government need to be involved in this issue? \nWhy is this legislation even necessary? Roe v. Wade clearly and \nunequivocally allows States to ban all postviability abortions unless \nnecessary to protect the life and health of the woman. Forty-one States \nalready have bans on the books. So the States have accepted the premise \nof Roe v. Wade. If they have been concerned about postviability \nabortions, as most are, they have taken action, as Roe so provides.\n  The fact is, abortions late in a pregnancy are rare and usually \nperformed under very tragic circumstances. Some States have not seen \nthe need to legislate in this area. Surely anyone who believes in \nStates' rights must question the logic of imposing a new Federal \nregulation on States in a case such as this, where States have already \nlegislated.\n  Finally, I say to my colleagues, the Santorum bill is a bad bill. It \nis clearly unconstitutional. I have cited district court cases. I have \ncited appellate court cases. I have cited Supreme Court cases. S. 3 \nfails to provide a straight health exception for the woman, which is \nnecessary to stand the constitutional test. It is not the role of the \nFederal Government to make medical decisions. It should be up to the \ndoctor and his or her medical judgment.\n  This bill is bad because it attempts to ban a medical procedure \nwithout properly identifying that procedure in medical terms; ergo, it \nmuddies the water and it throws all procedures into risk. It could \naffect far more than the procedure it seeks to ban. And it presumes \nguilt on the part of the doctor, something that, in the case of \nphysicians, may be unprecedented in American law.\n  In our criminal justice system, somebody has to prove you guilty. You \nare presumed innocent. This bill puts the burden on doctors, and it \nignores the vital health interests of women who are often facing tragic \ncomplications in their pregnancies.\n  That is why I am offering this complete substitute to S. 3. This \nsubstitute amendment puts medical decisions back in the hands of \ndoctors. If the doctor believes such a procedure is necessary to \nprotect a woman's life or health, then he or she should be able to \nperform the procedure. I believe it is that simple.\n  I strongly believe that Congress should be supporting legislation \nthat protects a woman's health. For the sake of all Americans, 80 \npercent of whom believe they should have the right to choose to protect \nthe woman's health, from all walks of life, present and future, I urge \nmy colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment.\n  Madam President, I yield 15 minutes of my time to the Senator from \nNew Jersey.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Can we go back and forth?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I have no problem with that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania. I \nwill not speak very long this evening.\n  Madam President, I would like to open my remarks by just talking a \nminute about what one of our very distinguished Senators, Mr. Patrick \nMoynihan, had to say about this procedure. We are not here arguing \nright to life or those who favor abortion. What we are here talking \nabout is a procedure that has been described by Senator Patrick \nMoynihan as follows:\n\n       I think this is just too close to infanticide. A child has \n     been born and it has exited the uterus. And what on Earth is \n     this procedure?\n\n  That is what the distinguished Senator from New York said.\n  We can spend all the time we would like in the Chamber talking about \nRoe v. Wade, about right to life and pro-abortion and where the \nAmerican people are, where the American women are. But that is not the \nissue. The issue is, where do we stand on infanticide, that is to say, \nwhere do we stand on banning a procedure that reduces--that diminishes \nthe life of a child that has been born and has exited the uterus? And, \nas Senator Moynihan said, what on Earth is this procedure?\n  I have been listening attentively. I understand the issue is a very \npersonal one, a very serious one. It is one that is very difficult for \nmany people to even come to the floor and debate, much less describe.\n  I don't choose to describe the procedure. I think my friend, the \nformer Senator from New York, does it well enough in a few words when \nhe says in this case what we are talking about is a child that has been \nborn and has exited the uterus.\n  The question before us is what should we in the United States say \nabout\n\n[[Page S3603]]\n\nwhether or not a doctor should accommodate the killing of a child as so \ndescribed?\n  To me, where people stand in this country on abortion or who wants \nRoe v. Wade and who doesn't isn't the issue. The issue is, where are we \non the actual taking of the life of a child that has already been born \nand has exited the uterus?\n  Roe v. Wade--where our Supreme Court chose to enter this fray--does \nnot address this issue because they are talking about a much earlier \nperiod in the development of a fetus in the mother's womb. Partial \nbirth abortion takes place way past the Roe v. Wade time schedule and, \nin fact, a child is born and then a choice is made regarding the life \nof that child.\n  There are arguments made that this ban is not constitutional. This is \nnot true. I believe, having read the case of Roe v. Wade itself and \nthen the Nebraska case that followed, that it is perfectly clear to me \nthat the Supreme Court is not saying you cannot have a valid statute if \nit properly describes the procedure and it says that a child who has \nbeen born and who has exited the uterus can be put to death. Clearly, \nthe court is not saying in the Nebraska case, nor in the Roe v. Wade \ncase, that you cannot legislate with regard to this issue. I don't \nbelieve one has to spend a great deal of time on the issue. It seems to \nme you are either against partial birth abortion or you are for it.\n  If you are against it, you vote for the bill of the Senator from \nPennsylvania. In that event, the legislation will work its way through \nthe Congress, as it already has twice before. It will go to the \nPresident, as it has twice before. And again, we will ask the \nPresident, Will you sign it or not?\n  I believe it is patently clear that Congress will speak again just as \nit has spoken heretofore twice--not just the House, the House and the \nSenate. Then it will go to the President, but this time it will be this \nPresident. It is my understanding he will sign it. Therefore, the \noverwhelming will of the U.S. Congress about an issue of grave \nsignificance and of great importance will have been decided by the \npolicymakers and presented to the executive branch, and it will be \nsigned.\n  I believe we minimize this issue by saying only a few of these \nprocedures are done. I submit that I have read literature that says \nbetween 3,000 and 5,000 of these abortions are done. I don't believe \nanybody can prove that there are only a few done, but I submit if there \nare only a few, that is a few too many.\n  From my standpoint, I compliment the distinguished Senator from \nPennsylvania. He has carried this bill. He has argued it not only \nvaliantly but with professionalism. I commend him and suggest to him \nthat his many years of effort in this regard will soon see daylight.\n  I yield the floor. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, how much time is remaining on our \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 31\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you, Madam President. I ask that 15 minutes go \nto the distinguished Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator from California. I thank her for \npermitting me to speak.\n  Madam President, I have listened very carefully to the arguments \nbeing made. I think a fundamental question preempts much of the \ndiscussion that is taking place. I think the essentiality to be \nconsidered is who determines decisions about a woman's health? As far \nas I am concerned, it is a relatively simple proposal. Is it the Senate \nwhich determines what we do about a woman's health when her health \ncould be in jeopardy and she makes the decision, in consultation with \nher physician? Should it be the President of the United States? Should \nit be idealogues who want to control the behavior of legitimate actions \nof other persons? Or should it simply be a patient in consultation with \nher doctor and her family, legitimately covered even in reviews by the \nSupreme Court?\n  The bill offered by the junior Senator from Pennsylvania says \npoliticians know best. And I say that is wrong. Keep the politicians \nout of the doctor's office.\n  We should not interfere with the medical judgment of a licensed \ndoctor. Only a woman's personal physician can make judgments about the \nhealth risks of child birth for that particular patient. If a decision \nto terminate the pregnancy is made, it should be only the woman and her \nfamily and her personal physician.\n  I notice the principal supporters of this legislation are the same \nmen who want to take away decisionmaking from the women of this country \nfor their own health. As of today, this bill has 44 cosponsors and all \nbut one of them are males. This creates the establishment, as I see it, \nof ``male-ogarchy'' over women's rights.\n  I say let women decide how to protect their health and their \nfamilies' well-being which is often a question associated with this.\n  I thought we overthrew the Taliban telling women exactly how they can \nact, when they can act, and what they should be able to do. I continue \nto hear a great deal of concern from the other side of the aisle about \nfetuses which they call unborn children. What about the born children?\n  I am reminded of what Congressman Barney Frank said. He is from \nMassachusetts. He said for some people, their zeal for life seems to \nbegin at conception and then ends at birth.\n  Next week we are going to likely work on the budget resolution. I \nexpect that the Republican budget will track the President's fiscal \nyear 2004 plan.\n  What happens to born children under the President's budget?\n  What happens to pre- and postnatal health programs? What happens to \nchild care and nutrition programs? What happens to education and \nafterschool programs? What happens to job training programs? I will \ngive you just a few examples.\n  Under the President's budget, the Head Start Program is weakened by \nturning it into a block grant. We all know the purpose of turning it \ninto a block grant. It is to make it easier to cut the funding for it. \nIn effect, the President is saying to the States: Here, you take this. \nYou figure it out. And by the way, we are going to cut it. The result \nis that thousands and thousands of children who currently participate \nin Head Start will be thrown out of the program. It is a very valuable \nprogram.\n\n  Under the President's education budget, millions of children are left \nbehind. Even though the President named his education proposal No Child \nLeft Behind, the President's budget falls $9.4 billion short of fully \nfunding the new education law that he signed into law only last year. \nThe President would leave more than 6 million born children behind by \nrefusing to provide $6.2 billion in title I funding he promised for \n2004.\n  The President wants to cut funding for schools for military children, \nof all things. The President's budget would eliminate Impact Aid \neducation funding for 110,000 born children whose parents are being \nmobilized to fight the war on terrorism and against Iraq.\n  He wants to make it harder for poor children to get school breakfasts \nand school lunches that, in many cases, are the only nutritional meals \nthey will get in a day.\n  The President cuts Pell grants and eliminates new funding for Perkins \nloans. The President wants to reduce the maximum amount for a grant. \nAnd the President would eliminate $106 million in funding for new \nFederal contributions to Perkins loans, which provide low-interest \nloans for undergraduate and graduate students with exceptional \nfinancial need.\n  What about the children of working-class families? The President is \nwilling to eliminate child care services for 200,000 children over 5 \nyears. These are born children. What about them?\n  If we want to help protect children, why hasn't there been a cry in \nthis Chamber for sensible gun legislation to make our schools and \ncommunities safer? In the year 2000, my gun show amendment passed the \nSenate. It was designed to take away unlicensed dealers' prerogatives \nto sell guns to anybody they wanted to. But it was killed in the House \nby the Republican leadership.\n  There are many other sensible gun laws we could pass, including a \nrequirement that guns have child safety locks. Each and every year, \napproximately\n\n[[Page S3604]]\n\n3,300 born children are killed by gunfire. What about them? Are we \ngoing to pass laws to help protect children from gun violence? Why \nisn't that on the agenda of the junior Senator from Pennsylvania?\n  I commend the President for his commitment to fight the global HIV/\nAIDS epidemic we see in front of us. But I ask, what is the President \ndoing about the growing AIDS epidemic right here in the United States, \nwhere one-half of all new HIV infections are among people under 25? \nWhat about these born children?\n  Right now, the Senate is trying to limit the choices women and their \ndoctors have in making the most personal and painful decision.\n  In 1995, Congress repealed the motorcycle helmet law--I was the \nauthor of that law--because it was seen as an intrusion by the Federal \nGovernment into people's lives. Close to 3,000 people--most of them \nunder the age of 30--die each year in motorcycle accidents. But if we \ntried to bring back the helmet law, I am sure we would hear about how \nintrusive it would be in people's lives.\n  The bill currently before the Senate is nothing more than an \negregious invasion of privacy and an affront to the doctor-patient \nrelationship.\n  Some of my colleagues would like us to believe women casually decide \nto terminate a pregnancy after carrying that fetus well into the third \ntrimester. The ugly, inaccurate, and unfair portrayal some of our \ncolleagues offer about a decision to terminate a pregnancy simply is \nnot true. In fact, 89 percent of all abortions in the United States are \nobtained within the first 12 to 13 weeks. Fewer than 1 percent of all \nabortions are performed after 20 weeks.\n\n  In the most gruesome terms, the supporters of S. 3 draw a revolting \npicture of a process that should be avoided if at all possible. But do \nthey present an alternative scenario of a family with children and a \nmother who is too ill physically or emotionally to continue giving \nguidance, love, and strength to her family because we in Congress \nintervened and told her doctor what he or she could and could not do in \nproviding appropriate medical treatment?\n  This issue is one of trust. Do you trust politicians to make \ncomplicated medical decisions affecting women's lives? Or will you \nleave it to medical experts consulting with families and with patients? \nI say, let's give women and their doctors--not politicians--the right \nto make the choice.\n  Another item, Madam President: I would note the junior Senator from \nPennsylvania continually quotes from an article that appeared in the \nBergen Record, a newspaper in my State. I want to set the record \nstraight since the Senator from Pennsylvania invokes a newspaper in my \nState. Years ago, it was discovered this newspaper article contained \nfalse information. I refer my colleagues to the Congressional Record of \nSeptember 26, 1996, in which I entered a letter into the Record from \nthe health clinic at issue in the article. The letter showed the \nstatistics cited in the newspaper article are false. It is now 6 years \nlater, and I would say it is time for the junior Senator to refrain \nfrom using information that is demonstrably false.\n  There is an old saying: Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, \nbut not their own facts.\n  The decision whether to vote for this bill ought to be an easy one. A \nrecent Supreme Court decision struck down a Nebraska State law modeled \non the very same legislation presented before the Senate by the junior \nSenator from Pennsylvania.\n  The Supreme Court held the Nebraska statute to be unconstitutional \nbecause it is too vaguely worded and it does not contain any exception \nfor the health of the mother. That was the United States Supreme Court \nthat said that.\n  The disregard for the health of a woman in this legislation is \nunconstitutional and it is offensive. I believe the Government should \nnot intrude on these complicated decisions, or tell a woman with \nserious health or fertility risks how to make this difficult decision.\n  I am going to oppose this intrusion into the doctor-patient \nrelationship. Let us continue to give women and their families--not \npoliticians--the right to make these difficult choices. Let them \ndetermine what is right for their well-being and the well-being of \ntheir families.\n  Madam President, I urge my colleagues to oppose this intrusion. It is \nnot a choice that should be made for a woman by politicians who do not \nfeel the pain of this decision.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to add \nSenator Stabenow and Senator Edwards as cosponsors of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from \nOhio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, I rise in strong opposition to the \namendment that has been offered by my friend and colleague from \nCalifornia.\n  A few hours ago, the Senate decisively rejected, in a vote of 60 to \n38, a substitute amendment by my colleague from Illinois. The Feinstein \nsubstitute amendment we are now considering, frankly, is even worse \nthan the failed Durbin substitute amendment. I would like to spend a \nfew minutes to discuss this with my colleagues and explain exactly why \nI believe the Feinstein amendment simply is not good public policy.\n  The Feinstein substitute says that it would be ``unlawful'' to \nperform an abortion if ``the fetus is viable'' in the judgment of ``the \nattending physician.''\n  First, as I have stated earlier, most partial-birth abortions are \nconducted when the fetus is within 20 to 26 weeks, so, just as with the \nDurbin amendment, the Feinstein amendment does not even cover most \npartial-birth abortions.\n  Furthermore, the terms of the substitute, when you look at the \nlanguage, make it practically useless in stopping these abortions.\n  What does the language in the Feinstein amendment mean? Very simply, \nit means the abortion provider--the person who will perform the \nabortion, the person who makes a living doing abortions--is the person \nwho will make the decision of whether or not the abortion is legal.\n  What do I mean by that? Let me explain.\n  Specifically, the Feinstein substitute does not define when a fetus \nis viable.\n  It further imposes no restrictions on the abortionist. Instead the \nsubstitute would permit the abortionist to decide what viability means. \nThe abortionist is the one under this substitute who makes that \ndecision. As long as the abortionist says the fetus is not viable, then \nthe Feinstein amendment would not apply. He could go ahead and perform \nthe abortion. This is obviously not acceptable.\n  We don't have to search very far for an example of how abortionists \nwould apply this standard. At least one abortionist who performs third-\ntrimester abortions has publicly taken the position that viability \noccurs only when a baby can survive independently of the mother without \nany artificial assistance. Of course, that is not what most doctors \nmean when they refer to viability. It is not the standard \nunderstanding. But under the Feinstein substitute, this standard, as \ndefined by this doctor, would be fine.\n  Even just this much discussion should be enough to convince everyone \nof the dangers of accepting this substitute, but there is more. Under \nthe terms of the Feinstein substitute, even if an abortionist should, \ncompletely against his self-interest, declare the baby he has been \nhired to kill is, in fact, viable under the Feinstein substitute, he \ncould still perform the abortion. All that would be required under the \nFeinstein substitute would be for the abortionist to determine, in the \nmedical judgment of the abortionist, that the abortion was necessary to \npreserve the life or health of the mother.\n  As I discussed earlier today, the term ``health of the mother'' is \nalmost impossible to clearly define, based on prior Supreme Court \ndecisions. In fact, the Supreme Court has declared, in an abortion-\ncontext decision, that this term is extremely broad. I quote again for \nmy colleagues from the Supreme Court case of Doe v. Bolton. Here is \nwhat the Court said:\n\n\n[[Page S3605]]\n\n\n       [P]hysical, emotional, psychological, familial, and the \n     woman's age--[are] relevant to the well-being of the patient. \n     All these factors may relate to health . . .\n\n  That is the Supreme Court, Doe v. Bolton. Under this definition, \nalmost any excuse would be enough to justify a late-term partial-birth \nabortion. Yet the abortionist would be within the law because he \ndetermined the health of the mother was at risk.\n  In fact, we have a real-life example of just how this power to define \na mother's health would be used. Kansas is currently the only State in \nthe Union that requires partial-birth abortions to be reported distinct \nand separate from other abortions. In 1999, Kansas abortionists \nreported they performed 182 partial-birth abortions. They also reported \nall 182 of these partial-birth abortions were performed on babies who \nthe abortionists themselves found to be viable.\n  Further, they reported that all 182 of these postviability partial-\nbirth abortions were performed for mental as opposed to physical health \nreasons. Those are very interesting statistics. They tell us a lot. \nEvery single one of these partial-birth abortions, 182 out of 182, were \nreported by the abortionist as being performed on viable children for \nmental as opposed to physical health reasons.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield the Senator 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. After all this, if somehow, somewhere, somebody were able \nto prove the abortionist had in some way violated this law--and I don't \nknow how that would ever happen--the only penalty would be a fine, a \ncivil penalty.\n  If you add it all up, the effects of this substitute amendment are \nclear. It would leave someone like Dr. Haskell, who I have talked \nabout, a professional abortionist who only does partial-birth \nabortions, to perform partial-birth abortions practically at will. \nAccordingly, this amendment would allow thousands of these gruesome \nprocedures to continue to be performed.\n  A vote for the Feinstein substitute is simply a vote to kill the \nPartial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. It is a vote simply to allow partial-\nbirth abortions to continue.\n  Therefore, I ask my colleagues to defeat this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I am a cosponsor of the amendment, and \non behalf of Senator Feinstein, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I appreciate the deeply held views on all sides of this \nissue. But first I will indicate there is not a more fundamental issue \nfor the women of this country that relates to our privacy, respect for \nour own decisionmaking, as well as our own religious beliefs, than this \nfundamental issue we are debating. I also remind my colleagues that the \nterm partial-birth abortion, there is not a procedure called that, but \nthe late-term abortion procedure is in fact one-tenth of 1 percent of \nall of those procedures, all abortions that are done every year. We are \ntalking about a very small group of procedures done when there are real \ntragedies.\n  These are wanted pregnancies, women who have been excited about \nhaving babies and find out very late in the term of the pregnancy that \nthere is a serious or fatal problem. And their families grieve. They \ngrieve over the decisions they have to make about how to proceed, given \nthe information.\n  I believe we need, as a governmental body under the Constitution, to \nrespect their privacy, their religious freedom, for them to be able to \nstruggle with their own decisionmaking, their family's and their faith, \nto be able to do what is best to protect their own life and their own \nhealth.\n  I rise to support the Feinstein amendment strongly and would be \nsurprised, given the vote on the Harkin amendment, if this amendment \ndid not pass. We just had a vote where 52 Members of this great body \nvoted to uphold Roe v. Wade, voted to uphold the constitutionality, the \ndecision made by the Supreme Court in that case. The Feinstein \namendment does nothing more than repeat the language as it relates to \nthe life and health of the mother. It repeats what is current law in \nterms of Roe v. Wade. So those who support Roe v. Wade, who supported \nthe Harkin amendment, should be supporting this amendment as well.\n  I would like to share a couple of letters that talk about what we are \nreally doing.\n  This is a statement by Maureen Britell, given on March 10 of this \nyear. She writes:\n\n       In February of 1994, my family was happily awaiting the \n     birth of Dahlia, our second daughter. My pregnancy was \n     progressing smoothly and we were getting more excited as the \n     days and the weeks passed. At the time, my husband, Andrew, \n     was on active duty in the Air Force and had been unable to \n     come to any of my routine prenatal checkups. He wanted to \n     share in the excitement, so when I was 5 months pregnant, we \n     scheduled an additional ultrasound.\n       When we went in for our appointment, that joy dissipated. \n     The technician was unable to locate my daughter's brain. \n     After my doctor came in, he informed us that Dahlia had a \n     fatal anomaly . . . where the brain stem develops, but not \n     the brain.\n\n  Madam President, can you imagine how that couple must have felt at \nthat moment? As a mother of two children, I certainly can. She goes on \nto say:\n\n       I went to the New England Medical Center for a high-level \n     sonogram, which confirmed what my doctor had told me. The \n     medical experts [there] . . . reviewed our options with \n     Andrew and me, but they all recommended the same thing: to \n     protect my health, we should induce labor.\n       I am a Catholic and the idea of ending my pregnancy was \n     beyond my imagination. I turned to my parish priest for \n     guidance. He counseled me for a long time and, in the end, he \n     agreed that there was nothing more that I could do to help my \n     daughter.\n\n  Madam President, I ask the Senator for 2 additional minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I yield 2 more minutes to the Senator.\n  Ms. STABENOW. She said:\n\n       With the support of our families and our priest, Andrew and \n     I made the decision to end the pregnancy.\n       I was scheduled for a routine induction abortion in which \n     medications are used to induce labor. My doctors anticipated \n     that it would be a standard delivery and that because Dahlia \n     had no brain, she would die as soon as the umbilical cord was \n     cut.\n\n  Madam President, again, can you imagine writing this letter and the \npain of this woman and her family?\n\n       After 13 long hours of labor, I started to deliver Dahlia. \n     Unexpectedly complications arose and Dahlia lodged in my \n     birth canal. The placenta would not drop. Our doctors had to \n     cut the umbilical cord to complete the delivery, and avoid \n     serious health consequences for me. Dahlia died while still \n     in my birth canal--the same description used in the so-called \n     ``partial-birth abortion.''\n       My husband and I still mourn the loss of Dahlia. However, \n     because of the excellent medical care I received, I was able \n     to become pregnant again and in June 1995, we welcomed \n     Nathaniel into our family.\n       Now I'm sharing my story not only as a mother who would be \n     banned from having an abortion, but as a military wife. I \n     find the timing of this bill highly offensive, as we military \n     families are just days away from sending our loved ones into \n     armed combat. I resent the administration using families like \n     mine as a cloak in their effort to ban reproductive \n     healthcare in this country.\n       In a perfect world, I would never have to write you this \n     letter. Every pregnancy would be wanted, healthy and happy--\n     and no loved ones would be going off to war. Until that time, \n     however, there will be families like mine. And until \n     that time, abortion must be kept safe, legal and \n     accessible.\n\n  Madam President, we have thousands of women who have shared similar \nstories. We have thousands who are asking for us to say no to this \nextreme legislation, to support the Feinstein amendment, and to join \nwith us--all of us--in efforts to come forward to prevent unwanted \npregnancies.\n  I was so disappointed that Senator Murray's amendment did not pass--a \npositive effort to focus on prevention, on coming together to focus on \nstopping the unwanted pregnancies on the front end. I was very \ndisturbed to see even a more restrictive effort to show how extreme \nthis effort is--even Senator Durbin's amendment did not pass this body.\n  This is an extreme measure, which will take away the ability for \nwomen to respond when their life or their health is in jeopardy as a \nresult of a pregnancy. This is not what we should be doing in the \nSenate. I urge my colleagues, reaffirm the vote on the Harkin amendment \nto support Roe v. Wade by supporting the language in the Feinstein \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S3606]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, to address the letter the Senator from \nMichigan read, I want to assure the young lady who wrote that letter to \nthe Senator from Michigan--and it is a very compelling story, one that \nhas my sympathy, certainly--my heart goes out to her and her family for \nwhat she had to go through. Let me, please, assure her it is crystal \nclear from the language in the bill that what happened to her is not \noffered under this legislation. I will read it:\n\n       The term partial-birth abortion means an abortion in which \n     the person performing the abortion deliberately and \n     intentionally vaginally delivered the living fetus.\n\n  Here is the key operative language:\n\n     delivered the living fetus for the purpose of performing an \n     overt act that the person knows will kill the partially \n     delivered living fetus.\n\n  The doctor in that case, first off, did not perform an abortion, did \nnot deliver the child for the purpose of killing the child. So it is \nclear beyond a shadow of a doubt--and we have discussed this at \nhearings and on the floor multiple times--there are obviously times, \nunfortunately and tragically, where a birth is either induced, or a \nnatural delivery where complications arise, and for the life of the \nmother the pregnancy is terminated. That is obviously a horrible and \ntragic situation. That is clearly outside of the bounds of this \ndefinition.\n  I just assure this young woman who wrote the Senator, and maybe even \nmet with the Senator from Michigan, her case would not under any \ncircumstances--if you are going through a procedure for the intention \nof delivering the child--this is for a person performing an abortion. \nThis doctor was performing a delivery of a child who had complications, \nwhich resulted in having to terminate the pregnancy to save the life of \nthe mother. That is clear in two cases. No. 1, they weren't performing \nan abortion. They didn't deliver for the purpose of performing an act \nthat the person knows will kill the partially delivered fetus. No. 2, \nthere is a life-of-the-mother exception in the bill. So in either \ncase--predominantly the first case--the case the Senator from Michigan \nread----\n  Ms. STABENOW. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Yes.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I wanted to clarify that, in fact, given the situation, \nthey were performing an abortion to do that. That was the intent of the \nprocedure. It was an abortion. Additionally, I say the mother's life \nwas not in jeopardy, but her health and future fertility were in \nquestion. There were a number of issues relating to her health as well.\n  I just indicate, with all due respect, I think the issue here, when \nwe are debating medical procedures on the floor, really gets to the \npoint about whether or not we in the Senate should be debating medical \nprocedures. Earlier, there was a debate about whether a child which was \nborn with a brain outside of its head was in fact to be categorized as \na disabled child. All of these issues we are debating here as non-\nmedical personnel, we don't know the facts or what happened in any \nindividual case. So that would be my concern.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Maybe I wasn't listening as attentively as I should \nhave been. Maybe I heard it incorrectly. I am happy to review what the \nSenator read. I apologize if I got that wrong.\n  In either case, I wanted to clarify we are not talking about cases \nwhere there are not abortions being performed.\n  With respect to the statement that we should not be making these \ndecisions, with all due respect, we make decisions here about \neverything under the sun--things that 50 years ago who would have \nthought we would be debating. To suggest we don't have the technical \nexpertise to determine what is a brutal, gory, horrendous procedure and \nban it--we make illegal in this country lots of things we find to be \nmorally objectionable and offensive. I think we have every right--in \nfact, we have a duty to speak on this. To suggest we in the Congress \ndon't have the right to make these decisions, that we have to give it \nup to the courts--unelected people, just give it up to them; I don't \nneed to be ruled by a bunch of judges.\n  People elected me and the Senator from Michigan and everybody else in \nthis Chamber to go forward and to make decisions about issues of \nimportance to the people of our States. That is what we are going to \ndo.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Will my colleague yield one more moment?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I will be happy to yield.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I interject, we are not asking that this right be given \nup to the courts; we are asking that these decisions be left up to a \nwoman, her family, and her faith.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I appreciate the Senator's comments, but in all due \nrespect, she is leaving it up to the courts because the courts have \nmade this decision and the courts have dictated the law of the land. \nThey have proscribed in elected representatives the right to have any \nimpact on that. We had that debate just a few minutes ago with Senator \nHarkin and his amendment.\n  The courts have completely trumped the legislature. They have decided \nto take an entire body of law away from us and the State legislatures. \nI believe the Senator was in the State legislature at one point. That \nis my recollection. They have taken it away from the State \nlegislatures, taken it away from the Congress, taken it away from \npeople in our democracy, in our Republic, and decided to hold it up \nacross the street where nine, at the time men, decided to take the law \ninto their own hands by creating a right that did not exist. It just \ndid not exist. I do not know how you say this. All through time, all \nthrough the history of this country, this right was there and we did \nnot find it. All of a sudden, we found this right in the middle of the \nConstitution in this liberty clause.\n  As I said before, they took the liberty clause of the Constitution, \nand within that clause they found this new right, this new right that \ntook liberty and put it ahead of life, even though our Founders put \nlife ahead of liberty because that is what our Creator did. We are \nendowed by our Creator with life, liberty, and the pursuit of \nhappiness. Not liberty, life. You have to have life to enjoy liberty. \nWhat the Supreme Court did was put some person's liberty ahead of \nanother person's life. That is fundamentally wrong, I do not care what \nyour feeling is on abortion. It is wrong, and I suggest the Senator \nfrom Michigan and both Senators from California would agree with me \nthat when the Supreme Court did that in the Dred Scott case, when they \nput the liberty of the slaveholder ahead of the life of the slave, the \nSenator from Michigan I am sure today would stand up and say: That is \nwrong; you cannot put someone's liberty rights ahead of someone's life \nrights.\n  What argument do you make in the case of abortion? Because that is it \nexactly. Remember, the liberty clause of the Constitution is the \ngenesis of a right to an abortion. The liberty clause is the genesis of \nthe right to an abortion, and it trumps the life of this other human \nbeing. That is the fact.\n  You can argue that it is a different case--people have--that somehow \nthis child inside the womb is not a human being. But it is. It is \ngenetically human. It is alive. It is a living human being. You can say \nin this case it is a special case. That is what they said in the 1850s, \nright here on this floor. They said it was a special case--a special \ncase because, you know, these black people, they are not like us. These \nlittle children, they are not like us. But that is what they did in the \n1840s and 1850s.\n  They put in the Dred Scott case that the liberty rights of the \nslaveholder trump the life rights of the slave. The slave was property. \nThe child in the womb, under the Supreme Court Roe v. Wade decision, is \nproperty. Look at this case with open eyes. Look at this case and what \nit does, the history that is being repeated in the world today, and you \nwonder why people still march in the streets. It is the same reason--\nthe same reason. It is the same case. It is Dred Scott, and for some \nreason we just choose not to see it.\n\n  What does this amendment do? It affirms Dred Scott. If you like Roe \nv. Wade, vote for this amendment because this is the law right now. \nBasically, the Harkin amendment makes no change. It takes the partial-\nbirth statute, wipes it out, and just says: The law of the land is the \nlaw of the land. OK. We have accomplished nothing here. We have \naccomplished nothing over the last 4 days.\n\n[[Page S3607]]\n\n  If you eliminate the underlying statute, which is the partial-birth \nabortion bill which we believe is constitutional, you wipe it out, all \nyou do is restate the law, and that is what the Feinstein amendment \ndoes. So if you are for the partial-birth abortion bill and vote for \nthis, do not go home and say you are for the partial-birth abortion \nbill because you are not because this amendment excises the underlying \nbill and replaces it with a restatement of Roe v. Wade. That is what \nthis amendment does. Nothing else.\n  I suspect the Senator from California would agree with that. I do not \nthink I am mischaracterizing her amendment whatsoever. It restates Roe \nv. Wade that says you cannot have abortions postviability except to \nprotect the life or health of the mother. That is what Roe v. Wade \nsaid; that is what this amendment says.\n  In practice, of course, health means anything, so there is no \nrestriction at all. In practice, this amendment will mean the same \nthing: There is no restriction at all.\n  With respect to the Durbin amendment--again, I said in all candor to \nhim and I will repeat it on this occasion--at least I believe the \nSenator from Illinois was trying to find some restriction, was trying \nin a rather painful and I would argue ultimately failed way to find \nsome movement, some attempt to reduce or put some stricture on \npostviability abortions. I think he failed in doing so, but I think he \nmade an honest attempt to try. This does not even attempt to try. This \nbasically restates Roe v. Wade.\n  Again, as far as I am concerned, this is the vote on the bill. If you \nvote for this, you basically vote to kill the bill and replace it with \nnothing. What you replace it with, again I would make the argument, is \nthe Dred Scott case. That is what you replace it with. You replace it \nwith putting people's liberty rights above people's life rights.\n  I repeat over and over, there is a reason the Founders put the \nordered rights in the place they did. I will quote again:\n\n       . . . they are endowed by their Creator with certain \n     unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and \n     the pursuit of Happiness.\n\n  I think everyone in this Chamber would agree, you cannot pursue \nhappiness if you are not free, and you cannot enjoy freedom if you are \nnot alive. So, of course, you cannot put freedom ahead of life. You \ncannot put someone's freedom ahead of someone's life. That is not \nright. That is out of order.\n  As I said before, we did it once before in this country and we paid a \nhorrible price, and we have left a horrible legacy that has stained \nthis country. I would argue we are doing the same thing. We are \nrepeating the failures of history. For some reason--as many people did \nin the 1840s and 1850s, good upstanding--in the movie ``Gods and \nGenerals,'' people have objected to the fact all these people were God-\nfearing, southern generals and others; they were portrayed in almost a \ngood, positive frame that these are good people; how can they believe \nthat someone's liberty rights trump someone's life rights? How could \nthey believe, these good, God-fearing people--these are faithful \nProtestants, Catholics, and Jews--how could they believe that? You just \nscratch your head and say they must have been bad people.\n  I do not think they were bad people, and I do not think the people on \nthe other side of this issue are bad people. I think they just got it \nwrong. I think they do not understand the lessons, the wisdom of the \npeople who wrote our founding documents, the wisdom of understanding \nbasic rights and the ordering of those rights to give meaning to those \nrights because if you misorder the rights, they have no meaning. If you \nput happiness before liberty so that your right to happiness trumps my \nright to freedom, well, then, I am your slave. I am the object of your \nhappiness for your own benefit. That is not fair. If you put my \nhappiness in front of your life, well, obviously no one is going to say \nthat is fair. And the same thing, if you put my freedom to do what I \nwant in front of your right to life, most people would say that is not \nfair. But that is the law of the land. That does not say this is not a \ndifficult issue. That does not say there are not cases that could pull \nat your heart strings and that the decisions people have to make are \ntough decisions. They are. But that is why----\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. In a moment. But that is why happiness is at the end. \nBecause you know what, life and liberty are all about tough choices \nsometimes, all about making decisions which are not necessarily easy, \nand happiness results at the end, hopefully. We have to make a lot of \ntough decisions to get to that point. It is of lower priority. There \nare higher, more noble things than the pursuit of happiness. That is \nwhat our Founders understood. These basic rights, as painful, as \ntroubling, and as difficult as they are to preserve, are important \nbecause without them there is no hope of freedom, there is no hope of \nhappiness, there is no hope of prosperity. And so it is the case with \nthe unborn. There is no hope of liberty, there is no hope of happiness, \nbecause we have misordered our priorities and rights in this country.\n  I know that is a tough message, and I know it is not a popular thing \nto hear, but I believe in my soul this is corrupting the body of this \ncountry, as slavery corrupted the body of this country for 200 years, \nand then some. We have an obligation to face history and to face the \nreality of what we are doing, and all we are asking is to end one \nlittle brutal procedure, one little insult to humankind. Three inches \naway from that legal status that would deem this person back in order, \nback in order where their life counts more than somebody else's \nliberty; 3 inches from coming under those founding documents that give \nthem rights. But they might as well be 3 miles, for their life is \nticketed for extermination in such a brutal fashion, in the hands of a \ndoctor who was taught to heal.\n  We have an obligation to end and stop evil, even if it is just a \nlittle thing, even if it is only a few thousand times a year in this \ncountry. It almost boggles my mind to think that 3, 4, 5, 6, whatever \nthousands of these that occur a year is considered to be rare and \ninfrequent. I say to my colleagues, if they are for the underlying \nbill, they cannot vote for the Feinstein amendment because it simply \nterminates this bill and replaces it with nothing, replaces it with \ncurrent law.\n  No one who votes for this can say they are for the partial-birth \nabortion ban, because they are not. They are for eliminating that ban \nand replacing it with current law, a reinstatement of Supreme Court \nlaw, which is nothing as far as doing anything about this brutal \nprocedure.\n  I am happy to yield. Can I yield on the Senator's time if that is \nokay?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. May I ask, first, how much time we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has 10 minutes 36 \nseconds. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 25 minutes 23 seconds.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I will yield on my time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I appreciate that. I have two questions for the Senator. \nIs the Senator aware that 78,000 women a year around the world die of \nillegal abortions? And since he stated that the other figure I put out \nis false, I went back and got the World Health Organization number. Is \nthe Senator aware of this?\n\n  The second question I have is: The Senator, in having a debate with \nSenator Clinton, which I thought was probably one of the more \ninstructive things that has happened this afternoon, talked eloquently \nabout the rights of the disabled, and I wondered why the Senator, in \nthe two last votes that we had, voted against the Individuals with \nDisability Education Act, IDEA funding, which would fund education for \nchildren with disabilities.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. As the Senator knows, I have been one of the strongest \nadvocates for increase in funding for the disabled. I was one of the \npeople who worked on this side of the aisle to try to get a dramatic \nincrease. When I came to the Senate, IDEA was funded at 5 percent. It \nwas promised at 40. One of the things I said on this floor and said \nrepeatedly across my State, it was my objective to get it to where it \nwas promised in 1975, which was 40 percent.\n  One of the concerns I had with the actual reauthorization of the \nlegislation was not that we should not be putting more money in to help \npeople with disabilities through the educational process. I disagreed \nwith some of the substantive changes within the law,\n\n[[Page S3608]]\n\nparticularly when it came to how we----\n  Mrs. BOXER. This is appropriations. These are two votes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. In that case, you are talking about the mandatory \nspending issue, and I do not believe----\n  Mrs. BOXER. No.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. That is my understanding.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I appreciate the Senator has not seen it.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I have not seen it. I know I voted against mandatory \nspending for IDEA, but I voted consistently for increases.\n  Mrs. BOXER. These are two votes for 2 years in a row.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. As the Senator from California knows, since Republicans \ntook control of the Chamber in 1995, IDEA funding has gone up from 5 \npercent to, I believe, about 15 to 20 percent right now through the \ninitiative of many of us who saw this as a real scourge on the Congress \nfor mandating something, saying we would fund it, and then we do not.\n  I do support it. I may not support the level of increases. As the \nSenator knows, when a hefty increase is supported, then somebody comes \nalong and tries to double or triple that and blow a hole in the budget. \nI think my record is clear that I voted for responsible and steady \nincreases to get us up to the 40 percent, and I have made a pledge to \ndo so.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent that the record of these votes be \nprinted in the Record.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I have no objection.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 4577\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO: 3699\n\n       Harkin motion to waive section 302(f) of the Budget Act to \n     permit consideration of the Harkin-Wellstone amendment which \n     provides full funding for the Individuals with Disabilities \n     Education Act (IDEA) by increasing it from $7.35 billion to \n     $15.8 billion.\n       Motion rejected: Yeas--40; nays--55; not voting--5.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I want to counter a couple of other things. The Senator \nfrom New Jersey says I keep referring to the Bergen County Record, and \nhe made a statement that has been proven false. I can say that the \nBergen County Record has never printed a retraction to the story and \nclaims to this day that their investigative reporter was not wrong. So \nthere is an honest disagreement. The paper stands by their story, has \nnot printed a retraction, and has said publicly that they have no \nintention of doing so. So just because Senator Lautenberg found \nsomebody who disagrees with the story does not mean it is not true.\n  I want to go, finally--and then I will be happy to yield back to the \nSenator from California--to what this health exception means.\n  Under Doe v. Bolton, the health exception means--and I am going to \nread the case. ``Health'' was broadly defined.\n\n       Medical judgment may be exercised in light of all factors--\n     physical, emotional, psychological, familial, and the woman's \n     age--relevant to the well-being of the patient. All these \n     factors may relate to health. This allows the attending \n     physician the room he needs to make his best medical \n     judgment.\n\n  So just understand what this amendment does. It strips out the \nlanguage of the partial-birth abortion ban, replaces it with the \nlanguage basically from Doe v. Bolton, which is the current law, which \nis no exceptions. In other words, there are no limitations under \ncurrent law, by the courts, for any abortion at any time. There simply \nare no limits.\n  So that may be where many Members of this Chamber are, and I respect \nthat. I disagree with them, but I respect that. To simply restate the \nlaw and then claim that one is for the partial-birth abortion bill, I \nthink, falls hollow on the Chamber and hopefully we can defeat this \namendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/12/senate-section/article/S3608-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3608-S3614]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT EXECUTIVE CALENDAR NO. 38\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. As in executive session, I ask unanimous consent that \nfollowing the vote in relation to the Feinstein amendment, the Senate \nproceed to executive session, and an immediate vote on the confirmation \nof Calendar No. 38, William Quarles, to be U.S. District Judge for the \nDistrict of Maryland, with no intervening action or debate; further, I \nask that following that vote, the President be immediately notified of \nthe Senate's action, and the Senate then resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I want to make a couple of comments. The first \ncomment is that comparing my amendment with the Dred Scott decision is \nridiculous. Having said that, the distinguished Senator from \nPennsylvania is right about one thing. In a sense, this is a \ncodification of Roe.\n  I have sat on the Judiciary Committee. I ask my colleagues the \nquestion: What do you think of Roe v. Wade? Overwhelmingly, most would \nsay it is well-settled law. The States have adapted to it, and Roe v. \nWade allows States to restrict abortion severely, if the fetus is \nviable, that is, can be sustained outside of the uterus. And over 40 \nStates have banned or severely restricted postviability abortions.\n\n  S. 3 is duplicitous because it says it does one thing but does \nanother. It says that it bans partial-birth abortion, but it does not \nadequately define it, and so bans much more than this method. Moreover, \nthe bill does not define D in a medical context.\n  Respectfully, Senator Santorum is not a physician, and, respectfully, \nhe is not going to be carrying out a surgical procedure. But there are \nhundreds of thousands of physicians out there who are carrying out this \nmedical procedure. And Senator Santorum wants to leave them with an \nunclear definition in this bill. And the precise, medically accurate \ndefinition I read into the Record, the definition of D as proposed by \nthe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, is not the \ndefinition in the bill.\n  What I have done is tried to write a simple, straightforward bill \nthat essentially sustains Roe v. Wade. So those who believe in Roe v. \nWade should vote for my amendment. It says that any abortion is illegal \nonce the fetus is viable, once the doctor determines that the fetus can \nsustain itself outside of the womb, unless the life and the health of \nthe woman are in jeopardy. That is Roe v. Wade. The amendment is also \nconsistent with a whole host of federal court decisions which I read \nand in the Supreme Court's decision in Stenberg v. Carhart where \nJustice Breyer, Justice O'Connor, and three other justices very clearly \nsaid that a Nebraska statute very similar to S. 3 falls because there \nis no exception for the health of the woman.\n  The Senator has talked about the liberty clause. And Roe v. Wade, \nyes, did come from the liberty clause of the due process clause of the \n14th amendment and other parts of the Constitution. Roe helped \nestablish a basic right of privacy for women.\n  I get so annoyed when men constantly strive to take away hard-won \nrights from women. Respectfully, I don't want Senator Santorum taking \naway my reproductive rights. I respect his views. I respect his rights. \nI respect his moral code, his religion, his conversations with his \nphysician. Why can't those who happen to be pro-choice receive the same \nrespect, particularly when a fetus is not viable, when a fetus cannot \nsustain life outside the womb? That is what this is all about.\n  Make no mistake, if you believe in choice, you will support my \namendment. If you do not, you will support S. 3. That is the clear \ndivision of the house on this. If there were a clear medically accurate \ndefinition in S. 3, I would not be saying what I am saying. I would \nsay: Members, you are voting on a particular medical procedure; you are \nprohibiting a particular medical procedure. But if you are voting for \nS. 3, you are voting to prohibit much more than just the medical \nprocedure that has been put on this floor. You are also prohibiting D \nabortions as well. That has been the finding not of me but of \nobstetricians and gynecologists, some of them from the finest medical \nschools in our country, and numerous federal courts, including the \nSupreme Court.\n  S. 3's infringement on women's right to choose reminds me of another \nwoman's right. It was not until 1920 that we got the vote. And when \nthis Nation was founded and we go back to our days of--for some--glory, \nwomen could not\n\n[[Page S3609]]\n\nget a higher education, women could not own property, women could not \ninherit. Every single right we have won has been fought for. And the \nright to choose has been fought for as well.\n  There are probably few people in this body who have seen a young \nwoman ready to commit suicide from an unwanted pregnancy. I have. I \nwent to college when abortion was illegal in the United States. I saw \nwhat happened. I saw the back-alley abortionist set up and do business. \nAnd then later I set sentences for women who had been convicted of \nfelonies for having illegal abortions. I did that for 6 years. And I \nsaw the tragedy they caused. We cannot go back to those days.\n  This is a step--let there be no doubt about it--back to those days. \nWe have before us an imprecise piece of legislation, not just banning \nD but covering many more abortion methods than the S.3's supporters \nhave said they aim to cover. A vote for my amendment will be a vote \nwith the 80 percent of the population who believe in a women's right to \nchoose to protect their health because my amendment is, Senator \nSantorum is correct, in essence a codification of Roe v. Wade.\n  I am hopeful that those who voted for the Harkin Roe v. Wade \namendment will also vote yes on this amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from California \nin her direct response to the issue of what this amendment does. She \nsaid this codifies Roe v. Wade, but Members have had a chance to voice \ntheir opinion on Roe v. Wade. We just had an amendment on that. It is \nclear where our Members were.\n  That is not the issue before the Senate. The issue is not, Do we need \nanother vote on Roe v. Wade. We already had one. The question is, Do we \nwant a ban on partial-birth abortion? If you want a ban on partial-\nbirth abortion, you do not get rid of the ban and replace it with \nnothing. I suggest you cannot vote for the bill on final passage and \nvote for this because you have just voted to kill the bill and replace \nit with nothing.\n  I think the Senator from California would agree with that. She says \nall we are doing is restating current law. So it does not accomplish \nanything.\n  At least the Durbin amendment, arguably, you could make the claim--I \ndon't agree, but you could make the claim that this is accomplishing \nsomething. The Senator from Illinois made the claim, and you could \nstand up with the legislative crafting he did and at least make a claim \nto that. The Senator from California is not attempting to make a claim \nto that.\n  I encourage those who support the ban to vote against something that \nstrips the ban and replaces it with nothing.\n  The Senator from California said that 80 percent of the public \nsupports this right. That is not the case. There is simply poll after \npoll after poll after poll that shows if you understand what Roe v. \nWade does--which is abortion any time, for any reason during \npregnancy--probably less than 20 percent, in every poll I have seen, \ncertainly less than 25 percent, support that.\n  In most polls I have seen, less than 20 percent support an absolute \nright to abortion. But that is Roe v. Wade.\n  I make the argument that 80 percent oppose Roe v. Wade. There may be \na larger percentage. Certainly there is a larger percentage than 20 \npercent who support some limited right to abortion. But they do not \nsupport Roe v. Wade because Roe v. Wade is an absolute right to an \nabortion at any time during pregnancy. I wanted to make that clear.\n  If this bill passes, it will go to conference. We will report it back \nhere and hopefully pass it and send it on to the President.\n  You are right. Several have said we are going to bring it to court. \nOf course it will go to court. The Supreme Court will have a chance to \nlook at this, to see whether we have jumped through the hoops the \nSupreme Court made us jump through.\n  With respect to the amendment of the Senator again, going back to her \namendment, I would posit a question. I don't know if anybody has the \nanswer to it. I don't know if there are any statistics. How many human \npostviability abortions are stopped by Roe v. Wade today?\n  I believe Roe is an absolute right. I would have some Members who \ndisagree with that, saying there are restrictions. If that is the case, \nI would certainly like to know how many abortions are blocked in this \ncountry because of Roe v. Wade. If there are some, I would certainly be \ninterested in hearing. If the answer is none, then I think my statement \nstands, which is this is an absolute right to abortion in this country.\n  With respect to the statement of the Senator from California that I \nam comparing her amendment to the Dred Scott decision, that is not \nnecessarily correct. I said her amendment is a restatement of Roe. And \nRoe is like the Dred Scott decision. I repeat, Roe is like the Dred \nScott decision because Roe v. Wade put liberty rights ahead of life \nrights.\n  As I said, the founding documents stated we are endowed by our \ncreator with certain inalienable liberties. We have ordered liberties--\nrights: Life, liberty, pursuit of happiness. Not liberty, life, pursuit \nof happiness. You must have liberty to enjoy life. You must have true \nliberty to enjoy happiness. They put them in order for a reason.\n  What Roe v. Wade does is take the liberty rights of an individual and \nputs them ahead of the life rights of another individual. That is \nexactly what happened in Dred Scott. They took the liberty rights of \nthe slaveholder and put them ahead of the life rights of the slave.\n  So, as I said, I am not condemning her amendment or trying to say \nanything derogatory about what she put on paper. I am not saying that \nat all. I guess I am saying something derogatory about the decision of \nRoe v. Wade because I think it gets it wrong. The Supreme Court got it \nwrong.\n  The Senator from California said nominees coming before the Congress \nsay Roe v. Wade is settled law. I suspect nominees in the 1850s and \n1860, early 1860s, who came before the Senate said the Dred Scott case \nwas settled law. That doesn't mean it was right. That does not mean it \nis constitutional, the way we look at liberty and the way we look at \nlife, and the way we look at the order of those rights.\n  I just suggest these are important issues. But I underscore this. If \nyou vote for this amendment, you vote to strip the bill and replace it \nwith nothing. I think the Senator from California would agree with \nthat. It is simply a restatement of law. That doesn't get you to a ban \non this procedure and the eventual court challenge that we know is \nahead of us on this issue.\n\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I would like to respond in this way, if I may. The \ndistinguished Senator said that if you vote for my amendment, you don't \nspecifically ban D That is true. You ban all postviability \nabortions, including all use of D postviability.\n  Let me also reiterate that S. 3 does not specifically ban D either. \nIn fact, D procedure isn't defined in Senator Santorum's bill. The \nmost knowledgeable people in the country have looked at S. 3, the \nnation's leading obstetricians and gynecologists, and what they tell me \nis that S. 3 will affect much more than D because S. 3's definition \nis incomplete and flawed. It is not me saying this, it is the American \nCollege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. I have entered their letter \ninto the Record.\n  The Senator could have used that definition in the bill, and then we \nwould know what we were voting on. But he did not. I believe that, from \nthe beginning, it has been intentional not to include a specific \nmedically accurate definition in the bill. The bill is a Trojan horse. \nIt could impact D abortions, the most common abortion method used, \nbut the Senator refuses to admit it. The bill violates Roe and other \nSupreme Court opinions because it doesn't protect the health of the \nwoman.\n  So what Senator Stabenow, Senator Edwards, and I have done in this \namendment is say that any abortion after the point of a fetus' \nviability, as determined by the physician, is illegal--except to \nprotect the health or life of the woman.\n  My amendment follows the Constitution. It is constitutional.\n  We just had 52 votes supporting Roe v. Wade. If those 52 votes are \nreal, then\n\n[[Page S3610]]\n\nthe same senators will vote for my amendment because both Senator \nSantorum and I agree that this codifies Roe v. Wade.\n  I have listened to the debate over D as a member of the Judiciary \nCommittee now in three Congresses. In every Congress I have asked: Why \ndon't you put in the medical definition? And in every Congress the \nother side refuses to put in the medical definition. It makes you \nsuspicious. Why wouldn't their bill use the generally accepted medical \ndefinition, unless it truly is a Trojan horse? Unless they are truly \ntrying to mask what they are trying to do, which is to strike at the \nheart of a woman's right to choose.\n  I think I will now close off this debate. I urge those who voted on \nthe Harkin amendment to please sustain that vote, to vote consistently, \nand to vote for the Feinstein-Stabenow-Edwards amendment.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, having now gone through the process of \ntrying to pass a piece of legislation that was found unconstitutional \nby the Court, let me be very clear, it is not my intention to try to \npass another piece of legislation that is going to be unconstitutional. \nIf the Senator is suggesting that my motive here is to pass a piece of \nlegislation and pull one over on the Court, let me make very clear I \nhave no intention of trying to pull one over on anybody. This Court is \nnot a friendly Court on this issue.\n\n  I realize I have, and the people who have worked on the drafting of \nthis legislation have, a heavy burden to carry. So I am not being cute. \nI am not being deceptive. I am simply trying, to the best of my \nability, to adequately and sufficiently describe a procedure to include \nthat procedure and exclude all others. Because that is what the Court \nasked us to do--to define this procedure so specifically as to exclude \nothers.\n  The Court went through great detail, talking about other procedures \nwhere a child could still be alive and portions of that child could be \noutside the mother. They could be doing another form of abortion and an \narm or a leg or some portion of the body could go outside of the mother \nin the process of killing the child in the womb. So they said the \noriginal definition was not clear enough. So we came back and made it \ncrystal clear. We said the person performing the abortion:\n\n       . . . deliberately and intentionally vaginally delivers a \n     living fetus, in the case of head-first presentation the \n     entire fetal head is outside the body of the mother.\n\n  You do not do any other procedures where you present the head. You \ndon't do it. I don't think any doctor in the land would say you do any \nof these other abortions where you present the head. It is just not \ndone.\n  Second:\n\n       . . . or in the case of breech presentation, any part of \n     the fetal trunk past the navel.\n\n  So it is not a hand or a foot or an arm. It is the legs, the feet, \nthe buttocks, and the lower part of the abdomen is outside of the \nmother, and in most cases the arms--the hands and arms.\n  That is a pretty clear definition of this procedure and cannot be--\nfrom all of the descriptions we have received in testimony--confused \nwith any other procedure.\n  The AMA board of trustees said:\n\n       The procedure is ethically different from other destructive \n     abortion techniques because the fetus, normally 20 weeks or \n     longer in gestation, is killed outside of the womb.\n\n  These other procedures are done inside the womb. That doesn't mean \nmaybe a portion of the baby may be outside. But it is killed by the \ndoctor inside the womb.\n\n       The ``partial-birth'' gives the fetus an autonomy which \n     separates it from the right of the woman to choose treatments \n     for her own baby.\n\n  This is the American Medical Association. They recognize that this is \ndifferent. Courts say they may recognize it is different, but you \nhaven't adequately defined it. Now we have adequately defined it. We \nhave said the entire baby, basically, except for the head is outside of \nthe mother. That is a pretty clear definition.\n  This idea that it is somehow vague and we have not addressed that \nissue I reject. We have addressed that issue. We have gone through the \nhealth exceptions, the Senator from California did. And I will not \nargue against myself. I think we have been successful in stating that \nwe have rebutted the health exception by the stipulations that we have \nmade in the bill.\n  Let me remind Members this is a vote to excise the underlying bill, \neliminate it, substitute for it, strike it, and insert existing law--\nnothing, no change. This bill would have the effect of being on the \nfloor of the Senate and have no meaning whatsoever. It simply is a \nrestatement of Roe v. Wade. If you are for eliminating this procedure, \nyou cannot vote for this amendment. It doesn't even try to do anything \nelse. At least the Durbin amendment was a substitute. You eliminated \nthe partial-birth. You could make the argument that we were eliminating \nall postviability abortions.\n  The Senator from California says this wouldn't change the law one \nbit--not one bit. All you are doing is killing the underlying bill and \nreplacing it with nothing. That means you are voting against the bill.\n  I hope a good, strong majority of Members will vote for this bill and \nnot simply strip this bill and replace it with nothing because that \nwould be a pretty clear sign they are not in favor of the bill.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, earlier this evening I pointed out \nthat the junior Senator from Pennsylvania continues to refer to a \nSeptember 15, 1996 article in the Bergen Record that contained \nincorrect information about the number and type of abortions performed \nat Metropolitan Medical Associates, MMA. After I spoke on the floor he \noffered the following rebuttal, which I am paraphrasing because a \nformal transcript isn't available yet:\n\n       I want to counter a couple of things to the Senator from--\n     the Senator from New Jersey says I keep referring to the \n     Bergen Record I can just say that the Bergen Record never did \n     print a retraction to the story and claims that their \n     investigative reporter was not wrong. There is an honest \n     disagreement. The paper stands by their story and has not \n     printed a retraction and said publicly that they have no \n     intention of doing so. So just because Senator Lautenberg \n     found somebody who disagrees with the story doesn't mean it \n     isn't true.\n\n  It so happens that the ``somebody'' who ``disagreed'' with the above \nmentioned Bergen Record article was the management of Metropolitan \nMedical Associates.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the letter be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       Dear Mr. Ritt, We, the physicians and administration of \n     Metropolitan Medical Associates, are deeply concerned about \n     the many inaccuracies in the article printed in September 15, \n     1996 titled ``The Facts on Partial-Birth Abortions''.\n       The article incorrectly asserts that MMA ``performs 3,000 \n     abortions a year on fetuses between 20 and 24 weeks, of which \n     at least half are by intact dilation and evacuation.'' This \n     claim is false as is shown in reports to the New Jersey \n     Department of Health and documents submitted semiannually to \n     the New Jersey State Board of Medical Examiners. These \n     statistics show that the total annual number of abortions for \n     the period between 12 and 23.3 weeks is about 4,000, with the \n     majority of these procedures being between 12 and 16 weeks. \n     The intact D procedure (erroneously labeled by abortion \n     opponents as ``partial birth abortion'') is used only in a \n     small percentage of cases between 20 and 23.3 weeks, when a \n     physician determines that it is the safest method available \n     for the woman involved. Certainly, the number of intact D \n     procedures performed is nowhere near the 1,500 estimated in \n     your article. MMA perform no third trimester abortions, where \n     the State is permitted to ban abortions except in cases of \n     life and health endangerment.\n       Second, the article erroneously states that most women \n     undergoing intact D procedures have no medical reason for \n     termination. The article then misquotes a physician from our \n     clinic stating that ``most are Medicaid patients . . . and \n     most are for elective, not medical, reasons . . . Most are \n     teenagers.'' This is a misrepresentation of the information \n     provided to the reporter. Consistent with Roe v. Wade and New \n     Jersey State law, we do not record a woman's specific reason \n     for having an abortion. However, all procedures for our \n     Medicaid patients are certified as medically necessary as \n     required by the New Jersey Department of Human Services.\n       Because of the sensitive and controversial nature of the \n     abortion issue, we feel that it is critically important to \n     set the record straight.\n                                                 The Management of\n                                  Metropolitan Medical Associates.\n\n[[Page S3611]]\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my concerns with \nS. 3, the ``so-called'' Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003.\n  Shortly before my election to Congress, the Supreme Court made its \nlandmark decision in Roe v. Wade to constitutionally protect a woman's \nright to choose. During my time in Congress, there has been no other \nissue that has engendered more passion or debate than this decision.\n  While I ardently support a woman's right to choose, I have spent my \ntime in Congress trying to ensure that abortions are as rare as \npossible. We can reduce the number of abortions through strong support \nof Title X, encouraging adoption, educating on the use of emergency \ncontraceptives, and requiring insurance policies to cover \ncontraceptives. In that manner we can ensure that women control their \nown reproductive destiny.\n  The ``so-called'' Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act is one of many \nattempts to overtly or covertly undermine and overturn the \nconstitutional right afforded women in Roe v. Wade. It is imperative \nthat Congress not be the entity making a woman's decision on this most \npersonal of issues. This is a decision to be made by a woman in \nconsultation with her doctor and others she chooses to include. The \nbill we consider today will place the Federal Government in the middle \nof the most intimate of discussions between a woman and her physician.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to discuss with my colleagues \nthe constitutional deficiencies contained in this legislation. Let me \nstart with the title of this legislation, the Partial-Birth Abortion \nBan Act.\n  Ask any doctor if they have ever performed a partial-birth abortion \nand the response is no such medical term exists. So what are we \nbanning? For that answer we turn to the definition of a partial birth-\nabortion contained in the bill. What we find is a very broad--overly \nbroad--definition that is strikingly similar to the over broad \ndefinition found unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court in \nthe Carhart decision.\n  You will hear my colleagues say this definition is limited to late \nterm abortions, or abortions performed during the third trimester or \npostviability. However, if you examine the definition contained in this \nlegislation, its breadth would cover safe abortion procedures that are \nused in the second trimester or previability of the fetus. Why have my \ncolleagues chosen to use a definition that is over broad?\n  Enactment of this legislation, if upheld, would erode the Roe \ndecision by banning an abortion procedure that is used previability of \nthe fetus. Thus, this legislation can be clearly seen as an attempt to \nundermine the legal underpinnings of the Roe decision.\n  Another critical constitutional deficiency in this legislation is the \nabsence of a health exception for the mother. The original Roe \ndecision, and most recently the Supreme Court Carhart decision, \nrequired that any ban on an abortion procedure have an exception for \nthe health of the mother. The proponents of this legislation will point \nto the pages of findings contained in the legislation as to why it is \nunnecessary to have an exception for the health of the mother. There \nare two problems with this rationale, first the Supreme Court has shown \nan unwillingness to consider Congressional findings of fact in recent \ndecisions, such as Morrison, VAWA, and Kimmel, ADEA. Second, during the \ndebate on the Carhart decision, the Supreme Court had knowledge of \nthese findings, yet still ruled that because the Nebraska statute did \nnot have an explicit health exception the law was unconstitutional.\n  So why do my colleagues seek to move this legislation forward even \nwith these glaring constitutional deficiencies? I can reach no other \nconclusion, based on the facts, than it is an attempt to erode the \nconstitutional protections provided to women in the Roe decision. Mark \nmy words, this legislation is one step in the process of attempting to \noverturn the Roe decision, and I will fight that outcome every step of \nthe way.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will oppose S. 3, the Partial Birth \nAbortion Ban Act, and instead will support a constitutionally sound \nalternative.\n  Mr. President, I understand that people on all sides of this issue \nhold sincere and strongly held views. I respect the deeply held views \nof those who oppose abortion under any circumstances. Like most \nAmericans, I would prefer to live in a world where abortion is \nunnecessary. I support efforts to reduce the number of abortions \nthrough family planning and counseling to avoid unintended pregnancies.\n  I have always believed that the decisions in this area are best \nhandled by the individuals involved, in consultation with their doctors \nand guided by their own beliefs and unique circumstances, rather than \nby government mandates. I support Roe v. Wade, which means that I agree \nthat government can restrict abortions when there is a compelling State \ninterest at stake. I have previously voted to ban postviability \nabortions unless the woman's life is at risk or the procedure is \nnecessary to protect the woman from grievous injury to her physical \nhealth, which is why I will again be voting for the Durbin alternative \nto S. 3.\n  Since the Senate last debated this issue in 1999, the Supreme Court \nhas ruled on a statute that is almost identical to the language of the \nbill before us today. In June 2000, in Stenberg v. Carhart, the Court \nheld that the State law, a Nebraska statute, banning so-called partial \nbirth abortions was unconstitutional. The Court found that the law was \nso vague and overbroad that it posed an undue burden on a woman's right \nto choose by encompassing safe and common abortion procedures used \nprior to viability. The Court also found that, even in banning abortion \nprocedures after viability, the State must include an exception for the \nhealth of the mother.\n  The Senate now has the Supreme Court's guidance, as we consider \nlegislation regulating late-term abortions. This is guidance that the \nSenate did not have when we previously debated legislation like S. 3. I \nfeel very strongly that Congress should seek to regulate abortions only \nwithin the constitutional parameters set forth by the\n\n[[Page S3612]]\n\nU.S. Supreme Court. Yet in light of the Supreme Court's 2000 decision, \nthe bill before us today, S. 3, is unconstitutional on its face. It is \nso vague and overbroad that it, too, could unduly burden a woman's \nright to choose prior to viability.\n  I might add that I would have preferred that S. 3 had been first \nreviewed by the Judiciary Committee on which I serve, rather than \nhaving been brought straight to the Senate floor. The Judiciary \nCommittee should hold hearings and review the bill prior to its \nconsideration by the full Senate. This is especially important because \nthe Supreme Court has now struck down a law that is almost identical to \nthe bill before us today. There have been no hearings in the Senate \nJudiciary Committee to consider this bill since the Court's Carhart \ndecision. Perhaps, if the Judiciary Committee had more thoroughly \nreviewed this legislation, it would have reported a bill that could \nhave withstood constitutional scrutiny.\n  The Durbin alternative amendment would ban abortions by any method \nafter a fetus is viable, except when serious medical situations dictate \notherwise. I support the Durbin amendment because it recognizes that, \nin some circumstances, women suffer from severely debilitating diseases \nspecifically caused or exacerbated by a pregnancy, or are unable to \nobtain necessary treatment for a life-threatening condition while \ncarrying a pregnancy to term. The exceptions in the Durbin amendment \nare limited to conditions for which termination of the pregnancy is \nmedically indicated. It correctly retains the option of abortion for \nmothers facing extraordinary medical conditions--such as breast cancer, \npreeclampsia, uterine rupture, or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma--for which \ntermination of the pregnancy may be recommended by the woman's \nphysician due to the risk of grievous injury to the mother's physical \nhealth or life. By clearly limiting the medical circumstances where \npostviability abortions are permitted, the Durbin amendment protects \nfetal life in cases where the mother's health is not at such high risk. \nIn contrast, S. 3 provides no exception at all to protect the health of \nthe mother.\n  I understand that the Carhart decision did not define the health \nexception or limit it to grievous physical injury. I recognize that it \nis not clear whether the narrow health exception contained in the \nDurbin amendment would be upheld, if it comes before the Court. To \ndate, I have supported this narrow definition of the exception \nnecessary to protect the physical health of the woman because I believe \nthat it strikes the right balance between preserving a woman's right to \nchoose and concerns that abortion procedures late in pregnancy should \nonly be used in rare circumstances. I voted for the Daschle amendment \nin the 105th Congress and the Durbin amendment in the 106th Congress \nand again in this Congress, because they reflect this position.\n  The Durbin amendment properly seeks to ensure that the exceptions to \nthe ban on postviability abortions are properly exercised. It requires \na second doctor to certify the medical need for a postviability \nabortion. The second doctor requirement will ensure that postviability \nabortions take place only when continuing the pregnancy would prevent \nthe woman from receiving treatment for a life-threatening condition \nrelated to her physical health or would cause a severely debilitating \ndisease or impairment to her physical health.\n  The Durbin alternative strikes the right balance between protecting \nwomen's constitutional right to choose and the right of the state to \nprotect future life after viability. It protects a woman's physical \nhealth throughout her pregnancy, while insisting that only grievous, \nmedically diagnosable conditions justify aborting a viable fetus. Both \nfetal viability and women's health would have been determined by the \nphysician's best medical judgement, as they must be, in concurrence \nwith another physician.\n  I hope that, as the Senate considers this bill and the proposed \namendments, we do so in full recognition of the strong feelings about \nthis issue on all sides. We should respect these differences and strive \nto legislate in this area in a way that is constitutionally sound. That \nis why I will oppose S. 3 and instead will support the Durbin \nsubstitute amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Republican leadership is wrong to ask \nthe Senate to support legislation that has been ruled unconstitutional \nby numerous courts. Since the last debate in the Senate in 1999, the \nSupreme Court found a very similar law enacted by the State of Nebraska \nto be unconstitutional. This bill is unconstitutional as well.\n  The Republican leadership has chosen to make as its top priority a \nflatly unconstitutional piece of legislation at a time when so many \nfamilies across the country are facing economic hardship, when \ncommunities are struggling to deal with homeland security needs, and \nbeing forced by state budget crises to cut back on education and health \ncare.\n  Because of the Republican leadership's decision to act on this bill, \nwe will do nothing this week to provide an economic stimulus plan for \nthe Nation's families and workers. We will do nothing to provide new \nfunding for communities struggling to protect themselves from new \nterrorist attacks. We will do nothing to help the millions of uninsured \nchildren in this country get the health care they need. We will do \nnothing for schools struggling to meet higher standards under the No \nChild Left Behind Act. We will do nothing to help college students \nstruggling to pay tuition and relieve their debt. We will do nothing to \nhelp the millions of families across the Nation who are worried about \ntheir economic future.\n  Let us be clear as to what this bill does not do.\n  This bill does not stop one single abortion. The proponents of this \nbill distort the law and the position of our side with inflammatory \nrhetoric, while advocating a bill that will not stop one single \nabortion. This bill purports to prohibit a medical procedure that is \nonly used in rare and dire circumstances. It is not used on healthy \nmothers carrying healthy babies. And if this bill is passed, a doctor \ncould be forced to perform another, more dangerous procedure if it \nbecomes necessary to terminate a pregnancy to protect the life and \nhealth of a woman.\n  This bill does not protect the health of the mother. Nowhere is there \nlanguage that would allow a doctor to take the health of the mother \ninto consideration, even if she were to suffer brain damage or \notherwise be permanently impaired if the pregnancy continued.\n  And this bill is not needed to protect the life of babies who could \nlive outside the mother's womb because those babies are already \nprotected under the law of the land. In Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court \nspecifically held that unless there was a threat to the life or health \nof a woman, she did not have a constitutional right to terminate a \npregancy after viability.\n  So what is this legislation all about? It is about politics and \ninflammatory language and hot-button topics. But it is not about \nstopping abortion.\n  Because of the sound and fury and high emotion that surrounds this \nissue, I would like to make my personal views clear. I am pro-choice. \nBut I believe that abortions should be rare. I believe that we have an \nobligation to create an economy and the necessary support systems to \nmake it easier for women to choose to bring children into the world. If \nthe proponents of this legislation were serious about limiting the \nnumber of abortions in this country, then we would be debating access \nto health care, quality education, the minimum wage, and the other \nissues of economic security that are so important to parents bringing \nup children. But those issues are not on the Republican leadership's \nagenda.\n  Instead, for rank political reasons, we are here this week debating \nso-called partial birth abortion. I do not believe that it is the role \nof the United States Senate to interfere with or regulate the kind of \nmedical advice that a doctor can give to a patient. And that doctor/\npatient relationship and the protection of the health of the mother is \nreally what is in jeopardy with this legislation.\n  From the time of the 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade through the \nStenberg v. Carhert decision in 2000, the Supreme Court of the United \nStates has made clear that the Constitution allows states to restrict \npost-viability abortions as long as there are protections for the life \nand health of the mother.\n\n[[Page S3613]]\n\n  Indeed, 41 states already ban post-viability abortions, regardless of \nthe procedure used. My own State of Massachusetts prohibits these \nabortions except when the woman's life is in danger or the continuation \nof the pregnancy would impose a substantial risk of grave impairment of \nthe woman's health. I would vote for a post-viability ban that protects \nwomen's life and health today.\n  The role of the United States Senate is to protect and defend the \nConstitution of the United States. Each of us in this body has taken \nthat oath of office. And that oath of office and the Constitution \nrequire me to oppose this legislation.\n  This bill unconstitutionally seeks to restrict abortions in cases \nbefore viability and it does not provide an exception to protect the \nmother's health after viability. It also impermissibly attempts to \ninterfere with the doctor/patient relationship. For all of these \nreasons, I oppose this bill.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment \noffered by Senator Murray, which would ensure that women have access to \npreventive health services--services like contraceptive coverage, and \nemergency contraception--to try to reduce the overall need for abortion \nby reducing the number of unintended pregnancies in this country. \nFurthermore, I support this amendment because just as critical to \nensuring that women have the right to plan their families in ensuring \nthat uninsured pregnant women have access to the care they need to have \nhealthy pregnancies and pre-natal care.\n  The composition of this amendment provides women with the ability to \nhave healthy families--which is what family planning is all about. Key \nto this effort is access to prescription contraceptives--including the \nmost commonly used contraception by far, oral contraceptives. Access to \nthese prescriptions are guaranteed under this amendment which includes \nlegislation I have authored each year since 1997, the Equity in \nPrescription Insurance and Contraceptive Coverage Act.\n  I have led the fight for equitable coverage of contraceptives after \nhaving found out that in 1994, according to an Alan Guttmacher \nInstitute, AGI, report, 49 percent of all large-group health plans and \n49 percent of preferred provide organizations, PPOs, did not routinely \ncover all five methods of reversible contraceptives. That report led me \nto introducing EPICC for the first time in 1997. And while the \nstatistics have improved there is more work to be done. According to a \n2001 Kaiser Family Foundation report, while 98 percent of employers \noffer prescription drug coverage in general, still only 64 percent \noffer coverage of oral contraceptives. Again, this category is the most \npopular of all prescription contraceptives.\n  It's been 6 long years now since I first introduced EPICC, and \naccording to an AGI report, in each of those 6 years women have spent \nover $350 per year on prescription oral contraceptives--for a total of \nover $2,100. Why? Because many insurance companies that already cover \nother prescription drugs do not cover prescription contraceptives. How \ncan we continue to deny this fundamental coverage for prescription \ndrugs that are a key component in women's reproductive health?\n  And that's no exaggeration, either. Take for example the known health \nbenefits of oral contraceptives, which have been in use for over 40 \nyears now. First, the pill has been demonstrated to lower the risk of \npelvic inflammatory disease, and has been linked to reducing the risk \nof ovarion, endometrial and uterine cancers. And, the estrogen in the \npill facilitates maintaining bone-density--a key component in the \neffort to fight osteoporosis and the debilitating and often life \nthreatening results of bone fractures which are all too often faced by \nolder women.\n  But if that's not enough, just consider the importance and impact of \nprescription contraceptives in context with what we're debating on the \nSenate floor this week. No matter where you are on the issues . . . no \nmatter what your political stripe--there isn't a U.S. Senator who \nwouldn't want to reduce the number of abortions in America. I would \nguarantee that.\n  Knowing that approximately 50 percent of all pregnancies in the U.S. \neach year are unintended--the highest of all industrial nations--\nshouldn't that be a compelling reason to support this amendment, no \nmatter which side of the abortion debate you're on? Indeed, I along \nwith Senator Reid--who has long been a Democrat lead on my \nlegislation--have long believed the EPICC not only makes sense in terms \nof the cost of contraceptives for women, but also as a means of \nbridging, at least in some small way, the pro-choice pro-life chasm by \nhelping prevent unintended pregnancies and thereby also prevent \nabortions.\n  Because, according to the Institute of Medicine Committee on \nUnintended Pregnancy, one of the reasons for the high rates of \nunintended pregnancies in the U.S. has been the failure of private \nhealth insurance to cover contraceptives--and half of these pregnancies \nend in abortion. Indeed, we know that there are 3 million unintended \npregnancies every year in the United States. We also know that almost \nhalf of those pregnancies result from just the three million women who \ndo not use contraceptives--while 39 million contraceptive users account \nfor the other 53 percent of unintended pregnancies--most of which \nresulted from inconsistent or incorrect use.\n  In other words, when used properly, contraceptives work. They prevent \nunintended pregnancies--we know that. Yet, there are opponents of my \nlegislation, regardless of what we know about what access to \ncontraceptives does for both the health of women and their children by \nhaving pregnancies better planned, and better spaced. Why? Well, it \ncertainly shouldn't be cost.\n  After all, a January 2001, OPM statement on EPICC-like coverage of \nfederal employees under the FEHBP found no effect on premiums \nwhatsoever since implementation in 1998. Let me repeat--no effect. In \nfact, some--like the Alan Guttmacher Institute--argue that improved \naccess to and use of contraception nationwide would save insurers and \nsociety money by preventing unintended pregnancies, as insurers \ngenerally pay pregnancy-related medical costs--which can range anywhere \nfrom $5,000 to almost $10,000. Improved access to contraception would \neliminate these costs and would reduce the costs to both employers and \ninsurers.\n  In 1999, the New York Business Group on Health released estimates \ncalculated by Pharmacia and Upjohn Pharmaceuticals on the cost to \nemployers of providing contraceptive coverage. Taking into account the \ncost of unintended pregnancies, Pharmacia and Upjohn estimated an \noverall savings of $40 per employee when contraception is a covered \nbenefit. An estimate that is supported by a study that estimated that \nnot covering contraceptives in employee health plans would actually \ncost employers 15-17 percent more than providing the coverage due to \nthe other pregnancy related costs.\n  Now, no one is saying that access to prescription contraceptives will \nsolve the most vexing of social problems, but if access helps women \nplan their pregnancies, and includes in this planning assurances that \nthey are in good health and that they will seek prenatal care, and that \nthey have the financially stability to provide for their child--then, \nclearly, contraceptive coverage would significantly help improve the \nlives of millions of mothers and their future children.\n  While the facts demonstrate that this amendment is something that \nevery senator regardless of their position on abortion should support \nit as it will reduce the instance of abortion while improving the \nhealth of women and their future children, I must also say that \nSenator Murray's amendment--her prevention package--even in its \ntotality, is not enough to fix the problems in the underlying bill \noffered by my friend, Senator Santorum, which would ban late term \nabortions without providing for any clear exception to protect the life \nor the physical health of the mother. This is completely contrary to \nthe 22-year-old landmark Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade that \nheld that women have a constitutional right to an abortion, but after \nviability, States could ban abortions--as long as they allowed \nexceptions for cases in which a woman's life or health is endangered.\n\n  And there should be no doubt--the underlying legislation puts women's \nlives and health on the line. If we vote this week to send this \nlegislation to the President without additional changes beyond the \ninclusion of this\n\n[[Page S3614]]\n\namendment--which beyond the guaranteed access to prescription \ncontraceptives provides information about emergency contraceptives for \nwomen and doctors, access to emergency contraceptives for sexual \nassault victims and finally, access to health care for pregnant \nuninsured women--we will bear the burden of putting women's lives and \nhealth at risk by substituting the judgement of politicians for the \njudgement of medical doctors. And that just isn't right.\n  The bottom line is, women should have control over their reproductive \nhealth--whether it be through access to contraceptives, access to \nhealth care when they are pregnant or through preserving the right to \nchoose which should include the right to terminate a pregnancy post-\nviability if a doctor determines that continuance of the pregnancy \nwould result in a grievous injury to the woman's physical health.\n  After all, allowing women to decide what is in their best interests \nserves not only the woman's overall health, but their children's and \ntheir future children's health. This goal will be furthered by the \namendment offered by Senator Murray and other amendments expected to be \noffered later this week by others which will ensure that we are \nfollowing the guidelines laid out for us in the landmark Roe v. Wade \ndecision ensuring that a woman's physical health is paramount in these \ndecisions.\n  In the meantime, I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this \nimportant amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/12/senate-section/article/S3614-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3614]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF WILLIAM D.

Mr. President, if everyone uses all the time, tomorrow will \nbe a long day. We do not know how much time everyone will use, but at \nleast we have completed this very difficult legislation today. We have \na circuit judge the leader has been asking for, and we have two more \ndistrict court judges. So I think we have accomplished quite a bit this \nweek.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator from Nevada. Through this entire \nweek, he has been working with this side in good faith to move forward \nthis legislation. He did an outstanding job, in my opinion, in helping \nus proceed through this process. I want to thank him for the excellent \nwork and for his willingness to move at times this heated and \ncontroversial discussion on the bill to this process where we are now \npoised to pass this legislation tomorrow morning. Hopefully, it will \npass by a very strong vote, and we will get the bill into conference \nand get it back. I think the House will bring this up in a\n\n[[Page S3615]]\n\ncouple of weeks and then possibly even get this bill back to the Senate \nwithin the month. So we are well on our way.\n  I want to thank all Members for their cooperation, for their \nwillingness to offer amendments, and to come to the floor and debate \nit. Obviously, we have had a spirited debate, but one that has not just \nprovided some heat but also hopefully provided a great deal of light as \nto the relative positions of the Senators on either side of this issue, \nand even the broader issue of abortion in general.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic whip.\n  Mr. REID. I have said this a couple of times during the past few \nweeks, and I want to say this again. The leader could have come and \nfiled cloture on this legislation very quickly, but he has obviously \nmade a decision the Senate works best when people are allowed to offer \namendments and speak their piece. There is no better example of that \nthan this controversial legislation. All the amendments offered were on \nour side, and I think it speaks well of the direction that the Senate \nis going. We still have some obstacles we have to get over, but I again \nstate that the pattern set by the majority leader in allowing debate to \ntake place is good for this body, and I think the debate has been \nhealthy. It has been very adversarial. That is what the Senate is \nsupposed to be. There has been very heated debate on this issue. I \nthink the Senate is better for this.\n  This issue has been aired. There were procedural efforts made to take \nit back to committee, and there was a lot of good debate. Again, I \ndirect this to the majority leader--and I speak on behalf of Senator \nDaschle and the rest of the minority--we appreciate allowing us to act \nas the Senate should act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I do not want to go without praising my own majority \nleader also. He obviously set the tone for this debate not only by \nstructuring the way by which this debate proceeded, but very \nimportantly in coming to the floor and laying out, in very strong \narguments, the case against this procedure from a perspective that is \nunique in the Senate, which is the perspective of a physician.\n  I am going to have a few more things to say in a few minutes, but \nbefore I do that, I thank my incredible staff for helping me through \nthis process, Heather MacLean and Wayne Palmer. Heather and Wayne were \nterrific in preparing for this debate. There was an obvious range on a \nwide variety of things, things, frankly, we did not even anticipate. \nThey did an outstanding job in preparation, and an outstanding job in \ngetting information to make me look good, which, I am sure many \nSenators will confirm, is not the easiest thing in the world to do.\n  I thank them both very much for their excellent assistance. I am not \nsurprised, by any stretch of the imagination, regarding their \nincredible work, but I am very grateful.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANTORUM.

The instant we occupy \nIraq, we become responsible for the security, care, and feeding of its \npeople--even the education of its children. Years of reconstruction and \nassistance to the Iraqi people will be necessary to bring Iraq to \nindependence into the family of nations. And we can expect an American \npresence in that country for months and even years to come.\n  This is an enormous enterprise and an extraordinary obligation.

Pickering and \nJames R. Schlesinger, Co-Chairs, and Eric P. Schwartz, Project Director\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n       If the United States goes to war and removes the regime of \n     Saddam Hussein, American interests will demand an \n     extraordinary commitment of U.S. financial and personnel \n     resources to post-conflict transitional assistance and \n     reconstruction. These interests include eliminating Iraqi \n     weapons of mass destruction (WMD); ending Iraqi contacts, \n     whether limited or extensive, with international terrorist \n     organizations; ensuring that a post-transition Iraqi \n     government can maintain the country's territorial integrity \n     and independence while contributing to regional stability; \n     and offering the people of Iraq a future in which they have a \n     meaningful voice in the vital decisions that impact their \n     lives.\n       But U.S. officials have yet to fully describe to Congress \n     and the American people the magnitude of the resources that \n     will be required to meet post-conflict needs. Nor have they \n     outlined in detail their perspectives on the structure of \n     post-conflict governance. The Task Force believes that these \n     issues require immediate attention, and encourages the \n     administration to take action in four key areas:\n       Key Recommendation #1: An American political commitment to \n     the future of Iraq: The president should build on his recent \n     statements in support of U.S. engagement in Iraq by making \n     clear to Congress, the American people, and the people of \n     Iraq that the United States will stay the course. He should \n     announce a multibillion dollar, multiyear post-conflict \n     reconstruction program and seek formal congressional \n     endorsement. By announcing such a program, the president \n     would give Iraqis confidence that the United States are \n     committed to contribute meaningfully to the development of \n     Iraq and would enable U.S. government agencies to plan more \n     effectively for long-term U.S. involvement.\n       The scale of American resources that will be required could \n     amount to some $20 billion\n\n[[Page S3616]]\n\n     per year for several years. This figure assumes a deployment \n     of 75,000 troops for post-conflict peace stabilization (at \n     about $16.8 billion annually), as well as funding for \n     humanitarian and reconstruction assistance (as recommended \n     immediately below). If the troop requirements are much larger \n     than 75,000--a genuine possibility--the funding requirement \n     would much greater.\n       For reconstruction and humanitarian assistance alone, the \n     president should request from Congress $3 billion for a one-\n     year period, and make clear the United States will be \n     prepared to make substantial additional contributions in the \n     future. This initial contribution would include $2.5 billion \n     for reconstruction and $500 million for humanitarian aid. \n     (However, if there are significant interruptions in the \n     availability of Iraqi oil revenues for the Oil for Food \n     Program, the figure for humanitarian assistance would need \n     to be considerably higher).\n       Key Recommendation #2: Protecting Iraqi civilians--a key to \n     winning the peace: From the outset of conflict, the U.S. \n     military should deploy forces with a mission to establish \n     public security and provide humanitarian aid. This is \n     distinct from the tasks generally assigned to combat troops, \n     but it will be critical to preventing lawlessness and \n     reassuring Iraqis who might otherwise flee their homes. As \n     women and children will constitute the majority of refugees \n     and internally displaced persons, special efforts should be \n     made to ensure that they are protected from sexual assault \n     and that their medical and health care needs are met. The \n     Bush administration should sustain this public security focus \n     throughout the transition. None of the other U.S. objectives \n     in rebuilding Iraq would be realized in the absence of public \n     security. If the administration fails to address this issue \n     effectively, it would fuel the perception that the result of \n     the U.S. intervention is an increase in humanitarian \n     suffering.\n       Additional recommendations--protecting Iraqi civilians: \n     Assist civilian victims of any use of WMD. The U.S. and \n     coalition partners should be ready to conduct rapid \n     assessment of any WMD damage, publicize the results of such \n     assessments, provide information to Iraqis on how to mitigate \n     the impact of WMD use, and provide assistance to alleviate \n     the health effects of WMD exposures should it occur.\n       Seek to ensure protection for displaced persons and \n     refugees. Administration officials should press neighboring \n     governments to provide safe haven in their countries to \n     fleeing Iraqis. If the government of Turkey and other \n     governments are determined to establish camps within the \n     territory of Iraq, U.S. officials should seek to ensure that \n     such camps are safe and secure.\n       Sustain, for the time being, the basic structure of the Oil \n     for Food Program. U.S. officials should work closely and \n     intensively with the World Food Program (WFP) to ensure the \n     continuation of the distribution network that sustains the \n     Oil for Food Program in central and southern Iraq. The \n     program should be modified over time to ensure transparency \n     and effectiveness in meeting Iraqi needs.\n       Actively recruit international civilian police (civpol) and \n     constabulary forces. Constabulary units such as Italy's \n     Carabinieri have equipment, training, and organization that \n     enable it to maintain public order and address civil unrest. \n     In addition, international civilian police could play an \n     important role in vetting, training, and mentoring Iraqi \n     police.\n       Key Recommendation #3: Sharing the burden for post-conflict \n     transition and reconstruction: The Bush administration should \n     move quickly to involve international organizations and other \n     governments in the post-conflict transition and \n     reconstruction process. This move will lighten the load on \n     U.S. military and civilian personnel, and help to diminish \n     the impression that the United States seeks to control post-\n     transition Iraq.\n       The Bush administration will likely be reluctant, \n     especially early in the transition process, to sacrifice \n     unity of command. On the other hand, other governments may be \n     hesitant to participate in activities in which they have \n     little responsibility. The Task Force recommends that the \n     administration address this dilemma by promoting post-\n     conflict Security Council resolutions that endorse U.S. \n     leadership on security and interim civil administration in \n     post-conflict Iraq, but also envision meaningful \n     international participation and the sharing of responsibility \n     for decision-making in important areas. The resolutions could \n     direct WFP or another international humanitarian organization \n     to assume lead responsibility for humanitarian assistance \n     (and involve NGOs and Iraqi civil society in aid management \n     and delivery); indicate that the United Nations will take \n     responsibility in organizing (with U.S. support and \n     assistance) the political consultative process leading to a \n     transition to a new Iraqi government; establish an oil \n     oversight board for Iraq; authorize the continuation of the \n     UN's Oil for Food Program; establish a consortium of donors \n     in conjunction with the World Bank and the IMF, to consider \n     Iraqi reconstruction needs as well as debt relief; and \n     indicate that responsibilities in other areas could be \n     transferred to the United Nations and/or other governments as \n     conditions permit.\n       Key recommendation #4: Making Iraqis stakeholders \n     throughout the transition process: The administration should \n     ensure that Iraqis continued to play key roles in the \n     administration of public institutions, subject to adequate \n     vetting. Continuity of basic services will be essential, and \n     will require that thousands of Iraqi civil servants continue \n     to do their jobs. In addition, every effort should be made \n     quickly to establish Iraqi consultative mechanisms on \n     political, constitutional, and legal issues, so that the \n     period of interim governance will be limited and \n     characterized by Iraqi engagement on the political as well as \n     administrative level.\n       Additional recommendation--making Iraqis stakeholders: \n     Encourage a geographically based, federal system of \n     government in Iraq. In northern Iraq, the Kurdish population \n     has operated outside of regime control for over a decade. \n     While decisions on Iraq's constitutional structure should be \n     made by Iraqis, the Task Force believes that a solution \n     short of a federal system will risk conflict in a future \n     Iraq, and that U.S. officials should adopt this \n     perspective in their discussions with Iraqi counterparts \n     and with Iraq's neighbors.\n\n\n               other issues of concern to the task force\n\n       The rule of law and accountability: Police training must be \n     supplemented by efforts to build other components of a system \n     of justice, especially courts. The Task Force thus makes the \n     following recommendations: Deploy judicial teams, seek \n     international involvement. The administration should promote \n     the post-conflict deployment of U.S. and international legal \n     and judicial assistance teams to help address immediate and \n     longer term post-conflict justice issues.\n       Act early on accountability, seek international involvement \n     in the process, and ensure a key role for Iraqis. Given the \n     enormity of human rights abuses by the regime, the Task Force \n     believes that accountability issues should be an early \n     priority for the transitional administration. International \n     involvement in the process, either through the creation of an \n     international ad hoc tribunal, or the development of a mixed \n     tribunal, will enhance the prospects for success. The Task \n     Force notes that a truth and reconciliation process could be \n     established concurrently with such a tribunal, as a \n     complement to criminal accountability for those who bear \n     greatest responsibility for abuses.\n       The Iraqi oil industry: U.S. officials will have to develop \n     a posture on a range of questions relating to control the oil \n     industry, such as how decisions on contracts for equipment \n     and oil field rehabilitation will be made; who will consider \n     and make judgments on the viability of executory contracts \n     for development of oil fields, which have as a condition \n     precedent the lifting of sanctions; and what will be required \n     for transition from the Oil for Food Program to a transparent \n     and accountable indigenous system to receive and disburse \n     oil-related revenues?\n       The Task Force recommends that the administration strike a \n     careful balance between the need to ensure that oil revenues \n     benefit the people of Iraq and the importance of respecting \n     the right of Iraqis to make decisions about their country's \n     natural resources. In particular, the administration \n     should undertake the following steps: Emphasize publicly \n     that the United States will respect and defend Iraqi \n     ownership of the country's economic resources, especially \n     oil; seek an internationally sanctioned legal framework to \n     assure a reliable flow of Iraqi oil and to reserve to a \n     future Iraqi government the determination of Iraq's \n     general oil policy. The removal of the regime will not \n     alter Iraqi obligations under the existing, UN-managed, \n     legal framework for oil, but it will likely result in the \n     need for modifications. The Task Force believes that a new \n     framework, which could be affirmed by a Security Council \n     resolution, could establish a decision-making oversight \n     board with international and significant Iraqi \n     participation.\n       Address potential impact of regime change on Jordanian oil \n     imports from Iraq. The Iraqi regime has provided the \n     government of Jordan with free and heavily discounted oil. It \n     is unclear whether such arrangements would continue in the \n     post-conflict environment. In view of Jordan's economic \n     situation and its important role on regional and \n     international security issues, the administration should make \n     efforts to address Jordanians needs in this area.\n       Regional diplomatic and security issues: In the Gulf, U.S. \n     officials will confront the challenge of effectively \n     downsizing the Iraqi military while seeking to promote a \n     longer-term security balance in which Iraq's territorial \n     integrity can be maintained. In the Middle East, a successful \n     U.S. and coalition intervention in Iraq will raise \n     expectations about a new U.S. diplomatic initiative on the \n     Arab-Israeli dispute. On these issues, the Task Force makes \n     the following recommendations: Closely monitor restructuring \n     and professionalization of the Iraqi military, as well as \n     disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration. These tasks \n     are likely to be carried out largely by private contractors \n     and/or international development organizations, and will \n     require close supervision of what might otherwise be an \n     uncoordinated effort. In addition, the Bush administration \n     should promote programs in this area that include curricula \n     emphasizing civilian control of the military and respect of \n     human rights.\n       Consider a regional forum for discussion of security \n     issues. The administration should strongly consider \n     encouraging a security forum with states in the region. The \n     forum could address confidence-building measures, and related \n     issues such as external security guarantees and \n     nonproliferation.\n\n[[Page S3617]]\n\n       Initiate post-conflict action on the Middle East Peace \n     Process. The Task Force encourages the administration to give \n     high priority to an active, post-conflict effort to engage \n     the peace process, and also believes that any such action by \n     the administration must be accompanied by greater efforts by \n     Arab states and the Palestinian leadership to discourage and \n     condemn acts of terrorism and violence against Israelis and \n     elsewhere in the region.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/12/senate-section/article/S3617-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3617]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NOMINATION OF JUDGE GREGORY FROST\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise to speak in strong support of the \nnomination of Judge Gregory Frost, whom the President has nominated to \nbe United States District Court Judge for the Southern District of \nOhio, and whom the Senate confirmed just two days ago. I have had the \npleasure of knowing Judge Frost for many, many years and can say with \nconfidence that he is exceptionally qualified for this position. I \nbelieve that he will be an excellent Federal Judge.\n  Judge Frost currently serves as Judge on the Licking County Common \nPleas Court in Newark, OH. He has been on the Licking County bench for \nthe past 19 years--serving first as a Municipal Court judge from 1983 \nto 1990 before being elected to his current position.\n  As I discussed during his Judiciary Committee hearing, while on the \nLicking County bench, Judge Frost was selected to take the lead in \nwriting the jury instructions for the State of Ohio. This is no small \nundertaking. These jury instructions provide the framework in which all \njury cases in the State of Ohio are deliberated. The fact that he was \nchosen to do this reflects the esteem in which his colleagues hold him.\n  Before serving on the bench, Judge Frost served in private practice \nand also served an assistant Licking County prosecutor from 1974 until \n1978. Having seen how the trial process works from many different \nperspectives--as a prosecutor, a defense attorney, and a judge--Judge \nFrost knows what defines good judicial temperament, and I believe that \nhe has it.\n  While on the bench, his graciousness and dedication have earned him \nthe respect of those inside and outside of his courtroom. I received \nmany letters of support for Judge Frost that attest to this.\n  Without question, Judge Frost will be a fine addition to the District \nCourt. He has the experience, the temperament, and the dedication to be \nan excellent Federal judge. I strongly support his nomination and thank \nmy colleagues for voting in support of his nomination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/12/senate-section/article/S3617-2", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3617]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     JUSTICE NEEDED FOR THE MURDER OF PRIME MINISTER ZORAN DJINDIC\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this morning's news of the \nassassination of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindic is deeply \nsaddening.\n  Prime Minister Djindic was a man of courage and determination--\nwhether tackling economic and political reforms or securing the \nextradition of war criminal Slobodan Milosevic to The Hague. He \nunderstood and accepted the risks of leadership in a transitional \nSerbia, and bravely served his compatriots.\n  Prime Minister Djindic rightly believed that Serbia's future rests \nwith the rule of law, free markets, and a democratic political system. \nThreats against his life--including an assassination attempt only last \nmonth--underscored that his reform agenda directly challenging \nentrenched segments of Serbian society, including organized crime and \nthe cronies of Slobodan Milosevic who continue to serve in the \ngovernment and military.\n  Prime Minister Djindic scoffed at the notion that his untimely demise \nwould derail Serbia's reform efforts. After last month's incident, he \nsaid, ``If someone thinks the law and reforms can be stopped by \neliminating me, then that is a huge delusion.''\n  Those who share the Prime Minister's vision of peace and prosperity \nfor Serbia cannot--and must not--give up their struggle. There is no \nbetter way to honor Zoran Djindic than to redouble efforts to implement \nreforms and to strengthen the rule of law.\n  During this uncertain time, the champions of reform and democracy in \nSerbia should know that the U.S. Congress continues to stand by their \nside; crime bosses and war criminals should know that the United States \nis committed to aiding reformers in their defeat.\n  We will continue to closely follow developments in Serbia and \nthroughout the region--and will remain vigilant in demanding justice \nfor the murder of Zoran Djindic.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/12/senate-section/article/S3617-3", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3617]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  SUPPORT FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER\n\n Mr. NELSON of Nebraska.

He reacted positively, assuring me that the \napplication would be given top priority.\n  The need for this facility in Lincoln is great. Lincoln is \nexperiencing an influx of immigrant families who lack health care \ncoverage and are in critical need of medical care. And Nebraska, like \nother States, is facing budgetary constraints due to the downturn in \nthe economy and reduced its Medicaid rolls leaving more people without \nhealth insurance.\n  The new health center, which will be called the Peoples' Health \nCenter of Lincoln, will provide many services to the area including: \nprimary medical care, primary dental care and oral health education, \nlab services, social work and health education. With the Federal funds, \nthe community will be able to proceed to develop these health services \nto the uninsured and underinsured in Lincoln.\n  I look forward to HHS's grant announcement and am hopeful that \nLincoln's application will be approved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/12/senate-section/article/S3617-4", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3617]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING DR.

Mr. President, today it is my great pleasure to \nrecognize Project Rehab for 35 years of dedicated service promoting \npersonal and community health throughout my home State of Michigan.\n  Since 1968, Project Rehab has functioned as a community-based \noutreach to people experiencing behavioral and mental health problems. \nProject in Rehabilitation began as the joint effort of Dr. William \nKooistra and Dr. Chet Maternowski to offer counseling and treatment to \nheroin addicts in Grand Rapids, MI. Through their valuable service, \nDrs. Kooistra and Maternowski promoted awareness of drug addiction\n\n[[Page S3618]]\n\nin a community that was not then equipped to address this problem. \nOvercoming sometimes harsh criticism, they succeeded in establishing \ntheir organization as a place of hope for those needing drug abuse \ntreatment.\n  Over the years, Project Rehab has grown to fit the changing needs of \nits clients. While maintaining a strong emphasis on treating addiction \nand substance abuse, Project Rehab now offers a broad range of \nservices, including work-release programs for prisoners, employee \ncounseling, and educational programs to encourage behavioral and mental \nhealth.\n  Today, Project Rehab serves 5,000 clients annually in cities across \nMichigan. Through its educational services, Project Rehab educates more \nthan 9,000 students, warning them of the dangers posed by drug and \nalcohol use. Within its field, Project Rehab is recognized as an \ninnovative force, bringing unique treatment to individuals in need. As \none of the largest and longest running substance abuse programs in \nMichigan, I commend Project Rehab for improving the lives of many in \nMichigan and setting an example for other programs around the country.\n  I know that my colleagues in the Senate will join me in \ncongratulating Project Rehab for their committed work and for the hope \nthey have given to many.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/12/senate-section/article/S3618-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3618]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING DR.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to acquire \nthe McLoughlin House National Historic Site in Oregon City, Oregon, for \ninclusion in the Fort Vancouver National Historic Site, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today as an original co-sponsor of \nthe McLoughlin House Preservation Act.\n  Dr. John McLoughlin, a powerful 6'4\" man, is known, officially and \nfondly, as the ``Father of Oregon.'' His compassion played a critical \nrole in the settling of the Northwest by Oregon Trail pioneers. Dr. \nMcLoughlin's generosity to these early pioneers who arrived in the \nOregon Territory after their incredible five month journey sick, hungry \nand without provisions was often the difference between survival and \nfailure during their first winter.\n  This bill is a testimony to the hard work that one community can \nachieve. Preservation of the McLoughlin House and the nearby Barclay \nHouse, located in Oregon City, Oregon, is important to the cultural \nidentity of Oregon. This bill would make them part of the Fort \nVancouver National Park Service administrative site, thereby \nhighlighting the interwoven connection between Fort Vancouver, the fur \ntrade and the beginnings of the Oregon Territory.\n  Dr. McLoughlin first came to the Northwest in 1824, arriving at Fort \nGeorge, now called Astoria, Oregon, to establish a supply center for \nthe Hudson's Bay Company. Within a year, he moved to a more favorable \nlocation on the northern side of the Columbia, in what is now \nWashington State, and built a new trading post and named it Fort \nVancouver. As the Post Administrator, the good hearted doctor \nmaintained a very good relationship with neighboring Indians and used \nhis medical skills to tend to the terrible fevers that broke out among \nthem.\n  The Fort belonged to the Hudson's Bay Company that was a rival of \nAmerican trappers, and although company policy discouraged American \nsettlers, Dr. McLoughlin was not one to refuse a helping hand to any \ntrapper or settler in distress. When frustrated with the Hudson's Bay \nCompany policy opposing American settlers, Dr. McLoughlin resigned and \nmoved to Oregon City on the Willamette Falls. By 1848, Oregon had grown \nso much that it was officially designated a territory, and by 1859, it \nbecame the nation's thirty-third state. McLoughlin remained a vibrant \npublic figure and became the Mayor of Oregon City in 1851. Many of the \ndebates concerning Oregon's statehood are said to have taken place in \nMcLoughlin's living room, and the Oregon State Legislature aptly named \nhim the ``Father or Oregon.''\n  The McLoughlin House was designated as the National Historic Site, \none of the first in the west, in 1941. I thank my constituents in \nClackamas County, particularly John Salisbury and the McLoughlin \nMemorial Association, for all of their hard work to preserve this \nOregon treasure. Additionally, I thank Tracy Fortmann with the National \nPark Service at Fort Vancouver for her advocacy on behalf of the \nMcLoughlin House. Mayor Alice Norris and the former mayors of Oregon \nCity who have worked together to bring this legislation to the \nattention of the Oregon delegation deserve our thanks as well. Finally, \nI thank Representative Hooley for having the foresight to introduce \nthis legislation in the House of Representatives in the 107th Congress \nand again in the 108th.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. \n        Rockefeller, and Mr. Jeffords):\n  S. 603. A bill to amend part A of title IV of the Social Security Act \nto give States the option to create a program that allows individuals \nreceiving temporary assistance to needy families to obtain post-\nsecondary or longer duration vocational education; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce ``The Pathways to \nSelf-Sufficiency Act of 2003.'' I am pleased to be joined in \nintroducing this important legislation by my colleagues Senators \nBaucus, Bingaman and Rockefeller.\n  This legislation is based upon the highly esteemed Maine program \ncalled ``Parents as Scholars''. This program, which uses State \nMaintenance of Effort, MOE, dollars to pay TANF-like benefits to those \nparticipating in post-secondary education, is a proven success in my \nstate and is a wonderful foundation for a national effort.\n  We all agree that the 1996 welfare reform effort changed the face of \nthis Nation's welfare system to focus it on work. To that end, I \nbelieve that this legislation bolsters the emphasis on ``work first''. \nLike many of my colleagues, I agree that the shift in the focus from \nwelfare to work was the right decision, and that work should be the top \npriority. However, for those TANF recipients who cannot find a good job \nthat will put them on the road toward financial independence, education \nmight well be the key to a successful future of self-sufficiency.\n  As we have seen in Maine that education has played a significant role \nin breaking the cycle of welfare and giving parents the skills \nnecessary to find better paying jobs. And we all know that higher wages \nare the light at the end of the tunnel of public assistance.\n  ``The Pathways to Self-Sufficiency Act of 2003'' provides States with \nthe option to allow individuals receiving Federal TANF assistance to \nobtain post-secondary or vocational education. This legislation would \ngive States the ability to use Federal TANF dollars to give those who \nare participating in vocational or post-secondary education the same \nassistance as they would receive if they were working.\n  We all know that supports like income supplements, child care \nsubsidies, and transportation assistance among others, are essential to \na TANF recipient's ability to make a successful transition to work. The \nsame is true for those engaged in longer term educational endeavors. \nThis assistance is especially necessary for those who are undertaking \nthe challenge and the financial responsibility of post-secondary \neducation, in the hopes of increasing their earning potential and \nemployability. The goal of this program is to give participants the \ntools necessary to succeed into the future so that they can become, and \nremain, self-sufficient.\n  Choosing to go to college requires motivation, and graduating from \ncollege requires a great deal of commitment and work--even for someone \nwho isn't raising children and sustaining a family. These are \nsignificant challenges, and that's even before taking into \nconsideration the cost associated with obtaining a Bachelor's degree, \nwith a four year program at the University of Maine currently costing \nalmost $25,000. This legislation would provide those TANF recipients \nwho have the ability and the will to go to college the assistance they \nneed to sustain their families while they get a degree.\n  The value of promoting access to education in this manner to get \npeople off public assistance is proven by the success of Maine's \n``Parents as Scholars'', PaS, program. Maine's PaS graduates earn a \nmedian wage of $11.71 per hour after graduation up from a median of \n$8.00 per hour prior to entering\n\n[[Page S3623]]\n\ncollege. When compared to the $7.50 median hourly wage of welfare \nleavers in Maine who have not received a post-secondary degree, PaS \ngraduates are earning, on average, $160 more per week. That translates \ninto more than $8,000 per year--a significant difference.\n\n  Furthermore,the median grade point average for PaS participants while \nin college was 3.4 percent,and a full 90 percent of PaS participants' \nGPA was over 3.0. These parents are giving their all to pull their \nfamilies out of the cycle of welfare.\n  Recognizing that work is a priority under TANF, and building upon the \nsuccessful Maine model, the ``Pathways to Self-Sufficiency Act'' \nrequires that participants in post-secondary and vocational education \nalso participate in work. During the first two years of their \nparticipation in these education programs, students must participate in \na combination of colas time, study time, employment or work experience \nfor at lest 24 hours per week--the same hourly requirement that the \nPresident proposes in his welfare reauthorization proposal.\n  During the second two years--for those enrolled in a four year \nprogram--the participant must work at least 15 hours in addition to \nclass and study time, or engage in a combination activities, including \ncolas and study time work or work experience, and training, for an \naverage of 30 hours per week. And all the while, participants must \nmaintain satisfactory academic progress as defined by their academia \ninstitution.\n  The bottom line is that if we expect parents to move from welfare to \nwork and stay in the work force, we must give them the tools to find \ngood jobs. For some people that means job training, for others that \ncould mean dealing with a barrier like substance abuse or domestic \nviolence, and for others, that might mean access to education that will \nsecure them a good job and that will get them off and keep them off of \nwelfare.\n  The experience of several ``Parents as Scholar'' graduates were \nrecently captured in a publication published by the Maine Equal Justice \nPartners, and their experiences are testament to the fact that this \nprogram is a critically important step in moving towards self-\nsufficiency. In this report one Las graduate said of her experience, \n``If it weren't for `Parents as Scholars' I would never have been able \nto attend college, afford child care, or put food on the table. Today, \nI would most likely be stuck in a low-wage job I hated barely getting \nby . . .  I can now give my children the future they deserve.''\n  Another said, ``By earning my Bachelor's degree, I have become self \nsufficient. I was a waitress previously and would never have been able \nto support my daughter and I on the tips that I earned. I would \nencourage anyone to better their education if possible.\n  These are but a few comments from those who have benefited from \naccess to post-secondary education. And,while these women have been \nable to attend college and pursue good jobs thanks tori the good will \nand the support of the people of Maine, Las has strained the state's \nbudget. Giving States the option use Federal dollars to support these \nparticipants will make a tremendous difference in their ability to \nsustain these programs which have proven results. In Maine, nearly 90 \npercent of working graduates have left TANF permanently--and isn't that \nour ultimate goal?\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to include this \nlegislation in the upcoming welfare reauthorization. It is a critical \npiece of the effort to move people from welfare to work permanently and \nit has been missing from the federal program for too long.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH (for himself, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Allen, Mr. \n        Warner, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Burns, Mr. \n        Coleman, and Mr. Dayton):\n  S. 605. A bill to extend waivers under the temporary assistance to \nneedy families program through the end of fiscal year 2008; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwould allow States with successful welfare to renew them for the next \nfive years. In this effort, I am joined by Senators Wyden, Baucus, \nAllen, Warner, Kerry, Kennedy, Akaka, Burns, and Coleman. All of our \nStates and several others operate their welfare programs under waivers \nwhich allow them flexibility to design programs that work for people in \ntheir States.\n  The most comprehensive evaluation of welfare workforce strategies to \ndate, commissioned and funded by the Department of Health and Human \nServices, demonstrated that a mixed strategy based on individual degree \nof job readiness was far and away the most effective way to transition \nfamilies from welfare to work. This is the approach Oregon and others \nhave taken, and I feel strongly that these States be allowed to \ncontinue their innovative and successful programs.\n  Oregon has long been considered a national leader in developing \ninnovative strategies to serve its low-income citizens. Oregon's \nwelfare waiver, known as ``The Oregon Option,'' was implemented just a \nfew months before passage of the Personal Responsibility and Work \nOpportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996. The Oregon Option reflects \nOregon's strong belief in moving families forward to sustainable \nemployment. Consistent with Oregon's reputation as an innovator, the \nOregon Option also rejects a ``one size fits all'' approach for its low \nincome families.\n  Oregon uses a labor market test to assess each person's ability to \nwork. Families are expected to engage in intense job search for 45 days \nand if that process identifies significant barriers to families finding \nand retaining employment, case managers will work with the families to \nidentify resources available to address those barriers. The case \nmanagers then work to develop appropriate plans that engage families in \nbarrier removal activities, such as education, substance abuse or \nmental health treatment, finding housing for victims of domestic \nviolence, while moving them toward employment. Oregon officials \nestimate that at any time, approximately 50 percent of all TANF \nfamilies have substantial barriers to employment.\n  Oregon has demonstrated success in moving families into employment by \nfully utilizing its flexibility under the Oregon Option waiver. Oregon, \nand other states that have used federal flexibility to design \nsuccessful programs, must not be forced either to abandon their \neffective approaches or to try to find loopholes to circumvent the \napproach mandated by current reauthorization proposals.\n  The legislation that my colleagues and I are introducing today will \nallow all states with currently operational TANF waivers, and states \nwith waivers expiring after January 1, 2002, the option of renewing \ntheir waivers for the next five years, until the next scheduled \nreauthorization of welfare in 2008. This will ensure that successful \nprograms designed by local people for local people aren't eliminated in \nfavor of a ``one-size-fits-all'' federal program.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GREGG (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Harkin, \n        Mr. Smith, Ms. Mikulski, Ms. Collins, Mr. Bingaman, Ms. Snowe, \n        Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Dayton, Mr. \n        Durbin, and Mr. Daschle):\n  S. 606. A bill to provide collective bargaining rights for public \nsafety officers employed by States or their political subdivisions; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to be joined by \nSenators Kennedy, DeWine, Harkin, Smith, Mikulski, Collins, Bingaman, \nSnowe, Sarbanes, Kerry, Bayh, Corzine, and Dayton in introducing the \nPublic Safety Employer-Employee Cooperation Act of 2003. This \nlegislation would extend to firefighters and police officers the right \nto discuss workplace issues with their employers.\n  With the enactment of the Congressional Accountability Act, State and \nlocal government employees remain the only sizable segment of workers \nleft in America who do not have the basic right to enter into \ncollective bargaining agreements with their employers. While most \nStates do provide some collective bargaining rights for their public \nemployees, others do not.\n  Studies have shown that communities which promote such cooperation \nenjoy much more effective and efficient delivery of emergency services.\n\n[[Page S3624]]\n\nSuch cooperation, however, is not possible in the States that do not \nprovide public safety employees with the fundamental right to bargain \nwith their employers.\n  The legislation I am introducing today is balanced in its recognition \nof the unique situation and obligation of public safety officers. To \naccomplish this the bill: 1. Requires States, within 2 years, to \nguarantee the right of public safety officers to form and voluntarily \njoin a union to bargain collectively over hours, wages and conditions \nof employment; 2. Protects the right of public safety officers to form, \njoin, or assist any labor organization or to refrain from any such \nactivity, freely and without fear of penalty or reprisal; 3. Prohibits \nthe use of strikes, lockouts, sickouts, work slowdowns or any other \naction that is designed to compel an employer, officer or labor \norganization to agree to the terms of a proposed contract and that will \nmeasurably disrupt the delivery of services; 4. Continues to allow \nStates to enforce right-to-work laws which prohibit employers and labor \norganizations from negotiating labor agreements that require union \nmembership or payment of union fees as a condition of employment; 5. \nPreserves the right of management to not bargain over issues \ntraditionally reserved for management level decisions; 6. Exempts all \nstates with a State bargaining law for public safety officers that are \nequal to or greater than the rights granted under Federal law; 7. Gives \nStates the option to exempt from coverage subdivisions with populations \nof less than 5,000 or fewer than 25 full time employees.\n  Labor-management partnerships, which are built upon bargaining \nrelationships, result in improved public safety. Employer-employee \ncooperation contains the promise of saving the taxpayer money by \nenabling workers to give input as to the most efficient way to provide \nservices. In fact, States that currently give firefighters the right to \ndiscuss workplace issues actually have lower fire department budgets \nthan States without those laws.\n  The Public Safety Employer-Employee Cooperation Act of 2003 will put \nfirefighters and law enforcement officers on equal footing with other \nemployees and provide them with the fundamental right to negotiate with \nemployers over such basic issues as hours, wages, and workplace \nconditions.\n  I urge its adoption and ask unanimous consent that the text of this \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 606\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Public Safety Employer-\n     Employee Cooperation Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DECLARATION OF PURPOSE AND POLICY.\n\n       The Congress declares that the following is the policy of \n     the United States:\n       (1) Labor-management relationships and partnerships are \n     based on trust, mutual respect, open communication, bilateral \n     consensual problem solving, and shared accountability. Labor-\n     management cooperation fully utilizes the strengths of both \n     parties to best serve the interests of the public, operating \n     as a team, to carry out the public safety mission in a \n     quality work environment. In many public safety agencies it \n     is the union that provides the institutional stability as \n     elected leaders and appointees come and go.\n       (2) The Federal Government needs to encourage conciliation, \n     mediation, and voluntary arbitration to aid and encourage \n     employers and their employees to reach and maintain \n     agreements concerning rates of pay, hours, and working \n     conditions, and to make all reasonable efforts through \n     negotiations to settle their differences by mutual agreement \n     reached through collective bargaining or by such methods as \n     may be provided for in any applicable agreement for the \n     settlement of disputes.\n       (3) The absence of adequate cooperation between public \n     safety employers and employees has implications for the \n     security of employees and can affect interstate and \n     intrastate commerce. The lack of such labor-management \n     cooperation can detrimentally impact the upgrading of police \n     and fire services of local communities, the health and well-\n     being of public safety officers, and the morale of the fire \n     and police departments. Additionally, these factors could \n     have significant commercial repercussions. Moreover, \n     providing minimal standards for collective bargaining \n     negotiations in the public safety sector can prevent \n     industrial strife between labor and management that \n     interferes with the normal flow of commerce.\n\n     SEC. 3.

CONSTRUCTION AND COMPLIANCE.\n\n       (a) Construction.--Nothing in this Act shall be construed--\n       (1) to invalidate or limit the remedies, rights, and \n     procedures of any law of any State or political subdivision \n     of any State or jurisdiction that provides collective \n     bargaining rights for public safety officers that are equal \n     to or greater than the rights provided under this Act;\n       (2) to prevent a State from enforcing a right-to-work law \n     that prohibits employers and labor organizations from \n     negotiating provisions in a labor agreement that require \n     union membership or payment of union fees as a condition of \n     employment;\n       (3) to invalidate any State law in effect on the date of \n     enactment of this Act that substantially provides for the \n     rights and responsibilities described in section 4(b) solely \n     because such State law permits an employee to appear on his \n     or her own behalf with respect to his or her employment \n     relations with the public safety agency involved; or\n       (4) to permit parties subject to the National Labor \n     Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 151 et seq.) and the regulations \n     under such Act to negotiate provisions that would prohibit an \n     employee from engaging in part-time employment or volunteer \n     activities during off-duty hours; or\n       (5) to prohibit a State from exempting from coverage under \n     this Act a political subdivision of the State that has a \n     population of less than 5,000 or that employs less than 25 \n     full time employees.\n     For purposes of paragraph (5), the term ``employee'' includes \n     each and every individual employed by the political \n     subdivision except any individual elected by popular vote or \n     appointed to serve on a board or commission.\n       (b) Compliance.--No State shall preempt laws or ordinances \n     of any of its political subdivisions if such laws provide \n     collective bargaining rights for public safety officers that \n     are equal to or greater than the rights provided under this \n     Act.\n\n     SEC. 9. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be \n     necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am honored today to join Senator Gregg \nin introducing the Public Safety Employer-Employee Cooperation Act of \n2003.\n  This bill is an important bipartisan effort to help protect our \nNation's public safety officers on the job. The events of September 11 \nmade clear that our Nation's true heroes are our fire fighters, police \nofficers, and emergency medical technicians. We will never forget the \nsacrifices they made at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. The \nphotographs of tired, dust-covered, fire fighters confronting the \nunimaginable horror of that day are permanently emblazoned in our \nminds.\n  Thousands of public safety officers throughout the country serve in \nsome of the country's most dangerous, strenuous and stressful jobs \ntoday. Every year, more than 80,000 police officers and 75,000 \nfirefighters are injured on the job. An average of 160 police officers \nand nearly 100 firefighters die in the line of duty each year. It is a \nmatter of basic fairness to give these courageous men and women the \nsame rights that have long been enjoyed by other workers.\n  For more than 60 years, collective bargaining has enabled labor and \nmanagement to work together to improve job conditions and increase \nproductivity. Through collective bargaining, labor and management have \nled the way together on many important improvements in today's \nworkplace--especially with regard to health and pension benefits, paid \nholidays and sick leave, and workplace safety.\n  Collective bargaining in the public sector, once a controversial \nissue, is now widely accepted. It has been widespread, since at least \n1962, when President Kennedy signed an Executive order granting these \nbasic rights to Federal employees. Congressional employees have had \nthese rights since enactment of the Congressional Accountability Act \nalmost a decade ago. It is long past time for State and local \ngovernment employees to have Federal protection for the basic right to \nparticipate in collective bargaining agreements with their employers.\n  The bill we are introducing today extends this protection to \nfirefighters, police officers, correctional officers,\n\n[[Page S3626]]\n\nparamedics and emergency medical technicians. The bill guarantees the \nfundamental rights necessary for collective bargaining--the right to \nform and join a union; the right to bargain over hours, wages and \nworking conditions; the right to sign legally enforceable contracts; \nand the right to a means to resolve impasses in negotiations.\n  The benefits of this bill are clear and compelling. It will lead to \nsafer working conditions for public safety officers. States that lack \nthese collective bargaining laws have death rates for fire fighters \nnearly double the rate in States in which such bargaining takes place. \nIn 1993, fire fighters in nine of the 10 States with the highest fire \nfighter death rates did not have collective bargaining protection. \nBecause public safety employees serve on the front lines in providing \nfirefighting services, law enforcement services, and emergency medical \nservices, they know what it takes to create safer working conditions. \nThey should have a voice in decisions that can literally make a life-\nor-death difference on the job.\n  This bill will benefit all of us, not just public safety officers. \nWhen workers who actually do the job are able to provide advice on \ntheir working conditions, there are fewer injuries, increased morale, \nbetter information on new technologies, and more efficient ways to \nprovide the services, all of which improve the safety and security of \nthe communities that our public safety officers serve.\n  This bill will also save money for States and local communities. \nExperience has shown that when public safety officers can discuss \nworkplace conditions with management, partnerships and cooperation \ndevelop and lead to improved labor-management relations and better, \nmore cost-effective services. A study by the International Association \nof Fire Fighters shows that States and municipalities that give \nfirefighters the right to discuss workplace issues have lower fire \ndepartment budgets than States without such laws.\n  This bill accomplishes its goals in a reasonable way. It requires \nthat public safety officers be given the opportunity to bargain \ncollectively, but it does not require that employers adopt agreements, \nand it does not regulate the content of any agreements that are \nreached.\n  In States with collective bargaining laws that substantially provide \nthe modest minimum standards in the bill--as a majority of States \nalready do--those States will be unaffected by this legislation. Where \nStates do not have such laws, they may choose to enact them, or to \nallow the Federal Labor Relations Authority to establish procedures for \nbargaining between public safety officers and their employers. This \napproach respects existing State laws, and gives each state the \nauthority to choose the way in which it will comply with the \nrequirements of this legislation. States will have full discretion to \nmake decisions on the implementation and enforcement of the basic \nrights set forth in this proposal.\n  This amendment will not supersede State laws which already adequately \nprovide for the exercise of--or are more protective of--collective \nbargaining rights by public safety officers. It is a matter of basic \nfairness for these courageous men and women to have the same rights \nthat have long been enjoyed by other workers. They put their lives on \nthe line to protect us every day. They deserve to have an effective \nvoice on the job, and I urge the Senate to approve this important \nbipartisan legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 608. A bill to provide for personnel preparation, enhanced support \nand training for beginning special educators, and professional \ndevelopment of special educators, general educators, and early \nintervention personnel; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Personnel \nExcellence for Children with Disabilities Act of 2003 to ensure high \nquality personnel to serve students with disabilities.\n  I have long worked to improve the quality of teaching in America's \nclassrooms for the simple reason that well-trained and well-prepared \nteachers, faculty, principals and administrators are critical to \nimproving the educational performance and achievement of students.\n  As Congress turns to the reauthorization of the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act, IDEA, the focus shifts to increasing \nsupport for both new and veteran special education teachers, school \nprincipals, and the higher education faculty who train prospective \nspecial education teachers.\n  There are currently an estimated 6 million children who receive \nspecial education services. Yet, there are about 70,000 special \neducation teaching vacancies in schools nationwide. The President's \n2002 Commission on Excellence in Special Education report stated that \n``the growing shortage of special education teachers alarms this \nCommission.'' Moreover, an estimated 600,000 IDEA students are taught \nby unqualified or underqualified teachers nationwide. In some urban and \nrural areas, close to half of special education teachers are \nunqualified.\n  I am joined by Senator Kennedy, a leader in improving education for \nall children, in introducing legislation today which would address and \nimprove current conditions by enhancing personnel preparation, \nrecruitment and retention, support and training for beginning special \neducators, as well as professional development for special educators, \ngeneral educators, principals, paraprofessionals, and related services \npersonnel.\n  The Personnel Excellence for Children with Disabilities Act modifies \nand strengthens the current State Improvement Grant program to focus \nsolely on personnel and professional development, including support to \nschool districts to meet the personnel requirements under IDEA.\n  Our legislation also establishes two grant programs. One would fund \npartnerships of school districts, institutions of higher education, and \nelementary and secondary schools that focus on meeting the needs of \nbeginning special educators, through an additional 5th year clinical \nlearning opportunity or the creation or support of professional \ndevelopment schools. Professional development schools seek to improve \nthe professional status of teaching through a renewal of schools and \npreservice teacher education, in-service education of veteran teachers, \nand research to add to the knowledge base. The other grant program \nseeks to ensure that general educators, including principals and \nadministrators, have the skills, knowledge, and leadership training to \nimprove results for children with disabilities in their schools and \nclassrooms. Currently, approximately half of students with disabilities \nspend 79 percent or more of their time in regular classes, according to \nthe Department of Education's Annual Report to Congress for 2001. Only \n20 percent are served outside of regular classes for 60 percent or more \nof the time.\n  Lastly, our legislation enhances the personnel preparation programs \nunder the current IDEA Section 673. These programs provide grants to \ninstitutions of higher education to enhance the preparation of special \neducators.\n  In sum, the Personnel Excellence for Children with Disabilities Act \nseeks to enhance: the teaching skills of special educators, general \neducators, early intervention personnel, paraprofessionals and related \nservices personnel; the leadership skills of principals; collaboration \namong special educators, general educators, and other personnel; \nmentoring and other induction support for beginning special educators; \nand training programs at institutions of higher education. The Act \nwould also boost the ability of educators and personnel to: involve and \nwork with parents, implement positive behavioral interventions; improve \nearly intervention services for infants, toddlers, and preschoolers; \nand provide transition services and postsecondary opportunities. It \nwould also improve their ability to: use classroom-based techniques to \nidentify student potentially eligible for services; use technology to \nenhance learning of children with disabilities and communicate with \nparents; and ensure an effective IEP process.\n  The time for action is now because 98 percent of school districts \nreport that meeting the growing demand for special education teachers \nis a top priority. Annual attrition rates for special education \nteachers are over 13 percent: 6 percent for those who leave the field \nentirely; and an additional 7.4 percent who transfer to general \neducation.\n\n[[Page S3627]]\n\nMore than 200,000 new special education teachers will be needed in the \nnext five years, according to U.S. Department of Education estimates. \nInvesting in personnel preparation is critical for addressing these \nneeds which, in turn, will improve outcomes and results for children \nwith disabilities.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in this essential endeavor by \ncosponsoring this legislation and working for its inclusion in the \nreauthorization of the IDEA.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 608\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (Public Law \n107-296) to provide for the protection of voluntarily furnished \nconfidential information, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last year when I voted to support passage \nof the Homeland Security Act, HSA, I voiced concerns about several \nflaws in the legislation. I called for the Administration and my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to monitor implementation of the \nnew law and to craft corrective legislation in the 108th Congress. One \nof my chief concerns with the HSA was a subtitle of the act that \ngranted an extraordinarily broad exemption to the Freedom of \nInformation Act, FOIA, in exchange for the cooperation of private \ncompanies in sharing information with the government regarding \nvulnerabilities in the nation's critical infrastructure.\n  Unfortunately, the law that was enacted undermines Federal and State \nsunshine laws permitting the American people to know what their \ngovernment is doing. Rather than increasing security by encouraging \nprivate sector disclosure to the government, it guts FOIA at the \nexpense of our national security and public health and safety.\n  On March 16, we mark Freedom of Information Day, which falls on the \nanniversary of James Madison's birthday. Madison said, ``A popular \ngovernment, without popular information, or the means of acquiring it, \nis but a prologue to a farce or tragedy or perhaps both.'' As a long-\ntime supporter of open government, I believe we must heed Madison's \nwarning and revisit the potentially damaging limitations placed on \naccess to information by the HSA.\n  I rise today to introduce legislation with my distinguished \ncolleagues Senator Levin, Senator Jeffords, Senator Lieberman, and \nSenator Byrd to restore the integrity of FOIA. I want to thank my \ncolleagues for working with me on this important issue of public \noversight. This bill protects Americans' ``right to know'' while \nsimultaneously providing security to those in the private sector who \nvoluntarily submit critical infrastructure records to the newly created \nDepartment of Homeland Security, DHS.\n  Encouraging cooperation between the private sector and the government \nto keep our critical infrastructure systems safe from terrorist attacks \nis a goal we all support. But the appropriate way to meet this goal is \na source of great debate--a debate that has been all but ignored since \nthe enactment of the HSA last year.\n  The HSA created a new FOIA exemption for ``critical infrastructure \ninformation.'' That broadly defined term applies to information \nregarding a variety of facilities--such as privately operated power \nplants, bridges, dams, ports, or chemical plants--that might be \ntargeted for a terrorist attack. In HSA negotiations last fall, House \nRepublicans and the administration promoted language that they \ndescribed as\n\n[[Page S3632]]\n\nnecessary to encourage owners of such facilities to identify \nvulnerabilities in their operations and share that information with the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, DHS. The stated goal was to ensure \nthat steps could be taken to ensure the facilities' protection and \nproper functioning.\n  In fact, such descriptions of the legislation were disingenuous. \nThese provisions, which were eventually enacted in the HSA, shield from \nFOIA almost any voluntarily submitted document stamped by the facility \nowner as ``critical infrastructure.'' This is true no matter how \ntangential the content of that document may be to the actual security \nof a facility. The law effectively allows companies to hide information \nabout public health and safety from American citizens simply by \nsubmitting it to DHS. The enacted provisions were called ``deeply \nflawed'' by Mark Tapscott of the Heritage Foundation in a November 20, \n2002 Washington Post op-ed. ``Too Many Secrets,'' Washington Post, \nNovember 20, 2002, at A25. He argued that the ``loophole'' created by \nthe law ``could be manipulated by clever corporate and government \noperators to hide endless varieties of potentially embarrassing and/or \ncriminal information from public view.''\n  In addition, under the HSA, disclosure by private facilities to DHS \nneither obligates the private company to address the vulnerability, nor \nrequires DHS to fix the problem. For example, in the case of a chemical \nspill, the law bars the government from disclosing information without \nthe written consent of the company that caused the pollution. As the \nWashington Post editorialized on February 10, 2003, ``A company might \npreempt environmental regulators by `voluntarily' divulging \nincriminating material, thereby making it unavailable to anyone else.'' \n``Fix This Loophole,'' Washington Post, February 10, 2003, at A20.\n  The new law also 1. shields the companies from lawsuits to compel \ndisclosure, 2. criminalizes otherwise legitimate whistleblower activity \nby DHS employees, and 3. preempts any state or local disclosure laws.\n  The Restore FOIA bill I introduce today with Senators Levin, \nJeffords, Lieberman, and Byrd is identical to language I negotiated \nwith Senators Levin and Bennett last summer when the HSA was debated by \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee. Senator Bennett stated in the \nCommittee's July 25, 2003 mark up that the administration had endorsed \nthe compromise. He also said that industry groups had reported to him \nthat the compromise language would make it possible for them to share \ninformation with the government without fear of the information being \nreleased to competitors or to other agencies that might accidentally \nreveal it. The Governmental Affairs Committee reported out the \ncompromise language that day. Unfortunately, much more restrictive \nHouse language was eventually signed into law.\n  The February 10 Post editorial called the Leahy-Levin-Bennett \nlanguage ``a compromise that would accomplish the reasonable purpose'' \nof ``encouraging companies to share information with the government \nabout infrastructure that might be vulnerable to terrorist attack \nwithout such broad harmful effects.'' Id. The Post editorial was \ntitled, ``Fix This Loophole,'' which is exactly what my colleagues and \nI hope to accomplish with the introduction of this bill. Id.\n  The Restore FOIA bill would correct the problems in the HSA in \nseveral ways. First, it limits the FOIA exemption to relevant \n``records'' submitted by the private sector, such that only those that \nactually pertain to critical infrastructure safety are protected. \n``Records'' is the standard category referred to in FOIA. This corrects \nthe effective free pass given to industry by the HSA for any \ninformation it labels ``critical infrastructure.''\n  Second, unlike the HSA, the Restore FOIA bill allows for government \noversight, including the ability to use and share the records within \nand between agencies. It does not limit the use of such information by \nthe government, except to prohibit public disclosure where such \ninformation is appropriately exempted under FOIA.\n  Third, it protects the actions of legitimate whistleblowers, rather \nthan criminalizing their acts.\n  Fourth, it does not provide civil immunity to companies that \nvoluntarily submit information. This corrects a flaw in the current \nlaw, which would prohibit such information from being used directly in \ncivil suits by government or private parties.\n  Fifth, unlike the HSA, the Restore FOIA bill allows local authorities \nto apply their own sunshine laws. The Restore FOIA bill does not \npreempt any state or local disclosure laws for information obtained \noutside the Department of Homeland Security. Likewise, it does not \nrestrict the use of such information by state agencies.\n  Finally, the Restore FOIA bill does not restrict congressional use or \ndisclosure of voluntarily submitted critical infrastructure \ninformation. The HSA language was unclear on this point, and even the \nCongressional Research Service could not say for certain that members \nof Congress or their staff would not be criminally liable. Homeland \nSecurity Act of 2002: Critical Infrastructure Information Act, February \n29, 2003, CRS Report for Congress, Order Code RL31762, at 14-15.\n  These changes to the HSA would accomplish the stated goals of the \ncritical infrastructure provisions in the HSA without tying the hands \nof the government in its efforts to protect Americans and without \ncutting the public out of the loop.\n  The Administration has flip-flopped on how to best approach the issue \nof critical infrastructure information. The Administration's original \nJune 18, 2002, legislative proposal establishing a new department \ncarved out an FOIA exemption, in section 204, and required non-\ndisclosure of any ``information'' ``voluntarily'' provided to the new \nDepartment of Homeland Security by ``non-Federal entities or \nindividuals'' pertaining to ``infrastructure vulnerabilities or other \nvulnerabilities to terrorism'' in the possession of, or that passed \nthrough, the new department. Critical terms, such as ``voluntarily \nprovided,'' were undefined.\n  The Judiciary Committee had an opportunity to query Governor Ridge \nabout the Administration's proposal on June 26, 2002, when the \nAdministration reversed its long-standing position and allowed him to \ntestify in his capacity as the Director of the Transition Planning \nOffice.\n  Governor Ridge's testimony at that hearing is instructive. He seemed \nto appreciate the concerns expressed by Members about the President's \nJune 18 proposal and to be willing to work with us in the legislative \nprocess to find common ground. On the FOIA issue, he described \nthe Administration's goal to craft ``a limited statutory exemption to \nthe Freedom of Information Act'' to help ``the Department's most \nimportant missions [which] will be to protect our Nation's critical \ninfrastructure.'' (June 26, 2002 Hearing, Tr., p. 24). Governor Ridge \nexplained that to accomplish this, the Department must be able to \n``collect information, identifying key assets and components of that \ninfrastructure, evaluate vulnerabilities, and match threat assessments \nagainst those vulnerabilities.'' (Id., at p. 23).\n\n  I do not understand why some have insisted that FOIA and our national \nsecurity are inconsistent. Before the HSA was enacted, the FOIA already \nexempted from disclosure matters that are classified; trade secret, \ncommercial and financial information, which is privileged and \nconfidential; various law enforcement records and information, \nincluding confidential source and informant information; and FBI \nrecords pertaining to foreign intelligence or counterintelligence, or \ninternational terrorism. These already broad exemptions in the FOIA \nwere designed to protect national security and public safety and to \nensure that the private sector can provide needed information to the \ngovernment.\n  Prior to enactment of the HSA, the FOIA exempted from disclosure any \nfinancial or commercial information provided voluntarily to the \ngovernment, if it was of a kind that the provider would not customarily \nmake available to the public. Critical Mass Energy Project v. NRC, 975 \nF.2d 871 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (en banc). Such information enjoyed even \nstronger nondisclosure protections than did material that the \ngovernment requested. Applying this exception, Federal regulatory \nagencies safeguarded the confidentiality of all kinds of critical \ninfrastructure information, like nuclear power plant safety reports \n(Critical\n\n[[Page S3633]]\n\nMass, 975 F.2d at 874), information about product manufacturing \nprocesses and internal security measures (Bowen v. Food & Drug Admin., \n925 F.2d 1225 (9th Cir. 1991), design drawings of airplane parts \n(United Technologies Corp. by Pratt & Whitney v. F.A.A., 102 F.3d 688 \n(2d Cir. 1996)), and technical data for video conferencing software \n(Gilmore v. Dept. of Energy, 4 F. Supp.2d 912 (N.D. Cal. 1998)).\n  The head of the FBI National Infrastructure Protection Center, NIPC, \ntestified more than five years ago, in September, 1998, that the ``FOIA \nexcuse'' used by some in the private sector for failing to share \ninformation with the government was, in essence, baseless. He explained \nthe broad application of FOIA exemptions to protect from disclosure \ninformation received in the context of a criminal investigation or a \n``national security intelligence'' investigation, including information \nsubmitted confidentially or even anonymously. [Sen. Judiciary \nSubcommittee on Technology, Terrorism, and Government Information, \nHearing on Critical Infrastructure Protection: Toward a New Policy \nDirective, S. HRG. 105-763, March 17 and June 10, 1998, at p. 107]\n  The FBI also used the confidential business record exemption under \n(b)(4) ``to protect sensitive corporate information, and has, on \nspecific occasions, entered into agreements indicating that it would do \nso prospectively with reference to information yet to be received.'' \nNIPC was developing policies ``to grant owners of information certain \nopportunities to assist in the protection of the information (e.g., by \n`sanitizing the information themselves') and to be involved in \ndecisions regarding further dissemination by the NIPC.'' Id. In short, \nthe former Administration witness stated:\n\n       Sharing between the private sector and the government \n     occasionally is hampered by a perception in the private \n     sector that the government cannot adequately protect private \n     sector information from disclosure under the Freedom of \n     Information Act, FOIA. The NIPC believes that this perception \n     is flawed in that both investigative and infrastructure \n     protection information submitted to NIPC are protected from \n     FOIA disclosure under current law. (Id.)\n\n  Nevertheless, for more than five years, businesses continued to seek \na broad FOIA exemption that also came with special legal protections to \nlimit their civil and criminal liability. That business wish list was \nlargely granted in the Homeland Security Act.\n  At the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing with Governor Ridge, I \nexpressed my concern that an overly broad FOIA exemption would \nencourage government complicity with private firms to keep secret \ninformation about critical infrastructure vulnerabilities, reduce the \nincentive to fix the problems and end up hurting rather than helping \nour national security. In the end, more secrecy may undermine rather \nthan foster security.\n  Governor Ridge seemed to appreciate these risks, and said he was \n``anxious to work with the Chairman and other members of the committee \nto assure that the concerns that [had been] raised are properly \naddressed.'' Id. at p. 24. He assured us that ``[t]his Administration \nis ready to work together with you in partnership to get the job done. \nThis is our priority, and I believe it is yours as well.'' Id. at p. \n25. This turned out to be an empty promise.\n  Almost before the ink was dry on the Administration's earlier June \nproposal, on July 10, 2002, the Administration proposed to substitute a \nmuch broader FOIA exemption that would (1) exempt from disclosure under \nthe FOIA critical infrastructure information voluntarily submitted to \nthe new department that was designated as confidential by the submitter \nunless the submitter gave prior written consent, (2) provide limited \ncivil immunity for use of the information in civil actions against the \ncompany, with the likely result that regulatory actions would be \npreceded by litigation by companies that submitted designated \ninformation to the department over whether the regulatory action was \nprompted by a confidential disclosure, (3) preempt state sunshine laws \nif the designated information is shared with state or local government \nagencies, (4) impose criminal penalties of up to one year imprisonment \non government employees who disclosed the designated information, and \n(5) antitrust immunity for companies that joined together with agency \ncomponents designated by the President to promote critical \ninfrastructure security.\n  Despite the Administration's promulgation of two separate proposals \nfor a new FOIA exemption in as many weeks, in July, Director Ridge's \nOffice of Homeland Security released The National Strategy for Homeland \nSecurity, which appeared to call for more study of the issue before \nlegislating. Specifically, this report called upon the Attorney General \nto ``convene a panel to propose any legal changes necessary to enable \nsharing of essential homeland security information between the \ngovernment and the private sector.'' (P. 33)\n  The need for more study of the Administration's proposed new FOIA \nexemption was made amply clear by its possible adverse environmental, \npublic health and safety affects. Keeping secret problems in a variety \nof critical infrastructures would simply remove public pressure to fix \nthe problems. Moreover, several environmental groups pointed out that, \nunder the Administration's proposal, companies could avoid enforcement \naction by ``voluntarily'' providing information about environmental \nviolations to the EPA, which would then be unable to use the \ninformation to hold the company accountable and also would be required \nto keep the information confidential. It would bar the government from \ndisclosing information about spills or other violations without the \nwritten consent of the company that caused the pollution.\n  I worked on a bipartisan basis with many interested stakeholders from \nenvironmental, civil liberties, human rights, business and government \nwatchdog groups to craft a compromise FOIA exemption that did not grant \nthe business sector's wish-list but did provide additional \nnondisclosure protections for certain records without jeopardizing the \npublic health and safety. At the request of Chairman Lieberman for the \nJudiciary Committee's views on the new department, I shared my concerns \nabout the Administration's proposed FOIA exemption and then worked with \nMembers of the Governmental Affairs Committee, in particular Senator \nLevin and Senator Bennett, to craft a more narrow and responsible \nexemption that accomplishes the Administration's goal of encouraging \nprivate companies to share records of critical infrastructure \nvulnerabilities with the new Department of Homeland Security without \nproviding incentives to ``game'' the system of enforcement of \nenvironmental and other laws designed to protect our nation's public \nhealth and safety. We refined the FOIA exemption in a manner that \nsatisfied the Administration's stated goal, while limiting the risks of \nabuse by private companies or government agencies.\n  This compromise solution was supported by the Administration and \nother Members of the Committee on Governmental Affairs and was \nunanimously adopted by that Committee at the markup of the Homeland \nSecurity Department bill on July 25, 2002. The compromise which I now \nintroduce as a free standing bill would exempt from the FOIA certain \nrecords pertaining to critical infrastructure threats and \nvulnerabilities that are furnished voluntarily to the new Department \nand designated by the provider as confidential and not customarily made \navailable to the public. Notably, the compromise FOIA exemption made \nclear that the exemption only covered ``records'' from the private \nsector, not all ``information'' provided by the private sector and \nthereby avoided the adverse result of government agency-created and \ngenerated documents and databases being put off-limits to the FOIA \nsimply if private sector ``information'' is incorporated. Moreover, the \ncompromise FOIA exemption clearly defined what records may be \nconsidered ``furnished voluntarily,'' which did not cover records used \n``to satisfy any legal requirement or obligation to obtain any grant, \npermit, benefit (such as agency forbearance, loans, or reduction or \nmodifications of agency penalties or rulings), or other approval from \nthe Government.'' The FOIA compromise exemption further ensured that \nportions of records that are not covered by the exemption would be \nreleased pursuant to FOIA requests. This compromise did not provide any \ncivil liability or antitrust immunity that could be used to immunize \nbad actors or frustrate regulatory enforcement action, nor did\n\n[[Page S3634]]\n\nthe compromise preempt state or local sunshine laws.\n  Unfortunately, the version of the HSA that we enacted last November \njettisoned the bipartisan compromise on the FOIA exemption, worked out \nin the Senate with the Administration's support, and replaced it with a \nbig-business wish-list gussied up in security garb. The HSA's FOIA \nexemption makes off-limits to the FOIA much broader categories of \n``information'' and grants businesses the legal immunities and \nliability protections they have sought so vigorously for over five \nyears. This law goes far beyond what is needed to achieve the laudable \ngoal of encouraging private sector companies to help protect our \ncritical infrastructure. Instead, it ties the hands of the federal \nregulators and law enforcement agencies working to protect the public \nfrom imminent threats. It gives a windfall to companies who fail to \nfollow federal health and safety standards. Most disappointingly, it \nundermines the goals of openness in government that the FOIA was \ndesigned to achieve. In short, the FOIA exemption in the HSA represents \nthe most severe weakening of the Freedom of Information Act in its 36-\nyear history.\n  In the end, the broad secrecy protections provided to critical \ninfrastructure information in this bill will promote more secrecy, \nwhich may undermine rather than foster national security. In addition, \nthe immunity provisions in the bill will frustrate enforcement of the \nlaws that protect the public's health and safety.\n\n  Let me explain in greater detail. The FOIA exemption enacted in the \nHSA allows companies to stamp or designate certain information as \ncritical infrastructure information, or ``CII,'' and then submit this \ninformation about their operations to the government either in writing \nor orally, and thereby obtain a blanket shield from FOIA's disclosure \nmandates as well as other protections. A Federal agency may not \ndisclose or use voluntarily-submitted and CII-marked information, \nexcept for a limited ``informational purpose,'' such as ``analysis, \nwarning, interdependency study, recovery, reconstitution,'' without the \ncompany's consent. Even when using the information to warn the public \nabout potential threats to critical infrastructure, the bill requires \nagencies to take steps to protect from disclosure the source of the CII \ninformation and other ``business sensitive'' information.\n  The law also contains an unprecedented provision that threatens jail \ntime and job loss to any government employee who happens to disclose \nany critical infrastructure information that a company has submitted \nand wants to keep secret. These penalties for using the CII information \nin an unauthorized fashion or for failing to take steps to protect \ndisclosure of the source of the information are severe and will chill \nany release of CII information--not just when a FOIA request comes in, \nbut in all situations, no matter the circumstance. Criminalizing \ndisclosures not of classified information or national security related \ninformation, but of information that a company decides it does not want \npublic--is an effective way to quash discussion and debate over many \naspects of the government's work. In fact, under the HSA, CII \ninformation is granted more comprehensive protection under Federal \ncriminal laws than classified information.\n  This provision of the law has potentially disastrous consequences. If \nan agency is given information from an internet service provider, ISP, \nabout cyberattack vulnerabilities, agency employees will have to think \ntwice about sharing that information with other ISPs for fear that, \nwithout the consent of the ISP to use the information, even a warning \nmight cost their jobs or risk criminal prosecution.\n  This provision means that if a Federal regulatory agency needs to \nissue a regulation to protect the public from threats of harm, it \ncannot rely on any voluntarily submitted information--bringing the \nnormal regulatory process to a grinding halt. Public health and law \nenforcement officials need the flexibility to decide how and when to \nwarn or prepare the public in the safest, most effective manner. They \nshould not have to get ``sign off'' from a Fortune 500 company to do \nso.\n  While the HSA risks making it harder for the government to protect \nAmerican families, it makes it much easier for companies to escape \nresponsibility when they violate the law by giving them unprecedented \nimmunity from civil and regulatory enforcement actions. Once a business \ndeclares that information about its practices relates to critical \ninfrastructure and is ``voluntarily'' provided, it can then prevent the \nFederal Government from disclosing it not just to the public, but also \nto a court in a civil action. This means that an agency receiving CII-\nmarked submissions showing invasions of employee or customer privacy, \nenvironmental pollution, or government contracting fraud will be unable \nto use that information in a civil action to hold that company \naccountable. Even if the regulatory agency obtains the information \nnecessary to bring an enforcement action from an alternative source, \nthe company will be able to tie the government up in protracted \nlitigation over the source of the information.\n  For example, if a company submits information that its factory is \nleaching arsenic in ground water, that information may not be turned \nover to local health authorities to use in any enforcement proceeding \nnor turned over to neighbors who were harmed by drinking the water for \nuse in a civil tort action. Moreover, even if EPA tries to bring an \naction to stop the company's wrongdoing, the ``use immunity'' provided \nin the HSA will tie the agency up in litigation making it prove where \nit got the information and whether it is tainted as ``fruit of the \npoisonous tree''--i.e., obtained from the company under the ``critical \ninfrastructure program.''\n  Similarly, if the new Department of Homeland Security receives \ninformation from a bio-medical laboratory about its security \nvulnerabilities, and anthrax is released from the lab three weeks \nlater, the Department will not be able to warn the public promptly \nabout how to protect itself without consulting with and trying to get \nthe consent of the laboratory in order to avoid the risk of job loss or \ncriminal prosecution for a non-consensual disclosure. Moreover, if the \nlaboratory is violating any state, local or federal regulation in its \nhandling of the anthrax, the Department will not be able to turn over \nto another Federal agency, such as the EPA or the Department of Health \nand Human Services, or to any State or local health officials, \ninformation or documents relating to the laboratory's mishandling of \nthe anthrax for use in any enforcement proceedings against the \nlaboratory, or in any wrongful death action, should the laboratory's \nmishandling of the anthrax result in the death of any person. The law \nspecifically states that such CII-marked information ``shall not, \nwithout the written consent of the person or entity submitting such \ninformation, be used directly by such agency, any other Federal, State, \nor local authority, or any third party, in any civil action arising \nunder Federal or State law if such information is submitted in good \nfaith.'' [H.R. 5710, section 214(a)(1)(C)]\n  Most businesses are good citizens and take seriously their \nobligations to the government and the public, but this ``disclose-and-\nimmunize'' provision is subject to abuse by those businesses that want \nto exploit legal technicalities to avoid regulatory guidelines. The HSA \nlays out the perfect blueprint to avoid legal liability: funnel \ndamaging information into this voluntary disclosure system and pre-empt \nthe government or others harmed by the company's actions from being \nable to use it against the company. This is not the kind of two-way \npublic-private cooperation that our country needs.\n  The scope of the information that is covered by the new HSA FOIA \nexemption is overly broad and undermines the openness in government \nthat FOIA was intended to guarantee. Under this law, information about \nvirtually every important sector of our economy that today the public \nhas a right to see can be shut off from public view simply by labeling \nit ``critical infrastructure information.'' Prior to enactment of the \nHSA, under FOIA standards, courts had required federal agencies to \ndisclose 1. pricing information in contract bids so citizens can make \nsure the government is wisely spending their taxpayer dollars; 2. \ncompliance reports that allow constituents to insist that government \ncontractors comply with federal equal\n\n[[Page S3635]]\n\nopportunity mandates; and 3. banks' financial data so the public can \nensure that federal agencies properly approve bank mergers. Without \naccess to this kind of information, it will be harder for the public to \nhold its government accountable. Under the HSA, all of this information \nmay be marked CII information and kept out of public view.\n  The HSA FOIA exemption goes so far in exempting such a large amount \nof material from FOIA's disclosure requirements that it undermines \ngovernment openness without making any real gains in safety for \nfamilies in Vermont and across America. We do not keep America safer by \nchilling Federal officials from warning the public about threats to \ntheir health and safety. We do not ensure our nation's security by \nrefusing to tell the American people whether or not their federal \nagencies are doing their jobs or their government is spending their \nhard earned tax dollars wisely. We do not encourage real two-way \ncooperation by giving companies protection from civil liability when \nthey break the law. We do not respect the spirit of our democracy when \nwe cloak in secrecy the workings of our government from the public we \nare elected to serve.\n  The argument over the scope of the FOIA and unilateral executive \npower to shield matters from public scrutiny goes to the heart of our \nfundamental right to be an educated electorate aware of what our \ngovernment is doing. The Rutland Herald got it right in a November 26, \n2002 editorial that explained: ``The battle was not over the right of \nthe government to hold sensitive, classified information secret. The \ngovernment has that right. Rather, the battle was over whether the \ngovernment would be required to release anything it sought to \nwithhold.''\n  We need to fix this troubling restriction on public accountability. \nExempting the new Department from laws that ensure responsibility to \nthe Congress and to the American people makes for a tenuous start not \nthe sure footing we all want for the success and endurance of this new \nDepartment. I urge my colleagues to support the Restoration of Freedom \nof Information Act of 2003.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the editorials I mentioned and \nseveral letters of support of the Restore FOIA bill in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the additional material was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\nRestoration of Freedom of Information Act (``Restore FOIA'') Sectional \n                                Analysis\n\n       Sec. 1. Short title. This section gives the bill the short \n     title, the ``Restoration of Freedom of Information Act''.\n       Sec. 2. Protection of Voluntarily Furnished Confidential \n     Information. This section strikes subtitle B (secs. 211-215) \n     of the Homeland Security Act (``HSA'') (P.L. 107-296) and \n     inserts a new section 211.\n       Sections to be repealed from the HSA: These sections \n     contain an exemption to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) \n     that (1) exempt from disclosure critical infrastructure \n     information voluntarily submitted to the new department that \n     was designated as confidential by the submitter unless the \n     submitter gave prior written consent; (2) provide civil \n     immunity for use of such information in civil actions against \n     the company; (3) preempt state sunshine laws if the \n     designated information is shared with state or local \n     government agencies; and (4) impose criminal penalties of up \n     to one year imprisonment on government employees who \n     disclosed the designated information.\n       Provisions that would replace the repealed sections of the \n     HAS: The Restore FOIA bill inserts a new section 211 to the \n     HSA that would exempt from the FOIA certain records \n     pertaining to critical infrastructure threats and \n     vulnerabilities that are furnished voluntarily to the new \n     Department and designated by the provider as confidential and \n     not customarily made available to the public. Notably, the \n     Restore FOIA bill makes clear that the exemption covers \n     ``records'' from the private sector, not all ``information'' \n     provided by the private sector, as in the enacted version of \n     the HSA. The Restore FOIA bill ensures that portions of \n     records that are not covered by the exemption would be \n     released pursuant to FOIA requests. It does not provide any \n     civil liability immunity or preempt state or local sunshine \n     laws, and it does not criminalize whistleblower activity.\n       Specifically, this section of the Restore FOIA bill \n     includes the following:\n       A definition of ``critical infrastructure'': This term is \n     given the meaning adopted in section 1016(e) the USA Patriot \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 5195c(e)) which reads, ``critical \n     infrastructure means systems and assets, whether physical or \n     virtual, so vital to United States that the incapacity or \n     destruction of such systems and assets would have a \n     debilitating impact on security, national economic security, \n     national public health or safety, or any combination of those \n     matters.'' This definition is commonly understood to mean \n     facilities such as bridges, dams, ports, nuclear power \n     plants, or chemical plants.\n       A definition of the term ``furnished voluntarily'': This \n     term signifies documents provided to the Department of \n     Homeland Security (DHS) that are not formally required by the \n     department and that are provided to it to satisfy any legal \n     requirement. The definition excludes any document that is \n     provided to DHS with a permit or grant application or to \n     obtain any other benefit from DHS, such as a loan, agency \n     forbearance, or modification of a penalty.\n       An exemption from FOIA of records that pertain to \n     vulnerabilities of and threats to critical infrastructure \n     that are furnished voluntarily to DHS. This exemption is made \n     available where the provider of the record certifies that the \n     information is confidential and would not customarily be \n     released to the public.\n       A requirement that other government agencies that have \n     obtained such records from DHS withhold disclosure of the \n     records and refer any FOIA requests to DHS for processing.\n       A requirement that reasonably segregable portions of \n     requested documents be disclosed, as is well-established \n     under FOIA.\n       An allowance to agencies that obtain critical \n     infrastructure records from a source other than DHS to \n     release requested records consistent with FOIA, regardless of \n     whether DHS has an identical record in its possession.\n       An allowance to providers of critical infrastructure \n     records to withdraw the confidentiality designation of \n     records voluntarily submitted to DHS, thereby making the \n     records subject to disclosure under FOIA.\n       A direction to the Secretary of Homeland Security to \n     establish procedures to receive, designate, store, and \n     protect the confidentiality of records voluntarily submitted \n     and certified as critical infrastructure records.\n       A clarification that the bill would not preempt state or \n     local information disclosure laws.\n       A requirement for the Comptroller General to report to the \n     House and Senate Judiciary Committees, the House Governmental \n     Reform Committee and the Senate Governmental Affairs \n     Committee the number of private entities and government \n     agencies that submit records to DHS under the terms of the \n     bill. The report would also include the number of requests \n     for access to records that were granted or denied. Finally, \n     the Comptroller General would make recommendations to the \n     committees for modifications or improvements to the \n     collection and analysis of critical infrastructure \n     information.\n       Sec. 3. Technical and conforming amendment. This section \n     amends the table of contents of the Homeland Security Act.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 10, 2003]\n\n                           Fix This Loophole\n\n       The Homeland Security law enacted last year contains a \n     miserable provision that weakens important federal regulation \n     and public access to information. Congress should act soon to \n     repair the damage.\n       The goal of the provision was reasonable enough: \n     encouraging companies to share information with the \n     government about infrastructure that might be vulnerable to \n     terrorist attack. Fearing public disclosure, companies have \n     been reluctant to share information on vulnerabilities at, \n     say, power plants or chemical factories. So under the law, \n     any such ``critical infrastructure'' information that \n     companies voluntarily provide to the government is exempted \n     from disclosure to the public, litigants and enforcement \n     agencies.\n       But the law defines ``information'' so broadly that it will \n     cover, and thus keep secret, virtually anything a company \n     decides to fork over. A company might preempt environmental \n     regulators by ``voluntarily'' divulging incriminating \n     material, thereby making it unavailable to anyone else. \n     Unless regulators could show they had obtained the material \n     independently, it would be off limits to them. And the law \n     prescribes criminal penalties for whistle-blowers who make \n     such information public. The collective impact will be to put \n     in the hands of a regulated party the power, simply by \n     turning over information, to shield that information from \n     legitimate law enforcement purposes and from public \n     disclosure.\n       Sens. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) and Robert F. Bennett (R-\n     Utah) had negotiated a compromise that would accomplish the \n     reasonable purpose without such broad harmful effects. It \n     should be restored before the government finds its hands \n     tied--and the public finds itself out of the loop--on \n     important regulatory matters.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 20, 2002]\n\n                            Too Many Secrets\n\n                           (By Mark Tapscott)\n\n       Why does the White House sometimes seem so determined to \n     close the door on the people's right to know what their \n     government is doing? Even some of us who admire the \n     leadership of President Bush in the war on terrorism would \n     like to know.\n       Admittedly, insisting that the public's business be done in \n     public isn't a popular cause these days. Recent surveys show \n     that many Americans are willing to trade significant chunks \n     of their First Amendment rights for the promise of greater \n     security in the war on terrorism. Such surveys must gladden \n     the hearts of Bush administration\n\n[[Page S3636]]\n\n     officials who--presumably unintentionally--undermine measures \n     such as the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).\n       Consider just three examples from the past year: Section \n     204 of the White House's original proposal to establish a \n     Department of Homeland Security, White House Chief of Staff \n     Andrew Card's March 2002 directive that agencies restrict \n     access to ``sensitive but unclassified'' information, and the \n     administration's claim of executive privilege to keep secret \n     information regarding President Clinton's infamous midnight \n     pardons.\n       The administration's Section 204 proposal exempted from \n     FOIA disclosure any information ``provided voluntarily by \n     non-federal entities or individuals that relates to \n     infrastructure vulnerabilities or other vulnerabilities to \n     terrorism.'' One need not be a Harvard law graduate to see \n     that, without clarification of what constitutes such \n     vulnerabilities, this loophole could be manipulated by clever \n     corporate and government operators to hide endless varieties \n     of potentially embarrassing and/or criminal information from \n     public view.\n       Subsequent negotiations in the Senate with the White House \n     resulted in compromise language that takes care of some of \n     the major problems, but in the rush to final passage, the \n     Senate has accepted the House version of the legislation, \n     which, being virtually identical to the administration's \n     original version, remains deeply flawed in this regard.\n       The Card memo was issued when public anger over the Sept. \n     11, 2001, massacre was still intense. Despite the fact that \n     the memo failed to define what constitutes ``sensitive but \n     unclassified'' information, agencies responded by removing \n     thousands of previously public documents from FOIA \n     disclosure. The Pentagon, for example, estimated recently \n     that approximately 6,000 Defense Department documents were \n     removed from public view. Who now outside of government can \n     verify that any of those documents contained information that \n     could help terrorists?\n       Few would argue that the Section 204 proposal and the Card \n     memo do not address legitimate national security needs in the \n     war against terrorism. But to date, nobody has produced a \n     single example of vital information that could not have been \n     properly exempted from disclosure under the current FOIA, \n     which is backed by 25 years of detailed case law. Instead, \n     the administration offers vague language that invites abuse.\n       Finally, there are those pardons, which provoked a national \n     outcry when first reported. President Clinton had pardoned \n     140 people, including his Whitewater partner Susan McDougal, \n     his brother Roger (convicted on cocaine-related charges) and \n     international fugitive Marc Rich, wanted by the Justice \n     Department for allegedly conspiring with the Iranian \n     government in 1980 to buy 6 million barrels of oil, contrary \n     to a U.S. trade embargo.\n       It is doubtful that the full facts behind the pardons will \n     ever be known as long as the administration refuses to \n     disclose nearly 4,000 pages related to the former president's \n     actions. The Bush administration has taken a similar position \n     on documents related to former attorney general Janet Reno's \n     controversial decision not to appoint a special counsel to \n     investigate possible Clinton administration campaign finance \n     illegalities.\n       There was a time when at least one senior Bush \n     administration official thought the FOIA essential because \n     ``no matter what party has held the political power of \n     government, there have been attempts to cover up mistakes and \n     errors.'' That same official added that ``disclosure of \n     government information is particularly important today \n     because government is becoming involved in more and more \n     aspects of every citizen's personal and business life, and so \n     access to information about how government is exercising its \n     trust becomes increasingly important.''\n       So spoke a young Illinois Republican congressman named \n     Donald Rumsfeld, in a floor speech on June 20, 1966, \n     advocating passage of the FOIA, of which he was a co-sponsor.\n       The writer is director of the Heritage Foundation's Center \n     for Media and Public Policy.\n                                  ____\n\n\n Fix the Critical Infrastructure Information Subtitle in the Homeland \n                          Security Act of 2002\n\n       The undersigned organizations are concerned about the \n     current language for Critical Infrastructure Information in \n     the Homeland Security Act of 2002, which contains ambiguous \n     definitions that could unintentionally allow companies to \n     keep broad categories of information secret and provisions \n     that restrict the government's ability to use the \n     information. In order to better serve the goal of improving \n     public safety and security, we support efforts to fix the \n     Homeland Security Act by clarifying the scope of the \n     information protected and removing provisions that overly \n     restrict the government's ability to use the information.\n       Senators Leahy (D-VT), Levin (D-MI), Jeffords (I-VT), \n     Lieberman (D-CT), and Byrd (D-WV) will soon introduce \n     legislation entitled the Restoration of Freedom of \n     Information Act of 2003 (``Restore FOIA'') addressing these \n     concerns, using bipartisan language developed last year by \n     the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. The Restore FOIA \n     solution would:\n       Clarify the FOIA exemption to be more consistent with \n     established law.\n       Remove the restrictions on the government's ability to act \n     as it sees fit in response to the information it receives.\n       Preserve whistleblower protections by removing unnecessary \n     criminal penalties.\n       The information provisions currently within the Homeland \n     Security Act of 2002 do not accomplish the goal of the law--\n     empowering the government to protect citizens using private-\n     sector information which is ``voluntarily'' shared and \n     identifies potential vulnerabilities to terrorist attacks. \n     The current language could have devastating effects on the \n     work of the government to protect public health, safety and \n     security, as well as government accountability. It is \n     essential that these problems in the Homeland Security Act be \n     fixed immediately before they become too firmly entrenched in \n     the law.\n       Jean AbiNader, Managing Director, Arab American Institute.\n       Prudence S.

The ``Restoration of \n     Freedom of Information Act of 2003'' would substitute \n     bipartisan language developed last year by the Senate \n     Government Affair Committee for that which was enacted into \n     law. This bill would:\n       Clarify the FOIA exemption to be more consistent with \n     established law, while still protecting records on critical \n     infrastructure vulnerabilities submitted to the Department of \n     Homeland Security by private firms.\n       Remove the restrictions on the government's ability to act \n     as it sees fit in response to the information it receives.\n       Preserve whistleblower protections by removing unnecessary \n     criminal penalties.\n       It is important for both citizens and the government \n     process that these changes in law are made quickly.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n         American Society of Magazine Editors; American Society of \n           Newspaper Editors; Associated Press Managing Editors; \n           Freedom of Information Center, University of Missouri \n           School of Journalism; Magazine Publishers of America; \n           National Federation of Press Women; National Newspaper \n           Association; National Press Club; Newsletter & \n           Electronic Publishers Association; Newspaper \n           Association of America; Radio-Television News Directors \n           Association; Reporters Committee for Freedom of the \n           Press; Society of Professional Journalists.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                            Let Freedom Ring\n\n                        (By Maurice J. Freedman)\n\n       What if you want to find out if toxic chemicals are buried \n     under your child's schoolyard? How could you tell if your \n     veterans' benefits hinged on proving you were exposed to \n     biohazards during a top-secret mission? Or perhaps a \n     candidate for your city council wants to better understand \n     formerly classified plans for emergency evacuation.\n       These days, it's possible, with considerable patience, \n     determination, and a few clicks of a mouse, to file a request \n     for answers to questions like these and a broad range of \n     government information that are critical to our lives, work, \n     health and well being.\n       But like registering to vote, in some places and for some \n     people, this precious freedom hasn't always been so easy to \n     exercise.\n       The main tool for such fact-finding, the Freedom of \n     Information Act, known as FOIA, which we honor each year on \n     the anniversary of James Madison's birthday, was first \n     enacted on July 4, 1966. Before that, any-one who wanted to \n     get records from the federal government had to establish his \n     or her legal right to examine those records. That was \n     expensive, time-consuming and a barrier for countless \n     legitimate requests for information on issues from whether \n     the nuclear reactor downwind had a record of safety \n     violations to how the Nixon administration tried to deport \n     John Lennon as detailed in his FBI files.\n       With FOIA, the burden shifted to government agencies, \n     requiring them to meet these requests unless they fell within \n     a handful of specific national security exemptions. Indeed, \n     since then, any decision by an agency to withhold a document \n     could be challenged in federal court.\n       From John Lennon's or Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s FBI \n     files to record of debates on whether to use nuclear weapons \n     in Vietnam, FOIA requests now run the gamut of what we need \n     to know about what our government is doing with our tax \n     dollars in our name. Whether it's internal NASA memos about \n     space shuttle safety or exchanges among federal officials \n     about Japanese internment camps during World War II, our \n     right to know about the deliberations and actions of our \n     federal government is a cornerstone of American democracy.\n       In 1974, in reaction to Watergate, Congress moved to \n     strengthen FOIA. Unwilling to let our country be run more \n     like a closed corporation than an open, democratic society, \n     this change allowed courts to order the release of documents, \n     even when the President said they couldn't be made public.\n       Our system of representative democracy depends on the free \n     flow of information produced, collected and published by our \n     government and available to the public so we can participate \n     as an informed electorate.\n       Since the early 19th century, libraries have served as \n     depositories for the written record of our nation's \n     development and gateways to the decisions of its leaders, \n     thus assuring public access to government information. Today, \n     21st-century librarians are committed to ensuring the \n     public's right to know is protected in the electronic age. As \n     organizers, navigators and providers of government \n     information that serves the public, we help file FOIA \n     requests and otherwise support freedom of information @ your \n     library.\n       Many Americans depend on access to information collected, \n     organized and disseminated by the federal government--from \n     farmers and health care professionals, to journalists and \n     veterans, community interest groups to local and state \n     government officials, and indeed, all voters.\n       Americans come to libraries to find Census and other \n     statistics; to help plan new business and marketing \n     strategies; to research environmental issues and hazards, \n     laws and regulations; and to learn about job opportunities \n     from government and other employment lists.\n       The ongoing transition to predominantly electronic \n     transmission of federal information offers both promise and \n     problems for the public in this realm. Information that is \n     only in electronic form quickly appears on--and as quickly \n     disappears from--Web sites. There is often no one charged \n     with capturing, preserving or making electronic data \n     available to future generations, as well as those, who for a \n     variety of reasons, cannot access or work with electronic \n     information.\n       True national security is built on a vibrant democracy and \n     a well-informed citizenry, not a culture of secrecy. Said \n     James Madison, on whose birthday we make Freedom of \n     Information Day, ``Knowledge will forever govern ignorance, \n     and a people who mean to be their own governors must arm \n     themselves with the power which knowledge gives.'' Although \n     he wrote in response to abuses by Britain's King George III, \n     his warnings ring equally true today.\n       Every country has hospitals, police and schools. But only \n     free countries allow the free flow of ideas. Free libraries \n     are the hub of public access to government information. \n     Challenges to an informed citizenry range from the complexity \n     and inequality in information technology to illiteracy, \n     limited information literacy skills and unequal access to \n     education and information resources.\n       Thankful for our freedoms, we must do our best as we \n     prepare to fight halfway around the world to ensure that we \n     continue to guard with unrelating vigilance the right to know \n     here at home.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I join with Senators Leahy, Byrd, \nJeffords, and Lieberman to introduce the Restore Freedom of Information \nAct, Restore FOIA, that will provide the public with access to \ninformation, while at the same time ensuring that information \nvoluntarily submitted to the government by companies is not improperly \ndisclosed. In order to ensure public access and limit improper \ndisclosure, we need to reexamine some aspects of the Homeland Security \nAct, HSA, which was rushed through Congress last year, dropping several \ncarefully-crafted, bipartisan measures which had been adopted by the \nSenate Governmental Affairs Committee, along the way. Dropping those \nmeasures left ambiguities in the law that need to be clarified, and \ntoday's bill is an attempt to make those clarifications and address \ncertain problems that could otherwise result.\n  The issue this bill addresses is public access to information in the \npossession of the Homeland Security Department. Although some seem to \nwant to shroud all homeland security efforts in secrecy, as Judge Damon \nKeith, writing for the U.S. Sixth Circuit of Appeals, recently warned \n``Democracies die behind closed doors.'' The principles of open \ngovernment and the public's right to know are cornerstones of our \ndemocracy. We cannot sacrifice those principles in the name of \nprotecting them.\n  One of the reasons that I voted against the Homeland Security Act \nlast year was because the final bill dropped a bipartisan provision, \npassed by the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, clarifying how the \nnew Department of Homeland Security, DHS, should comply with the \nFreedom of Information Act, FOIA. The final bill substituted a poorly \ndrafted provision that could inappropriately close the door on persons \nseeking unclassified information from the Department related to \ncritical infrastructure.\n  What is critical infrastructure? Critical infrastructure is the \nbackbone that holds our country together and\n\n[[Page S3638]]\n\nmakes it work--our roads, computer grids, telephones, pipelines, water \ntreatment plants, utilities, and other facilities essential to a fully \nfunctioning Nation. It so happens that, in the United States, much of \nour critical infrastructure is controlled by private entities, often \nprivately owned or publicly traded corporations. To strengthen existing \nprotections for these facilities, the Federal Government asked the \ncompanies that own them to submit unclassified information about their \nfacilities to assist the government in evaluating them, identifying \npossible problems, and designing stronger protections from terrorist \nattack, natural disasters, or other threats to homeland security.\n  Some companies asked to voluntarily submit this information feared \nthat it might be improperly disclosed, and sought a new exemption from \nthe Federal Freedom of Information Act, FOIA, to prohibit disclosure of \nso-called ``critical infrastructure information.'' Reporters, public \ninterest groups, and others feared that, if this FOIA exemption were \ngranted, companies could send important environmental and safety \ninformation to DHS under the general heading of ``critical \ninfrastructure information'' and thereby put this information out of \nthe public's reach. To bring these sides together, last July, Senators \nBennett, Leahy and I worked out a bipartisan FOIA compromise that \ncodified existing case law with regard to companies voluntarily \nsubmitting information. At the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee \nmark-up of the homeland security legislation, Senator Bennett said that \nthe Administration supported our compromise, but the language was \nultimately dropped from the final Homeland Security Act. As a result, \nthe media, public interest groups, and others continue to fear that \ncompanies may be hiding important health and safety information that \nhas long been public and should be public behind the mask of ``critical \ninfrastructure.''\n  To rectify this situation, today we are introducing a bill that would \nchange the existing HSA language in several important ways. First, our \nbill defines the key term, ``critical infrastructure,'' in a more \nfocused way than the overly broad language in the HSA. To do that, our \nbill draws from language in existing case law, that has already been \ntested by the courts. The existing HSA language, it interpreted \nbroadly, could expand the prohibition on disclosing critical \ninfrastructure information to include virtually every aspect of a \ncompany's operations, denying public access to a great deal of health \nand safety information that the public has a right to know. If this \nexpansive interpretation was not the intent of the bill's drafters, \nthen they should be willing to accept our court-tested language.\n  A second important change that our bill would make in the existing \nHSA involves the issue of civil immunity for companies that violate the \nlaw. As currently worded, the HSA seems to suggest that companies \nwhich voluntarily submit to DHS critical infrastructure information \nindicating that the company is in violation of public health or safety \nregulations may gain protection from legal action in court to halt or \npenalize this wrongdoing, even if the information shows that the \ncompany is acting negligently. For example, the current HSA provisions \ncould lead to the disturbing situation where DHS learns, through a \ncritical infrastructure submission, that a company is leaking polluted \nsludge into a nearby waterway in violation of environmental \nrestrictions, but is barred from going to court to stop the pollution \nbecause the law appears to prohibit the agency's use of the critical \ninfrastructure information in a civil action. Our bill would eliminate \nthe possibility that the HSA would provide companies with civil \nimmunity under these circumstances.\n\n  A third key problem with the existing HSA language is that it \nincludes a provision that could send a Federal whistleblower who \ndiscloses critical infrastructure information, even to an appropriate \nauthority, to prison. The language is clear that if a DHS employee \ndiscloses unclassified critical infrastructure information, even when \nacting as a whistleblower who reveals the information to Congress in an \nact of conscience or patriotism, that whistleblower could wind up in \njail. My colleague, Senator Leahy, describes a whistleblower who works \nat the FAA who blew the whistle on government collusion to coverup \nfailures by airlines to meet tests on airline preparedness. That \nwhistleblower could have ended up in jail had he blown the whistle \nunder today's law. A year in jail is quite a deterrent for a Federal \nemployee who is thinking about blowing the whistle, and we have never \nbefore threatened Federal whistleblowers with jail terms. It is a bad \nidea, and it is counterproductive to homeland safety.\n  There are other troubling provisions in the current HSA law as well, \nequally detrimental to the public's right to know. For example, the HSA \nexempts all communication of critical infrastructure information from \nthe open meeting and other sunshine requirements of the Federal \nAdvisory Committee Act, and places critical infrastructure information \noutside restrictions on ex parte contacts. The HSA also pre-empts state \nand local sunshine laws, an undue intrusion on the power of the States. \nThe bill we are introducing today would strike all of these unnecessary \nprovisions, and create in their stead a narrow FOIA exemption that \nbalances the prohibition against improper disclosures of critical \ninfrastructure information with the public's right to know.\n  Finally, I would like to include in the Record two examples of \nsituations that could occur under the language in the HSA but would not \noccur under our bill. These disturbing examples were provided by Dr. \nRena Steinzor, Professor at the University of Maryland School of Law, \non behalf of the center for Progressive Regulation.\n  Case Study Number 1 is the following:\n  A large Midwest utility decides to replace an old coal burning \nelectric generation unit with a new one. The new unit, much larger than \nthe first, will produce significantly greater air pollution emissions. \nThe company could mitigate these increases by installing additional \npollution control equipment, but decides it does not wish to incur the \nexpense. It begins construction and simultaneously reports its plans to \nthe DHS as ``critical infrastructure information,'' so Federal security \nexperts will know about its increased capacity to generate electricity.\n  A Department of Homeland Security employee, visiting the plant to \nconsult on government purchases of power during emergency situations, \nnotices readings on internal gauges reflecting the dramatically \nincreased emissions. She telephones EPA to report the situation. EPA \nissues a Notice of Violation to the company, and threatens to bring an \naction for civil penalties, but is instructed to desist by DHS \nofficials who inform EPA that the HSA prohibits disclosing the \ninformation provided to the agency in court and that DHS wants to list \nthe company as an emergency supplier capable of providing expanded \nelectricity production in an upcoming report to Congress. EPA drops its \nenforcement action, and the DHS employee not only loses her job but \nalso is prosecuted criminally.\n  Case Study Number 2 is the following:\n  Lobbyists representing companies that provide goods and services to \nthe Department of Homeland Security routinely submit materials \ndescribing their companies' products in glowing terms. They arrange \nrepeated trips for government purchasing agents to exotic locations \nunder the guise of briefing them regarding the technical aspects of the \nproducts. All of this information is designated as critical \ninfrastructure by the companies, and is therefore protected from \ndisclosure and oversight by the media or possibly even individual \nmembers of Congress who could see the information but not reveal it.\n  The Homeland Security Act was never intended to protect polluters or \nspecial interests from public scrutiny. But as these examples \ndemonstrate, that is exactly what could happen if the current, vague \nlanguage in the law is not corrected. The bill we are introducing today \nwould make the needed corrections.\n  On January 17, 2003 at his confirmation hearing before the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, I questioned Governor Ridge about these \nproblems with the current wording of the Homeland\n\n[[Page S3639]]\n\nSecurity Act. I asked him whether the HSA could have the unintended \nconsequences of providing protections for wrongdoing while impeding \naccess to necessary information to protect public health and safety. \nGovernor Ridge replied: ``[T]hat certainly wasn't the intent, I am \nsure, of those who advocated the Freedom of Information Act exemption, \nto give wrongdoers protection or to protect illegal activity, and I \nwill certainly work with you to clarify that language.'' If that was \nnot the intent, then let us fix the vague, and potentially dangerous \nprovisions that are in this bill.\n  I would also note, for the record, that many organizations have \nendorsed our bill including the following:\n  American Association of Law Libraries, American Civil Liberties \nUnion, American Immigration Lawyers Association, American Library \nAssociation, American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, Americans for \nDemocratic Action, American Society of Magazine Editors, American \nSociety of Newspaper Editors, Arab American Institute, Asian American \nLegal Defense and Education Fund, Associated Press Managing Editors, \nAssociation of Research Libraries, Center for Democracy and Technology, \nChildren's Environmental Health Network, Clean Production Network, \nCommon Cause, Communications Workers of America, Cook Inlet Keeper, \nCouncil on American-Islamic Relations, Council on Professional \nAssociation of Federal Statistics, Electronic Frontier Foundation, \nElectronic Privacy Information Center, Environmental Defense, \nFederation of American Scientists, Freedom of Information Center, \nFriends of the Earth, Fund for Constitutional Government, Government \nAccountability Project, Greenpeace, Magazine Publishers of America, \nMaryland Pesticide Network, National Federation of Press Women, \nNational Newspaper Association, National Press Club, Natural Resources \nDefense Council, New Jersey Work Environment Council, Newsletter & \nElectronic Publishers Association, Newspaper Association of America, \nOhio Valley Environmental Coalition, OMB Watch, Pesticide Action \nNetwork, North America Powder River Basin Resource Council, Privacy \nActivism, Privacy Times, Project on Government Oversight, Radio-\nTelevision News Directors Association, Reporters Committee for Freedom \nof the Press, Sierra Club, Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition, Society of \nProfessional Journalists, Strategic Counsel on Corporate \nAccountability, U.S. Public Interest Research Group, University of \nMissouri School of Journalism, West Harlem Environmental Action Working \nGroup on Community Right-to-Know.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/12/senate-section/article/S3639-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3639]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 81--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING THE \n CONTINUOUS REPRESSION OF FREEDOMS WITHIN IRAN AND OF INDIVIDUAL HUMAN \n            RIGHTS ABUSES, PARTICULARLY WITH REGARD TO WOMEN\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Coleman, and Mr. Cornyn, \nand Mr. Campbell) submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                               S.

Res. 46\n\n       Whereas the Civilian Conservation Corps, commonly known as \n     the CCC, was an independent Federal agency that deserves \n     recognition for its lasting contribution to natural resources \n     conservation and infrastructure improvements on public lands \n     in the United States and for its outstanding success in \n     providing employment and training to thousands of Americans;\n       Whereas March 31, 2003, is the 70th anniversary of the \n     signing by President Franklin D.

Res. 78\n\n       Whereas the ancient Greeks developed the concept of \n     democracy, in which the supreme power to govern was vested in \n     the people;\n       Whereas the Founding Fathers of the United States drew \n     heavily on the political experience and philosophy of ancient \n     Greece in forming our representative democracy;\n       Whereas Greek Commander in Chief Petros Mavromichalis, a \n     founder of the modern Greek state, said to the citizens of \n     the United States in 1821, ``it is in your land that liberty \n     has fixed her abode and . . . in imitating you, we shall \n     imitate our ancestors and be thought worthy of them if we \n     succeed in resembling you'';\n       Whereas Greece is 1 of only 3 nations in the world, beyond \n     the former British Empire, that has been allied with the \n     United States in every major international conflict for more \n     than 100 years;\n       Whereas Greece played a major role in the World War II \n     struggle to protect freedom and democracy through such \n     bravery as was shown in the historic Battle of Crete and in \n     presenting the Axis land war with its first major setback, \n     setting off a chain of events that significantly affected the \n     outcome of World War II;\n       Whereas the price for Greece in holding our common values \n     in their region was high, as hundreds of thousands of \n     civilians were killed in Greece during the World War II \n     period;\n       Whereas President George W. Bush, in recognizing Greek \n     Independence Day on March 25, 2002, said, ``Greece and \n     America have been firm allies in the great struggles for \n     liberty.

Mr. President, I just want to make a few additional \ncomments before we wrap up on this debate. As I said earlier, this has \nbeen 7 years in the making, to take a bill that was conceived not by me \nbut by Charles Canady over in the House of Representatives, who is now \na Federal judge, I believe, and others here in the Senate. Senator Bob \nSmith from New Hampshire was one of the original leaders on this issue \nin the Senate. I know he will feel very good about passage of this \nlegislation. It has been a long time coming. And a lot of effort has \nbeen put behind this measure by many Members. We have accomplished \nsomething that I think is really important.\n  People have said this is not going to stop any abortions. That may be \nthe case. People have said this procedure is very rare. Well, I would \nargue that several thousand abortions a year, several thousand children \nbeing put through this brutality--I will, first, not classify thousands \nas rare--and as the Senator from Minnesota so eloquently said earlier \ntoday, even one should cause this Senate to stand up and say no.\n  This is a procedure that has no place in medicine, has no place in \nthe legal behavior of anybody here in the United States of America.\n  We had a good debate today. We were able to defeat some amendments \nthat were very much aimed at eliminating this ban, wiping the \nunderlying bill out and replacing it with some language that would \nhave, frankly, done little to nothing.\n  I thank all of my colleagues for standing up and sticking with this \nunderlying bill, defeating amendments which I know in some cases were \nvery difficult votes for Members. They came through, and we were able \nto get decisive votes.\n  We have had this partial-birth abortion debate so often, and it is \nour fifth time, unfortunately, we have had to be here on the floor of \nthe Senate. But we also had a good debate on the whole underlying issue \nof Roe v. Wade.\n  While I was disappointed that the sense of the Senate passed, with, I \nbelieve, 52 positive votes here in the Senate affirming Roe v. Wade, I \nhope those who had an opportunity to listen to the debate today--for \nthose who did not, I encourage them to pick up the Record because I \nthink both sides of the aisle laid out their case. They laid out their \ncase as to why this judicial decision is a good thing for America, as a \ncountry, and for the people--those who are for it. And those who are \nagainst it laid out a good argument, I would argue a compelling one, \nsince I was one of the ones making it, that Roe v. Wade is not a good \nthing for this country. It is damaging to our culture, to the spirit of \nAmerica.\n  I just want to reiterate why I feel so strongly about that. Because, \nas you noticed in the Senate, even during that debate, as heated as it \nwas, you did not have a whole lot of people coming down here to engage \nin that debate.\n  It is the great moral issue of the day. There is no other issue that \nfires passion in people like this one, and it has for decades. It has \nbeen 30 years since the Supreme Court grabbed from the people the \ndecision to determine what the collective morality of this country is \nwith respect to the sanctity of human life in the womb. The Supreme \nCourt took that decision from the people, and did it through \nlegislating in a judicial decision.\n  Now, I would argue that irrespective of your position on abortion, as \nfree people, we fought a revolution about those people taking rights \nfrom us or taking decisions from us, people who are not elected, who \nare not subject to the will of the voter. And that is what the U.S. \nSupreme Court did in 1973. They took from us, the people, the right to \ndetermine our fate, the right to determine our collective judgment, our \nmoral decision.\n\n  Some people have come up to me for years and said: You don't have the \nright to make this moral decision. My response is: Well, if I, as your \nelected representative, don't have the right, what gives the right to \nnine unelected judges to make this decision for you?\n  This is a representative democracy. You elect people to make \ndecisions for the collective whole. That is how the system works. And \nwhat judges are there to do is to determine whether they are within the \nconstitutional framework. They are not to use, as a flimsy excuse, the \nConstitution to create legislation. That is the constitutional \namendment process.\n  If you want to create a new right, pass a constitutional amendment. \nYou don't create new rights by someone coming on a court and saying: \nHey, I found a new right. That is exactly what the U.S. Supreme Court \ndid in Roe v. Wade. They found a new right that for centuries--roughly \ntwo centuries--had not been found by some of the smartest men we have \nhad in this country, some of the best and brightest.\n  Lawyers and nonlawyers in this country have served on the U.S. \nSupreme Court, and for all that time they\n\n[[Page S3645]]\n\ncould not find this right. But in 1973, seven Justices--seven men--I \nhear so often: Well, why are you men making these decisions--seven men \non the U.S. Supreme Court found a right.\n  They found a right that was not written in this Constitution. I don't \nthink anyone will make the comment that the right to an abortion is \nwritten in the black letters of the Constitution. It is not.\n  So where did this right spring from? Where did this right emerge \nfrom? It emerged from the liberty clause of the 14th amendment--\nindividual liberty. The Senator from Iowa read a subsequent case, \nabortion case, the Casey decision. The Casey decision was about the \nPennsylvania Abortion Control Act signed by a Democrat, Robert Casey, \nwho I had a great amount of respect for, his willingness to stand up to \nhis party and do what he believed was truly the legacy of his party, to \nlook out for those who are the least fortunate among us or have the \nleast power among us. That is what the Governor used to say over and \nover.\n  He passed a bill through the Pennsylvania legislature and signed this \nbill to put ``restrictions'' on abortion, horrible things like parental \nconsent. That means when a minor wants to have an abortion, the parent \nhas to consent because it is a minor child; or parental notification, \nwhich is what is sort of the lay of the land today, we passed parental \nnotification statutes. But there was a whole variety of things: 24-hour \nwaiting period, informed consent. There were a bunch of things in this \nact.\n  The Supreme Court, in making this decision, it was really remarkable. \nThey came up with this language, really chilling language for society. \nIt is language that says the heart of liberty is man's right to \ndetermine the meaning of life, of the universe. It is the essence of \nliberty, they said. It is one person's right to define for themselves \nlife and liberty and the universe and the world.\n  I have to say our Founding Fathers could not have thought that. Those \nwho passed the 14th amendment were not our Founding Fathers, but those \nwho passed the 14th amendment, I just don't believe they thought every \nsingle person in America had a right to define their own existence. And \nthat was part of it--what their own existence meant, what the universe \nmeant, what liberty and life meant. If we all go around deciding what \nwe believe is right or wrong and what is fair or not fair, if we all \nhave our own moral code and we are not responsible for anybody else, \nthat is chaos. That is simply my ability to impose my will on you and \nright makes right. The strongest prevail. That is not what they had in \nmind. I am sure of that.\n  That is where the line of cases after Roe v. Wade has taken us. It \nhas taken us down a road where it is just positivism. It is my ability \nto be able to put my will on you. That is why I referred to the two \nkillers from Columbine who said: I am the law. Where do you think they \ngot that? Where do you think that came from? It came from the U.S. \nSupreme Court because that is what the Supreme Court says, that you are \nthe law. You can define your own existence. You can define your own \nuniverse. That is the essential meaning of liberty. That wasn't in a \ndissenting opinion or a concurring. It was in the main body of the \nopinion.\n  So liberty, twisted and tangled beyond recognition in the abortion \ncases, twisted and tangled so much by the 1973 Roe case. Because what \nthey did with liberty, a very important right, one of the fundamental \nrights, but our Founders knew it was not the most important right. \nBecause when our Founders put together our original documents, they \nsaid we are endowed by our Creator, not the Supreme Court, not the \nCongress, but by our Creator, with certain inalienable rights. And then \nthey listed them. They listed them deliberately in order. Life was \nfirst. Liberty was second. The pursuit of happiness was third.\n\n  Why did they order them in such fashion? Was it just because it \nsounded better? Life, liberty, pursuit of happiness sounds better than \nliberty, life, pursuit of happiness?\n  No, they ordered these rights because one flows from the other. You \ncan't have happiness without freedom, without liberty, without true \nliberty. You cannot pursue happiness, you are not free to pursue your \nhappiness. Happiness doesn't mean doing something that makes you feel \ngood. It means living your life in a way that is fulfilling, \npurposeful. I would argue, the way God meant you to live your life--in \nservice. That is the happiness they envisioned.\n  It wasn't my ability to dominate you or to impose my will on you. \nThat is not the liberty they are talking about. That is certainly not \nthe happiness. You have to have freedom to have happiness. And, of \ncourse, you must have life to be free. If you don't have life, having \nliberty means nothing. So they ordered these rights.\n  And what does Roe v. Wade do? Roe v. Wade takes those ordered rights \nand flips them. We have so contorted liberty in the line of abortion \ncases, we have so destroyed the essence of what the amenders of the \nConstitution intended that not only does the definition of liberty \nitself strike fear and should strike fear into the heart of every law-\nabiding citizen, because under this line of cases, liberty means \nwhatever you can force on somebody else. Your opinion stands. Not only \nhave we contorted liberty, but we have now exalted liberty over life.\n  How is that true? It is true because the liberty of the person \ncarrying the child trumps the life of the child within. That is what \nhappens in abortion. The rights of the mother are supreme to the rights \nof the child throughout the term of the pregnancy. That is what Roe v. \nWade and Doe v. Bolton say. Abortions are legal in this country from \nthe time of conception to the time of separation--legal every minute, \nevery second. So the liberty rights trump the life rights.\n  I said before, there is only one other instance I am aware of in \nAmerican history where such a stark reversal of rights has been tried. \nThat was over 150 years ago in the Dred Scott case. The Supreme Court \nsaid the liberty rights of the slaveholder trump the life rights of the \nblack man or woman. The liberty rights of the slaveholder trumped the \nrights of the black man and woman. Why?\n  This may sound familiar. The black man was not considered a person \nunder the Constitution. Of course, this whole debate about Roe v. Wade \nis what? Is the child in the womb considered a person under the \nConstitution? The answer is, according to Roe v. Wade, no. It is not. \nIt does not have rights.\n  So what did Dred Scott do?\n  Dred Scott said the human being--clearly human--as the Senator from \nKansas said, William Wilberforce, when he was a Member of Parliament in \nEngland, was trying to stop the slave trade throughout the British \nEmpire and he had, I believe, Wedgewood China make a plate that was \nthen turned into a poster and distributed it throughout England and the \nworld. It was of a black man, a slave, in shackles. The inscription \naround the plate was, ``Am I not a man and a brother?''\n  So since 1973, we, too, have had our own version of that plate. \nInstead of a black man in shackles, we have an innocent child in the \nwomb, who is human--genetically human--and living; it is a human being. \nIs this child any different in the eyes of the law than the black man \nunder Dred Scott? Can he or she not also say: Am I not a child and a \nson, or a daughter, a brother, or a sister?\n  I believe the answer to that is yes. Now, I understand the \nconsequences of this. I truly do. I understand the hardship that \nrecognizing someone's right to life would impose on others. I \nunderstand the burden it puts upon women who are carrying a child they \ndon't want. I understand that. I understand this is not an easy \ndecision. I don't make this argument cavalierly, but to the extent I \ncan make it scholarly, I understand the real ramifications of this. I \nunderstand there is real human suffering. I understand, like the \nSenator from California said, these men are telling me what to do with \nmy body. I understand that feeling. I recognize it. I cannot tell you \nthe number of women who have said that to me.\n  Women have a unique gift, which is the ability to conceive. Men do \nnot have that ability. With all gifts come burdens and \nresponsibilities. I know people, in our society in particular, are not \nnecessarily comfortable with all of the burdens and responsibilities \nthat may come upon them. But we are talking about a human being, a \nhuman life. We are talking about exercising the\n\n[[Page S3646]]\n\nright of one person's liberty over another person's life, and giving \nthat person their liberty rights, total control over someone's right to \nexist. That is a big deal. It is a great gift. But with that gift is \nthis burden.\n  I make the argument that taking these liberties out of order doesn't \njust lead to this conflict that 1.3 million women will go through in \nthis country--probably many more than that will go through this \nconflict. So 1.3 million women, or more, will decide the conflict in \nfavor of their liberty rights--snuffing out the life of their unborn \nchild. Almost half of those abortions will be the second, or more, \nabortion for the woman involved.\n  I am concerned about that, but I am also concerned about what happens \ndown the road. What precedent have we set that we seem so unwilling to \noverturn, and what are the long-term consequences of that precedent? I \nuse the example of children who are victims of infanticide. The right \nof infanticide since Roe v. Wade, you would think, would have gone \ndown. That is what they said would happen. Prior to Roe v. Wade, the \nrate of infanticide was 4.3 percent. Since Roe v. Wade--in fact, within \n10 years of Roe v. Wade, the rate more than doubled. That doesn't make \nsense, does it? Roe v. Wade was supposed to end unwanted pregnancies. \nIt was supposed to stop infanticide, child abuse, spouse abuse, and \ndomestic violence. Why? Because we weren't putting this burden on \nwomen. We were removing this burden. That is what abortion is about, \nremoving a burden.\n  Then why have all of the things I have just mentioned increased since \nRoe v. Wade? Why is domestic violence going up? Why has spousal abuse \ngone up? Why has infanticide gone up? Why has divorce gone up? You can \ngo down the list. Every social indicator that abortion was to cure, \nincluding teen pregnancy, has doubled or done more since Roe v. Wade. \nWhat happened since we have lifted this burden?\n  Maybe we really didn't lift the burden. Maybe we created a whole \nother burden. Maybe--just maybe--we made a moral statement in this \ncountry. Maybe the Supreme Court made a moral statement, which is that \nthe life of a baby in the womb doesn't count; it has no legal standing. \nNow, how does something that has no legal standing, within a few \nseconds after birth, or the separation from the mother, all of a sudden \nhave full standing? Well, obviously, and unfortunately, a larger number \nof mothers don't see that transition, don't recognize the difference \nand think, well, I can kill my child in the womb if I don't want it. \nWhat is the difference? It is just a few minutes, just a few seconds. \nAnd society recognizes that it is different.\n  Look at the sentences given out to cases of infanticide, particularly \nthose immediately after birth, and cases of mothers killing their \nchildren who are 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 years of age. Look at the differences in \nsentencing. How does society view this newborn child versus the 4 and \n5-year-old child? Look at the sentence. Remember just recently, in the \nlast few years, the ``prom mom'' in I believe Delaware, and there were \na couple others that got 2 years, or 18 months, for killing their \nchildren after birth. And when one looks at other cases of mothers \ncommitting murder, killing their children, they get life imprisonment \nbecause the children are 5 or 6 years old. What is the difference? That \nis how we value these children. We cannot even bring ourselves to \nconsider the difference--even as a society, we look at a difference \nbetween a child who has no rights in the womb to one who has sort of \nquasi rights.\n\n  We have a professor at the University of Princeton, Peter Singer, \nwhom the New Yorker magazine calls the most influential living \nphilosopher. Imagine, most influential living philosopher, Peter \nSinger, Princeton University, not Podunk U but Princeton University, a \ndistinguished chair. Here is a summary of his views:\n\n       The views I put forward should be judged not by the extent \n     to which they clash with accepted moral views, but on the \n     basis of the arguments by which they are defended. Not all \n     who are biological human beings should be counted as human \n     beings.\n\n  That is what Roe v. Wade says. Roe v. Wade says not all biological \nhuman beings should be counted as human beings. That is not that far.\n\n       Some human beings are more than others.\n\n  Just that phrase reminds me of the book ``Animal Farm.''\n\n       The unborn, the newborn, the anencephalic----\n\n  Anencephalic is a child born without a brain, just a brain stem----\n\n       and those in a vegetative state, for instance, do not \n     count, or at least do not count fully as human beings.\n\n  It sort of reminds me of three-fifths of a person, not fully a human \nbeing. That is what the slave was counted as, three-fifths of a human.\n\n       The other qualifying prong of this argument is that it is \n     not rational to draw a hard and fast line between human \n     beings and other forms of animal life. To do so is an \n     instance of speciesism.\n\n  He has advocated a waiting period of 28 days after birth before \ndeciding whether a baby has rights that we have to respect. Where do \nyou think this comes from? It comes from Roe v. Wade. Why draw the line \nat birth? What is so significant about birth as to whether to give \nrights, particularly if the child, as we heard today from some of the \ndebate, has severe abnormalities? Why give this child full rights? Who \nare they to insist upon rights?\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       I should think it would be somewhat short of 1 year. But my \n     point is that it is not for me or anyone else to say.\n\n  It reminds me of the clause in the Casey decision: I am not going to \nsay what others--I just do what I want; you shouldn't tell me what to \ndo; just let me do what I want.\n\n       It should be up to the parents.\n\n  How many times have we heard this? Let the parents decide. Who are \nyou, as society, to tell a parent what to do in the case of an \nabortion? Let the parents decide. They know what is in the best \ninterests of their children.\n  He added:\n\n       It is a decision that parents should make in consultation \n     with their doctor.\n\n  Doesn't that sound familiar? You say, well, this is just some crazy \nman. New Yorker magazine, most influential living philosopher, a \nchair--a chair--at Princeton University. What does having this \nnotoriety in the media and this distinguished academic position get \nyou? Noticed. By whom? A judge. When? Maybe that is that decision of \ninfanticide. Maybe it is the next case where a child is born to a \nmother, did not know the child was disabled or deformed, and was so \nupset about it that she committed infanticide. And a judge feeling \nsympathy for the mother, as society does--it is a horribly tragic \nsituation, particularly if it is a young mother who went through a \npregnancy. And so the judge does not want to do anything to ruin this \ngirl's life. She might be from a good family. She might have a \npromising career. So why would we want to put her in jail and do \nsomething? I have to figure out a way not to impose a burden on her. \nWell, there is this distinguished chair at Princeton University; New \nYorker magazine calls him a great thinker, ahead of his time; I have an \nidea; I will say--and Peter Singer writes extensively about this--that \nit is natural for a woman to kill her child. And so they will use all \nof his writings and come up with some mumbo-jumbo decision to give \neither no sentence or a light sentence. Thus, it gets into the case \nlaw.\n\n  Initially, it will be viewed as an outlier and thrown out as a \nridiculous decision; it will be overturned. That happens with \nregularity, particularly in California in the Ninth Circuit. They are \nconstantly throwing cases out of the Ninth Circuit in the Supreme \nCourt.\n  Do not think for a minute these decisions like the Pledge of \nAllegiance case do not have the effect of a wave coming up on the sand. \nThey go back, but they keep coming back. Eventually, they wear away the \nbeach. So this will be the case here.\n  People are going to listen to this and maybe read this and say: Here \nis the Senator. It is late at night, and he is not thinking very \nclearly. I hope 30 years from now, God willing, I will still be on this \nEarth, not in the Senate Chamber, I hope. I hope I can read this \nstatement and say: Boy, you were a fool; boy, that was really a silly \nargument you made. What were you thinking?\n  I fear I will not be able to say that because our culture is so \nfixated on relieving us of all of our burdens, of resting away all of \nour responsibilities so we can pursue what makes us happy. So do not be \nsurprised that this poisonous line of cases will continue to\n\n[[Page S3647]]\n\npoison the water of this culture and will lead to things such as \npartial-birth abortion.\n  I remember during previous debate I got a letter from a man in \nEngland saying he was watching the debate and heard the Senators \ndescribing these children in utero, these deformed children and saying: \nWe need to keep partial-birth abortion available for these mothers late \nin pregnancy who find out their children are not perfect because we \nhave to give mothers the right to destroy this child who is not \nperfect, who may not live long, or may have some abnormalities that are \nproblematic. He kept hearing these cases after cases.\n  The other side does not argue that partial-birth abortion should be \nlegal for healthy mothers and healthy babies, even though that is 99 \npercent of the abortions that occur, are partial-birth abortion; 100 \npercent in Kansas.\n  What they argue is, it is the hard cases. He said: I sat there and \nlistened to Member after Member get up and describe people like me, for \nI am in a wheelchair and I have spina bifida. I am one of those cases, \nand they want to get rid of me.\n  And you say: Oh, no, abortion does not have an impact on how we view \nlife. Oh, no, we do not devalue people. The Senator from New York asked \ntoday: Is there an exception in the bill for children with fetal \nanomalies? She asked me: Does the Senator have an exception in the bill \nfor children with fetal anomalies? In other words, maybe we will sign \noff on the fact that healthy babies with healthy mothers cannot be \nkilled, but we are going to provide less legal protection for healthy \nmothers with babies who have anomalies.\n  The poison of Roe v. Wade infects us all, and the amazing thing is we \ndo not even know it. It is so part of us. We do not even realize it. It \nis that corrosive, slow effect that hardens us to life, hardens us away \nfrom any burden or sacrifice or responsibility. It is truly a poison \nthat infects us all.\n  Today, the Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, offered a letter \nfrom an obstetrician from the University of California San Francisco \nMedical Center about cases in which a partial-birth abortion was \nnecessary. I have a letter in response to that from Dr. Nathan \nHoeldtke, who is the medical director of Maternity-Fetal Medicine at \nTripler Medical Center, Honolulu, HI. Both are experts and board \ncertified in maternal-fetal medicine, the doctor whom Senator Feinstein \nquoted who proposed these cases and Dr. Hoeldtke.\n  The letter from Dr. Hoeldtke reads:\n\n       Dear Senator Santorum, I have read the letter from Dr. \n     Philip Darney addressed to Senator Feinstein regarding the \n     intact D often referred to as ``intact D'' in medical \n     terminology, procedure, partial-birth abortion, and its use \n     in his experience.\n       As a board certified practicing Obstetrician/Gynecologist \n     and Maternal-Fetal Medicine sub-specialist I have had much \n     opportunity to deal with patients in similar situations to \n     the patients in the anecdotes he has supplied.\n       In neither of the type of cases described by Dr. Darney, \n     nor in any other that I can imagine, would an intact D \n     procedure be medically necessary, nor is there any medical \n     evidence that I am aware of to demonstrate, or even suggest, \n     that an intact D is ever a safer mode of delivery for the \n     mother than other available options.\n       In the first case discussed by Dr. Darney a standard D \n     could have been performed without resorting to the techniques \n     encompassed by the intact D procedure.\n       In the second case referred to it should be made clear that \n     there is no evidence that terminating a pregnancy with \n     placenta previa and suspected placenta accreta at 22 weeks of \n     gestation will necessarily result in less significant blood \n     loss or less risk to the mother than her carrying later in \n     the pregnancy and delivering by cesarean section. There is a \n     significant risk of maternal need for a blood transfusion, or \n     even a hysterectomy, with either management. The good outcome \n     described by Dr. Darney can be accomplished at a near term \n     delivery in this kind of patient, and I have had similar \n     cases that ended happily with a healthy mother and baby. \n     Further a standard D procedure could have been performed in \n     the manner described if termination of the pregnancy at 22 \n     weeks was desired.\n       I again reiterate, and reinforce the statement made by the \n     American Medical Association at an earlier date, that an \n     intact D procedure is never medically necessary, that there \n     always is another procedure available, and there is no data \n     that an intact D provides any safety advantage whatsoever \n     to the mother.--Sincerely, Nathan Hoeldtke.\n\n  I thank the Chair, and those who are watching, for their indulgence. \nI appreciate the tremendous support of the Chair and the statement he \nmade today.\n  It is very heartening to be on the verge of passing a bill that could \nend up in law, signed by the President in very short order.\n  I gave a long talk about Roe v. Wade, but this is not an assault on \nRoe v. Wade. The point we are making is that this is actually outside \nof Roe v. Wade. The Court has foreclosed us from having a public \ndebate, in having the public and their elected representatives decide \nthe issue of abortion. They have taken it from us and have jealously \ncoveted it for 30 years. But this is an attempt to stop a brutal evil \nthat even the Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer, said her \nconstituents could not bear to watch.\n  Well, if one cannot bear to watch it, how can they say they believe \nin it? If it chills one to the bone that we do this to little children, \nhow can we allow it to be legal, to place a baby in the hands that were \ntrained to heal and kill the child in the hands of a doctor?\n  People know evil when they see it. I believe abortion is an evil. For \nthe first time in this debate, people saw the face, people saw what was \nbeing aborted. It was not a blob of tissue. It was not a group of \ncells. It was a little baby with arms and legs who wanted one thing, \nthe opportunity to live, but who was brutally denied that by the hands \nof a doctor. Hopefully today--actually, tomorrow with the vote--it will \nbe the beginning of the end of this brutal procedure.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
