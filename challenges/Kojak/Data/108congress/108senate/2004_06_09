Mr. President, I wish to make a few remarks regarding \nPresident Ronald Reagan. It was in January 1977, as Jimmy Carter \nprepared to take the oath of office as President, that Ronald Reagan \nmet with the man who would become his chief foreign policy adviser for \nthe next several years, Richard Allen.\n  The two spent several hours together discussing in detail the vast \narray of issues. As Allen recalls--and some people have heard this on \nthe news--as he has recounted it, Reagan said a whole range of \nmemorable things, but none was more profound than this:\n\n       My idea of American policy toward the Soviet Union is \n     simple and some would say simplistic. It is this: We win and \n     they lose. What do you think of that?\n\n  Ronald Reagan's words would have been shocking to the trained ears of \nany foreign policy expert of that day. The consensus was the cold war \nsimply could not be won. We could not defeat communism. That is what \npeople thought. That is what they felt. All we could do was to hope to \ncontain the Soviet Union and chip away at the fringes of its influence.\n\n[[Page S6640]]\n\n  After his meeting with Ronald Reagan, Richard Allen never looked at \nthe world in the same way. When Ronald Reagan entered the White House \nand laid out his vision for winning the cold war, America never looked \nat the world the same way. And when Ronald Reagan left the White House \nand events he helped put in motion came to pass, the world, indeed, \nwould never be the same.\n  What were the reasons for Ronald Reagan's historic foreign policy \nsuccess? How did he come to leave a more indelible mark on the world \nthan any American President since Franklin Delano Roosevelt?\n  First, Ronald Reagan believed in a strong military to defend our \nNation and to protect peace. He marshaled the resources from this body \nfor a remarkable 35-percent increase in defense spending during his \nPresidency. Critics accused Reagan of unnecessarily provoking the \nSoviet Union and putting America on a path to nuclear war. But for \nRonald Reagan, a strong national defense was an instrument for peace. \nIt was Government's first and foremost duty to its people. He knew the \nSoviet Union could not match our capacity to fund our national defense, \nand should the Soviets attempt to keep pace, as they did, the Communist \nstate would be unable to sustain itself.\n  Second, Ronald Reagan believed that America, our allies, and our \ncommon values were on that winning side of history. The destiny of \nmankind was not to live in the shadow of tyranny, dictatorship, but to \nbe guided by the light of liberty, by the light of democracy. That was \nthe destiny.\n  As Reagan said in his watershed Westminster speech:\n\n       The march of freedom and democracy . . . will leave \n     Marxism-Leninism on the ash-heap of history as it has left \n     other tyrannies which stifle the freedom and muzzle the self-\n     expression of the people.\n\n  Third, Ronald Reagan viewed the world through a lens of moral \nclarity. He believed there was right and wrong and good and evil, \nstrength and weakness, but, most importantly, he was not afraid to talk \nabout the world as he saw it or use his words to help shape the world \nin that vision.\n  He called the Soviet Union the ``evil empire.'' Why? Because the \nSoviet regime was repressive and godless and imperialist.\n  In 1987, he stood before the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin and \nchallenged the Soviet leadership:\n\n       Mr. Gorbachev, if you seek peace, if you seek prosperity \n     for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, if you seek \n     liberalization, come here to this gate. Mr. Gorbachev, open \n     this gate. Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.\n\n  Within months, the wall was torn down. The cold war was won, and the \nnew and lengthy era of peace for America and among the major powers of \nthe world was born.\n  In this week of tribute to the life of Ronald Reagan, let us remember \nthe simple ideas upon which his foreign policy was based: a strong \nmilitary as an instrument of peace; liberty and democracy as the \ndestiny of mankind; and the moral clarity to see the world as it was \nand what it should be.\n  Let us also remember that without the courage and the character of \nRonald Reagan, his ideas would have remained just ideas, and the world \nwould have remained the same.\n  As Reagan once wrote of his determination to stand up for what he \nbelieved:\n\n       But bearing what we cannot change and going on with what \n     God has given us, confident there is a destiny, somehow seems \n     to bring a reward we wouldn't exchange for any other. It \n     takes a lot of fire and heat to make a piece of steel.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/09/senate-section/article/S6640-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6640]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I join my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle in paying tribute to Ronald Reagan. As all of us who had the \nprivilege of working with him know, he brought a special grace to the \nWhite House and the country in everything he did. We often disagreed on \nspecific issues, but he had an undeniably unique capacity to inspire \nand move the Nation.\n  The warmth of his personality always shone through, and his \ninfectious optimism made us all feel that it really was ``morning in \nAmerica.'' It was impossible not to respect and admire the way he \nrevived the spirit of the Nation in that era, restored the power and \nvitality of the Presidency, and made it a vigorous and purposeful place \nof effective national and international leadership.\n  It was no coincidence that he opened his 1984 re-election campaign \nyear by citing two Democratic Presidents, John F. Kennedy and Franklin \nD. Roosevelt, in his State of the Union address. Nor was it a \ncoincidence that at the Republican Convention that year, not the \nDemocratic Convention, the band played ``Happy Days Are Here Again.''\n  He governed as a conservative Republican, often very conservative. \nBut he had a special genius for reaching out to all Americans. Somehow, \nthe hard edges of his policies always seemed smoother when he discussed \nand defended them. He was willing to step back from them when \nnecessary, such as when it proved impossible to cut taxes, increasing \nspending for defense, and balance the budget at the same time.\n  He was an intense competitor who wanted to win, not just for himself \nbut for his beliefs. But his goal was to defeat his opponents, not \ndestroy them. He taught us that even though the battle would inevitably \nresume the next morning, at the end of each day we could put aside the \ndivisions and debates. We could sit down together and laugh together, \nespecially at his endless stream of stories. He took issues seriously, \nbut he had a sense of perspective that never let him or us take \nourselves too seriously. As a leader, he was a President of large \nprinciples, not small details. Some criticized him for that, but it was \noften the source of his strength.\n  On foreign policy, he will be honored as the President who won the \ncold war, and his famous words ``Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall'' \nwill be linked in history with President Kennedy's ``Ich bin ein \nBerliner.'' He came to office convinced that we could not trust the \nCommunists, or perhaps even negotiate with them, and his commitment to \na strong national defense was never doubted by Soviet leaders.\n  But he also understood the importance of working with our allies to \nprotect our security, and he also understood the madness of ``mutually \nassured destruction.'' He had an instinct that Michail Gorbachev might \nbe different, and was quick to respond when I learned on a visit to \nMoscow in 1986 that President Gorbachev was prepared to negotiate a \nseparate arms control treaty on the critical issue of nuclear missiles, \nin Europe. The Intermediate-Range Nuclear-Force Treaty they negotiated \nthe following year eased tensions in Europe, and became the needed \nbreakthrough in U.S.-Soviet relations that made it possible to see \nlight at the end of the long dangerous tunnel of the cold war.\n  President Reagan was never afraid to be controversial, to confront \nwhen he had to, and lead where he believed. There were intense \ndisagreements with many of his policies, then and now. But beyond all \nthat was a defining reality. He came to power at a time of self-\nfulfilling pessimism, a pervasive belief that public policy could \nbarely move molehills, let alone mountains. The true achievement of the \nReagan Revolution was the renewal of America's faith in itself.\n  It was more than the fact that he was a superb communicator. Some \nattributed at least part of his success to the fact that he had been an \nactor. But his deepest convictions were matters of heart and mind and \nspirit, and on them, he was no actor at all.\n  He was very generous to the Kennedy family on many public and private \noccasions. Caroline and John went to see him in the White Hose early in \n1985 to ask if he might be willing to participate in some way in a \ndinner we were\n\n[[Page S6641]]\n\nplanning at my home in support of my brother's presidential library. He \nwas delighted to attend. ``Of course I'll help you,'' he said. ``You \ndon't have a father to help.''\n  At the dinner a few weeks later, he stood with us in the receiving \nline and shook the hand of every guest. He was quick to mention that he \nhad not supported President Kennedy in 1960. ``I was for the other \nfellow,'' he told us. ``But you know, it's true, when the battle's over \nand the ground cooled, well, it's then that you see the opposing \ngeneral's valor.''\n  He proceeded to give one of the finest tributes that my brother ever \nreceived. As he said of Jack, ``He seemed to grasp from the beginning \nthat life is one fast-moving train, and you have to jump aboard and \nhold on to your hat and relish the sweep of the winds as it rushes \nby.''\n  He summed it up by saying of my brother, ``You have to enjoy the \njourney. . . . I think that's how his country remembers him, in his \njoy, and it was a joy he knew how to communicate.'' That's how America \nremembers Ronald Reagan, too.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the memory of \nour 40th President, Ronald Wilson Reagan.\n  Mary and I have deep sadness today and we send out our heartfelt \ncondolences to Nancy and the rest of the Reagan family.\n  I didn't personally meet Ronald Reagan until 1983, but I wish I had \nknown him before.\n  I will never forget how even though we hardly knew each other, he was \nthere when I needed him.\n  This first happened when I was running for Governor of Kentucky in \n1983. To be honest, not many people were helping me. I entered the race \nlate to try to help the Republican party because we didn't have a \ncandidate. Most people either weren't very interested or weren't giving \nme much of a chance. But I called President Reagan and he helped me and \neven came out to campaign for me. I'm sure some of his advisers told \nhim not to, and told him there was nothing in it for him. But he came \nanyway.\n  At a time when not many other people believed in me, Ronald Reagan \ndid. That was very special to me personally.\n  I didn't win that race, but President Reagan's faith in me and his \nsupport transformed me from someone who had merely watched him from \nafar to an appreciative admirer.\n  He had no reason to come and assist me other than to help because of \nthe goodness in his heart.\n  I asked, and that was enough for him.\n  Later I was at the 1984 Republican Convention in Dallas when he gave \nthe great speech about believing in America and how our Nation \nsymbolized hope to the world as a shining city on the hill.\n  It was spellbinding and uplifting. Even though it was a political \nconvention, I think his message of optimism and his belief in the \ngoodness of America touched all Americans.\n  President Reagan believed in me again when I ran for Congress in \n1986. To be honest, I wasn't really interested at first in coming to \nWashington. But when Ronald Reagan and his White House turned on the \npower of persuasion, it was almost impossible to say ``no.'' And with \nRonald Reagan's support, I was fortunate enough to win and to come join \nhim as a Member of Congress for his last 2 years in office. Again, he \nbelieved in me and I've never forgotten it.\n  I attended his last two State of the Union speeches as a Member of \nthe House and they were spectacular performances.\n  I remember during his last State of the Union when he dropped a copy \nof the enormous continuing resolution spending bill Congress had passed \nin late 1987 and warned us that we'd better get our work done on time \nbecause he wouldn't sign another bill like that.\n  We knew he meant it and Congress listened and the next year we did \nget our work done on time.\n  I believe the secret to Ronald Reagan's appeal was that he had such \nstrong and profound fundamental beliefs about the role of Government \nand he was so confident in his ability to communicate those beliefs in \nsimple, but powerful ways that average Americans could understand.\n  People sensed that he was sincere in his own beliefs. They knew he \nwas comfortable in his own skin and had a clear idea of the direction \nwhere he wanted to lead the country. Because he was confident in \nhimself and believed in America and its people, the American people \nreturned that faith. They believed in him and they listened to him. \nWhen he led, they followed.\n  They followed Ronald Reagan when it came to his staunch opposition to \ntaxes.\n  They listened to him when he warned us about the evils of communism \nand asserted our moral superiority in the struggle between the East and \nthe West.\n  Many in Washington criticized him when he warned that the old Soviet \nUnion was an evil empire.\n  But Ronald Reagan understood that the Soviets were a moral threat to \nour way of life, and that we were engaged in a struggle that we had to \nwin.\n  The naysayers said Ronald Reagan was dangerous, but the American \npeople knew he was fundamentally right, and history will show him to be \na visionary who probably saved our Nation and the world.\n  Like every other President, Ronald Reagan had his critics. And he \nmade mistakes. But there is no doubt that the strong consensus among \nthe American people is that Ronald Reagan was a great President.\n  He was an unusually strong and optimistic leader that we all want to \nemulate. That's why his passing has hit so many of us so hard.\n  Even his strongest critics will tell you that they liked Ronald \nReagan the man and human being. They knew that even though he might \ndisagree with their policies that he still liked them as people and \nthat he would treat them with respect.\n  That was a hallmark of Reagan and another strength of his \nadministration--he was always a gentleman and treated others with \nrespect. He might not have won every policy and political argument, but \nhe fought cleanly and conducted himself with civility and grace.\n  In the end, I believe that few of us will see another leader the \nlikes of Ronald Reagan during our lifetime.\n  I believe that when he took office he set out to change not only the \nNation but the face of the world. That is exactly what he did.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, on the passing of former President \nReagan, my mind, like everyone else's, goes back to a personal \nexperience--not one that I had with Ronald Reagan himself because I did \nnot know him that well, but in 1976, I was being interviewed for a job \nin the Reagan campaign for President. The individual, the former \nPresident's campaign manager at the time, who was conducting the \ninterview, went through all of the specifics of the job he wanted me to \ntake. The interview went very well. I seemed to have the credentials \nthey wanted, and it was clear that a job offer was sitting there on the \ntable. But I was a little troubled, even though things were going well, \nbecause I wanted to make something very clear.\n  I did not know Ronald Reagan. I had met him, but I did not know him. \nI only knew the caricature of Reagan which was out there in the media, \nwhich was that he was a rigid, ideological, hard-line conservative who \nwould never, ever budge from an ideological position. So I said, in the \nspirit of full disclosure in this job interview, I want to make one \nthing clear. I said: I am not a true believer.\n  The individual conducting the interview smiled a little and he said: \nThat's all right, neither is the Governor.\n  That was my first glimpse into what made Ronald Reagan a truly \nsuccessful politician. He was a politician of absolutely firm resolve, \nthere is no question about that. There were things he believed and he \nbelieved with such passion that he would never, ever deviate from them. \nBut there were also some things he realized could be compromised that \ndid not require an absolute, hard-line ideological stance, and the \ngreat genius of the man is that he had the wisdom to be able to discern \nwhich issue fell into which category, which issue was one in which \nthere must be no compromise, and which issue was one where he could, in \nthe\n\n[[Page S6642]]\n\nwords of former Senator Dole, take 80 percent of the deal and be happy \nwith it. That requires a degree of wisdom and sensitivity that very few \nof us possess. Ronald Reagan possessed it, and that was the core of his \ngenius.\n  In the words of the country music song, he knew when to hold them and \nwhen to fold them.\n  On the issue of the evil empire, that was a time when he would hold \nthem. On the issue of the evil empire, he would give no quarter, and he \nwas criticized firmly for that, even within his own administration. The \nstory is told of a meeting where members of the administration were \ndiscussing how they would deal with the Soviet Union in a certain \nsituation, and after one point of view was presented President Reagan \nturned to the individual and said: If you believe that, what are you \ndoing in this administration? He was that firm in his determination \nthat the Soviet Union was, indeed, an evil empire and had to be \nconfronted as such.\n  But when the confrontation truly came and the Soviet Union found they \nwere up against an immovable object in Ronald Reagan and they began to \nmaneuver, then he could see the areas in which 80 percent was good \nenough. He could discern the difference between where he had to stand \nabsolutely firm and where he had to negotiate. He skillfully exploited \nall of those differences in such a way that the ``evil empire'' first \nceased to be evil and then ultimately ceased to be an empire.\n  I find one of the great ironies of history the fact that upon his \npassing, on the pages of the New York Times, Mikhail Gorbachev is \nquoted in praise of Ronald Reagan. The man whom Reagan outmaneuvered, \noutnegotiated, and ultimately forced from office was singing his \npraises at his passing. That is an indication of how good Ronald Reagan \nwas at the job of being President of the United States.\n  We have all talked about how optimistic he was, how filled with hope \nhe was, what a congenial fellow he was, what a great communicator he \nwas. And all of that is true and all of that is right and proper in \nthis eulogy. But we should not allow ourselves to forget in these \ndiscussions of his wonderful qualities how effective a President he \nwas. We live in Ronald Reagan's America. Indeed, we live in Ronald \nReagan's world. He is more responsible for the kind of America we have \ntoday than any other man. He is more responsible for the kind of world \nin which we live than any other man.\n  That does not mean he is solely responsible, by any means, because \nthere are many people who have affected America and have affected the \nworld for good and ill, and no one man can be solely responsible for \nwhat happened. But he is more responsible than any other individual for \nthe kind of country we have and for the kind of world in which we \nlive--and both are substantially better than that which he found when \nhe became President.\n  Let us look back for a minute at what America was like when Ronald \nReagan became President.\n  We think of the Great Depression and how devastating that was as an \neconomic event in our lives. When Ronald Reagan came to the Presidency, \nwe were in the midst of the great inflation. I remember it very \nclearly. I was delighted in that period--absolutely delighted--to be \nable to get a bank loan, so I could meet payroll in the business I was \nrunning, at an interest rate of 21 1/5 percent. I remember talking to \nmy banker who said to me, Today the Treasury auction has sold 30-year \nGovernment securities at 15 percent. It was absolutely stunning. The \ngreat inflation was destroying value, destroying confidence, and \ncreated what is the most serious recession we have had since the Great \nDepression--the double digits of the 1980s which occurred in Reagan's \nPresidency but were the consequence of the great inflation that went \nbefore. This President stood absolutely firm on his economic policy \nthat was being ridiculed, that was being castigated, that was being \nsneered at; and his message to the country was stay the course. We did \nstay the course. His party lost a lot of seats in that next election, \nbut he stood firm. Along with Paul Volcker at the Federal Reserve, they \nsqueezed inflation out of the economy, created an economic situation \nwhere today as the heirs of that enormously difficult but significant \neffort we find the time when interest rates are at their lowest in 20, \n30, or 40 years.\n  I remind people who derided Ronald Reagan as the playboy, lifeguard, \nfootball player with no intellectual base that he was the only \nPresident of the United States who had a degree in economics--classic \neconomics, Keynesian economics--and he viewed the world in Keynesian \nterms and set an economic course that produced the base of prosperity \nwe live in today. Yes, he was an optimist. Yes, he was a politician of \njoy. Yes, he was a pleasant fellow. But he was an enormously successful \nPresident in his domestic policies.\n  During his Presidency, the American economy grew as measured in terms \nof gross domestic product as much as if it had acquired the entire \neconomy of Germany. We added as much gross domestic product--that is as \nmuch output in the American economy--during the time he was President \nas the entire economy of Germany.\n  Let us not forget that contribution as we remember and properly \ncelebrate his sterling personal qualities.\n  Internationally, of course, we have talked about that. Other Senators \nhave talked about that. But let us remember once again at the time his \npolicies were very controversial, at the time his policies were derided \nby the wise men, at the time they said he was a cowboy who was going to \nset off all kinds of danger internationally, and at the end of his \nPresidency, as I say, the ``evil empire'' was no longer evil and very \nquickly it was no longer an empire. And instead of setting off \ndangerous international consequences, what he did by standing firm on \nhis resolve was transform the world by ridding it of its greatest \nthreat. That was not bad for a B actor who presumably didn't know \nanything beyond what was on those 3-by-5 cards.\n  The best summary comes from one of his staffers who wrote a book. The \nstaffer was named Dinesh D'Souza. He wrote a book called ``Reagan,'' \nand the first chapter of that book is entitled, ``The Wise Men and The \nDummy.''\n  In that chapter, D'Souza said when Reagan came to the Presidency, it \nwas widely assumed among all the liberal wise men in the country that \nhe was a dummy. The untold secret is the conservative wise men felt the \nsame way. The conservative wise men thought he won the Presidency \nbecause he was a great actor: He looks good on television, but we can't \nallow him to make any of the decisions. He is a front, and we will put \ntogether the conservative agenda. Then we will have him as our puppet \nto go out and sell it to the American people, and we will have the best \nof all possible worlds.\n  Well, as D'Souza records, at the end of the day, on every major issue \nthat came before the Reagan Presidency, it turned out the wise men were \nwrong and the dummy was right. And the dummy, because he was President \nof the United States and because he understood the proper use of power \nand he exercised it with tremendous skill, had views that prevailed, \nand we are the beneficiaries of his wisdom.\n  At this time of his passing, I do not mourn because Ronald Reagan has \nbeen released by death from a tremendously debilitating, frustrating, \nand ultimately tragic situation. Ronald Reagan is now in a better place \nthat does not require us to mourn but to rejoice. This time is a time \nto celebrate, a time to be grateful, and a time to thank Providence for \ngiving America at this time in its history this particular statesman, \nthe one who knew when to stand with absolute resolve, when to be \nwilling to make the deal, and possess the innate wisdom to know the \ndifference.\n  We live in Ronald Reagan's America. Indeed, we live in Ronald \nReagan's world, and we are all better off for that fact.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, it is a great honor for me to be a \nMember of this body at this point in history and to be able to have the \nprivilege of making a few comments on the life and career of Ronald \nReagan.\n\n[[Page S6643]]\n\n  My words are inadequate to the task. Many have spoken more eloquently \nthan I. Many have written beautifully about his life and the meaning of \nhis Presidency.\n  I will just say that I do remember being personally inspired by him. \nAs a young high school student, I came to believe Barry Goldwater would \nbe a good President. I believed that from the values he was \narticulating. I did what I could. I put a bumper sticker on my daddy's \npickup truck. Although he had never been involved in politics in any \nway, he allowed me to do that.\n  Of course, things did not go well in that election. Things were going \npoorly. But on the eve of that election, the Nation and many of the \npeople who shared those basic values about classical America, what we \nas a nation represent--limited government, individual responsibility, \npersonal freedom, a strong national defense--were electrified by a \nspeech by Ronald Reagan. I think they call it ``Rendezvous With \nDestiny.'' Some just call it ``The Speech.'' I remember it to this day.\n  After the Goldwater campaign ended--and it certainly was a major \ndefeat for him--Ronald Reagan sort of inherited the flame of classical \nAmerican values and made them the basis of his personal beliefs and his \ncampaign for the Presidency.\n  I was also later honored to be President Reagan's U.S. attorney for \nthe Southern District of Alabama. It was a Presidential appointment, \nconfirmed by the Senate. I was a U.S. attorney, and I served in that \njob as one of his lieutenants in the war on crime for the entire two \nterms of his Presidency, and, indeed, for 4 more years under former \nPresident Bush. That was a great honor for me.\n  As we talk about what President Reagan accomplished, I do want to \ntake a moment to talk about crime and drugs. Crime and drugs had been \nsurging for 20 years when President Reagan took office. The elites in \nthis country actually believed that prison was noneffective, that it \ndid not work, that it was counterproductive, that you should not put \npeople in prison, that we ought to ask how they committed the crime, \nwhat the root causes of criminal behavior were, and what we could do to \nhelp the criminal.\n  We lost sight of the victim. We lost sight of accountability. We lost \nsight of righting wrong. And it resulted in crime rates that doubled \nand tripled in the 20 years prior to President Reagan taking office.\n  Drug use had surged during the 1960s and 1970s. By the time President \nReagan took office, one-half of high school seniors in America admitted \nto having used an illegal drug in their life. That is a stunning \nnumber. That is according to a University of Michigan study.\n  Nancy Reagan began her ``Just Say No'' program. President Reagan \npassed mandatory sentencing policies. He eliminated parole and passed \nthrough the Congress the Federal Sentencing Guidelines that eliminated \nparole, had guaranteed sentences for incarceration, with many \nsubstantial sentences for serious violations of the law. I believe the \nsentencing guidelines were probably the biggest change in law \nenforcement in the history of this country since its founding.\n  The result was that drug use went down. It went down every year \nPresident Reagan was President. For 12 years it declined steadfastly. \nWe now have less than half of high school seniors who say they have \nused an illegal drug in their life. The crime rate began to fall. We \nare still seeing declines in crime. That is because we went back to the \nfundamental precepts of crime and punishment, and how you do it. Some \npeople are just dangerous. They need to be incarcerated. They need to \nbe removed from society for the protection of society.\n\n  States picked up on this. Most crimes are prosecuted in the States, \nbut that leadership of the bully pulpit by the President led to State \nreforms and crackdowns and improved capacity in prisons to deal with \nrepeat offenders. It has been a key element in the reduction of crime \nand why Americans are safer today than they were in 1980. It is \nsomething that I think we have not heard much about in the discussion \nof the accomplishments of President Reagan.\n  I was also honored to have been his nominee for a Federal judgeship. \nIt turned into a very unpleasant experience for me and my nomination \ndid not clear the Senate Judiciary Committee, of which I am now a \nmember and on which I am honored to serve. But he stood steadfastly for \nme. The fact he believed in my ability to be a Federal judge was \nsomething I cherish. And I cherish the letter he wrote me when I asked \nthat my name be withdrawn from that appointment. It is something I will \nalways cherish. It was personal and meaningful to me.\n  Ronald Reagan had a deep and fully formed philosophy about America \nand American ideals when he came to office at age 69. This is something \nthat did not come to him lightly. It was over a lifetime of evaluation. \nEven in the face of the most fierce opposition, he never wavered in \nthose beliefs. Indeed, his very life seemed to embody the highest and \nbest of American values. His very life, the way he carried himself, \nembodied American values. His courage to remain true to the highest of \nthese ideals was his greatest strength, I believe.\n  His goal was to free the greatness of individual Americans, assured \nthat their goodness and industry would lift the Nation and inspire the \nworld to freedom and progress. He believed in the individual American \ncitizen. He believed that government should allow their creativity and \nindustry to flourish, and as they flourished, and as they worked hard, \nand as they were creative, the world and America would benefit from it.\n  His courage to be true to those ideals, I believe, was his secret \nstrength. He understood that intuitively, and he remained true to it. \nHe called us, in his very special way, to the natural optimistic spirit \nof America.\n  His record of achievement was extraordinary. He led us with courage \nand steadfastness to defeat the evil empire. He cut our taxes. He \ncalled on us to renew our spiritual, moral, and family values. He said \ncriminals should be punished. He not only communicated these values \nwith words, but his actions and policies and life were dedicated to \nthat.\n  As a result of his constancy and courage to fight for these values, a \nserious period of pessimism abounding in our land at that time ended. \nThe Soviet Union collapsed. The economy began its 20 years of \nremarkable growth. Matters of faith, morality, and family were lifted \nup. The crime rate fell, and drug use fell.\n  The success of the Reagan Presidency was stunning in its scope, and \nit could not have come at a better time for the country. Like President \nWashington, President Reagan's life was given over to the country. He \nloved his country and he was selfless in his commitment to it. His \nselflessness and the purity of his principles inspired those who worked \nfor him.\n  I remember--and I will close; I know there are others who would like \nto speak--but I do remember how, as a U.S. attorney, we did not need to \nbe told in detail what the President wanted. We heard his philosophy. \nWe heard his campaign. We knew he wanted us to be more productive. We \nknew he wanted us to take charge of our governmental office and make it \nwork for the people and produce as high an output as it could possibly \nachieve. We also knew he expected us to crack down on criminals and \ncrime.\n  I think that was good leadership because all the departments of the \nGovernment understood where Reagan came from, what administration they \nwere a part of. They did not have to be instructed in detail on how to \naccomplish the goals of his administration. That was one of his great \nstrengths. The impact of it was incalculable in many ways around the \nworld.\n\n  I will just close with this story. In 1993, several years after \nPresident Reagan left office, I had the opportunity to go with a church \ngroup to Russia. It was a Methodist group. We went and stayed in a town \n5 hours from Moscow, about 40,000 people, many of whom had not seen \nAmericans before. We had a very nice time there. I stayed for a number \nof days with a Russian family.\n  The first day we got there, the Russian host's daughter was to be \nbaptized. Father Gannati was the Russian orthodox priest. He came and \nhe did a nice service, and it took some time. Then we had dinner after \nthe baptism. Father Gannati explained that just 2\n\n[[Page S6644]]\n\nyears before, he was not able to wear his robes in public. The state \ncaused him to be moved from town to town every year so that he could \nnot build bonds and roots in a given community. He could not meet the \ngovernmental leaders. They would not meet with him because they were \natheists and they would not meet with believers. So it was a very \ninteresting time.\n  He described how since then he could wear his robe, the mayor had him \ndown to meet with him the day before this event, and that he was able \nto stay and rebuild the church there that had been damaged ever since \nthe Russian revolution had occurred.\n  At the conclusion of those remarks, our host jumped up and said: I \npropose a toast to Ronald Reagan, who allowed us to believe in God \nagain. Right in the center of the evil empire, the impact Ronald Reagan \nhad to change the nature of the world in which we lived was felt in a \nvery real way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise to join other colleagues in talking \nabout President Ronald Reagan, the Great Communicator, the great \nhumanitarian.\n\n       I will lie down and bleed awhile, and then I will rise and \n     fight again.\n\n  Ronald Reagan quoted Sir Andrew Barton's words after returning home \nfrom campaigning against Gerald Ford. Poignant words for a man who just \n4 years later was elected the 40th President of the United States.\n  The Nation and the world have lost a great treasure. Ronald Reagan \nwas a master wordsmith, an international diplomat, a man whose genuine \nhumanity gave Americans and people around the world a new sense of \nself-worth. He loved America first and foremost, so we stood behind our \nleader, our captain, our coach--to win one for the Gipper.\n  Ronald Reagan held a deep devotion to principle, sought peace through \nstrength, and encouraged everyone to believe in their convictions. He \nhad a keen intellect, but he was underestimated by his critics. He \ndisarmed many naysayers with his quick wit, crooked smile, thoughtful \nwords, and a jar of jelly beans.\n  He will forever be remembered by ending the cold war. His words ``Mr. \nGorbachev, tear down this wall'' echo in our mind's eye. Known as the \nGreat Communicator, his philosophies changed the political direction \nthis country was taking. His domestic policies gave us a smaller \ngovernment rather than a larger one. These are just a handful of \nchanges that will be the legacy left by Ronald Reagan. Certainly, we \ncan all be very proud of the leadership he has given and follow the \nexample he left behind.\n\n  Beneath the steely smile, Ronald Reagan was a cowboy. Westerners \nremember Reagan for his love of horses, his Wrangler jeans, his cowboy \nhats, something we all appreciated out West. In fact, in 1968, Ronald \nReagan came to Wyoming to speak to the Wyoming Republican State \nConvention in Cheyenne. Clarence Brimmer, now a U.S. district judge in \nCheyenne, remembered the cowpoke from California who delivered a \nmotivating speech. He said recently:\n\n       He was really outstanding, not just as a speaker, but in a \n     cowboy suit he was really sharp. He wowed all the ladies.\n\n  The passing of Ronald Reagan has brought about a great deal of grief \nfor all of us in the country and throughout the world. But through his \ndignified leadership, universal diplomatic skills, and his energetic \npersona, Ronald Reagan established a legacy that will live for \ngenerations to come. We should take pride in his life, in his \naccomplishments, and recognize what he left us--the great dawning of a \nnew America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I, too, rise to join my colleagues in \nhonoring our Nation's 40th President, Ronald Reagan. It is most fitting \nand I know that I have watched, as have Americans across the country, \nas we see the stories of Ronald Reagan and his life and his \ncontributions to this country, stories coming from not only those of us \nstanding on the Senate floor but from other countries, from small \ncommunities. People are focusing on the man that was Ronald Reagan, a \ngreat leader for this country. The stories that have been told have \nbeen wide-ranging, covering President Reagan's role in the cold war, \nhis truly undying sense of optimism for the country, the discussions \nabout Reaganomics, and, of course, all those personal stories that make \nPresident Reagan so unforgettable.\n  Alaska certainly has its stories to add and to share as well. \nPresident Reagan's impact on Alaska began before he even entered the \noffice of the Presidency. In 1980, the Alaska National Interest Lands \nConservation Act, putting over 100 million acres of land under Federal \ncontrol, was pending before the Congress. With Reagan's election that \nyear, leaders in the House and Senate--at the time, both were under \nDemocratic control--knew that if they were going to get a bill signed \ninto law, it would have to be then, before President Reagan was sworn \nin, and the Act, for better or for worse, was signed into law on \nDecember 2, 1980. But President Reagan understood Alaska and Alaskans.\n  In his book, entitled ``Reagan, In His Own Hand,'' the President \nasked this very important question:\n\n       Will Alaska wind up as our biggest state, or will it be our \n     smallest state surrounded by our biggest national park?\n\n  He tried to ease the impact these land withdrawals had on Alaskans \nliving in and around the new parks and refuges. He fought for access to \nthese lands to provide for economic development, and it was his \nadministration that determined that oil drilling should be allowed in a \nsmall section of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, a debate that \ncontinues today.\n  Alaskans remembered all that President Reagan did for us in both \nPresidential elections by giving him wide and broad-based support \nthroughout the State.\n  President Reagan had the opportunity to visit Alaska several times. \nHe liked to talk about his ties to the State. He was a big fan of \nRobert Service, and one of his favorites was a poem entitled ``The \nShooting of Dan McGrew.'' It is a poem about a particular barroom \nbrawl, and most people may remember the beginning of it:\n\n       A bunch of the boys were whooping it up at the Malamute \n     Saloon.\n\n  It is a wonderful, kind of down-and-dirty, rough-and-tumble poem that \npersonified what many wanted to believe about Alaska and the last \nFrontier.\n  But President Reagan was quite fond of that. I had an opportunity \nlast night to pull out ``The Shooting Of Dan McGrew'' and read it yet \none more time, and it brought good smiles to my face.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the full \ncontents of ``The Shooting Of Dan McGrew.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       The Shooting of Dan McGrew\n\n     A bunch of the boys were whooping it up in the Malamute \n           saloon;\n     The kid that handles the music-box was hitting a jag-time \n           tune;\n     Back of the bar, in a solo game, sat Dangerous Dan McGrew,\n     And watching his luck was his light-o'-love, the lady that's \n           known as Lou.\n\n     When out of the night, which was fifty below, and into the \n           din and glare,\n     There stumbled a miner fresh from the creeks, dog-dirty, and \n           loaded for bear.\n     He looked like a man with a foot in the grave and scarcely \n           the strength of a louse,\n     Yet he tilted a poke of dust on the bar, and he called for \n           drinks for the house.\n     There was none could place the stranger's face, though we \n           searched ourselves for a clue;\n     But we drank his health, and the last to drink was Dangerous \n           Dan McGrew.\n\n     There's men that somehow just grip your eyes, and hold them \n           hard like a spell;\n     And such was he, and he looked to me like a man who had lived \n           in hell;\n     With a face most hair, and the dreary stare of a dog whose \n           day is done,\n     As he watered the green stuff in his glass, and the drops \n           fell one by one.\n     Then I got to figgering who he was, and wondering what he'd \n           to,\n     And I turned my head--and there watching him was the lady \n           that's known as Lou.\n\n     His eyes went rubbering round the room, and he seemed in a \n           kind of daze,\n     Till at last that old piano fell in the way of his wandering \n           gaze.\n     The rag-time kid was having a drink; there was no one else on \n           the stool,\n     So the stranger stumbles across the room, and flops down \n           there like a fool.\n     In a buckskin shirt that was glazed with dirt he sat, and I \n           saw him sway,\n\n[[Page S6645]]\n\n     Then he clutched the keys with his talon hands--my God! but \n           that man could play.\n\n     Were you ever out in the Great Alone, when the moon was awful \n           clear,\n     And the icy mountains hemmed you in with a silence you most \n           could hear;\n     With only the howl of a timber wolf, and you camped there in \n           the cold,\n     A half-dead thing in a stark, dead world, clean mad with the \n           muck called gold;\n     While high overhead, green, yellow, and red, the North Lights \n           swept in bars?--\n     Then you've a hunch what the music meant . . . hunger and \n           might and the stars.\n\n     And hunger not of the belly kind, that's banished with bacon \n           and beans,\n     But the gnawing hunger of lonely men for a home and all that \n           it means;\n     For a fireside far from the cares that are, four walls and a \n           roof above;\n     But oh! so cramful of cosy joy, and crowded with a woman's \n           love--\n     A woman dearer than all the world, and true as Heaven is \n           true--\n     (God! how ghastly she looks through her rouge,--the lady \n           that's known as Lou.)\n\n     Then on a sudden the music changed, so soft that you scarce \n           could hear;\n     But you felt that your life had been looted clean of all that \n           it once held dear;\n     That someone had stolen the woman you loved; that her love \n           was a devil's lie;\n     That your guts were gone, and the best for you was to crawl \n           away and die.\n     'Twas the crowning cry of a heart's despair, and it thrilled \n           you through and through--\n     ``I guess I'll make it a spread misere,'' said Dangerous Dan \n           McGrew.\n\n     The music almost dies away . . . then it burst like a pent-up \n           flood;\n     And it seemed to say, ``Repay, repay,'' and my eyes were \n           blind with blood.\n     The thought came back of an ancient wrong, and it stung like \n           a frozen lash,\n     And the lust awoke to kill, to kill . . . then the music \n           stopped with a crash,\n     And the stranger turned, and his eyes they burned in a most \n           peculiar way;\n\n     In a buckskin shirt that was glazed with dirt he sat, and I \n           saw him sway;\n     Then his lips went in in a kind of grin, and he spoke, and \n           his voice was calm,\n     And ``Boys,'' says he, ``you don't know me, and none of you \n           care a damn;\n     But I want to state, and my words are straight, and I'll bet \n           my poke they're true,\n     That one of you is a hound of hell . . . and that one is \n           Dangerous Dan McGrew.''\n\n     Then I ducked my head and the lights went out, and two guns \n           blazed in the dark;\n     And a woman screamed, and the light went up, and two men lay \n           stiff and stark.\n     Pitched on his head, and pumped full of lead, was Dangerous \n           Dan McGrew.\n     While the man from the creeks lay clutched to the breast of \n           the lady that's known as Lou.\n\n     These are the simple facts of the case, and I guess I ought \n           to know.\n     They say that the stranger was crazed with ``hooch,'' and I'm \n           not denying it's so.\n     I'm not so wise as the lawyer guys, but strictly between us \n           two--\n     The woman that kissed him and--pinched his poke--was the lady \n           known as Lou.\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I have a wonderful personal anecdote about President \nReagan. He visited Fairbanks, Alaska, in 1984. It was a monumental \nvisit because he joined Pope John Paul II in Fairbanks for a summit \nthere. The President and Nancy Reagan arrived in Fairbanks on their way \nback from China. The following day, the Pope was arriving on his way to \nKorea. As we do in Alaska, we can facilitate great unions because of \nour strategic location at the top of the globe. So they were able to \nmeet at the Fairbanks International Airport.\n  During his stopover in Fairbanks, the President spent his time at my \nparent's home out on the Chena River. They were there for a couple of \ndays. It would not be much of a story except that the home was brand \nspanking new. It had not yet been furnished. So in an effort to make \nsure the President and Mrs. Reagan were comfortable, the community \nliterally furnished the home, complete with very fine Alaskan artwork. \nIt was perhaps a showcase home for a couple of days. Everything from \nthe city's artwork to the china ultimately had to be returned to \nwherever it came from. The community went all out for the President and \nMrs. Reagan.\n  Because this was a new house, there were some kinks that still needed \nto be worked out, specifically the water. It didn't have hot water. \nApparently, after a long flight, it is quite nice to stop and take a \nshower, or perhaps Mrs. Reagan needed a warm bath. But there was no hot \nwater. A call was made to then-Senator Murkowski at about 3 a.m. asking \nhow come there was no hot water. As the story goes, the President and \nmy father were wandering around outside trying to figure out how to \nmake the hot water come on. They learned you had to keep the water \nrunning for a while. That was the way President Reagan was. He was \nwilling to go out and try to be helpful and fix the problem. He was a \nman who wanted to make things work, to cut through the redtape and \nbureaucracy, reduce the size of Government, and a man who was not \nafraid to stand up and promote his vision for America, but also knowing \nwhen it was time to compromise on issues. He was an individual who \ntruly made America feel good about itself again.\n  I will close by reading a quote from Ronald Reagan during his speech \nat the 1992 National Republican Convention. I feel it is truly a \nfitting reminder of this great man's legacy. I read as follows:\n\n       My fellow citizens--those of you here in this hall and \n     those of you at home--I want you to know that I have always \n     had the highest respect for you, for your common sense and \n     intelligence, and for your decency. I have always believed in \n     you and in what you could accomplish for yourselves and for \n     others.\n       And whatever else history may say about me when I'm gone, I \n     hope it will record that I appealed to your best hopes, not \n     your worst fears, to your confidence rather than your doubts. \n     My dream is that you will travel the road ahead with \n     liberty's lamp guiding your steps and opportunity's arms \n     steadying your way.\n       My fondest hope for each one of you--and especially for the \n     young people here--is that you will love your country, not \n     for her power or wealth, but for her selflessness and her \n     idealism. May each of you have the heart to conceive, the \n     understanding to direct, and the hand to execute works that \n     will make the world a little better for your having been \n     here.\n       May all of you as Americans never forget your heroic \n     origins, never fail to seek divine guidance, and never lose \n     your natural, God-given optimism.\n       And finally, my fellow Americans, may every dawn be a great \n     new beginning for America and every evening bring us closer \n     to that shining city upon a hill.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n\n                Unanimous Consent Agreement--S. Res. 374\n\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, on behalf of the leader, I ask unanimous \nconsent that following the scheduled vote, the Senate proceed to a \nsecond resolution, which is at the desk, and further that the \nresolution and preamble be agreed to, with the motion to reconsider \nlaid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, it is an honor for me to join the Senate \nin honoring the memory and celebrating the life of Ronald Reagan. I \nwant to say, first of all, how much I have appreciated the eloquence \nand the personal memories that have been offered on the Senate floor \nand in public by those who knew and remembered President Reagan. I, of \ncourse, remember him. I didn't know him personally.\n  I also want to say how much especially I have appreciated the grace \nand the charity shown to the former President by those here who were, \nwhen he was in office, his political opponents. I think it is a great \ntestimony to their charity of spirit that they have done so and also a \ncomment on how our system operates in times such as this. We can \nremember and appreciate a person for his good qualities without \nnecessarily having to retreat from any disagreements we may have had \nwith that person over political issues.\n  I am reminded of what Winston Churchill said on a similar occasion \nwhen he was offering remembrances of a colleague who had died, with \nwhom he had had many differences. He said:\n\n       The fierce and bitter controversies which hung around him \n     in recent times were hushed by the news of his illness and \n     are silenced by his death. In paying a tribute of respect and \n     of regard to an eminent man who has been taken from us, no \n     one is obliged to alter the opinions which he has formed or \n     expressed upon issues which have become a part of history; \n     but at the Lychgate, we may all pass our own conduct and our \n     own judgments under a searching review. It's not given to \n     human beings, happily for them for otherwise life would be \n     intolerable, to foresee or to predict to any large extent the \n     unfolding course of events. In one phase men seem to have \n     been right, in another they seem to have been wrong. Then \n     again, a few years later, when the perspective of time has \n     lengthened, all stands in a different setting. There is a new \n     proportion. There is another scale of values. History with \n     its flickering lamp stumbles along the trail of the past, \n     trying to reconstruct its scenes, to revive its echoes, and \n     kindle with pale gleams the passion of former days. What is \n     the worth of all\n\n[[Page S6646]]\n\n     this? The only guide to a man is his conscience; the only \n     shield to his memory is the rectitude and sincerity of his \n     actions. It is very imprudent to walk through life without \n     this shield, because we are so often mocked by the failure of \n     our hopes and the upsetting of our calculations; but with \n     this shield, however the fates may play, we march always in \n     the ranks of honour.\n\n  I stand here for a few minutes to remember a man who always marched \nin the ranks of honor and whose shield was the sincerity and rectitude \nof his actions at all times. He was not a mentor, because I did not \nknow him personally, but he was a hero of mine.\n  Much has been said in the last few days about his humor and \namiability. I agree that was a very important part of Ronald Reagan, of \nwho he was and of his success. When I think of him, when I visualize \nhim, I visualize him smiling, telling a joke, or offering some \nwitticism or some piece of humor. I think that was a big part of his \nsuccess.\n  It is important not to take yourself too seriously. That is a quality \nthat often is lacking in this town. I think I can say that without \nbeing deemed uncharitable. But it was not a quality that was lacking in \nRonald Reagan. He thought deeply about issues. He thought deeply about \nthe country. I think people underestimated, to some extent, how deeply \nhe thought and understood what was going on. He never pretended to know \neverything. I think that helped him a lot in his Presidency.\n\n  We should also remember President Reagan, however, not just for his \nqualities and his personality, but also for what he believed. He \nthought ideas were important, and he was right. I remember George Will \nsaid a few years ago--and I am paraphrasing him; he probably said it \nmore eloquently than this--but the gist of his remarks was, the \ncollapse of the Soviet Union proves that ideas not only have \nconsequences, but that maybe only ideas have consequences.\n  President Reagan's friends and opponents have sometimes characterized \nhis political philosophy as being an anti-Government philosophy or a \nsimplistic belief in making Government smaller whatever the \ncircumstances the country was confronting. I do not think that is \ncorrect. I think at best it is oversimplistic.\n  President Reagan understood that the issue of our time during his \nPresidency and the issue of our time now, I suggest, is not whether \nGovernment is going to be big or small, certainly in an absolute sense \nand often in a relative sense as well, but whether the Government, in \ndoing whatever functions we believe it ought to do, will consistently \nrespect the values and institutions of private life.\n  It is not a question of whether Government is important, because it \nis; it is a question of whether the Government believes it is more \nimportant than the private society and culture and people it is \ngoverning. That is where President Reagan drew the consistent line of \nhis philosophy in his public life. His faith was in what the American \npeople had built and have built and are continuing to build on their \nown, and in the associations and networks of private life that give \nlife meaning, that give people a chance for happiness and opportunity. \nHe believed in what people build in their families, in their small \nbusinesses, in their local schools, in their voluntary associations and \norganizations, in their churches, synagogues, and temples. He believed \nin the great traditions of American culture. He knew those traditions \nand the institutions that represent them grow and evolve organically \nover time and that they represent the wisdom of many generations of \npeople about how we ought to live in our society so that we can have \nthe maximum amount of justice and freedom and opportunity for all of \nour people.\n  What he wanted was for the Government to be vigorous in the areas it \nwas supposed to operate but to respect those institutions rather than \ntrying to overthrow them.\n  He said once in 1970:\n\n       It is not my intention to do away with government. It is \n     rather to make it work--work with us, not over us; stand by \n     our side, not ride on our back. Government can and must \n     provide opportunity, not smother it; foster productivity, not \n     stifle it.\n\n  I remember a few years ago when we were debating welfare reform in \nthe Congress--and I was in the House at the time--a key point in that \ndebate was when the Congress decided collectively that we were not \ntalking about whether we were going to try in some sense to get rid of \nthe welfare system. We were not going to retreat from the impulse of \nthe 1960s to help people who were in poverty get out of poverty.\n  What we wanted, however, was a system that tried to do that in a way \nthat respected and upheld the values that generations and generations \nof Americans have relied on to move up the economic ladder. We wanted a \nsystem that instead of punishing work, encouraged and required it. We \nwanted a system that instead of providing incentives against marriage, \nencouraged marriage and talked about its importance. We wanted a system \nthat did not uproot neighborhoods and neighborhood institutions, that \ndid not sweep them aside in the name of an all powerful and \nprescriptive government, but rather a system that helped build up again \nthe vital parts of neighborhoods.\n\n  The reason that bill has been so successful, the reason it was \nsupported by a vast majority in both Houses, and why it has been \nsuccessful all over the country is not because it represented, I \nsubmit, a retreat by the Government from its commitment to helping \npeople achieve the American dream, but rather because it represented a \nconscious commitment by the Government to work with the values of \nAmericans, to respect those values and not to uproot them.\n  There is no question where President Reagan would have been in that \nfight, where he was in that fight, because the seeds of welfare reform \nwere planted during his administration.\n  I am not going to go on. There are others who wish to speak. I thank \nthe Senator from Florida for allowing me to go out of order because we \ntry to go back and forth on both sides of the aisle.\n  Let me close with one of my favorite quotes from President Reagan. We \nare all doing that. It is from his second Inaugural Address in January \n1985, and many have commented on President Reagan's optimism about \nAmerica, how he was optimistic about America because he not only \nbelieved in those values and the institutions that represented them, \nbut he had a tremendous faith in their power. I think he knew we were \ngoing to triumph over the Soviet Union in the cold war because he knew \nwhat we believed in was right, was powerful, and was good, and he was \nnot afraid to state it in those terms.\n  Here is an example of his optimism from his second Inaugural Address:\n\n       Now we hear again the echoes of our past: a general falls \n     to his knees in the hard snow of Valley Forge; a lonely \n     president paces the darkened halls, and ponders his struggle \n     to preserve the Union; the men of the Alamo call out \n     encouragement to each other; a settler pushes west and sings \n     a song, and the song echoes out forever and fills the \n     unknowing air.\n       It is the American sound. It is hopeful, big-hearted, \n     idealistic, daring, decent, and fair. That's our heritage; \n     that is our song. We sing it still. For all our problems, our \n     differences, we are together as of old, as we raise our \n     voices to the God who is the Author of this most tender \n     music. And may he continue to hold us close as we fill the \n     world with our sound--sound in unity, affection, and love--\n     one people, under God, dedicated to the dream of freedom that \n     he has placed in the human heart, called upon now to pass \n     that dream on to a waiting and hopeful world.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, later today, the body of \nPresident Ronald Reagan will be brought into this Capitol so that all \nAmericans can pay their final respects.\n  Much has been said, much has been written about our 40th President \nand the impact he had on our Nation and the world. In at least one \nrespect, I believe part of his legacy has been mischaracterized, and I \nrise today, as has my friend and colleague from Missouri, to set the \nrecord straight.\n  The issue that I would like to address is Ronald Reagan's view of the \nsize of Government. It is true that President Reagan believed the \nFederal Government was too large and too costly, but he did not believe \nthat was true of all governments.\n  As a former Governor of California, he believed governments closer to \nthe people, governments at the State and local level, had the primary \nresponsibility for essential public service and, thus, they should have \nthe resources to respond to public needs.\n\n[[Page S6647]]\n\n  The people would serve as the control of whether the State and local \nofficials had fulfilled the voters' expectation of the role of their \nState, their county, or their city. I know this firsthand.\n  My tenure as Governor of Florida overlapped with President Reagan's \nadministration for 6 years. During that time, President Reagan and key \nmembers of his administration, even as they attempted to eliminate the \nU.S. Department of Education and shrink Federal spending on education, \nhelped me pass a tax increase in Florida that led to great improvements \nin our State education system.\n  An education reform movement swept the country in 1983 and 1984 with \nthe issuance in April of 1983 by the National Commission on Excellence \nin Education of a landmark report entitled ``Nation at Risk: The \nImperative for Educational Reform.''\n  At the time that report was issued, President Reagan made this \nstatement:\n\n       Parental authority is not a right conveyed by the state; \n     rather, parents delegate to their elected school board \n     representatives and state legislators the responsibility for \n     their children's schooling.\n\n  During a meeting of the National Governors Association in 1983 \nPresident Reagan told the Governors they would be responsible for \nimplementing reforms, including how to cover the costs of those \nreforms. He was not interested in having the Federal Government play a \nlarger role; in fact, he was intent on cutting the Federal role in \neducation.\n  I recalled those words when back in Tallahassee I began to push a \nmajor educational reform package through the legislature. I was not \nalone. For instance, our colleague, the then-Governor of Tennessee, \nLamar Alexander, was instrumental in the development and adoption of a \nsimilar reform package in Tennessee, and we had the opportunity to work \ntogether during that process with then-Governor Alexander talking to \nRepublican members of the Florida legislature as I reciprocated in \nconversations with Democratic members of the Tennessee legislature.\n  The Florida package had a goal. The goal was we would raise the level \nof education in Florida as judged by student performance on \nstandardized tests and other measurements and also per-student funding \nof education to among the top 25 percent of the States in America. We \nincreased student performance standards at all levels and had the most \nchallenging standards for graduation from high school of any State in \nthe Nation.\n  The package included basic things such as smaller class sizes, more \nclass and curriculum opportunities for students, and a career ladder \nwith pay increases which recognized our best teachers. But all of those \nreforms depended upon additional State financing. I proposed several \nsteps to raise the necessary revenue, including a revision of our \ncorporate profits tax. I advocated the plan with the assurance that \nbetter schools would improve our State's economic climate. We even \nprinted up buttons which read: ``Education Means Business.''\n  I was therefore very disturbed that the success of the educational \nreform program was threatened by the lack of support by Republicans in \nthe State Senate and the State House of Representatives. I called \nPresident Reagan's Education Secretary, Dr. Terrell Bell from Utah. I \nreported that I was attempting to do exactly what the President \nhad said States should be doing, but could not get any Republican \nsupport.\n\n  After consulting with the White House and gaining the President's \npersonal permission, Secretary Bell called me back and asked: What can \nI do to help?\n  I gave him the names of a half dozen or more Republican legislators. \nSecretary Bell called them on behalf of the President to ask them to \nsupport the reform package. I am pleased to say that with strong \nbipartisan support, the education reform program in Florida passed in \n1983, and then by 1986 Florida had moved to 13th in the Nation in our \nper-pupil spending, and our test scores had the greatest rate of \nincrease in 1986 of any State in the Nation.\n  This program showed that greater gains in student performance can be \nachieved through the right set of educational reform. This would not \nhave happened without the support of President Ronald Reagan.\n  My point is Ronald Reagan was a more nuanced political leader in \nterms of his view of the role of Government than he is generally given \ncredit for by both his critics and his fans. On behalf of all \nFloridians, I express my appreciation for his support of improved \neducation in Florida, and on behalf of all Floridians I express my \ncondolences to President Reagan's family, especially his beloved Nancy.\n  Thank you.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would feel really bad if I didn't take a \nfew moments to speak about my friend, Ron Reagan. I, as much as anybody \nin this body, revered him, respected him, and loved him.\n  When I was running back in 1976, I filed literally on the last day, \nMay 10. I had zero name recognition except among the legal community \nand among my initial church community. But it was zero in the public \npolls. I ran through the preconvention, the convention, and came out \nsecond in the convention, which enabled me to force a primary, and \nthrough the primary on $35,000, $18,000 of which was my own, which was \na lot of money then back in 1976. I was about 9 points ahead and \npulling away at that time against the favored in the race--the \nRepublican Party favorite and the favorite of most of the delegates of \nthe State convention. But he had spent about $150,000, and he was \nstarting to slip. I was starting to pull ahead by about 9 points, \naccording to the polls.\n  Since I was the first to come out for Ronald Reagan in that race at \nthat particular time in Utah as a candidate, we decided to ask Ronald \nReagan if he would pre-primary endorse me in my race for the U.S. \nSenate.\n  I have to say when I called it didn't take them long, recognizing my \nfriendship and my support for the first time in his political career, \nas far as I know--at least that is what I was told by those who were \nrunning his campaign, that he was going to pre-primary endorse me, and \nhe did. By that time I was probably known by about 60 to 65 percent of \nthe people in Utah.\n  After the endorsement, I won the primary. I probably would have won \nthe primary between 10 or 15 percentage points. But after his \nendorsement, I won the primary 2 to 1, and I was known by, I believe, \nwell over 95 percent of my fellow constituents in Utah.\n  I went to 36 States for Ronald Reagan as one of his major surrogates. \nI went to New Hampshire, and I was Nancy Reagan's date that night as I \nspoke for Ronald Reagan in the cattle call. That is what it was called \nin New Hampshire.\n  In 1980, I gave the keynote address at Plains High School, Jimmy \nCarter's own high school in Plains, GA, before 2,000 people.\n  I did everything in my power to elect Ronald Reagan. We had a \nfriendship that transcended the usual friendships that are lovely and \nwonderful around here but nevertheless usually don't rise to the level \nthat his friendship for me and mine for him really rose to.\n  I truly love Ronald Reagan. I know what a great President he was. I \nknow he did bring down the Iron Curtain, that he was the primary mover \nand articulator of the themes that actually ended the cold war.\n  Most scholars will now say there are four reasons why Reagan was able \nto win the cold war: No. 1, his military buildup; he put too much \npressure on the Soviets; No. 2, the placing of the Pershing II missiles \nin Europe, which was a very gutsy thing to do at the time, and highly \ncriticized; No. 3 was the threat to build SDI, the Space Defense \nInitiative, and the Soviets knew we could do it; and, No. 4 was a \nplacing of the Stinger missiles Afghanistan. I was here through all of \nthose times.\n  I honor this great President, and I honor his dear wife who has been \na wonderful wife and supporter, who I know deeply, who has been an \nadvocate for so many things that are right, and especially in later \ntimes. Embryonic stem cell research--she is right on that\n\n[[Page S6648]]\n\nissue, and I support her. I honor both of them this day.\n  I join my colleagues, millions of Americans, and indeed countless \nmore around the world in mourning the loss of the greatest American \nPresident of the 20th century, President Ronald Wilson Reagan.\n  After suffering nearly a decade, our beloved President died this \nweekend. I join those in this body here today in sending our \ncondolences to Mrs. Reagan and their entire family.\n  It is hard to imagine any American alive who has not been touched by \nthe legacy of Ronald Reagan. Even those born after he left office in \n1989 have benefited from his selfless service, as they grew up in an \nera of unprecedented global freedom, a result of the end of the cold \nwar brought on by President Reagan's bold vision of this country and \nour faithful mission in the world.\n  Certainly, I was touched by the life of President Reagan.\n  Perhaps I might not be here today were it not for the invigorating \nsupport of this great leader, whose endorsement of my candidacy in my \nfirst Senate run was certainly instrumental in my service to the people \nof Utah.\n  I was pleased and honored to return the favor at every opportunity--\nand, in 1980 and 1984, I campaigned for Ronald Reagan in almost every \nState of the Union.\n  Let no one believe that this repaid my debt, political or personal, \nto this great man--because I believe I will remain in his debt as long \nas I live, and so will our country.\n  President Reagan was both political mentor and inspiration to me as a \nyoung Senator.\n  We both started as Democrats.\n  We were inspired by our country's bold international leadership and \nsacrifice during World War II, under a Democratic president.\n  Yet we both saw the political landscape shift early in our adult \nlives.\n  We both grew dismayed at our country's direction, as citizens lost \nfaith, lost optimism and lost the dynamism that once made this land \ngreat.\n  At the same time, we both grew to appreciate the principles of the \nRepublican Party, where individual initiative and personal freedom are \nenshrined, and where the fight against international communism took a \nbackseat to no other foreign policy.\n  When I came to the Senate in 1977, our country was still fresh from \nthe defeat symbolized by communist tanks crashing into Saigon in 1975.\n  By the time Ronald Reagan became President, the defeat in 1975 had \nbeen interpreted by our global nemesis, the Soviet Union, as a weakness \nin American resolve; it inspired the Soviets to proxy adventures in \nLatin America, Africa and Asia.\n  As the liberal elites of the 1970s denounced and disparaged our \ninternational sacrifices of the past decade, as it became commonplace \nto equate the use of American force with the encroachments of communist \ntyranny, America became uncertain of itself and turned inward.\n  It was not our finest moment.\n  Our late colleague, Senator Moynihan, once remarked, ``the central \nconservative truth is that it is culture, not politics, that determines \nthe success of a society. The central liberal truth is that politics \ncan change a culture and save it from itself.''\n  In the 1970s, liberal culture had brought this country to a period of \nsocial decline and international withdrawal.\n  As communist tyranny gained around the world, drug use here reached \nan all-time high.\n  The economy of the most productive nation in the world was unraveling \nwith high taxes and higher inflation.\n  Our sense of mission was gone; our belief in our natural strengths \nand goodness receded.\n  One of the things I loved the most about Ronald Reagan was that he \nrecognized his duty to lead a conservative movement back into the \npolitical majority; by so doing he declared that we would never concede \nto cultural decline.\n  Reagan's victory in 1980 put an end to this malaise and changed our \ncountry forever.\n  Originally from the Midwest, Reagan moved to California and found his \ntalent in the industry of American dreams, showing our country that an \nAmerican everyman could be a star.\n  Many scorned Reagan the actor for seeking political office.\n  But, once again, he showed them wrong. He won our hearts as a \nPresident--as he had as an actor--showing us all that a man well-\npracticed in the arts of both heart and mind could be a perfect leader \nfor a nation which had lost its sense of imagination.\n  Only in America could a man from the middle class, from the middle of \nthe country, rise to become the greatest American leader of the 20th \ncentury.\n  Ronald Wilson Reagan achieved this by appealing to the essential \nAmerican values in all of us--the values of individualism and \nenterprise, initiative and optimism, charity and sacrifice. And he \nrestored those values in our country's policies.\n  Many misjudged Reagan. Many underestimated him. Many confused a man \nof simple beliefs with a simple man.\n  Those of us who knew him well recognized Reagan as a man of deep \nconvictions. Deft of wit, he always deflected a tough moment with \nhumor. But, under it all, a gravity of purpose shone through.\n  What I came to admire in Ronald Reagan was his core belief that \ngovernment could lead society, but not build society. He recognized \nthat government's most important economic role was to foster American \ninnovation and industry. And his policies followed that principle.\n  In foreign policy, he knew that communism was an abominable scourge \non the face of the planet. He eagerly tackled that challenge as he had \nmost obstacles in his life, and in so doing left a legacy unparalleled \nby any American leader.\n  Who can forget his momentous call, ``Mr. Gorbachev, tear down that \nWall?''\n  And who can forget watching as the wall fell just 2 years later?\n  In the most fundamental way, President Ronald Reagan inspired us all \nto believe in our great nation, and what it could do to help its people \nlead better lives.\n  As a junior Senator, I watched President Reagan take office, facing \nhis first challenge: an economy misfiring on all cylinders, mired in \nthe mud of inflation, high taxes and bureaucracy.\n  With a strong voice of optimism, President Reagan unfurled an \nambitious plan to rejuvenate the economy and lead the nation to \neconomic recovery.\n  I remember how excited we were to see his bold plan, the change in \ndirection that our new President charted.\n  He led us to pass the landmark Economic Recovery and Tax Act, \nincluding the Kemp-Roth personal income tax cuts of 25 percent over \nthree years.\n  This major initiative stimulated the economy by providing for \naccelerated depreciation deductions and an investment credit.\n  It also enhanced the retirement of millions of Americans by \nintroducing Individual Retirement Accounts.\n  And perhaps most significantly, it indexed income tax brackets to \ninflation, limiting this punishing form of spending growth.\n  The result? The economic boom in the 1980s.\n  Inflation dropped from 13.5 percent in 1980 to 3.2 percent in 1983.\n  By 1986, the fourth year of the tax cuts, economic growth had \nincreased a cumulative 18 percent.\n  And, when Ronald Reagan left office in January 1989, more than 18 \nmillion jobs had been created.\n  Some have criticized the Reagan era as years of profligate spending \nand an irresponsible increase in the federal deficit.\n  However, only in 1 year, 1983, did either personal income tax \ncollections or total receipts go down from the previous year. It is \ntrue that the budget deficit did increase during the Reagan presidency, \nbut this was clearly due to large increases in spending, not because of \nthe Reagan tax cuts, without which we would not likely have had the \nincrease in prosperity most Americans enjoyed.\n\n  President Reagan also led the way for Congress to approve the \nlandmark 1986 Tax Reform Act.\n  Despite the naysaying of critics, President Reagan did it again. The \n1986 Act lowered the top marginal income tax rate from 50 percent to \njust 28 percent. Also, it reduced the number of tax brackets from 14 to \njust 2.\n\n[[Page S6649]]\n\n   While I did not support some of the provision in the final product \nof the 1986 Act, particularly some of the drastic changes in \ndepreciation, which I believed would help contribute to a crisis in \nreal estate and the savings and loan industry, the Act itself with its \nsimplification and lower tax rates was a major accomplishment.\n  The fact that subsequent presidents and Congresses have reversed the \ngains made in terms of simplicity does not take away from the \nmonumental victory that President Reagan scored by his leadership of \nthe Tax Reform Act of 1986.\n  Throughout the Reagan era, I had the privilege of serving on the \nLabor and Human Resources Committee, much of it as chairman. I worked \nclosely with the President and his staff on issues related to public \nhealth and welfare issues showcasing the President' compassion and \ndedication to improving the quality of life of all Americans.\n  The country was still in a major recession, and we worked to pass the \nJob Training Partnership Act. This legislation changed the emphasis of \njob assistance from providing government jobs to unemployed workers to \nproviding them job training which would help unemployed find jobs in \nthe private sector.\n  The President's initiatives often focused on releasing decision-\nmaking initiatives from an old federal bureaucracy, as with the \ninnovative health block grants that returned decision-making to the \nstates, providing them with the resources and flexibility to deliver \npreventive services, maternal and child health care, and mental health \nservices in a totally new model.\n  As chairman of the committee, I was criticized for putting this \nlegislation through. But we are vindicated when the General Accounting \nOffice reviewed these initiatives several years after their creation, \nit included that they were successful, and provided a more efficient \nway to address the health needs of America's diverse population.\n  I also remember how strongly the Reagan administration supported \nbiomedical research, a love for and appreciation of the power of \nscientific inquiry Mrs. Reagan carries forward to this day.\n  Other key accomplishments under President Reagan's tenure were \nsignificant Food and Drug Administration legislation, such as the \nOrphan Drug Act, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Resolution \nAct, the National Organ Transplantation Act, pediatric emergency \nmedical services, vaccine compensation, tobacco warning labels, and the \nnational practitioner data bank.\n  How well I remember the battle President Reagan waged to seat C. \nEverett Koop as the Surgeon General.\n  Again recognizing that the country needed inspired leadership more \nthan bureaucracy, President Reagan informed us that he wanted to \nnominate C. Everette Koop to be the Surgeon General.\n  Many balked, citing Dr. Koop's age--65--as a barrier. The Public \nHealth Service Act limited the age of PHS Commission Corps officers to \n64\\1/2\\.\n  But our President, himself past that age, recognized the superior \nleadership skills of Dr. Koop.\n  It was a long battle, but one which one which had to be fought. Dr. \nKoop defined the modern-day role of Surgeon General, and today is \nrevered by all, Democrats and Republicans alike, for his independent \nminded advocacy of public health, from AIDS awareness and prevention to \nanti-tobacco initiatives.\n  I would be remiss if I didn't highlight President Reagan's other \nsignificant healthcare accomplishment.\n  As we know, the use of illegal drugs had hit a historic high in the \nlate 1970s.\n  Again, President Reagan recognized that government needed to find new \nways to address this social blight. He proposed and we legislated the \ncreation of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, which has taken \nthe leadership role in anti-drug policy ever since.\n  Once again, however, the President recognized that leadership was as \nmuch in the message as in the bureaucracy.\n  His beloved First Lady introduced the ``Just Say No'' campaign, a \nflat rebuttal to an ingrown acceptance of drug use in our society.\n  Derided by some elites, this program of declaring unequivocally the \nunacceptable use of illegal drugs has become a foundation of all \nsubsequent drug use.\n  No one suggests--then or now--that the problem of drug use is simple, \nand that prevention and treatment policies can be cauterized from \ninterdiction policies.\n  But no one suggests, after years of confirming studies, that a drug \npolicy can be effective absent a strong component of social rhetoric.\n  I loved President Reagan, and I loved his personal style of \nleadership.\n  But I loved even more his undying love and affection for one of the \nclassiest first ladies this country has come to know.\n  Nancy Reagan's quiet support of her husband, so evident in all his \nsuccesses, is often overlooked, as is her courage in leading the ``Just \nSay No'' campaign.\n  I remember as if it were today when President Reagan signed the 1986 \ndrug law, the one that created the Office of the drug Czar and gave \nadded resources to prevention and treatment.\n  I was standing behind the President when he signed the bill. He said \nwith that special twinkle in his eye, ``I am going to give this pen to \nthe women who has crusaded to end drug use in this country.''\n  With that, he walked past expectant advocates and lawmakers straight \nto his wife Nancy, and presented her with the pen.\n  Some focus on President Reagan's talents as an actor and image-maker. \nYet I have never known a more authentic man.\n  And when he concluded that AIDS was a challenge to the public health \nthat was reaching emergency proportions, he declared this as national \npolicy.\n  At the time, some criticized his administration. They wanted him to \nact sooner. They wanted more money. They wanted more research.\n  But what I remember was a compassionate man, who recognized that we \nneeded to build the research infrastructure to make effective use of \nnew funding.\n  While the HIV virus was not identified until 1983, the Reagan \nadministration invested close to $6 billion in fighting the disease by \nthe end of his term in 1989. Once the President recognized the \nchallenge, he radically increased the response of the government, and \nthe breakthroughs with retroviral medicines in the 1990s would simply \nhave not occurred were it not for those investments.\n  We all know that one of a President's greatest legacies is his \nnominations to the third branch of government.\n  In appointing more judges than any president in American history, \nPresident Reagan's judicial legacy can be seen on two levels.\n  First, he described, in both principled and practical terms, the kind \nof judge America needs.\n  We had seen decades of judicial activism, through which judges took \nmore and more control over the policies governing the country and the \nculture in which Americans lived.\n  President Reagan came into office not just saying judges were going \ntoo far, but explaining why. He refocused Americans on the principles \nAmerica's founders laid down at the dawn of the Republic: the people, \nthrough their elected representatives, decide how they wish to be \ngoverned and make the law to do so. Judges can only interpret and apply \nthat law, they cannot make or change it.\n\n  Implementing those basic principles, President Reagan shaped the \njudiciary by the individuals he nominated and appointed. He appointed \nsome of the legal academy's best minds to the U.S. Court of Appeals--\nsuch as Ralph Winter to the Second Circuit, Frank Easterbrook and \nRichard Posner to the Seventh Circuit, and of course Robert Bork to the \nDistrict of Columbia Circuit.\n  I served on the Judiciary Committee during those years, seeing first \nhand the depth and breadth and quality of President Reagan's nominees.\n  America's founders insisted that this separation of powers, this \nrestriction on judicial power, was absolutely critical for the freedom \nthat self-government under a written constitution makes possible.\n  For some whose agenda the people do not favor, however, a judiciary \nthat won't make law means their preferred law just won't get made. And \nthey\n\n[[Page S6650]]\n\nfought President Reagan's nominees with increasingly intensity.\n  The first cloture vote ever taken on an appeals court nominee, for \nexample, occurred during President Reagan's first term, and the \nconfirmation process changed entirely in his second.\n  The seeds sown then have borne fruit today in the filibusters being \nused against President Bush's nominees. But the issue remains the same, \nwhether unelected federal judges may take over from the people the \nbusiness of making law and defining the culture.\n  President Reagan's record of judicial appointments is certainly a \nprofound legacy. He truly blazed a trail on this issue and, through his \nleadership, Americans now know more about how appointing the right kind \nof judge is so important to protect their freedom.\n  Many believe that President Reagan's lasting legacy will be his \nsuccessful leadership during the last stage of the cold war.\n  Ronald Reagan's tenure began at what was our lowest point in the cold \nwar. The loss in Vietnam and the Watergate debacle led to a withdrawal \nfrom our global policy of containment. The Soviets filled the gap, and \ntheir proxies gained around the globe.\n  Emboldened, the Soviet Union engaged in its most extensive military \nexpansion in that dictatorships history; during the 1970s, the Soviets \nexpanded their nuclear missile arsenals as well as their conventional \narsenals in virtually every armament category. At the end of the 1970s, \nthe previous president as left shame-faced, following the invasion of \nAfghanistan, declaring his ``surprise'' at Soviet behavior.\n  President Reagan came to office dedicated to redressing the military \nbalance and engaging the Cold War.\n  His administration saw the largest peace-time growth of military \nspending in modern American history. That escalation combined American \nresolve with American ingenuity, and this was no more evident than in \nPresident Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative.\n  The President rejected conventional deterrence doctrine when he \nstated, ``We must seek other means of deterring war. It is both \nmilitarily and morally necessary . . . I propose to channel our \ntechnological prowess toward building a more secure and stable world . \n. . Our only purpose is to search for ways to reduce the danger of \nnuclear war.''\n  What President Reagan imagined, when he stated this back in 1984, is \nslowly coming to be, 20 years later. We have moved too slowly, but not \nbecause we lacked in vision.\n  President Reagan was willing to challenge the Soviets diplomatically, \nmilitarily and by proxy. He was unabashed in declaring that regime an \n``evil empire''. Who today denies the inherent evil of the gulag?\n  He was bold in responding to the emplacement of Soviet SS-20s in \noccupied Europe with Pershing's in Germany. Who today denies that this \ndidn't signal to the Soviets our new-found resolution to combat them \ngeopolitically?\n\n  Ronald Reagan rejected the so-called ``Vietnam syndrome'' long before \nour victory in the first Gulf War allowed Americans to believe in the \njustice of our use of force. He knew that the U.S. had a role in the \nworld, that the use of American force was not immoral and that the U.S. \ncould do good for the world.\n  This military escalation challenged the Soviet leadership and \nultimately bankrupted its coffers. The decision to roll-back directly \nchallenged and refuted the fundamental ideological tenet of communism, \nthat it would prevail as an inexorable law of history.\n  This perverted notion was based, of course, on the acceptance that \nthe highest stage of history would be rest on imprisoning nations and \nextinguishing history.\n  Reagan knew in his heart that this was the greatest falsehood \nperpetrated on modern history and he built his foreign policy--the \nReagan Doctrine--on the idea of rolling back this ideology, this \ntyrannical power, and tearing down the walls that kept its citizens \nimprisoned.\n  Ronald Reagan did not accept the status quo.\n  He did not accept a static geopolitical division of the world between \nthe free nations and the captive nations of the evil empire.\n  He and his allies--and I will be proud to my dying day to have \nconsidered myself one of his allies--believed that we could roll back \ncommunism, on the ground, and in the minds of people.\n  Ronald Reagan went to England in 1983, before the leftist Oxford \nUnion, and announced the creation of what would become the National \nEndowment for Democracy, which would support programs around the world \nfostering democratic principles and practices.\n  Last year, on the 20th anniversary of this bold initiative, President \nBush announced a major push by the NED into the Arab world.\n  Democracy remains relevant after it has triumphed over communist \ntyranny.\n  But for democracy to succeed, people striving to break the yoke of \ntyranny had to have a friend in the United States. Ronald Reagan did \nnot limit his friendship to diplomacy and military posturing.\n  A key aspect of the Reagan legacy was the Reagan Doctrine's policy of \nsupport for anti-communist movements around the world. We supported \nSolidarity in Poland, using the International Labor Organization.\n  We supported the resistance in Nicaragua--and the wars over that \npolicy were sometimes almost as intense here on Capitol Hill.\n  And we supported the Afghan resistance.\n  We've had democracy in Poland for over a decade, and Poland is the \nshining example of the New Europe, a country whose government and \nsoldiers have bravely and proudly served besides ours in Iraq.\n  Nicaragua has also had democratic elections over the past decade.\n  And while the Iran-Contra episode was a policy debacle, I remain \nproud of my service in this Senate during that investigation, as I \nremain unflinching in my belief that it was right to help Nicaraguans \nresist the tyranny and thuggery of the Sandinistas.\n  And our support for the Afghan resistance led to the withdrawal of \nSoviet forces from Afghanistan, dealing the Soviet Union a military, \nfinancial and psychological blow from which it would never recuperate. \nThis blow created a major fissure in the notion of communist \ninevitability that, many of us believe, would lead to the crumbling of \nthe Soviet empire.\n  Many are quick to disparage that policy, because of what arose from \nthe tumult of the Afghan resistance and the rise of the Taliban. We \nmade mistakes in implementing the policy, we now see, primarily having \nto do with recruiting Saudi participation and relying on Pakistani \nmanagement of arms flows.\n\n  But our biggest mistake was abandoning Afghanistan after the collapse \nof the Soviet puppet regime, leaving that poor country an orphan child \nof the cold war. But we made no mistake in contributing to a \ndevastating Soviet defeat, a defeat that brought about the end of the \ncold war.\n  When Ronald Reagan left office, this country had been transformed.\n  Malaise was not associated with the American economy, nor the \nAmerican spirit.\n  Optimism, that personal trait of Ronald Reagan, was what \ncharacterized our standing in the world, our economy, and our belief in \nourselves.\n  Reagan, a child of the Midwest who understood mythically the role of \nthe western frontier in the American psyche, left us looking to the \nhorizon, to the future.\n  Ronald Reagan was a humble man, who left office gladly, having served \nhis term, but who never stopped loving the American people.\n  It was such love that led to one of the most moving letters to the \nAmerican public ever written in our history, the letter he wrote on \nNovember 5, 1994, announcing that he was slowly succumbing to \nAlzheimer's Disease.\n  This is a horrible disease, as so many American families know.\n  My colleagues in the Senate know that, after much soul-searching and \nstudy, I have become a strong proponent of embryonic stem cell \nresearch, because of the promise it offers for treatment of some of the \nmost wrenching illnesses Americans face today, such as Alzheimer's, \nParkinsons and juvenile diabetes.\n  President Reagan's widow, my dear friend Nancy, knows that I will \nremain dedicated to supporting this research through all my days in the \nSenate.\n  Even though retired and enjoying the privacy that was always \nimportant for\n\n[[Page S6651]]\n\nhim and his family, President Reagan wrote on November 5, 1994 one of \nthe bravest and most moving letters in American history.\n  He said:\n\n       Upon learning this news, Nancy and I had to decide whether \n     as private citizens we would keep this a private matter or \n     whether we would make this news known in a public way. So \n     now, we feel it is important to share it with you. In opening \n     our hearts, we hope this might promote greater awareness of \n     this condition. Perhaps it will encourage a clearer \n     understanding of the individuals and families who are \n     affected by it.\n\n  After speaking of the burdens he knew his long illness had in store--\nnot for him, but for his beloved Nancy, he thanked his fellow \nAmericans. He said:\n\n       Let me thank you, the American people, for giving me the \n     great honor of allowing me to serve as your President. When \n     the Lord calls me home, whenever that may be, I will leave \n     with the greatest love for this country of ours and eternal \n     optimism for its future.\n       I now begin the journey that will lead me into the sunset \n     of my life. I know that for America there will always be a \n     bright dawn ahead.\n\n  These are the virtuous and loving words of a patriot, of a brave and \nhumble man, of a man who lived every day in the belief that our best \ndays lie ahead. It is America that pauses this week, and I thank God \nfor the gift of the greatest American president of the twentieth \ncentury, Ronald Reagan.\n  We have lost a great American.\n  I think it is fitting to quote another great American, Daniel Webster \nwho spoke so eloquently about the passing of two other Presidents, \nThomas Jefferson and John Adams. Webster's words were never more true \nthan today:\n\n       A superior and commanding human intellect, a truly great \n     man, when Heaven vouchsafes so rare a gift, is not a \n     temporary flame, burning brightly for a while, and then \n     giving place to returning darkness. It is rather a spark of \n     fervent heat, as well as radiant light, with power to \n     enkindle the common mass of human kind; so that when it \n     glimmers in its own decay, and finally goes out in death, no \n     night follows, but it leaves the world all light, all on fire \n     from the potent contact of its own spirit.\n\n  I pray that America will always be alight with the spirit of Ronald \nReagan.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the remarks of our \nformer colleague, Senator Connie Mack, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            Ronald W. Reagan\n\n                               1911-2004\n\n         (A tribute by former U.S. Senator Connie Mack (R-FL))\n\n\n ronald reagan was more than the president, he was an inspiration, he \n                             was my friend\n\n       As America mourns the passing of former President Ronald \n     Reagan, one of the most loved American Presidents in history, \n     it is appropriate that our nation take a moment to reflect on \n     the life of this remarkable man. He will not only be \n     remembered for his vision and leadership, but also for his \n     conviction to principles, his sense of pride and love of \n     country.\n       President Reagan made a difference in my life both \n     personally and politically. When he was elected in 1980, I \n     remember vividly saying to my wife Priscilla ``this is such \n     an important election for our nation that I have to become \n     involved. I had no idea his election would one day lead me to \n     seek elective office and eventually to represent Florida in \n     the United State Senate.\n       Knowing Ronald Reagan and serving in the U.S. Congress when \n     he was President of the United States has been one of the \n     greatest honors of my life. I remember when he came to \n     Florida in 1988 to campaign for me in my race for the United \n     States Senate. I introduced him saying: ``Mr. President, we \n     will never forget that you gave us back a belief in ourselves \n     and our nation. You restarted our economy giving people hope \n     and opportunity. You rebuilt America's military and led the \n     fight for freedom around the world.'' Ronald Reagan was more \n     than the president, he was an inspiration . . . he was a \n     friend.\n       Each year, the magnitude of President Reagan's \n     accomplishments at home and abroad become increasing \n     apparent. As recognition of his achievements and their \n     impacts on our lives today grows so does the nation's \n     gratitude toward him. He embodied the American Spirit that \n     helped lift the morale of our country.\n       American Presidents affect history in their own way, but \n     fewer have made more of an impact or shaped the history of \n     their times than Ronald Reagan.\n       In the election of 1980, Americans were faced with one of \n     the most simple, yet defining questions in American politics: \n     ``Are you better off now than you were four years ago?'' Were \n     we as Americans willing to accept that the once proud land of \n     the free and the home of the brave was now worn and tired and \n     lacked direction? America said: ``No!''\n       Ronald Reagan reaffirmed my philosophy as well as that of a \n     whole generation which believed that wealth and prosperity \n     emerge from the spirit of creativity that resides in \n     individuals not government, and to the belief in the \n     principles of less taxing, less spending, less government and \n     more freedom. Freedom deeply mattered to Ronald Reagan, and \n     freedom deeply matters to me.\n       With Ronald Reagan's election came a renewed vitality in \n     America. He brought a belief that freedom must ring from the \n     bells of this great nation and that opportunity should not be \n     limited. He reminded us of the America that was there all \n     along. A freedom loving country waiting to be unshackled from \n     a Government that had grown too big and cost too much which \n     dictated what was best for us. No, we wanted better and \n     Ronald Reagan led us there.\n       Under President Reagan's leadership, the spirit of America \n     was rekindled and the flame of freedom burned bright free \n     markets, free ideas, free trade and freedom as the \n     centerpiece of our foreign policy. The Reagan Revolution had \n     no boundaries. The winds of freedom swept across America and \n     gained momentum throughout the world. Freedom's ring was \n     heard in Latin America, where nations turned back communism \n     and accepted the free will of the people. In Eastern Europe, \n     freedom broke the rusted chains of totalitarianism and caused \n     the Berlin Wall to fall.\n       Ronald Reagan never lost faith in the freedom, dignity and \n     liberty of mankind. He understood that freedom is never more \n     than one generation away from extinction. He never doubted \n     that freedom was more than a virtue. It was a right given to \n     each of us by a sovereign God.\n       Rondald Reagan did not invent freedom. He defined it. For \n     through his wit and humility, he carried his role in history \n     as the man who gave freedom a face. And through his undying \n     faith in those who entrusted him the role as their leader, \n     Ronald Reagan achieved greatness.\n       Even though President Reagan has now completed the journey \n     he began so many years ago, our nation has not yet completed \n     the path we began under his leadership. Ronald Reagan made \n     America stronger, more prosperous and more confident. We \n     still need to do more to make our country and the world a \n     better and safer place to live, work and raise a family. We \n     must continue his legacy so as to ensure that America remains \n     that shinning city on the hill that President Reagan \n     described to us.\n       To Nancy and the Reagan family, our nation is forever in \n     your debt for sharing this unique and special individual with \n     us, the American People.\n       President Reagan, we say goodbye for now. You have touched \n     our lives deeply. You have indeed lived the words of sacred \n     scripture: ``You have fought the good fight, you have \n     finished the race, you have kept the faith.''\n       Godspeed Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/09/senate-section/article/S6651-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6651-S6652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RELATIVE TO THE DEATH OF RONALD WILSON REAGAN\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The hour of 11:30 having arrived, the \nSenate will proceed to consideration of a resolution honoring the \nformer President Ronald Wilson Reagan, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 373) relative to the death of Ronald \n     Wilson Reagan, a former President of the United States.\n\n                              S.

By request, Senators are asked to vote \nfrom their desks.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, these past few days we have seen an \nextraordinary outpouring of affection for our 40th President, Ronald \nWilson Reagan. In a few short hours, he will lie in state under the \nCapitol dome where dignitaries from around the world and citizens from \nacross the country will pay their respects to the man from Dixon.\n\n[[Page S6652]]\n\n  In his 1982 State of the Union address, President Reagan told the \nNation: We don't have to turn to our history books for heroes; they are \nall around us. In life, Ronald Reagan was a hero to millions. To the \nfreedom fighters in the Soviet Union, to his fellow citizens striving \ntoward that American dream, Ronald Reagan told the world that we are \nmeant to be free.\n  He was a man of faith and deeply held convictions. Like James \nMadison, Ronald Reagan believed that in the creation of our Republic \nwas the hand of God. He believed our freedoms flow not from the State \nbut from the Almighty. Our task was and remains to awaken in the people \nthis essential truth.\n  I close with a story I believe captures Ronald Reagan's remarkable \ncharacter, his courage, and his vision. It was 1997. From a news report \nwas a story of an emigre.\n\n       Walking in Arm and Hammer Park near his home, Reagan was \n     approached by an elderly tourist and his 12-year-old \n     grandson, Ukranian emigres now living near Toledo, OH. They \n     spoke with him for a moment and the grandfather snapped a \n     picture of the boy sitting with the former president. An \n     article about the encounter and the picture appeared first in \n     the Toledo Blade and then in newspapers around the country. \n     The other day, the grandfather recalled their meeting. We \n     went to the park for a picnic with our friends, he said, and \n     then he saw President Reagan. And we began to cheer him and \n     said, Mr. President, thank you for everything you did for the \n     Jewish people, for Soviet people, to destroy the Communist \n     empire. And he said, yes, that is my job.\n\n  Ronald Wilson Reagan was raised in a small town. Part of him remained \na small town citizen all of his life. Not in the self conscious way one \nthinks of a politician stumping on the campaign trail. Ronald Reagan's \nsmall town roots informed the way he viewed the body politic--what he \nbelieved people wanted from life, from each other and from government.\n  As he explained, when a person grows up in a small town,\n\n       You get to know people as individuals, not as blocs or \n     members of special interest groups. You discover that, \n     despite their differences, most people have a lot in common . \n     . . [W]e all want freedom and liberty, peace, love and \n     security, a good home, and a chance to worship God in our own \n     way; we all want the chance to get ahead and make our \n     children's lives better than our own. We all want the chance \n     to work at a job of our own choosing and to be fairly \n     rewarded for it.\n\n  Ronald Reagan believed that the government should serve the people. \nHe believed that the strength of our economy came from the creativity, \ningenuity and productivity of the individual, not from the plans and \nschemes of government bureaucrats or intellectual elites.\n  This view of America's economic success guided his economic policies \nhere at home, and, in no small way, shaped his political policies \nabroad.\n  When Ronald Reagan became President, the American economy was in a \nshambles. Inflation was in the double digits. Interest rates were \nsoaring. Americans had to wait in endless lines to pump overpriced gas. \nReal incomes had stagnated and the American worker was demoralized. In \nhis 1989 ``Speaking My Mind'' collection of essays and speeches, Ronald \nReagan reflected that:\n\n       Here we were, a country bursting with economic promise, and \n     yet our political leadership had gone out of its way to \n     frustrate America's natural economic strength. It made no \n     sense. My attitude had always been--let the people flourish.\n\n  So, he set about slashing Federal income taxes and cutting burdensome \nregulations. It was his mission to free the American worker and unleash \nthe American entrepreneur. When he came to office, the top marginal tax \nrate was 70 percent. By the time he left, it was a mere 28 percent. His \nsweeping tax reforms overhauled the tax code and removed 6 million \ntaxpayers from the tax rolls.\n  At the same time, President Reagan gave Federal Reserve chairman Paul \nVolcker free reign to tighten the money supply and bring down \ninflation.\n  Together, these policies worked.\n  True to the President's forecast, as the economy grew, so, too, did \ntax revenues. Tax revenues increased faster than GDP. By 1990, the \neconomy had grown by a third--or as the Wall Street Journal put it, \n``roughly the size of Germany.'' Over the course of his presidency, the \neconomy created 19 million jobs and the stock market hit a record high. \nAmerica enjoyed the longest economic expansion up to that time.\n  Throughout, President Reagan was assailed for the growing deficit. In \ntypical Washington fashion, he got the blame for adverse economic \nnumbers, but never the credit for economic success. Contrary to his \ncritics, however, the Federal deficit fell from 6.3 percent of GNP in \nfiscal year 1983 to 2.3 percent in 1988. The deficit actually shrank as \na percentage of Gross National Product.\n  At the time, his policies were dubbed, ``Reaganomics.'' Now, they're \nconsidered common sense. President Reagan's guiding principle was \nsimple, yet profound: government policies should grow the economy, not \nmanage [or redistribute?] it. The impact of this idea was so great \nthat, now, even the other side of the aisle speaks of targeted tax cuts \nand tax credits, and no longer openly campaigns to raise our taxes.\n  Indeed, President Clinton crystallized the Reagan Revolution when he \ndeclared, ``The era of big government is over.''\n  President Reagan believed in the dreams and dignity of the \nindividual. As he said in his second inaugural address, ``There are no \nlimits to growth and human progress, when men and women are free to \nfollow their dreams.''\n  Ronald Reagan reminded the American people that economic liberty and \nhuman freedom are two sides of the same coin.\n  Some call it the Reagan Revolution. Others call it the Reagan \nRestoration. I prefer the latter term. The man from Dixon--lifeguard, \nradio announcer, actor, governor, father, adoring husband, and \nPresident of the United States--restored not only our confidence, but \nour fundamental understanding of the source of America's greatness: the \nAmerican people.\n  Indeed, America was blessed to have such a President. Now he will \nenter the history books as one of our greatest. God bless Ronald Wilson \nReagan. God bless America.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today because a mighty oak has \nfallen. Ronald Reagan has left his life here on Earth, but oh what a \nlife it was. Born in the middle of our great Republic in the beginning \nof the last century, his was an American tale from start to finish.\n  Jack and Nelle Reagan brought a son into the world in Tampico, IL, in \n1911. Jack was a shoe salesman with an Irishman's flare for \nstorytelling. Nelle was a devout Christian who made ends meet by doing \nother people's sewing out of their home. When Jack first saw their \nhealthy baby in his crib, he looked at this little baby and said he \nlooked like a ``little fat Dutchman.'' And the nickname stuck, \n``Dutch.''\n  Times were hard for the Reagans. He commented years later that:\n\n       Our family didn't exactly come from the wrong side of the \n     tracks, but we were certainly within sound of the train \n     whistles.\n\n  Even then, it was in Ronald Reagan's character to look for the Sun \nbehind the clouds. Growing up, he lived a typical American boy's life. \nHe was a lifeguard in the summer and a football player in the fall. In \nthe fading years, when Alzheimer's robbed him of most of his memory, he \ncould still summon up his youth in Illinois, proudly recalling the 77 \nlives he saved as a lifeguard from the teeming Rock River, notching \neach one on a log on the shore.\n  In Illinois, he discovered there was more to life than just football \nand lifeguarding. There was also acting. Connecting with an audience \nplugged him into a broader world. As he later said:\n\n       For a kid suffering childhood pangs of insecurity, the \n     applause was music.\n\n  Ambition led him westward out of Illinois; Hollywood, to be exact. \nThere, as we all know, he started his successful acting career and, \nmore importantly, met a young actress from Chicago named Nancy Davis. \nShe became the love of his life. Nancy was focused, smart, and loved \nher Ronnie. Jimmy Stewart once remarked:\n\n       If Ronnie had married Nancy the first time, he would have \n     won an Academy Award.\n\n  But gradually his time in front of an audience changed from the stage \nand screen to the assembly hall. Time constraints prevent me from \nfollowing his ascent to the highest office in the land. Let me simply \ncomment that for most of us being a successful actor and pitchman, \nunion president, two-term Governor of our Nation's largest State, and a \nnational figure to boot would have been enough of a career, especially \nat the age of 69. But Ronald Reagan had other thoughts, and so began \nhis run against President Jimmy Carter for the Presidency in 1980.\n  Neck and neck until the debate a week before the election, Reagan \nbroke it wide open when he closed by asking Americans a simple \nquestion: Are you better off than you were 4 years ago?\n  On election day, Reagan won a smashing victory, winning 44 of 50 \nStates. He would top that mark in 1984, winning 49 out of 50 States.\n  I have listened to and read countless people reflecting on what \nPresident Reagan meant to them and to America. Were there enough time, \nI would fill up the rest of the afternoon with my thoughts about this \ngreat man. But I will limit my observations to what I think will be, in \naddition to restoring America's faith in itself, the way history will \nremember Ronald Reagan, the peacemaker.\n  I want to address the question, What does it mean to have won the \ncold war? Revisionists suggest that Ronald Reagan had little to do with \nthe Soviet Union's fall which they now claim was just inevitable. I can \ntell you no one thought that in 1979. Communism was on the rise and \nfreedom was in retreat. The United States was the toothless tiger with \nthe uncertain future. Energy shortages crippled us, and rampant crime \nhunted us down. Interest rates for homes, cars, and businesses were sky \nhigh. Our economy was wrenched back and forth between bouts of \nrecession and inflation, both at the same time. America's decline was \nmarked by new, unfamiliar words. We learned stagflation, \n``taxflation,'' and, of course, we learned malaise.\n  America's economy was not the only thing in decline. So, too, was our \nforeign policy. Still suffering from a Vietnam syndrome, we watched and \ndid\n\n[[Page S6654]]\n\nnothing as Afghanistan was invaded by the Soviets, as hostages in Iran \nwere seized, and as Cuban puppets invaded Africa and Central America. \nOur Navy was weak. Our planes couldn't fly. Our Army lacked volunteers \nand morale. The nuclear balance was tipping, and our intelligence \nservices were ravaged by firings and mismanagement.\n  We were declining and the Soviet Union was rising. Some people were \nready to give up. Others suggested the Presidency was too big and \ncomplicated a job for any single person. It seemed as if we had lost \nour nerve. But not Ronald Reagan. You see, he had a vision.\n  In 1982, he explained his ``sick bear'' theory:\n\n       The Soviet Empire is faltering because rigid centralized \n     control has destroyed innovation, efficiency and individual \n     achievement. . . . The Soviet dictatorship has forged the \n     largest armed force in the world . . . by preempting the \n     human needs of its people and, in the end, this course will \n     undermine the foundations of the Soviet system.\n\n  With his customary humor, he had a memorable way of explaining this. \nHe talked of a Soviet citizen who went to a Soviet bureau of \ntransportation to buy a car. After paying and filling out all the \nforms, he is told by the seller of the car: Come back in 10 years to \nget your car.\n  The man asks: In the morning or the afternoon?\n  The official responds: Well, we are talking about 10 years from now; \nwhat difference does it make whether it is the morning or afternoon?\n  The man replies: Well, the plumber is coming in the morning.\n  Beneath the humor, President Reagan knew the serious truth. The \nSoviet Union was as inherently weak as the U.S. economy was inherently \nstrong, a fact too few recognized. So when President Reagan's policies \nbegan to revitalize our economy, the confidence restored here was \nmatched by new uncertainty over in the Soviet Union.\n  Others have and will talk about the Reagan revolution here at home, \nbut in terms of our victory in the cold war, the Reagan economic \nrecovery was the first body-blow that eventually exorcized the demon of \ncommunism from the Soviet Union.\n  The real trouble for the Soviet Union was not Reagan's policies, but \nReagan's values, his courage, and his willpower. Before he was ever \nelected, President Reagan recognized that the Soviet Union was an \n``arsenal of anarchy'' throughout the world. It was a sickness of the \nhuman condition, he said. And President Reagan was never afraid to do \nthat which so many leaders lack the courage to do: look at evil and \ncall it by its name. In this regard, Reagan was like Churchill. Reagan \nwas the nemesis of communism, just as Churchill was of nazism. He \nunderstood the evil that communism represented and what it would do if \nunchecked.\n  Interestingly, Reagan's understanding of this evil did not begin with \nthe fate of millions, but of just one. In May of 1975, a 5-year-old boy \nfell into the Spree River, which divided then-Communist East Berlin \nfrom free West Berlin. As firemen from West Berlin--firemen, not \nsoldiers--started to go to the boy's rescue, an East German patrol boat \nbarred their entry into East German waters. The boy drowned.\n  The mayor of West Berlin described that refused rescue as ``an \nincomprehensible and frightful act, placing political considerations \nbefore the saving of a human life.'' But for Reagan, it was the sad \npersonification of a harsh and enduring reality: Communism is a system \nwhere every human life is sublimated to the ruthless needs of the \nstate.\n  Focused on the value of a single human life, Ronald Reagan looked \nacross the globe and saw 600 million people living like slaves under \nthe Communist lash. He did not mince words or deeds. He dubbed the \nSoviet Union the ``evil empire,'' a description brutally accurate, yet \noffensive to the tender sensibilities of most of the media and \nintelligentsia here at home. He called for a massive defense increase--\n``peace through strength,'' he called it--and some even in his own \nCabinet opposed it.\n\n  In the face of criticism, Reagan strengthened our defense. He quoted \nDemosthenes in dismissing the Soviets' empty assurances of their good \nintentions on arms control:\n\n       What sane man would let another man's word rather than his \n     deeds tell him who is at war and who is at peace with him?\n\n  He then translated that demand into a Russian saying of no uncertain \nwords--doveryai, no proveryai. In Russian, that means ``trust but \nverify.''\n  Ronald Reagan did not have timid dreams. He wasn't interested in \nslowing the decline of freedom or just holding its position steady; he \nwanted freedom to ring across the globe and communism to be relegated \nto the ash heap of history. So he went to the Berlin Wall to call out \nin front of that colossal affront to freedom: ``Mr. Gorbachev, tear \ndown this wall.''\n  He left Reykjavik when it was clear that Mr. Gorbachev was only \nbargaining for the end of the Strategic Defense Initiative, which \nmatching, the Soviets knew, would spend them into oblivion. Margaret \nThatcher notes that Reykjavik, deplored as a loss by Reagan's critics, \nparticularly by the European and American intelligentsia, marked the \nbeginning of the end of the Soviet Union.\n  Of course, all the significant arms control reductions came after \nReagan walked away from Reykjavik. But today, President Reagan is \nvindicated by some 600 million people who breathe freely because of the \ncollapse of the Soviet empire.\n  So what does it mean to liberate almost 600 million from fear and \nterror? It means 49 million Ukrainians will never again worry about a \nclass purge.\n  It means 17 million former East Germans will never be grabbed in the \nnight by the STASI, the secret police of Eric Honneker.\n  It means 38 million Poles will never fear General Jaruzelski \nattempting to crush the Solidarity free labor movement.\n  It means 22 million Romanians will never know the tortured madness \nand human experimentation of Nicolae Ceausescu.\n  It means 16 million in the Czech Republic and Slovakia will never \nhear tanks rumbling through their city streets to crush self-rule.\n  It means tens of millions of former West Germans lead lives oblivious \nto the cosmic nervousness that gripped their mother's and father's \ngeneration.\n  It means that 5 million in Finland no longer look across the Gulf of \nFinland with dread at 7.2 million people in Latvia, Estonia, and \nLithuania, who lived in slavery as a warning to any neighbors who would \ndare dissent from the Soviet world view.\n  In all, 600 million lives were emancipated by the victory in the cold \nwar--the greatest liberation in the history of mankind, and hopefully \nfor all time.\n  Now, having said all of that, let me just mention how much I miss \nthat sweet-hearted man, especially his sense of humor. I have been \nreminded from all the replayed speeches just how wonderful he was. For \nexample, during an exchange with the press one day, he said:\n\n       I have given my aides instructions that if trouble breaks \n     out in any of the world's hot spots, they should wake me up \n     immediately--even if I am in a cabinet meeting.\n\n  It makes you wonder what President Reagan said to Saint Peter. \nSomething witty, no doubt, and delivered with a warm smile.\n  So now the long goodbye that Mrs. Reagan, his rock and strength and \nthe love of his life, has spoken of so movingly is nearly complete. So \nI will close with President Reagan's own words in his courageous letter \nto the American people upon discovery of the disease that would \nultimately bring about his fall. President Reagan said 10 years ago:\n\n       When the Lord calls me home, whenever that may be, I will \n     leave the greatest love for this country of ours and eternal \n     optimism for its future. I now begin the journey that will \n     lead me into the sunset of my life. I know that for America \n     there will always be a bright dawn ahead.\n\n  God bless Ronald Reagan, an American hero.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, our Nation has come together this week \nto mourn the passing of former President Ronald Reagan. However \nanticipated his death may have been, it is still a profound loss for \nthe Reagan family. Our thoughts and prayers are with them all and \nespecially with former First Lady Nancy Reagan.\n  However, knowing the kind of man Ronald Reagan was, knowing his \nrelentless optimism and his sunny disposition, something tells me he \nwould\n\n[[Page S6655]]\n\nprefer that Americans spend this week remembering and celebrating his \nunique character and quality. ``America in mourning'' just does not \nseem Reaganesque because Ronald Reagan was always about ``morning in \nAmerica.'' He always looked at the bright side of every situation or \ncircumstance. I remember the story he told about the little boy who \nwalked into a barn and encountered a huge pile of manure. The boy, who \nwas not the least bit disappointed, broke into a big smile and said: I \njust know there is a pony in here somewhere. That was the Ronald Reagan \nwe remember and admire.\n  Iowans relate strongly to Ronald Reagan because his roots were our \nroots. He grew up next door in smalltown Illinois and spent 5 formative \nyears in Iowa. In fact, this was where the young Ronald Reagan found \nhis voice as the Great Communicator--first as a radio announcer at WOC \nRadio in Davenport and later at WHO Radio in Des Moines where he became \none of the most popular sports broadcasters in the region. That was at \nthe height of the Great Depression.\n  He remembered this period with obvious fondness. In his \nautobiography, ``An American Life,'' he wrote:\n\n       I spent four years at station WHO in Des Moines and they \n     were among the most pleasant of my life. At 22, I'd \n     achieved my dream; I was a sports announcer. If I had \n     stopped there, I believe I would have been happy the rest \n     of my life.\n\n  During his two terms in the White House, I met President Reagan on \nmany occasions, and just about every time he would eagerly tell me he \nhad been an announcer at WHO Radio. He regaled me with stories of how, \nsitting in his studio in Des Moines, he faked the play by play of the \nChicago Cubs baseball game based upon wire reports as they came \nthrough. He seemed to have this fixed in his mind, that when he would \nsee me, it was Tom Harkin and WHO. If this is Harkin, I am going to \ntell him about my time at WHO. It sort of became a thing that every \ntime we met, he, again, would tell me some story about his time at WHO \nRadio. So that was my experience with the Reagan charm.\n  We disagreed on many important issues, but you could not come into \ncontact with this man and not feel his personal warmth and charm. In \nfact, I have been struck this week by the bipartisan affection for this \nformer President. He was the genuine article, a man who embodied so \nmany of the traits we hold dear as Americans. We remember his \nconviction, his courage, his lack of pretentiousness, and, yes, his \noptimism.\n  On a personal note, I will always be grateful to President Reagan for \nsigning into law my bill to establish the National Institute on \nDeafness and Communication Disorders at the National Institutes of \nHealth in 1988. Quite frankly, his advisers urged him to veto the bill, \nbut the President, who himself suffered from hearing loss, vetoed his \nadvisers. He signed the bill into law. As a result, we have had a \nseries of medical breakthroughs that are helping millions of Americans \ncope with hearing loss and communication disorders.\n  Lastly, he and Nancy fought a heroic battle with Alzheimer's disease, \nand they did a great deal to raise the level of awareness and \nunderstanding of this terrible disease. I am especially proud of the \ncourageous leadership Nancy Reagan has displayed in our efforts to find \na cure for this deadly disease by her advocating a more expanded stem \ncell research program in America.\n  As I said, the most fitting way to pay tribute to President Reagan is \nnot so much to mourn his death as to celebrate his life and to honor \nhis service to our country. As he lies in state at the Capitol this \nweek, a thankful American nation will say farewell to a truly unique \nAmerican.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \nAmerican legend, President Ronald Reagan. Like all Americans, I was \nsaddened to learn of his passing over the weekend. I had left our \nRepublican State convention at a time when it was moving across the \nfloor that he might be in his final hours. Of course, all of us started \nreminiscing. It was a moment of great loss, but yet a recollection of \nhis humor, his contagious optimism, and the historic accomplishments he \nmade for our country really were comforting and engendered so many \nwonderful moments.\n  Although I was not a Member of this body while he was in office, I \nhave lived and served under his conservative principles and ideologies. \nHe was in his political prime when I was just beginning in politics. \nDuring his first campaign, my husband Ray was chairman of the Texas \nRepublican Party and spent many hours traveling with him across Texas. \nIn 1992, I was honored to be temporary chair of the Republican National \nConvention in Houston, TX, when he delivered his very important message \nthat turned out to be his goodbye to America. It was there that he left \nus with these final thoughts:\n\n       Whatever else history may say about me when I'm gone, I \n     hope it will record that I appealed to your best hopes, not \n     your worst fears, to your confidence rather than your doubts. \n     My dream is that you will travel the road ahead with \n     liberty's lamp guiding your steps and opportunity's arm \n     steadying your way. . . . May each of you have the heart to \n     conceive, the understanding to direct, and the hand to \n     execute works that will make the world a little better for \n     your having been here. . . . My fellow Americans, may every \n     dawn be a great new beginning for America and every evening \n     bring us closer to that shining city upon a hill.\n\n  At a time of great despair in our Nation, Ronald Reagan came into \noffice and restored hope. He was an unequaled champion of freedom, \nsmaller Government, and market-oriented principles. His philosophies \nguided our Nation to become the economic and military superpower it is \ntoday. Of course, he was often called the Great Communicator for his \nability to give a rousing speech that could both rally the troops and \nyet make an individual in the crowd of thousands feel as if they were \nhaving a heart-to-heart talk.\n  Beyond his optimism, his confidence, and graceful charm was a man of \naction who implemented great change in the United States of America. \nUnder his leadership, our Nation sowed seeds of prosperity and reduced \nregulatory burdens on small business. He lowered taxes for all \nAmericans, including reducing the top marginal rate from an oppressive \n70 percent to approximately half that, offering new incentives to \ncreate wealth and jobs and rebuild America.\n  He encouraged Americans to embrace their own destiny and realized \nthat Government was not the answer to social ills; people were. Good \npeople working in concert to better their communities and their fellow \nman could accomplish far more than bureaucracy, from his vantage point.\n  Perhaps most important, President Reagan took the steps to ultimately \nwin the cold war. He pursued peace through strength and achieved an \noverwhelming victory that was inconceivable to a generation that was \nraised with fallout drills and backyard bunkers.\n  Who can forget the famous challenge he laid down when he cried, ``Mr. \nGorbachev, tear down this wall''? They were indeed great, dramatic \nwords but more importantly words of action. Two and a half years later, \nwhat once seemed a permanent divider through the heart of Berlin was \ntorn down piece by piece, section by section, until it was reduced to a \npile of rubble.\n  Visitors to the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center \nin Washington, DC, can view a section of that wall donated by the \npeople of Berlin in honor of the President and in recognition of his \nleadership. The segment, which is over 9 feet high and weighs almost 3 \ntons, is from a section of the wall near the Brandenburg Gate where \nPresident Reagan issued that challenge. It stands as a stark reminder \nof the great shift in global politics that spread freedom in Europe and \nencouraged new generations to pursue democracy.\n  Today, we again find ourselves in a fight for freedom. This \ngeneration, like their World War II grandparents and cold war parents, \nhas been called to stand and fight for freedom. Today, we are grappling \nwith a new threat: global terrorism, an enemy with no borders, no \nuniforms, no respect for traditional rules of war, and more importantly \nno respect for human life.\n  World War II took bitter years of fighting and sacrifice. The cold \nwar took decades of dedication and patience. This battle against \nterrorism\n\n[[Page S6656]]\n\nrequires all that and more. The question is: Will our generation meet \nthe test? Will we have what it takes to win the peace? I believe we do. \nI believe the strength, perseverance, and patriotism that Ronald Reagan \nembodied will help see us through.\n  In 1987, he addressed a joint session of Congress saying:\n\n       Let it never be said of this generation of Americans that \n     we became so obsessed with failure that we refused to take \n     risks that could further the cause of peace and freedom in \n     the world.\n\n  Since learning of his passing last weekend, elected officials, former \nCabinet members, and newspapers across the world have been penning \neulogies, remembrances, and tributes to the beloved President.\n  James Baker, his former Chief of Staff and Treasury Secretary:\n\n       President Reagan restored America's source of pride and \n     confidence in itself. He was a wonderful person to work for \n     and a truly great President. His willingness to stick to his \n     principles changed the world.\n\n  Former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher:\n\n       He will be missed not only by those who knew him, and not \n     only by the nation that he served so proudly and loved so \n     deeply, but also by the millions of men and women who live in \nfreedom today because of the policies he pursued. To have achieved so \nmuch against so many odds and with such humor and humanity made Ronald \nReagan a truly great American hero.\n\n  Secretary of State Colin Powell, who served as his National Security \nAdviser, said:\n\n       President Reagan fueled the spirit of America. His smile, \n     his optimism, his total belief in the ultimate triumph of \n     democracy and freedom, and his willingness to act on that \n     belief, helped end the Cold War and usher in a new and \n     brighter phase of history.\n\n  Mikhail Gorbachev, once Reagan's adversary, called him:\n\n       A true leader, a man of his word and an optimist . . . He \n     has earned a place in history and in people's hearts.\n\n  Finally, his Vice President, later our President, George H.W. Bush, \nhas been giving interviews about how much fun he was and how they had \nlunch every week together and sometimes they would talk substance, \nsometimes they would talk policy, and sometimes they would just have a \ngood time. They were very close, and yet he never lost that laser beam \nfocus on the big issues, the things that really mattered that would \nmove us one step toward the peace through strength that was his guiding \nprinciple.\n  Indeed, his lasting place in the hearts of all Americans has been \nevidenced by the outpouring of love and admiration that we have seen \nacross the Nation and around the world. Ronald Reagan was a leader who \ntouched people with his words, inspired them with his actions, and led \nby his example.\n  On November 5, 1994, nearly a decade ago, President Reagan announced \nto the world that he had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, the \nillness that would ultimately take his life. His poise and hopeful \nspirit, even in the face of the heartbreaking years ahead, were \nremarkable. He said:\n\n       . . . Let me thank you, the American people, for giving me \n     the great honor of allowing me to serve as your president. \n     When the Lord calls me home, whenever that day may be, I will \n     leave with the greatest love for this country of ours and \n     eternal optimism for its future. I now begin the journey that \n     will lead me into the sunset of my life. I know that for \n     America there will always be a bright dawn ahead. Thank you, \n     my friends. May God always bless you.\n\n  Standing by his side through good times and bad, his beloved wife \nNancy, a beautiful woman, very slight in stature but strong as steel. \nTheirs was a partnership in every respect and one of the great love \nstories of our time. Ronald Wilson Reagan was a great President. He \nleft an indelible impression on our country. As we say farewell, our \nthoughts and prayers are with Nancy and his family. We thank them and \nwe thank the Lord that he gave us Ronald Reagan at a time when our \ncountry needed him the most.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Madam President, as Americans gather in our Capitol and \nacross the country to remember and pay tribute to President Ronald \nReagan, we have been provided a very special opportunity to reflect on \nhis great achievements as our Commander in Chief, as well as the \ntremendous personal strength which he brought to the Oval Office.\n  But as we salute President Reagan for his leadership, his integrity, \nand his vision, I am struck by the very personal nature of so many of \nthese memories and stories. Whether here in Washington or out across \nthe country, whether it is a U.S. Senator or a teacher in a small \nschool, it seems that so many of these recollections begin with phrases \nsuch as, ``I remember seeing him during his first visit to our State,'' \nor ``I shook his hand when he visited our factory,'' or ``I recall a \nstory that President Reagan loved to tell,'' or even ``because of \nRonald Reagan, I chose to run for office.''\n  These recollections are enormously personal, but I think they are a \ntestament to the way he touched people in a very deep and unique way. \nHe affected the lives of millions of people in America and around the \nworld in countless encounters. Many of these encounters may have been \nfor only a moment or two in a life that spanned decades, but his gift \nwas in his ability to make a strong connection that had real power, the \npower to bridge generations, the power to last a lifetime, and the \npower to change a life as well.\n  We remember his touch, his smile, and his encouragement, not simply \nbecause when he walked into a room Ronald Reagan conveyed a great \npersonal warmth. That was certainly special in and of itself, and \nsomething that anyone who had the chance to meet him or see him in \nperson would always remember, but it was because this personal \nconnection conveyed a sense of purpose, a sense of kindness, and an \nenormous love for public service. That was the power of the Great \nCommunicator, the power of the personal connection that he made.\n  I consider this the greatest tribute of all. Despite the myriad and \nextraordinary legislative and foreign policy victories of President \nReagan such as cutting taxes and reforming the code, rebuilding our \nNation's defenses, turning back the Soviets in Afghanistan, or leading \nthe West to a lasting victory in the cold war--despite the enormous \nsubstance of these achievements, Ronald Reagan, in the end, is not \nremembered first and foremost as a clever politician with great \nmachinations of political strategy or hardball political \ntactics. Instead, the descriptive words that we heard here and across \nthe country over and over again are integrity, character, courage, and \nleadership. These are qualities that transcend politics and qualities \nthat transcend time. They are qualities that inspire the young and \ncomfort the aged. They are the qualities of heroes.\n\n  Ronald Reagan was fond of describing the heroes he saw in audiences \nat every speech he made or heroes he would see as he traveled across \nthe country in every corner of America and coming from every walk of \nlife. He saw in these men and women the very strength of character, \ncourage, integrity, and leadership that he knew made our country unique \nand which kept our country prosperous and free. But by bringing these \nvery same qualities to the Oval Office and drawing on them time and \ntime again to guide our Nation through demanding and even dark times, \nhe left a legacy that shined like the city on a hill which he knew \nAmerica could be and would again become. It is a heroic legacy, and it \nis the legacy of a great American.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I join with my colleagues in paying \nprofound respects to our late President Ronald Reagan, and I do so with \na deep, deep sense of humility.\n  It is interesting, I walked into my reception room just the other \nday. No\n\n[[Page S6657]]\n\nmatter how long one is around here, I think you sort of have to go back \nand refresh your recollection as to what you put up in your reception \nroom, and I found six different photographs of myself with the good \nfortune to be in the presence of our former great President.\n  I think back over my 26 years in the Senate, having had the privilege \nof working with all the Presidents in that period of time and, prior \nthereto, those Presidents when I was in the Department of Defense. \nAgain, I say with a deep sense of respect and humility, I believe it is \nclear in my mind that I had the greatest opportunity to work with \nPresident Reagan, and probably had more opportunities to be with him in \na professional capacity than any other President.\n  I was ranking for a period of time on the Armed Services Committee \nand in every way supported him in his remarkable vision to build and \nrestore the Armed Forces of the United States, which buildup, in my \njudgment, was a major contributor, if not the major contributor, to the \neventual demise of the Soviet Union.\n  There are several pictures of when he visited my home, which was a \nfarm in Virginia, a farm in an area where I grew up in the summers as a \nvery young man. He loved coming down to the farm. My farm was adjacent \nto the home of former President Kennedy, and the owner at that time was \nBill Clements, who was a former Deputy Secretary of Defense. I served \nunder him as Secretary of the Navy. He and I were very close friends. I \nintroduced him to that countryside, and he bought the Kennedy home, \nwhich is a very small, modest home, reconstructed, so to speak, and \nenlarged by President Kennedy and Jacqueline Kennedy, his lovely, dear \nwife.\n  President Ronald Reagan and Bill Clements set it up so he could come \ndown there and spend some quiet downtime. And he loved to ride horses. \nIn those days, I had a pretty good collection of horses, and I was \nhappy to share them with him on occasion. He rode around on my farm. I \ncertainly enjoyed being with him on several occasions. I have one of \nthe pictures of the two of us riding together.\n  I mention that because in that informal setting when there was just \nthe two of us riding horses--I remember one time Mrs. Reagan was with \nus--this particular time I remember very well. We rode high up on the \nhill on the back of the farm. The hill has a vista down into the valley \nof Virginia. We checked the horses and began to talk about his great \nadmiration for Stonewall Jackson and the various campaigns Jackson had \nup and down that valley during the Civil War.\n  I was so impressed with his remarkable knowledge of the facts of that \nperiod of history, and in later years, in other discussions with him, \nagain he would frequently make reference to the history of the United \nStates. His knowledge was really second to none. He had a \nmagnificent command of American history.\n\n  But on this particular day, he reflected on a little self-deprecating \nhumor, which he was very good at. He told me when Pearl Harbor \noccurred, he was a lieutenant in the Army Reserve Cavalry, again \nbecause he loved horses, he loved to ride. He promptly went down, Pearl \nHarbor Day or the day after, whatever the case may be, and said: I want \nto be activated. And sure enough, he was eventually activated. He \nwanted to take, as we say in the horse world, the bit in his teeth and \ncharge--``Send me right away out to the front.''\n  I remember he gestured with his hand. But, no, they sent him to an \nold cavalry post, which was down in one of the Indian territories, and \nhe laughed and joked and said: When we put those posts out there, the \nprimary thing was to secure the settlers and to hopefully strike a \npeaceful balance with the Indians and make life such that those \nterritories could be developed.\n  But he said: I did a little homework--as he always did--before I went \nto this cavalry post and studied who the commanding officer and the \nother officers were.\n  Well, in those days, the custom in the military, particularly the \nArmy, was that when a soldier reported, perhaps with his wife, whatever \nthe case may be, the commanding officer would have them over to pay \ntheir respects, to get to know each other as soon as they arrived on \nthe post. In the old days with the covered wagons, it was a long \njourney. By the time they reached their destination, they were pretty \nwell exhausted--food and otherwise. So this was a chance to introduce \nthem.\n  Reagan described the evening with great humor. He said: I walked in \nand there was the little colonel. He was a rather short fellow. He was \nall dressed in his uniform, with his riding boots, his Sam Browne belt. \nI was there in my lieutenant's uniform. He greeted me very warmly. He \nlooked at me.\n  And President Reagan had a remarkable way of cocking his head. His \nbody language was extraordinary. His walk, his mannerism, it was a \ngreat part of his character that I admired, how he conveyed so much \nfeeling with just the way he would use his hands and his head, his \nstride. It emulated such tremendous confidence he had in himself.\n  But anyway, the colonel said: Now, Reagan, where have I seen you? Do \nI know you?\n  Lieutenant Reagan said: No, sir, we have never met.\n  The colonel failed to guess. He circled back again and said: Look \nhere, young man, I know somehow I have seen you. Let's figure out where \nthat was. What do you do?\n  And Lieutenant Reagan said: Well, sir, I am involved in making \nmovies.\n  Suddenly this colonel became silent. Then he said: That is where I \nhave seen you. You were in that movie called ``Brother Rat,'' which was \nabout the Virginia Military Institute, and that movie didn't exactly, \nin my judgment, properly characterize the magnificence of that \ninstitute. As a matter of fact, I think it reflected dishonor upon that \ninstitute. And I remember you were in that movie. Lieutenant, your duty \non this post is over. I will transfer you.\n\n  In due course the President said he was transferred off the post, but \nI mention that because those of us who had the opportunity to be with \nhim, particularly in informal settings, remember so well the \nmagnificence of this man, the lessons he taught each of us.\n  Again, going back to those days in the buildup of the Soviet Union, \nhe was very conscious of the fact that the Soviet Union was on pretty \nshaky financial status at that stage and that the cold war posed a \nthreat to the United States--intercontinental missiles, the threat to \nthe standard forces of NATO, the Warsaw Pact nations, all of which are \nnow, save one, members of NATO.\n  Those of us who worked in the Senate--I remember John Stennis and \nBarry Goldwater, Scoop Jackson, John Tower, to name but a few--formed a \ngroup to work with the President in a bipartisan way on trying to \nstrengthen America such that we could send a strong signal to the \nworld, particularly the Soviet Union, that we mean business. Don't ever \nentertain the idea of striking out against the free world, be it the \nUnited States or our NATO allies.\n  And the rest is history. ``Tear down that wall, Mr. Gorbachev.'' And \nthat wall did come down. Those were extraordinary days I was able to \nshare with him, and I say that with the deepest sense of humility. But \nI don't want to prolong my remarks.\n  I do want to tell one other chapter. Just a few days ago I was a part \nof a delegation that went over to the Normandy 60th anniversary. \nSenator Akaka was with me and the distinguished Senator from New Jersey \nand his lovely new bride were with me. So there were three of us who \nhad some experience in World War II, of the six here in the Senate. We \nspent a wonderful day at the ceremonies. But the next day we took time \nto go out to Pointe du Hoc. It was fascinating.\n  There on June 6, 2004, I had been on that same spot of land 20 years \nbefore with Ronald Reagan. I remember the delegation. Strom Thurmond \nled it. Three of us went with him. Of course, Senator Thurmond had made \na landing on the beaches on D-day. Other Senators, the Senator from \nNevada, and Howard Cannon had likewise participated in the D-day \nlandings. Of course, I was at that time the youngster, 17 years old, in \nthat group back in the United States getting prepared to take our \ntraining and become replacements someday. That is all history. There I \nstood on that ground, and he had passed away within that 24-hour \nperiod.\n  So I thought today I would read some of the remarks he made.\n\n[[Page S6658]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the entire speech, a very short \nspeech, in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    President Reagan's Speech in Normandy on D-Day 40th Anniversary\n\n                              June 6, 2004\n\n       We're here to mark that day in history when the Allied \n     peoples joined in battle to reclaim this continent to \n     liberty. For four long years, much of Europe had been under a \n     terrible shadow. Free nations had fallen, Jews cried out in \n     the camps, millions cried out for liberation. Europe was \n     enslaved, and the world prayed for its rescue. Here in \n     Normandy the rescue began. Here the Allies stood and fought \n     against tyranny in a giant undertaking unparalleled in human \n     history.\n       We stand on a lonely, windswept point on the northern shore \n     of France. The air is soft, but forty years ago at this \n     moment, the air was dense with smoke and the cries of men, \n     and the air was filled with the crack of rifle fire and the \n     roar of cannon. At dawn, on the morning of the 6th of June \n     1944, 225 Rangers jumped off the British landing craft and \n     ran to the bottom of these cliffs. Their mission was one of \n     the most difficult and daring of the invasion: to climb these \n     sheer and desolate cliffs and take out the enemy guns. The \n     Allies had been told that some of the mightiest of these guns \n     were here and they would be trained on the beaches to stop \n     the Allied advance.\n       The Rangers looked up and saw the enemy soldiers--at the \n     edge of the cliffs shooting down at them with machine-guns \n     and throwing grenades. And the American Rangers began to \n     climb. They shot rope ladders over the face of these cliffs \n     and began to pull themselves up. When one Ranger fell, \n     another would take his place. When one rope was cut, a Ranger \n     would grab another and begin his climb again. They climbed, \n     shot back, and held their footing. Soon, one by one, the \n     Rangers pulled themselves over the top, and in seizing the \n     firm land at the top of these cliffs, they began to seize \n     back the continent of Europe. Two hundred and twenty-five \n     came here. After two days of fighting only ninety could still \n     bear arms.\n       Behind me is a memorial that symbolizes the Ranger daggers \n     that were thrust into the top of these cliffs. And before me \n     are the men who put them there.\n       These are the boys of Pointe du Hoc. These are the men who \n     took the cliffs. These are the champions who helped free a \n     continent. These are the heroes who helped end a war.\n       Gentlemen, I look at you and I think of the words of \n     Stephen Spender's poem. You are men who in your ``lives \n     fought for life . . . and left the vivid air signed with your \n     honor''. . .\n       Forty summers have passed since the battle that you fought \n     here. You were young the day you took these cliffs; some of \n     you were hardly more than boys, with the deepest joys of life \n     before you. Yet you risked everything here. Why? Why did you \n     do it? What impelled you to put aside the instinct for self-\n     preservation and risk your lives to take these cliffs? What \n     inspired all the men of the armies that met here? We look at \n     you, and somehow we know the answer. It was faith, and \n     belief; it was loyalty and love.\n       The men of Normandy had faith that what they were doing was \n     right, faith that they fought for all humanity, faith that a \n     just God would grant them mercy on this beachhead or on the \n     next. It was the deep knowledge--and pray God we have not \n     lost it--that there is a profound moral difference between \n     the use of force for liberation and the use of force for \n     conquest. You were here to liberate, not to conquer, and so \n     you and those others did not doubt your cause. And you were \n     right not to doubt.\n       You all knew that some things are worth dying for. One's \n     country is worth dying for, and democracy is worth dying for, \n     because it's the most deeply honorable form of government \n     ever devised by man. All of you loved liberty. All of you \n     were willing to fight tyranny, and you knew the people of \n     your countries were behind you.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I thought I would read part of this very moving speech. \nIt starts midway in the speech and lays out the history of the brave \nmen who participated in D-day landings, and in particular the Rangers.\n\n       Behind me is a memorial that symbolizes the Ranger daggers \n     that were first thrust into the top of these cliffs. And \n     before me are the men who put them there.\n       These are the boys of Pointe du Hoc. These are the men who \n     took the cliffs. These are the champions who helped free a \n     continent. These are the heroes who helped end a war.\n       Gentlemen, I look at you and I think of the words of \n     Stephen Spender's poem. You are men who in your ``lives \n     fought for life . . . and left a vivid air signed with your \n     honor.''\n       Forty summers have passed since the battle that you fought \n     here. You were young the day you took these cliffs; some of \n     you were hardly more than boys, with the deepest joys of life \n     before you. Yet you risked everything here. Why? Why did you \n     do it? What compelled you to put aside the instinct for self-\n     preservation and risk your lives to take these cliffs? What \n     inspired all the men of the armies that met here? We look at \n     you, and somehow we know the answer. It was faith and belief; \n     it was loyalty and love.\n       The men of Normandy had faith that they were doing what was \n     right, faith that they fought for all humanity, faith that a \n     just God would grant them mercy on this beachhead or on the \n     next. It was the deep knowledge--and pray God we have not \n     lost it--that there is a profound moral difference between \n     the use of force for liberation and the use of force for \n     conquest. You were there to liberate, not to conquer, and so \n     you and those others did not doubt your cause. And you were \n     right not to doubt.\n       You all knew that some things are worth dying for. One's \n     country is worth dying for, and democracy is worth dying for, \n     because it's the most deeply honorable form of government \n     ever devised by man. All of you loved liberty. All of you \n     were willing to fight tyranny, and you knew the people of \n     your countries were behind you.\n\n  The Presiding Officer, with his distinguished military service, \nunderstands, as do I, those words. The vision that he had not only for \nAmerica but the free world, the strength of his convictions, the \nstrength of his actions--it reestablished the strength of the Armed \nForces which today have carried on, since that speech, with missions in \nthe Balkans, Afghanistan, Iraq, and other areas of the world.\n  It takes time to restructure and build up a military. I find this \nPresident is doing just that, President Bush. I am happy and privileged \nto be a part of the team that is working in the Senate to achieve that. \nAs a matter of fact, the bill for the Armed Forces in 2005 is the \ncurrent business before the Senate.\n  Before I leave the speech, I was privileged, because of Senator \nThurmond and the other Senators with me, we were not more than 15, 20 \nyards from the President when he gave the speech, right on this little \nspit of land that I visited 2 days ago.\n  And suddenly you saw the Secret Service men sort of break and go off \nand quickly perform the duties they have to protect the President. \nThere was this figure which came up the cliff unexpectedly, \nunannounced, because there had been a reenactment with men of the Armed \nForces currently on duty to scale the cliffs for all to see. So that \npart was over. Yet suddenly there appeared another individual who had \nscaled the cliffs and the Secret Service tackled him. I remember the \nPresident, always composed, stood there and looked at this scene. \nSuddenly, an aide went over and whispered in his ear and the President \nwent over and grasped this man and gave him a hug. He was one of the \noriginal rangers who scaled that cliff. He wanted to show the President \nand the world that he was still able to do it. He had bits and pieces \nof his own uniform on.\n  Last, what are the ways in which we can honor this great President? \nOur hearts are so filled with gratitude and a sense of deep remorse at \nhis loss. But it was his wisdom and foresight that strengthened \nAmerica's military, and I think that requires some special recognition. \nI don't have all the answers now. I will be happy to work with others.\n  I am not trying to be the sole author of anything, but some thought \nhas been given to the Department of Defense--and I went back last night \nand did a little research, and this morning I called the former \nSecretary of Defense Melvin Laird, a very dear and valued friend, under \nwhom I served as Secretary of the Navy, and we reminisced about our \ndays and some of the initiatives he took. He mentioned one \nspecifically. There was some thought about naming the Department of \nDefense building for President Eisenhower. After some very considerable \nthought, the decision was made not to do that. One of the main \nreasons--and I remember this very well--is that that building stands as \na symbol of the bipartisanship that must be present as we work with the \nmen and women in the Armed Forces. I strive to achieve that, as does \nthe Presiding Officer and many others.\n  I am proud of the committee on which I have served--Armed Services--\nfor 26 years, under a series of chairmen and ranking members. We have \nalways tried to put partisanship aside and we have been successful. But \nit is important that the building be viewed as bipartisan.\n  Therefore, I remember Secretary Laird saying the naming of the \nbuilding was not, in his judgment, what we should do. He confirmed that \nthis morning, and I shared that feeling. He said he conceived the idea \nof naming a corridor for General Eisenhower. There is a technical thing \nthere. The corridor\n\n[[Page S6659]]\n\nis named after him as a general of the Armed Forces, a five-star \ngeneral. His picture in uniform and many other pieces of memorabilia \nare along the corridor by the office of the Secretary of Defense. \nPrevious Secretaries of Defense have honored the commanders in chief, \nthe Presidents. So there is a corridor set aside for the commanders in \nchief, with portraits of every President since George Washington. Five \nliving Presidents are there. You have Ford, Carter, George Herbert \nWalker Bush, President Clinton, and our current President Bush. All of \ntheir portraits are there. The way the Department of Defense has \nhandled this in the past is to treat with equality the Presidents and \ntheir portraits, the recognition being bipartisan in nature in that \nbuilding.\n  We will have to put our minds together to see how best to do it. \nThere is no question that Ronald Reagan gave a tremendous impetus to \nthe concept of defending this Nation against missiles--missiles fired \nin anger or accidentally. Those things happen. He had the star wars \nconcept. I was on the committee and we looked at this program. We began \nto do the initial work in the Congress to give support to the \nPresident's program. But eventually, from the standpoint of technology \nand costs, we looked at different ways to achieve our defense against \nmissiles. It started way back under President Reagan when we put \nemphasis on this situation. Some of the thinking preceded President \nReagan on how to defend this country against missiles. Today, we don't \nhave a thing to interdict an intercontinental ballistic missile that \nwould be fired in the direction of our 50 States. That is a separate \nmatter.\n  Therefore, I think we have to give a lot of careful thought and be \never mindful of how we recognize our commanders, with five still \nliving, in terms of their contributions to the defense of this country. \nWe will come up with an idea. I hope we can, in some way, appropriately \nrecognize this great President for his extraordinary accomplishments in \nstrengthening America.\n  I conclude my remarks with the deepest sense of humility and \ngratitude toward the recollection, modest friendship, and the teachings \nI received from this great President.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The distinguished Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, today and this week, as we pause to \nreflect on the life of Ronald Reagan and his role in leading our Nation \nand the State in which I lived when I was in the Navy, I was thinking \nback and talking with my children this week about my first recollection \nof Ronald Reagan.\n  My first recollection was when I was about their age, early in my \nteenage years, seeing him on television. I may have seen him earlier \nthan that as a kid in the movies, but I do not remember. I remember \nfully--and the Presiding Officer is probably too young to remember \nthis--a television show called ``Death Valley Days'' and watched later, \nI remember, a television show called ``GE Theater.'' He was the host \nand introduced each week's segment. My family would watch those shows, \nnot religiously, but regularly. I enjoyed them as a kid growing up in \nDanville, VA.\n  At the time, Ronald Reagan, who, I guess, was maybe in his fifties at \nthat time, or maybe forties, had a reasonably successful career in \nmotion pictures, certainly a lot more successful than any of us, except \nfor former Senator Fred Thompson. But he had a reasonably successful \ncareer. We were in this in-between place where television was coming of \nage and playing a role with respect to ``Death Valley Days'' and ``GE \nTheater.''\n  I remember my first thoughts of him were that he was a nice-looking \nguy, a handsome kind of rugged fellow. He seemed to be amiable. He came \nacross as amiable and exuded a certain warmth and also a sense of \nsincerity that came across clearly on that small television screen that \nwe owned back in those days.\n  I remember being surprised in 1964. I think I was 17 years old. I was \nabout to enroll in Ohio State University. I was going to be a Navy ROTC \nmidshipman. I was at the age of 17 a young Republican for Barry \nGoldwater. I do not know how I ended up on this side of the aisle. \nChurchill said: If you are young and not liberal, you don't have a \nheart; if you are old and not conservative, you don't have a brain. \nSomehow I ended up as a 17-year-old supporting Barry Goldwater.\n  I remember watching the convention which was in San Francisco at the \nCow Palace. Ironically, another one of our colleagues was there as a \nGoldwater supporter, too. She was there as a ``golden girl.'' Her seat \nis right behind me. It is ironic we both ended up where we are in the \nU.S. Senate. I remember watching on television the 1964 Republican \nConvention and actually watching the Democratic Convention that year.\n  I remember being surprised to see Ronald Reagan speak and address the \nconvention. I knew he had been a film star. I knew he played a role on \nthese two television shows I watched as a kid growing up, but I had no \nidea. I heard he had been involved in the Actors Guild, sort of a labor \nunion for actors, but I had no idea he was involved in politics to any \nextent and that he would end up with a major role at that convention \nspeaking on behalf of Barry Goldwater.\n  He came across in this speech a bit differently than he did in his \nother roles on television, but he did project a great deal of \nsincerity, a lot of conviction.\n  He also suggested a good-naturedness and a certain warmth I have \nalways found refreshing and enduring about him.\n  We learned that evening, as we watched that speech, that this was a \nman who had some strong convictions and gave a powerful speech and one \nwho got a lot of people to think about him as a future leader. Not long \nafter that, he was elected Governor of California, served there for the \nmost part with distinction and then ran against Gerald Ford for \nPresident, lost and came back a couple of years later, ran against \nJimmy Carter and won.\n  It is interesting, conventions were different then. The first \nconvention I ever remember paying much attention to was in 1964. It was \na convention with serious questions about who was going to be the \nPresident.\n  We had the Republicans. Conservatives were supporting Barry Goldwater \nand we had the Rockefeller Republicans. There was a lot of give and \ntake, and real primaries. It was hard fought right up until the \nconvention.\n  I remember in 1968 I was a supporter for Eugene McCarthy who was \nrunning for President. I respected both McCarthy and Goldwater because \nthey were standup guys. They were willing to take tough positions and \nnot mince their words. I respected them both for that. Conventions were \ndifferent than they are today.\n  Although I was impressed by the speech that then-citizen Ronald \nReagan gave, I never imagined he would be Governor of California, and I \ncertainly never imagined he would be President of the United States. I \nnever imagined I would be a Congressman, Governor, or Senator, either. \nI am probably more surprised by that than I am about him ending up as \nGovernor and President.\n  As luck would have it, he ended up as President of the United States \nand I ended up here serving with our Presiding Officer, and that is \nsomething I enjoy very much.\n  Before I was Governor, I served in the House of Representatives for \n10 years. Ronald Reagan was elected President in 1980; I was elected to \nthe House in 1982. I had a chance to interact with him from time to \ntime during limited opportunities as a Democratic Congressman. He had \nqualities I admired all those years ago when he was hosting those \ntelevision shows. His warmth, his sincerity, his good humor, those were \nqualities he possessed in the real world off the TV screen.\n  Sometimes the folks we see or admire on television and film or other \nvenues do not turn out to be quite the same when we meet them in \nperson. He was very much the same.\n  While I did not always see eye to eye with him on environmental \nissues, for\n\n[[Page S6660]]\n\nexample, and I had concerns about the budget deficits we were starting \nto rack up, and questions about deploying space weapons, star wars, and \nthe way we conducted our business in Central America, there was a lot \nhe wanted to do and sought to do with which I did agree. He was an \nearly proponent of welfare reform. He was a guy who believed work \nshould pay more than welfare. We have all heard of the earned income \ntax credit. He was a major proponent of the earned income tax credit \nbecause he felt people who worked ought to be better off than folks who \nwere on welfare.\n  He presided over big tax cuts in the early 1980s, 1981, and later on, \nfaced with ever-growing tax deficits, he presided over some of the \nlargest tax increases that were adopted in our Nation's history.\n\n  He was a staunch opponent of communism, but a fellow who could reach \nout not just across the aisle but across the world to Gorbachev to \nbecome friends, and they embraced one another at the end of their \ntenures as they together helped to change the world in a better way.\n  I find in Ronald Reagan that he was someone who would stake out a \nposition; he would adhere to that position with his convictions for as \nlong as he could, and at the end, if he had to change, he would. He was \nwilling to do that, but he did not back off easily or readily. He was \nwilling in the end to compromise.\n  In reacting to folks in my own State in Delaware this week who asked \nme for my reaction to what he was like, I said, well, whether or not \nyou liked the man's policies, it was hard not to like the man.\n  Since his death, there has been a fair amount of conjecture about \nwhat we should do to pay tribute to him and his memory. Some people \nhave suggested we ought to rework Mount Rushmore and find a way to put \nhis image on Mount Rushmore. We have had a few people suggest maybe \nRonald Reagan's picture should be on the $10 bill instead of Alexander \nHamilton. I heard our Republican leader suggest yesterday that maybe we \nshould rename the Pentagon in honor of Ronald Reagan. I do not know \nthat those are good or bad ideas. I have not given those a lot of \nthought.\n  I ask we consider a couple of other legacies that might even be more \nimportant and more enduring. One of those deals with the disease that \ndogged him for the last years of his life, Alzheimer's disease, a \ndisease my mom also suffers from. She lives in Kentucky. I visited her \nover the weekend. She does not remember much. Actually, she remembers a \nfew things that happened a long time ago, but she does not have any \nrecollection of Ronald Reagan and all of those years we watched him on \ntelevision when I was a kid growing up.\n  My mom is going to be 82 years this August and my hope is she will \nlive to be as old as Ronald Reagan. I do not think that is likely, but \nthat would be wonderful if it happened. My mom is one of 4 million \npeople in the world today who suffers from Alzheimer's disease. It was \nsomething we saw the first signs of 5, 6, 7 years ago, and we knew \nwhere it was leading. Her mom suffered the same fate. Her grandmother \nhad suffered the same fate as well.\n  While there are roughly 4 million Americans today who suffer from \nAlzheimer's disease, by the year 2020 we are told there could be as \nmany as 14 million Americans who suffer from Alzheimer's disease. It is \na tough disease not so much for the person who suffers from it but \ncertainly for their families and those who love them and who are unable \nto have the kind of relationship we once did.\n  I know Senator Mikulski is going to be leading the effort, I think \nwith Senator Bond, for us to focus anew as a Congress, as a Senate, on \nproviding meaningful increases in funding to find a cure for \nAlzheimer's disease; not simply a way to treat the symptoms, but a way \nto stop it dead in its tracks. I commend them for their actions and I \nstand fully ready to support them. I hope others will as well.\n  The other legacy I suggest that may be as important or we may be \ninspired to address and do something about other than dealing with \nAlzheimer's disease is civility. I am not the first person who has \nnoticed this of late, but there has been a huge loss of civility not \nonly in Washington, DC, but shortly after I heard of President Reagan's \ndeath I was flipping through the radio channels in my car and I came \nacross one of these right-wing talk shows. There was pure vitriol \ncoming out of the speaker on my radio. I find it hard to listen to that \nstuff so I turned it off. I find it hard to watch the television shows \nanymore because it seems there is no meaningful discourse; they are \nreally shouting matches.\n  Ronald Reagan, for whatever faults he may have had, was a civil \nperson, he was a gentleman, and at a time when that kind of behavior \ncharacterizes too little of what not only goes on here but what takes \nplace in politics throughout our country, he is a good role model in \nthat the way he treated people was the way he would like to have been \ntreated. It is a lesson that was good and meaningful then and it is one \nwe can certainly take again today.\n  I have heard our own leader, Tom Daschle, begin to speak of late of a \nnew civility, and we need a new civility. We need some civility, not \ngoing through the formalities, but treating one another the way we \nwould want to be treated; not just in this Chamber, not just in this \nCapitol, but throughout this country, even in a Presidential election \nyear.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, as one of the two Senators from \nIllinois, I am very proud of Ronald Reagan and his contributions to \nthis country. Ronald Reagan is the only American President who was, in \nfact, born in Illinois. Many people think of Abraham Lincoln as having \nbeen born in Illinois, but he was actually born in Kentucky and later \nmoved there. Of course, I think there is no question that Ronald Reagan \nwill join Abraham Lincoln as one of our Nation's greatest Presidents. I \nonly want to say a few words about him.\n  I didn't actually serve in the Senate when he was President. I didn't \never have the opportunity to get to know him. I did, however, get the \nopportunity to meet him once as a very young man, when I was about 20 \nyears old or so and he was campaigning for President in 1980.\n  But my first real recollection of him came from watching his address \non television in 1976 at the Republican National Convention. He had \nlost the primaries to incumbent President Gerald Ford but had \nnonetheless had a very strong showing. He gave a speech at that 1976 \nconvention that literally brought down the house and fired up the \ndelegates. I remember watching that at home and thinking, What an \noutstanding leader. You could see that this man certainly still had a \ngreat contribution to make.\n  He won against all the odds. All the pundits and many of the \ncommentators dismissed Ronald Reagan. They thought he was too old. They \nthought he was too conservative to run and be elected President in \n1980. But he proved them all wrong.\n  I think a pivotal moment came in 1980 during his primary elections. \nAt that time he lost the Iowa caucuses and he had a lot of pressure on \nhim to win the New Hampshire primary. Many of us will recall that New \nHampshire primary debate where he grabbed the microphone as they tried \nto shut it off. He grabbed the microphone and said: ``Mr. Green, I paid \nfor this microphone.'' He wanted his other opponents to be allowed the \nopportunity to speak at that debate, as opposed to just having a one-\non-one debate with George Bush, who later became his Vice President and \nsucceeded him as President.\n  I remember watching that Nashua, NH, debate in 1980 from the basement \ntelevision room of my fraternity house in Hanover, NH, at Dartmouth \nCollege. I was very much paying attention to that primary because it \nwas happening in New Hampshire where I was attending college. I will \nnever forget seeing Ronald Reagan in that debate and his remarkable \nperformance.\n  Later, in 1980, I had the opportunity to meet him when he came to \nIllinois to campaign for a U.S. Senate candidate in October of 1980, \nabout a month before Reagan was elected President. I was actually an \nintern on the campaign of a fellow by the name of Dave O'Neal who was \nrunning for the Senate in Illinois. He actually lost. But as an intern \non that campaign, I had the opportunity to meet Ronald\n\n[[Page S6661]]\n\nReagan and to welcome him into the back room before we had the dinner \nin honor of Dave O'Neal.\n  I will never forget Ronald Reagan. Everybody called him Governor at \nthat time. That was the most recent office he had. They didn't call him \nPresident Reagan yet. But when he walked into the holding room, the \nbartender immediately told him: Governor Reagan, we have squeezed some \nfresh oranges for you. We have some freshly squeezed orange juice for \nyou. Would you like some of this?\n\n  Governor Reagan looked at him and said: I'll take it if you put a \nlittle vodka in that.\n  I was struck immediately at the time by his charm and his sense of \nhumor and his relaxed nature, even though he was just a few weeks out \nfrom the election day in what everyone thought would be a very close \nelection with President Carter. But, of course, as we know, Ronald \nReagan went on to win in a landslide.\n  He had a remarkable career. He was an enormous source of inspiration \nto me as I was finishing college and going on to law school. I was very \nproud at the time to be a Republican and to have him as the leader of \nour party, but also to be an American and have him lead our country and \nrepresent us in the world. I thought he handled himself with incredible \npoise and dignity.\n  His achievements are monumental. You will recall that he had few \nallies in Congress. The other party controlled both Houses of Congress \nwhile he was President. Yet he was able to work his will through \nCongress by calling upon the American people to lobby Congress for some \nof his important initiatives, such as lowering taxes. President Reagan \nsucceeded in lowering the highest tax rates, which at that time were up \nto 70 percent. He dramatically lowered the tax rates and unleashed a \nflurry of economic activity that is with us today.\n  He went on to achieve major arms control agreements, and also, with \nthe threat of his willingness to spend whatever it took to defend our \ncountry--his will in that regard, his sheer will to succeed in \ndefeating what he saw as an evil ideology, communism--in ending the \ncold war with the Soviet Union, he ultimately succeeded in doing that. \nNo one has a greater claim on ending the cold war than Ronald Reagan \nand, as Margaret Thatcher has said, he did so without firing a single \nshot.\n  I think one of his greatest accomplishments occurred in his second \nterm, and that was the simplifying of the Tax Code. If you recall, we \nwent for a time where we got rid of a lot of the Swiss cheese loopholes \nand deductions that are in our Tax Code. We dramatically simplified the \nTax Code, collapsed the rates, and it held for a few years. We have \ngone back now and allowed all the special interests to fill up the Tax \nCode with all sorts of special interest loopholes and giveaways to \npolitically connected interests. Sometimes I wish we were rereading \nwhat Ronald Reagan said at the time about the necessity of cleaning up \nthat Tax Code.\n  One of the most cherished treasures in the State of Illinois is the \nboyhood home in which Ronald Reagan grew up in the 1920s, in Dixon, IL. \nThat home has been purchased and lovingly restored by a foundation and \nby members of the Dixon, IL, community. It is a wonderful place for \nAmericans who want to pay their respects to Ronald Reagan and his \nlegacy, to go by and visit on Interstate 88 in Dixon, IL, just off \nInterstate 88. I certainly hope a lot more Americans who are interested \nin the history of Ronald Reagan will visit that home.\n  Ronald Reagan himself went back to visit it, I believe, after he left \nthe White House even. He has recounted many tales of his growing up \nthere.\n  He was actually born in Tampico, IL, in an apartment above a \ncommercial building in downtown Tampico, and later moved to Dixon, IL. \nSome of his fondest memories are of growing up in Dixon, along the Rock \nRiver.\n\n  Of course, many people will remember Ronald Reagan talking about one \nof his proudest accomplishments in life was actually saving 77 people \nfrom drowning over the 7 years that he was a lifeguard along the Rock \nRiver in Dixon, IL.\n  If you go to Dixon, IL, you can see this wonderful small town that \nshaped Ronald Reagan, his character, his values, his common sense, his \nMidwestern way of thinking, of looking at the world. I don't think that \never left him.\n  There is also an interesting story not many people are aware of, but \nPresident Reagan wrote about this in his biography. He graduated from \nEureka College, about 130 miles south of Dixon, in Illinois. After \ngraduating from college, he went back to Dixon and he applied for a job \nin the sporting goods department, I believe, at a Montgomery Ward store \nin Dixon, IL.\n  Guess what happened. Montgomery Ward turned down Ronald Reagan for \nthat job. That set him off in different pursuits, and he ultimately \nwent to Iowa and became an announcer, did Cubs games from a regional \nradio station there. But he wrote in his biography he wonders what \nwould have happened had he actually gotten that job at the Montgomery \nWard store in Dixon, IL. He suspected he might never have left Dixon, \nIL.\n  We need to thank somebody who failed to hire Ronald Reagan at \nMontgomery Ward in 1932, I think, because it was that little twist, \nthat little turn in his life that turned out for the better, not only \nfor him but certainly for our entire Nation and the world.\n  I ask that we not forget the example of Ronald Reagan and his \ncheerful optimism about our country and our future. No one could \ncommunicate their thoughts as well as Ronald Reagan, in my judgment. I \nknow of no equal he had in public service in terms of communicating \nwith people. He was an inspiring leader.\n  Ronald Reagan came to the presidency of a self-doubting nation, a \nnation more suspicious of its power than inspired by its possibilities. \nAnd he understood--as magnificently as any American leader--the \nrestorative force of faith, of conviction, of pride. He was the Great \nCommunicator, not because he mastered the sound bite, but because this \nmidwestern man of 10,000 handwritten letters knew that words matter--\nwords with simple, self-evident integrity, words that reach into the \nvagueness of a volatile democracy and perfectly describe the essential \ngoodness of our character.\n  Ronald Reagan returned us to ourselves. He did not work miracles. But \nhe emboldened us to see the grace of God in the destiny of our great \nNation. He enabled us to hear the still, small voice in the clamor of \ngreat historical conflicts. He reminded us to treasure the simple \nmiracles of life, laughter and love.\n  This man, who survived into the 21st century, embodied as perhaps \nnone other the panoramic sweep of America's 10th century. Reagan was \nborn in the small town of Tampico, IL. It was 1911, the year of the \nfirst coast-to-coast airplane flight, a 49-day ordeal with 69 stops and \n16 crash landings. It was also the year of the first aircraft landing--\ncrude though it was--on a ship anchored in San Francisco Bay. A series \nof ropes stopped the aircraft. Ninety years later, on March 4, 2001, \nthe United States christened the Navy's newest Nimitz-class aircraft \ncarrier, the USS Ronald Reagan, a 90,000-ton nuclear-powered fighting \nship, and the pride of the most powerful navy in the world.\n  Ronald Reagan fundamentally changed the face of American politics--\nand profusely contributed his name to the new political lexicon. What \nAmerican before or since Ronald Reagan has become the popular namesake \nfor a theory of economics, a political and electoral sea change, and a \ndecisive partisan crossover? I speak of Reaganomics, the Reagan \nRevolution, and Reagan Democrats.\n  The man was that large. He had strong and distinct views which he was \nable to communicate with remarkable effectiveness. He had a \nirresistibly winning personality and was irrepressibly optimistic. \nThough the establishment of both political parties often ridiculed his \nbeliefs, the people somehow always seemed to have faith and confidence \nin him. In fact, they loved as perhaps they have loved no other \nPresident in modern history.\n  Conventional intellects and comfortable pundits were aghast when \nPresident Reagan spoke so freely of ``evil'' in the world. In a world \nwhere ``evil'' is neatly banished because it is too judgmental, the \nmoral declarations of Ronald Reagan were inevitably revolutionary. The \nGreat Communicator\n\n[[Page S6662]]\n\nunderstood perfectly well that communication without a moral compass \nbecomes all talk. And so we are the heirs of a more civilized and less \nmenacing world because Ronald Reagan had the courage to maintain firm \nbeliefs and to stand up for those beliefs.\n  As a Senator from Illinois, I am proud to remark briefly and \ncomparatively about another great son of Illinois, the only President \nto be elected from Illinois, Kentucky-born but Illinois-settled Abraham \nLincoln, whom our history honors as few others. Lincoln and Reagan both \ngrew up humbly and gained a natural comfort with people from all walks \nof life. They were both frequently underestimated by opponents who \nimagined themselves intellectually, culturally or socially superior. \nThey both possessed an equanimity and fortitude that kept them serene \nwhile navigating treacherous waters. They both loved the United States \nof America. And they both cherished American freedom and staked their \npublic lives on the resolute promotion of it--for Lincoln, against the \nforces of disunity and enslavement at home, and for Reagan, against a \ngodless imperial tyranny abroad. I am proud to hail from the State of \nIllinois.\n  When we finally measure the worth of a statesman, the words of \npolitical or ideological adversaries can speak volumes. And here Ronald \nReagan--a statesman with many more converts than implacable enemies--is \na shining beacon in his own shining city. When President Clinton \nannounced in 1996 that ``the era of big government is over,'' it was \nhomage to the durable influence--across the political landscape--of \nRonald Reagan's faith in the American people. When Mikhail Gorbachev \nrecently said of Ronald Reagan, ``he was sincere,'' he captured with \nfitting simplicity the worldwide power of the American dream in the \nhands of America's finest dreamer.\n  Ronald Reagan stayed the course, throughout and after his presidency, \nuntil a progressive illness consumed him. Indeed, sliding irretrievably \ninto forgetfulness a decade ago, Ronald Reagan remembered to say \ngoodbye to his beloved American people. ``When the Lord calls me home, \nwhenever that may be, I will leave with the greatest love for this \ncountry of ours and eternal optimism for its future,'' Reagan wrote. \n``I now begin the journey that will lead me into the sunset of my life. \nI know that for America there will always be a bright dawn ahead. Thank \nyou my friends. May God always bless you.''\n  May God rest his soul, and may God bless Nancy Reagan, who is also \nfrom Illinois, and all the Reagan children and their families.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I join my colleague from Illinois in \npaying tribute to the late President Ronald Reagan.\n  Today the Senate passed by an overwhelming vote a resolution \ncommemorating Ronald Reagan for his service to America and recalling \nhis legacy.\n  There has been a lot said on the floor about President Reagan. I come \nto this task with a little different perspective than some. Were it not \nfor Ronald Reagan, I wouldn't be in the Senate today. I say that \nbecause I made three vain and futile attempts to be elected to public \noffice. In 1982, I ran for the House of Representatives against an \nincumbent Republican Congressman. Were it not for the sorry state of \nthe economy in Illinois after the first 2 years of President Reagan's \nPresidency, I would have lost. But because of the economy and the \ntroubles faced at that moment in time, I was successful in my campaign \nagainst a long-time Republican incumbent Congressman.\n  I will not mislead anyone before making these remarks. I will tell \nyou that while a Member of the House of Representatives during the 6 \nremaining years of President Reagan's Presidency, there were very few \nthings I agreed with in reference to him. In fact, over 90 percent of \nthe time we didn't see eye to eye. I had some very strong philosophical \ndifferences with President Reagan on economic policy, foreign policy, \nand many other things. But I will tell you this: He was an \nextraordinary person, and I think even those of us who disagreed with \nhim politically respected him very much.\n  I recall when I was elected in one of the largest new classes of \nCongressmen since Watergate, in 1982, that President Reagan and Mrs. \nReagan invited all of the new Members of the House of Representatives \nand their spouses to come for a dinner at the White House. It was an \namazingly heady experience to walk in as Congressmen-elect with our \nwives and shake hands with the President and Mrs. Reagan, realizing \nfull well that most of the people in the room were new Democratic \nCongressmen who had been running against President Reagan and his \npolicies. But he was gracious to a fault and could not have been more \ncordial to all of us who gathered that evening. One of my great \nmemories of that period of time between the election and being sworn in \nwas sitting there in the White House at this dinner hosted by President \nReagan and Mrs. Reagan. At the same table was my Senate colleague, \nthen-Congressman Mike DeWine, and his wife Fran, who had made the trip \nfrom Ohio for that special dinner with the Reagans and new Members of \nCongress days after she had given birth to a little baby girl, whom she \nbrought to the same dinner in a basket which she had right next to the \ntable. We have laughed about it all the time, because obviously after \n23 years that little girl has grown up to be a remarkable young woman.\n  But those are some of the memories I have of President Reagan opening \nthe door and welcoming in some new Congressmen who had spent months \nrunning against him and his policies.\n  The same thing held true when it came to his State of the Union \nAddresses. I can remember so many different times when I marched to the \nHouse of Representatives' Chamber for the State of the Union Address by \nPresident Reagan. After a while I came to understand what the rules \nwere. The rules were these: You didn't have a chance as a Democrat to \nsay anything critical and be successful the night of President Reagan's \nspeech. He had such a magical style and was so affable and friendly and \napproachable that after he concluded his State of the Union Address, \nthe best for the loyal opposition was to wave and leave the stage \nbecause he was so good. He was one of the best. We did learn that after \n24 or 48 hours had passed, perhaps a closer look at what he said could \nlead to some constructive criticism. But we knew right off the bat when \nPresident Reagan took to the floor of the House of Representatives for \nthe State of the Union Address and walked up those stairs, the best \nthing the loyal opposition could do was to be quiet.\n\n  There was another aspect of Ronald Reagan which I miss so much. It is \npart of the political life which unfortunately we don't have enough of. \nHe was President in an era of some great people--Tip O'Neill, Speaker \nof the House of Representatives, and Bob Michel, Republican minority \nleader from Illinois. They brought to this business of politics a \ncertain humanity and civility which we have lost almost completely.\n  I can recall the bitter battles we had on the floor of the House of \nRepresentatives with President Reagan over very contentious issues and \nthe debates going on for days. Ultimately, someone would prevail, and \nmany times it would be President Reagan and his position. Without fail, \nwhen it came to those critical votes, Tip O'Neill, then Speaker of the \nHouse, the leading Democrat, would pick up the phone, call the \nPresident and congratulate him. It was a gesture, but it was an \nimportant gesture to say that, frankly, we have both given it a good \nfight; the decision has been made; now let us move on to the people's \nbusiness.\n  President Ronald Reagan understood that, Tip O'Neill understood that, \nand Bob Michel understood that. I wish our generation of leaders could \nunderstand that more, that even though we disagree, and disagree with a \ngreat deal of conviction, we should try to look for that human side we \ncan all share. I think time and again President Reagan did that. I \ncommend him for it.\n  Even though you have disagreed with him during the course of the \ndebate, when it was all over, you knew you would be treated with \nrespect.\n  Time and again, my wife Loretta and I would go down to the White \nHouse for the Christmas party, the barbeques and picnics. It was always \na warm welcome and greeting, even though the President was of a \ndifferent party where there were very serious differences.\n\n[[Page S6663]]\n\n  I would like to reflect, too, for a moment on the former First Lady, \nNancy Reagan. She has been a pillar of strength since it was announced \nthat the late President was suffering from Alzheimer's; 10 years \nwatching the man she loved the most of any in the world slip into \ndarkness. She said in a few interviews since President Reagan passed \naway, the worst part was the advancing years and not being able to \nshare memories anymore because President Reagan was inflicted with \nAlzheimer's disease. That takes a toll.\n  We have had friends who have gone through it. It takes a special \ncommitment and sacrifice to make it through that terrible illness. My \nheart goes out to Nancy Reagan and her family, all of them, for what \nthey have endured for 10 years, standing by the former President while \nhe was afflicted with this disease.\n\n  My colleague Senator Carper mentioned earlier that many people are \nnow talking about tributes to President Reagan, and he is deserving. \nDespite my differences with him politically, I voted for the renaming \nof the Washington National Airport in his memory. I thought that was \nappropriate for someone who had served our Nation as President of the \nUnited States. Now people are trying to think of other things they can \ndo. They are kind of upping the ante: Well, you know, not the 50-cent \npiece, maybe the $10 bill; no, maybe Mount Rushmore. I would like to \nsuggest to them the most enduring legacy for this President would be to \nhelp others in his name. I can't think of anything more important to \nask for when the time comes for those to consider what to do in his \nmemory than the contribution suggested by our colleagues Senators \nMikulski and Bond, one which I think is worthy of our immediate \nconsideration. They called for the establishment of the Ronald Reagan \nAlzheimer's Breakthrough Act of 2004. They believe we are near a \nbreakthrough in treating Alzheimer's and they want us to put special \nattention and special resources and special efforts in that regard. \nThat not only will serve the memory of President Reagan and his \ncourageous family who stood by him, but it will also serve to help 4\\1/\n5\\ million Americans inflicted with Alzheimer's disease today, and \ntheir husbands, wives, children, and their loved ones who stand by \nhelplessly at their side as they drift into the darkness of this \ndreaded disease. That would be such a great tribute to President \nReagan. I hope we can do it on a bipartisan basis with the civility and \nhumanity which President Reagan demonstrated during the course of his \nlife.\n\n  I might also add that the First Lady's commitment to stem cell \nresearch is an exceptional statement on her part. She has broken with \nsome members of the Republican Party on this issue. I know her position \nis controversial, even within this administration, but she understands, \nas many do, that unless we are committed to medical research, including \nstem cell research, the chances that we can successfully deal with \nAlzheimer's, diabetes, spinal cord injuries, and other terrible \nafflictions will be diminished. I salute the First Lady and I hope we \nwill, in recognition of her commitment and in memory of President \nReagan, also decide we will step forward in this critical area of \nmedical research involving stem cells.\n  I am honored that President Reagan was a friend, at least in passing, \non a political basis. I am happy he came from Illinois and happened to \nbelieve that perhaps his Midwestern roots might have helped him in his \nvarious careers. It certainly helped him serving this country as \nPresident.\n  He had an amazing record of victories. I know because I was on the \nlosing end of a lot of those campaigns. I campaigned for his opponents \nwith little or no success. He carried 44 States in the first election \nand 49 States in the second. Probably few Presidents in history have \nhad a mandate that substantial when they were reelected. It is a \ntribute to the fact that America loved that President, America wanted \nRonald Reagan to serve, and he served our Nation so well.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, over the past few days, more than 100,000 \nAmericans have stood in line in California for 12 hours or even more to \npay their respects to President Ronald Reagan. This great show of \nrespect and affection will be repeated during the coming days in \nWashington.\n  This overwhelming outpouring cannot be explained by merely citing the \ntraits for which he was so well-known--his likability, his wit and \noptimism, his courage when attacked by a would-be assassin's bullet or, \nat the end of his life, by a devastating disease, or even his skills as \nthe Great Communicator. Americans are standing in line because of \nPresident Reagan's ideas and the principles and convictions that gave \nthose ideas their power: The God-given right to freedom, responsibility \nfor one's own actions, and charity toward others--the very ideas that \nare the foundation of this great Nation were the foundation of \nPresident Reagan's character.\n  President Reagan became President at a time when the world had begun \nto question the strength of that foundation. It was a time when \nfreedom, balanced by personal responsibility and justified by charity, \nwas in danger of becoming just one of the many ways in which human \nsociety could be organized. Rather than appease or accommodate \ncommunism, he confronted it and exposed its moral bankruptcy.\n  President Reagan emboldened freedom-loving people everywhere--those \nbehind the Iron Curtain and those in danger of being enveloped by it--\nand gave them faith and strength. He believed, as he said in his first \ninaugural address, that no weapon in the arsenals of the world is so \nformidable as the will and moral courage of free men and women. He was \nright.\n  President Reagan became President at a time when America had begun to \nquestion its place in the world and the values upon which this great \nNation was built. He opened the gate of the American spirit. He tore \ndown the wall of doubt.\n\n  Ronald Reagan was a great communicator because he had something great \nto communicate. He was the right man for his time; and now he belongs \nto all time.\n  He will be missed, but President Reagan's ideas will always be part \nof the American experience.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I have, for the last day, listened to a \ngood number of my colleagues reminisce about the late President Ronald \nReagan, many of them quoting from his speeches, many of them quoting \nfrom books written about him, about his phenomenal life, and his \nphenomenal presence in this city as one of our Presidents. So I would \nguess that by this moment nearly everything that can be said about \nRonald Reagan has been said but, then again, not everyone has said it.\n  I find myself in that situation in these moments just prior to the \nadjournment of the Senate and hours before a coffin bearing President \nRonald Reagan will arrive at the Rotunda of our great Capitol.\n  What I might do for just a moment is reminisce about a couple of \npersonal experiences I had the privilege of having with the late \nPresident that, to me, speaks volumes about the gentleman's personalty, \nhis style of Presidency, and what he meant to my State of Idaho.\n  Idaho, by its conservative character and its independence, was always \na strong Reagan State. It spoke out loudly for the President. It voted \nin large numbers for the President. There was never a question where \nIdahoans would be when it came to supporting Ronald Reagan for his \nPresidency.\n  My relationship with him began at the very time he came to \nWashington. I was a freshman in the House of Representatives in the \nwinter of 1981. Both\n\n[[Page S6664]]\n\nPresident Reagan and I were elected at the same time. I was one of \nthose of the large class of 54 Republican freshmen who entered the U.S. \nHouse, many of them because of the strength of Ronald Reagan, and we \nall became known as ``Reagan babies.'' I suspect that is a title that \nat the age of 58 I still bear with some pride. Because we came at a \ntime when we had a President who was speaking of change; and the \nAmerican people were wanting it, demanding it, and his Presidency \nembodied it.\n\n  The situation I want to relate for the record this afternoon occurred \nduring the first budget process of the Reagan administration. David \nStockman, a Congressman, had just been appointed Director of OMB. Of \ncourse, the major tax cut that our President was so well known for--\nthat began to stimulate the economy and turn the American people back \ninto entrepreneurialism--was all at hand. But there were deficits. So \nDavid Stockman came up with the idea that we should sell off our \nstrategic minerals stockpile.\n  Well, that is something you do not hear talked about hardly at all \ntoday, but following World War II, Congress had passed legislation \nsaying that we should stockpile silver and magnesium and titanium and \nzinc and a variety of other metals in case we got in another war, so we \nwould have these supplies of metals available for industrial purposes.\n  By 1981, it was largely determined on the part of the Reagan \nadministration and David Stockman that they were just not necessary any \nlonger. It was probably true that some Members of Congress believed the \nsame thing. So when the announcement of the sale of these stockpiles \nbecame public--and the money then from their sale was to return to the \nTreasury, and that money would offset some of the deficits that might \noccur as a result of the tax cuts--the silver market plummeted. The \nprice of silver on the world market dropped because the large supply of \nsilver being held by our Government was going to enter the market at \nsome point. So the market out there was beginning to adjust and prices \nfell.\n  Because Idaho at that time was a primary silver producer, not only \ndid prices fall in Idaho, but when they fell, many of our mines closed. \nThere were 400 or 500 miners--men and women--out of work in the Silver \nValley of Idaho, known as the Coeur d'Alene mining district, that was \nin part a direct result of this announcement.\n  I was a freshman Congressman. That was my congressional district. I \nhad people out of work. This was largely still an old line labor \nDemocrat stronghold in north Idaho, and the hue and cry was very loud. \nThese men and women were out of work because of President Ronald \nReagan.\n  I had thought that if Ronald Reagan really understood the impact of \nwhat he was doing, he might change his approach. But because it was a \ndirective from OMB, because it was a part of the budgetary policy of \nthis administration, my small voice simply was not getting heard.\n  I appealed one evening in a conversation to the then-Secretary of the \nInterior, Jim Watt. I said: Secretary Watt, how do I get to the \nPresident? How do I tell my story, our story, Idaho's story, about this \nparticular problem?\n  He said: Well, Larry, you have to get to the President directly. \nObviously, David Stockman is not interested in hearing your story. The \nsale of the strategic metals, the sale of the stockpiles, is his idea. \nHe's not going to be your champion. So if you're ever down at the White \nHouse, see if you can get the President's ear.\n\n  Well, freshmen Congressmen do not often go to the White House. But \nbecause of the key tax votes that were coming up, I got invited to the \nWhite House to visit with Ronald Reagan. I had presented on one, small \nsheet of paper, on one side, a very brief, clear explanation of the \nimpact of the sale of the silver stockpile out of the strategic metals \nstockpile on the people of Idaho. I put it in an envelope, and wrote \nacross it ``To President Ronald Reagan,'' and stuck it in my pocket.\n  Now I am down at the White House and conversations go forward. At the \nend of the conversation, I say: Mr. President, here is a note I would \nlike to have you read. It's important to my people in Idaho. By your \nactions, you have put 500 Idahoans out of work.\n  He said: Really?\n  I said: Yes, selling off the strategic metals.\n  He smiled and said: We are?\n  Well, that did not surprise me. The longer I am here in Washington, I \nknow not everybody knows every detail about everything. That is why you \nhire and have around you competent people, and Presidents are certainly \nno different than many of us.\n  He kept the note. I saw it go into the breast pocket of his suit \ncoat. A day and a half or two later, I got a call from the White House \nsaying: Congressman Craig, can you come down and visit with the \nPresident about your problem in north Idaho and the sale of the silver \nstockpile?\n  My, I was impressed. I went to the White House. There in the Oval \nOffice was the President and David Stockman, the Director of OMB, the \nman who had established the policy of selling off the stockpiles to \nbring money to the Treasury. We discussed it at length. In fact, David \nStockman and I had a small debate in front of the President about the \npros and cons of doing so.\n  What I said at that time was: Mr. President, I am not opposed to you \nselling off the stockpile of silver, but it's how you are approaching \nit, and how you are approaching it has had a dramatic impact on the \nmarket. As a result of that, it has dropped the price of silver \nworldwide, and men and women in Idaho are now out of work.\n  He said: Well--in his inevitable way--let me think about that.\n  A week later, there was a very small but very important announcement \nthat no longer would there be any more sale of the silver stockpile, \nand, of course, the prices came back and the men and women in north \nIdaho went to work.\n  What is the message? The message is that when this President, Ronald \nReagan, understood the impact of an action--if it was hurting people or \nimpacting them adversely, or if it was doing something that was against \nhis market ideas and his philosophical belief in limited government and \nthat government should not be the arbiter nor should government \ninfringe upon the well-being of citizens--he would make changes. And he \ndid. And of course, I have told that story many times in Idaho. It was \nvery clear to Idahoans that the market changed because Ronald Reagan \nsaw what he was doing or saw what his administration was doing and was \nwilling to make a very important change to impact people's lives.\n\n  Lastly, I remember coming to the U.S. Senate in 1990, certainly after \nPresident Reagan had left this city. The first office I took in the \nHart Building had on a conference wall a very large map of the world. \nIt filled the whole wall, and it still had the Socialist Republics of \nthe Soviet Union written across that map. That will tell you how old it \nwas in 1990. I remember at the time looking at that map and saying: \nThank you, Ronald Reagan. You have made that map of the world obsolete. \nYou as the President--not single-handedly but certainly by the force of \nyour beliefs and by the force of your efforts--have made the Soviet \nUnion obsolete in such a way that it simply withered and died, almost \nwithout a whimper. And that, of course, is one of the great legacies of \nour President, and many of our colleagues have spoken about that.\n  We are not going to let revisionist historians suggest that the \nSoviet Union would have crumbled anyway. There was a reality they had \nto face. The reality was Ronald Reagan and the national resolve of this \ncountry in the cold war, built on the strength and the beliefs of a \ngreat President by the name of Ronald Reagan, that we not only could \novercome communism but we would, in essence, arm ourselves and build a \nmilitary ready and capable of defeating the Soviet Union. That \ncombination of efforts, put together with his willingness to deal with \nGorbachev and others, obviously changed the dynamics of world politics \nand the environment I grew up in as a child, known as the cold war.\n  I will attend the ceremony in the Chamber tonight, and I will mourn \nthe loss of Ronald Reagan. But more importantly, I will celebrate. I \nwill celebrate a great President, a President who came to our country's \ncall at the right time in our history, to lead us with optimism and \nenthusiasm and vision in a way few Presidents have. So while I will \ncertainly miss the presence\n\n[[Page S6665]]\n\nof the man, I celebrate his record and the history that will be written \nabout him.\n  I send my prayers and the prayers of my wife Suzanne to Nancy Reagan \nand all of the Reagans. They stand with a great legacy they are \nobviously very proud of, as we all are as Americans.\n  To Ronald Reagan I say: Thank you, you built a place in history that \nis well deserving of the actions you took as President of the United \nStates.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I wanted to be sure to have an \nopportunity to make some comments about President Reagan before we went \nout of session tonight. I will take the opportunity to do so right now.\n  I join with my colleagues, so many of whom have already spoken, in \ntribute to our Nation's 40th President, Ronald Reagan. My first term in \nthe Senate coincided with the last 6 years of his Presidency. I had the \nopportunity to work with him on several occasions. As someone who came \nfrom modest beginnings and a working-class family, I understood the \nfact that he rose from his humble beginnings to become one of the \ncrucial world leaders. He was respected greatly. I had a chance to work \nwith him on several occasions, not the least of which was something as \nsimple as raising the drinking age to 21 across the country, thereby \nsaving thousands of families a year from having to mourn the loss of a \nyoung person in their household. The bill was signed in the morning at \nthe White House, and I was pleased I was able to return from a \nconvention in San Francisco in time to be there and share those good \nmoments with President Reagan and then-Secretary of Transportation \nElizabeth Dole.\n  We did a lot of good for families across America with that \nlegislation, and also offered support to say to those who would pollute \nour environment, ``If you pollute, you must pay to clean it up,'' and \nthat was Superfund. It had a very important beginning in those days.\n  President Reagan is appropriately being remembered for his \noverpowering sense of optimism and rock-solid faith in the fundamental \ngoodness of America. Many of his actions stand as examples of ideas \nthat we ought to consider as we carry out our responsibilities in \nGovernment. There was no doubt that he was the Great Communicator, and \nhis ideas and his words will long be remembered.\n  I just returned yesterday from the D-day celebration and \ncommemoration in Normandy. No one will ever forget President Reagan's \nspeech 20 years ago at Normandy commemorating the 40th anniversary of \nthe D-day invasion; it will be permanently etched in our memories. Or \nhis poignant remarks when the Space Shuttle Challenger exploded, and \nhow he helped America recover from that terrible national tragedy. Or \nwho can forget his insistence that helped break the iron grip of the \nSoviet Union on millions of people around the globe?\n  President Reagan was known for his ideological zeal. But the \ninteresting thing about him at the same time was that he ultimately was \na pragmatist. Perhaps the clearest example of his pragmatic side is \nwhat happened after he pushed through a massive tax cut in Congress in \n1981. One thing that President Reagan disliked enormously was Federal \nbudget deficits. He thought the idea of borrowing from future \ngenerations was truly repugnant.\n  On the campaign trail in 1980, he promised he would work to balance \nthe budget. When he took office, he argued that a tax cut was necessary \nto stimulate the economy. He believed the Federal Government would end \nup with more, not fewer, revenues. But when the revenues didn't \nmaterialize as predicted, and the Federal Government began running huge \nannual budget deficits, his pragmatism took over and he followed his \n1981 tax cuts with tax increases that were necessary in 1982 and 1984, \ndetermined to reduce the burgeoning budget deficits. His tax increases \nwere a tacit admission that the plan wasn't working as expected. He was \npragmatic enough to change the course.\n\n  His personality was so unique for someone in that high office. As \nMikhail Gorbachev wrote in Monday's New York Times op-ed page, \nPresident Reagan was ultimately someone with whom you could negotiate. \nHis suggestion was that he was human enough, he was collegial, funny, \nand gracious, and you could discuss serious issues with him and \naccomplish goals.\n  One of President Reagan's last great acts of public service was to \nacknowledge 10 years ago to the American people and to the people of \nthe world that he was suffering from Alzheimer's disease.\n  He handled his affliction with his customary grace, saying that he \nwas sharing the news with the public in the hope that it might \n``promote a greater awareness of this condition.'' That was a \ncourageous thing to do. He went on further to say that he hoped it \nmight encourage a clearer understanding of the individuals and families \nwho are affected by it. He really brought a focus on the disease that \nultimately consumed his remaining years.\n  One truly meaningful way that we can honor President Reagan is to \npursue the kind of research that might produce a treatment, or even a \ncure, for Alzheimer's disease and a host of other illnesses, something \nhis beloved wife Nancy has called for. Since we witnessed the pain of \nthe deterioration of this great individual, we have to be mindful of \nthat for the future.\n  His life yielded so many more things, besides those obvious ones, \nduring his service as President of the United States.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I pay tribute to President Ronald Reagan, \na man for whom I had the utmost respect.\n  A strong, principled leader, President Reagan used his optimism and \nhumor to help the Nation feel better in a post-Vietnam, post-Watergate \ncountry coping with an energy crisis and high inflation.\n  He brought strong leadership and could relate to people from all \nwalks of life very, very easily. Democrats controlled the House during \nboth of his terms, and the Senate during his last 2 years in office. In \norder to advance his priorities, he had to bridge the partisan divide \nand work with members of the other party. He was also very proud of his \ngood personal relations with Tip O'Neill and other Democratic leaders. \nThe proof of his good personal relations with Tip O'Neill and other \nDemocratic leaders. The proof of his appeal was his ability to carry a \nDemocrat stronghold like my state of Rhode Island in the 1984 election. \nHe was the last Republican Presidential candidate to do so.\n  With tremendous vision and dignity, President Reagan will ultimately \nbe remembered for ending the cold war and promoting freedom and \ndemocracy throughout the world in a peaceful way.\n  In closing, I recall a large color photograph on my father's office \nwall. It is a picture of merriment, Senator Robert Dole having just \ncracked a joke, with President Reagan, Alan Simpson and John Chafee \nstanding by, smiling from ear-to-ear.\n  Later, my father obtained a copy of the photo and at a later meeting \nwith the President, slid it down the table towards him and asked if he \nwould sign it. Without hesitation, Reagan penned a line and slid it \nback.\n  It read simply, ``John--some times it is fun, isn't it?''\n  Some times it is fun, isn't it? Ronald Reagan, with unfailing good \nhumor and optimism, made Americans feel good about their country again. \nI believe that is his lasting legacy.\n  The Chafee family offers our sincere condolences to Nancy, and the \nReagan family.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to offer words in memory of \nAmerica's 40th president, Ronald Wilson Reagan.\n  Ronald Reagan was elected President on the same day that I was first \nelected to the United States Senate. I was somewhat of an anomaly that \nyear, being one of only two freshman Democrats elected to the Senate, \ncompared with 16 Republicans.\n  Over the years, there is no question that when it came to matters of \npolicy, Ronald Reagan and I disagreed, in a\n\n[[Page S6666]]\n\nvery fundamental way, on a great many occasions.\n  But in today's very partisan atmosphere, it is easy to forget that \npersonality can be much more important than agreements and \ndisagreements. Many of the qualities that distinguished Ronald Reagan--\nas a president, as a leader, as an individual--went beyond policies and \npolitics.\n  Ronald Reagan was one of our Nation's most personable presidents. His \ncongeniality, wit and trademark sense of humor could bring a smile to \nthe face of even the most ardent political opponent. And he had the \nuncanny ability to communicate his thoughts to the American people.\n  As a Member of the opposite side of the political aisle, I had a \nparticular appreciation for Ronald Reagan's openness. As we all know, \nPresident Reagan was a man of great conviction. It wasn't easy to \nchange his mind. But he was willing to sit down and talk. He was open \nto listening to views that were different from his own, even if he \nultimately chose to disagree with them. Ronald Reagan was able, as the \nsaying goes, to disagree without being disagreeable.\n  Though we had our differences on many issues, I would never doubt for \na minute Ronald Reagan's commitment to this Nation, just as I don't \nbelieve he doubted the patriotism of his political adversaries. Ronald \nReagan believed deeply in our country and in its values, and in its \nplace in the history of humankind. He correctly saw the former Soviet \nUnion, with its regime of repression, imprisonment, and stifling of the \nindividual spirit, as antithetical to everything in which we believe. \nHe presided over a historic time period during which we witnessed the \nbeginnings of a dramatic, global political sea change.\n  Ronald Reagan was a leader who reflected the optimism and spirit of \nthis great Nation. At the time he was elected president, our country \nwas experiencing a crisis of confidence. Many wondered if America's \nbest days were behind it. Ronald Reagan had an unflagging belief in \nAmerica, and he helped restore a sense of possibility in our land.\n  As a society, we often elevate our public figures to practically \nmythological proportions, and our presidents are no exception. Towards \nthe end of Ronald Reagan's life, though, we were reminded of his \nhumanity. All of us, particularly those of us who have watched a loved \none struggle late in life, were inspired by the dignity, grace, and \ncourage with which he and his family battled a terrible and devastating \ndisease--a disease that ultimately took Ronald Reagan, in the words of \nhis wife Nancy, to a place where she could no longer reach him.\n  Many tributes have been and will be paid to President Reagan's \nmemory. But I can't think of a greater tribute than to commit our \nNation to fully researching the causes of, and cures for, diseases like \nAlzheimer's that cause such great suffering for such great numbers of \npeople.\n  At this difficult time, my heart goes out to Nancy and the entire \nReagan family. America celebrated with you on so many happy occasions. \nThis week, we all join you in your sorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in remembering our \nNation's 40th President, Ronald Reagan, who passed away last weekend at \nhis home in Bel-Air, CA.\n  Of course, much has already been said, both in this Chamber and in \nthe media, about the legend of his large life. His career in movies, \nhis entry into politics and, of course, his two terms as President \nduring a most tumultuous time have been well documented in the past \nseveral days.\n  By all of these accounts, Ronald Reagan was a most admired \npolitician, and while he and I had our policy differences, I have \nalways shared in that admiration.\n  Ronald Reagan held true to a strong conservative philosophy, which \noften made it hard for the two of us to find common ground. I was a \nMember of the House of Representatives during his 8 years as President, \nand you might say I was often a thorn in his side. We were on opposing \nsides when it came to many issues, most notably tax cuts and funding \nfor the arts.\n  But through all of our sometimes heated discussions and debates, it \nwas so evident to me that President Reagan held a deep and abiding \npassion for his country, and an equally deep conviction for what he \nbelieved was right.\n  As Americans take time this week to honor the life of President \nReagan, it is that passion and conviction that they will remember and \nreflect upon. I believe, that those memories of our Nation's 40th \nPresident will inspire our future leaders.\n  I extend my condolences to his wife Nancy, and to the entire Reagan \nfamily on the passing of President Ronald Reagan. May the memories of \nhis life's accomplishments sustain them in their time of grief, and may \nthe Nation's prayers bring them comfort.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to former \nPresident Ronald Wilson Reagan, our Nation's 40th President.\n  Like many Americans, I admired President Reagan's eternal optimism \nand his belief in America and her people.\n  I am struck by the numbers of mourners who have paid their respects \nto our former President. The outpouring of respect and grief is a \ntestament to the great impact that he had on so many Americans. I am \nsure that one of the reasons so many have taken time to honor President \nReagan is because of the great optimism and purpose that he showed. His \ntrust in the fundamental decency and goodness of the American people is \na guide and inspiration to us all.\n  I admired his sense of civility and his ability to disagree with his \nopponents without being disagreeable. He fought hard for the policies \nin which he believed, but after the fight, he shook hands and moved on. \nWe need more of that kind of statesmanship in Washington today. And I \nhope my colleagues will join me in trying to follow his example.\n  During one of our Nation's greatest challenges--the cold war--\nPresident Reagan was a strong voice against the enemies of freedom. His \nleadership and vision helped us to overcome our enemies.\n  In the final years of his life, he and Mrs. Reagan were an example of \nthe kind of sacrifice and love that we should all seek to emulate. Mrs. \nReagan's quiet dignity and support for her husband during the most \ndifficult of times should be an inspiration to us all.\n  My thoughts and prayers go out to his wife, Nancy, his sons, Michael \nand Ronald, Jr., and his daughter, Patty.\n  Ronald Reagan lived a full life and was a great American. His \ncontributions to the American political system and to our way of life \nwill not soon be forgotten.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Ronald \nReagan, our Nation's 40th President. First, my condolences and prayers \ngo out to Nancy Reagan, the Reagan family, and all of those who are \nmourning his passing.\n  Ronald Reagan was an optimist. He was the best kind of optimist--a \nliving example of the fulfillment of the American dream. From a small \nMidwestern town, he rose to become leader of the free world and was \nrespected around the world by both our allies and our Soviet bloc \nopponents alike.\n  President Reagan was called the Great Communicator for a reason. Many \nof his speeches touched the heartstrings of all Americans. Whether it \nwas his speech at the Berlin Wall or his 1984 tribute to those who died \non D-Day, President Reagan always conveyed a positive, optimistic sense \nof our shared destiny. His words will long be remembered.\n  President Reagan loved America, and this love for our country shaded \nevery word he spoke to the Nation as President. He always wanted our \ncountry to be the ``shining city'' on a hill.\n  I also pay tribute and convey my genuine respect to our former First \nLady Nancy Reagan, a woman whose unwavering commitment to her husband \nnot only provided a testament to their love but also extended hope and \nempathy to countless Americans who share in the role of caregiver.\n  As we begin now to consider ways to pay proper tribute to our admired \nformer President, let us go beyond the erecting of a monument or the \netching of a portrait. Instead let us act to help the many Americans \nwho needlessly suffer from the debilitating effects of Alzheimer's \ndisease.\n\n[[Page S6667]]\n\n  We should increase research funding for Alzheimer's and expand stem \ncell research, which Nancy Reagan supports.\n  I am pleased to be a cosponsor of a Mikulski-Bond bill that will \ndouble our investment in Alzheimer's research and refocus our efforts \nto find a cure. This bipartisan measure, if passed, would leave a \nlasting legacy to President Reagan.\n  Earlier this month, I joined with 57 other Members of this body, both \nRepublican and Democrat alike, to urge President Bush to broaden the \ncurrent Federal policy regarding stem cell research. By expanding stem \ncell research beyond those stem cells derived by August 9, 2001, we \nwill take the necessary first step of helping millions of Americans who \nare plagued by Alzheimer's--Americans, who like President Reagan, live \nout their daily lives traveling an unknowable journey of solitude.\n  If we allow the medical experts to do stem cell research, we can \nbegin the work Mrs. Reagan so steadfastly promotes: finding a cure to \nthis devastating disease.\n  To find a cure of Alzheimer's would indeed be the greatest tribute we \ncould ever give to President Reagan.\n  In this time of grief, let us evoke President Reagan's gentlemanly \nservice, swift wit, jovial candor, and unconditional patriotism. With \ndifferences in philosophy and politics aside, let's all praise a man \nwhose decorum and distinguished character exemplified the office for \nwhich he held.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to take a few moments today to join \nmy colleagues in celebrating the life of our 40th President, Ronald \nWilson Reagan.\n  In many ways, Ronald Reagan embodied the American dream. He was born \nin the small town of Tampico, IL, and grew up 30 miles down the road in \nDixon, another small town. His was a normal, middle class American \nfamily, and he was the all-American boy-next-door: Good-looking, \npopular, an actor, and an athlete. And from that modest background he \nfulfilled the American democratic ideal that anybody can grow up to \nbecome President of the United States.\n  That ideal--that anyone can grow up to become President--captures \nAmerica's optimism, so it is fitting that the word that comes most to \nmind when remembering President Reagan is exactly that: optimism. \nPresident Reagan was an incurable and infectious optimist when it came \nto America. By insisting that, as he said, it was morning again in \nAmerica, he connected with Americans, lifted their spirits, and \nrestored their confidence in our future.\n  This power to communicate and connect with Americans from all walks \nof life was central to his success as President. He could sway skeptics \nand charm supporters with his simple eloquence and self-deprecating \nwit. People came to know him and feel comfortable with him; and they \nwere moved by his simple, clear messages. President Reagan perfected \nthe art of selling his policies to the American people and using that \nability to pressure Congress to work his will. Not surprisingly, the \nGreat Communicator, as he came to be known, left office with the \nhighest approval rating of any recent President.\n  President Reagan was one of the truly larger than life figures of the \npost World War II era. He brought a new conservative philosophy to the \nWhite House, and he championed freedom at home and abroad. One of the \nreasons for his success, I believe, was his willingness to compromise, \nto put aside partisan politics and ideological purity to do what was \nright for the country. When his 1981 tax cuts caused deficits to \nskyrocket, President Reagan supported tax increases in 1982 and 1983 to \ncontain the damage. After tagging the Soviet Union as the Evil Empire, \nhe negotiated historic arms control treaties with the Soviets, coining \nthe famous phrase ``trust, but verify'' in the process. He had, as his \nchief of staff Howard Baker once put it, ``a capacity to surprise.''\n  And throughout it all, he was a wonderful man, someone who you \ncouldn't help but enjoy being with. I met with president Reagan several \ntimes during the last years of his presidency. The last time I was with \nhim, President Reagan was telling two or three of us in the White House \nan Irish story full of warmth and wit. I believe that best describes \nPresident Reagan himself--a man of endearing wit and great personal \nwarmth.\n  As America mourns his passing, my thoughts and prayers are with Nancy \nand the rest of President Reagan's family and many, many friends. It is \nmy hope that their memories of his life, laughter, and legacy will be \nof some small comfort in these days and weeks ahead.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, on Saturday, June 5, 2004, President \nRonald Wilson Reagan, the 40th President of the United States, passed \naway after a decade-long battle with Alzheimer's disease. I extend my \ndeepest sympathies to the members of his family, who have suffered a \nterrible loss, and I want them to know that Americans throughout our \nNation, regardless of their political party or ideology, share in their \nloss and mourn with them.\n  Ronald Reagan was an exceptional national leader who loved this \ncountry and its people. He will long be remembered for his infectious \noptimism and his faith in America's future. To President Reagan, \nAmerica was always a shining city on a hill--a beacon of hope for all \nmankind. He understood just what a great country America is, and always \nremained a committed advocate for the ideal of freedom that helps \ndefine us as Americans.\n  President Reagan was known as the Great Communicator, and he richly \ndeserved the accolade. Few politicians, if any, have had his ability \nnot just to connect with the American people but to inspire them. His \nspeeches didn't just make a point, they touched a chord. He talked to \nAmericans in a powerful and personal way.\n  As is widely understood, Ronald Reagan had strongly held views about \npublic policy, from his support for lower taxes to his strong \nanticommunism. But as is less widely appreciated, President Reagan was \nnot inflexible or dogmatic. He actually was a practical and pragmatic \nleader who was willing to adjust his approach, sometimes dramatically, \nwhen circumstances called for change.\n  For example, after pushing through a large tax cut at the start of \nhis Presidency, he reversed course and increased taxes when the deficit \nstarted to explode. Perhaps most importantly, after denouncing the \nSoviets as an ``evil empire,'' he was willing to work closely and \ncooperatively with Mikhail Gorbachev, helping not only to end the cold \nwar but to liberate millions of people and change the course of world \nhistory. In doing so, he was not following his party. He was not \nfollowing the polls. He was following his conscience. And the entire \nworld community owes him a deep debt of gratitude for his vision and \nhis leadership.\n  There were many issues about which I strongly disagreed with \nPresident Reagan. But I always had great respect for him personally and \nfor the way he conducted himself while in office. President Reagan knew \nhow to disagree without being disagreeable. He knew that those in the \nother party were not enemies. He knew that, at the end of the day, we \nare all Americans and, though we may disagree about particular \npolicies, we all share a love of our country and a commitment to its \nfuture.\n  President Reagan's life was marked by his fundamental personal \ndecency and his sense of dignity. That was never more evident than when \nhe announced to the world his struggle with Alzheimer's disease in \n1994. His and Nancy Reagan's courageous fight against this debilitating \ndisease brought a new awareness to the devastation that accompanies \nthis illness. I hope it also will bring a new commitment to do what it \ntakes to find a cure for this horrible affliction.\n  In conclusion, Americans throughout our Nation are saddened at the \npassing of President Reagan, and our hearts go out to his family. \nRonald Reagan was an extraordinary man whose impact on our Nation, and \nour world, will be felt for generations to come. Today, we join \ntogether to honor his memory and to give thanks for his historic \nservice on behalf of the country he loved so deeply.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, Robert Robb is one of the great columnists in \nAmerican journalism today, and his tribute to Ronald Reagan is among \nhis best work. I ask unanimous consent to have the following article \nprinted in the Record.\n\n[[Page S6668]]\n\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Arizona Republic, June 9, 2004]\n\n               My First Fan Letter Was Signed ``Reagan''\n\n                            (By Robert Robb)\n\n       Ronald Reagan wrote my first fan letter.\n       When he announced for president in 1976, I was editor of \n     the student newspaper at Occidental College in Los Angeles.\n       The Los Angeles Times had developed an obsessive dislike \n     for Reagan. And it pounded on his announcement speech, \n     denouncing it and him for superficiality and a lack of \n     specifics.\n       Of course, it's standard fare for announcement speeches to \n     enunciate broad themes. And the only thing that would have \n     unhinged the Times more than a lack of specifics form Reagan \n     would have been if he had been specific.\n       And so I wrote a column for the student newspaper having a \n     bit of sport with the Times' hypocrisy and disequilibrium.\n       Not much later, I was astonished to receive a letter from \n     Reagan. Apparently being defended in a student newspaper was \n     an unusual enough event to catch the attention of his \n     campaign.\n       Reagan thanked me for my ``generous words,'' and allowed \n     that ``a great part of my pleasure was your masterful \n     handling of the Times.\n       That purposeful understatement was characteristic of Reagan \n     in political combat. He was far more inclined to give his \n     opponents a gentle and humorous poke in the ribs, rather than \n     a rhetorical knife in the stomach--a restraint he maintained \n     even as the invective and bile against him mounted.\n       Bill Buckley invented modern American conservatism--a \n     sometimes uneasy blend of anti-communism, free-market \n     economics and traditional cultural values inspired and \n     informed by religious faith. Barry Goldwater launched it as a \n     political movement.\n       But Ronald Reagan embodied the conservative movement. He \n     was the glue that held its factions and strands together long \n     enough, for a time, to be politically triumphant.\n       This was no small feat. American conservatism is more \n     naturally a dissenting movement than a governing one.\n       Yet Reagan not only governed, he transformed the country, \n     indeed the world.\n       What began as Reagan Democrats are now simply Republicans, \n     and the Republican Party now competes with the Democratic \n     Party for majority status, rather than the semi-permanent \n     minority role the party seemed consigned to before Reagan.\n       To complete with Reaganism, Democrats had to overcome their \n     legacy from the 1960s and 1970s, a belief that there was as \n     much wrong as right about America. Democrats reconciled \n     themselves to America's essential goodness, as well as its \n     defining institutions and values: free markets, enterprise, \n     faith and family.\n       Bill Clinton was a reaction to Reaganism, and today's \n     Republican Party, unfortunately, is as much a reaction to \n     Clintonism as it is a legitimate heir to Reaganism.\n       Winston Churchill believed that history was the story of \n     great men altering its course. In his History of the English \n     Speaking Peoples, writing about Alfred the Great, who united \n     much of modern-day England in the ninth century, Churchill \n     described his ``sublime power to rise above the whole force \n     of circumstances.''\n       As much as Reagan dominated and transformed the domestic \n     political landscape, his greatness--his sublime power to rise \n     above the whole force of circumstances--was in the way he \n     managed the Soviet Union and communism.\n       Early in his presidency, Reagan described the Soviet Union \n     as an evil empire and said it and Marxism-Leninism would be \n     deposited on the ``ash heap of history.''\n       This was denounced by foreign policy sophisticates at the \n     time as naive and dangerously provocative.\n       Yet he quickly embraced Mikhail Gorbachev, who gained power \n     in 1985, and his perestoika reforms. This made conservatives \n     highly nervous, and they openly wondered whether Reagan was \n     being had.\n       But Reagan, having lived through the Hungarian and Polish \n     rebellions, intuited that the Soviet Union could not both \n     liberalize and remain intact.\n       Reagan also knew the moment to apply pressure, as in 1987, \n     when he stood before the Berlin Wall and, against the advice \n     of his entire foreign policy team, famously called upon \n     Gorbachev to tear it down.\n       A few years later, I was in Berlin, after the wall had been \n     torn down figuratively, but not yet physically. You could \n     travel freely in eastern Berlin, but it was like Dorothy \n     stepping from black-and-white into the colorful land of Oz, \n     only in reverse--from the vibrant feel of a free people into \n     the still-stale desolation of the repression of the human \n     soul.\n       You could visit the wall and even take a blow against it \n     yourself. So, I clawed loose a few chunks and brought them \n     home.\n       They're mounted now, pieces of history's sadness and joy. I \n     can never look at those chunks of concrete without thinking \n     about Ronald Reagan, a champion of freedom for our time.\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the late \nPresident Ronald Reagan.\n  We were of different parties and very different political \nphilosophies but I respected him as a strong leader--a man of principle \nand dignity. He was also good-natured and affable, never letting \npolitical differences drag him down into bitter partisanship.\n  I was always impressed with President Reagan's ability to communicate \nand persuade and his talent for soothing our Nation in difficult times. \nIn good times and bad, he sought to appeal to the best in all of us, to \nour hopes and better instincts, not our doubts and fears. And while he \nenjoyed a good political fight, he never demonized his opponents or \naccused those who differed with him of being unpatriotic. Ronald Reagan \nseemed to understand that we could disagree without being disagreeable \nand that we all love our country, even as we debate the best way to \nmove toward a more perfect Union. All of us can learn from his example.\n  As we pay tribute to our 40th President, this man who rose from \nhumble beginnings to the greatest heights, I offer my condolences to \nNancy Reagan and the Reagan family. I join my colleagues in saying \nfarewell to Ronald Reagan, a modest man who was larger than life.\n  Thank you, President Reagan, for your service to our Nation and for \nthe important example you set for us all.\n   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on Saturday, our Nation lost a good man and \na great American, the 40th President of the United States, Ronald \nWilson Reagan.\n  A former sports announcer, actor, television performer, and Governor, \nthis man from a small mid-western town was eventually elected to our \nNation's highest office, not once, but twice, in landslide victories. \nHis was a success story, an American success story. He demonstrated \nthat the key to the American dream is still determination, hard work, \nand perseverance. He did it by appealing to our ``best hopes,'' not \n``our worst fears.''\n  Historians will study and evaluate the impact of the Reagan \nadministration--his role in ending the cold war and the results of his \ndomestic policies.\n  What is beyond debate was his uncanny ability to connect with the \nAmerican people. He knew where he wanted to take the country and \nattempted to do it with remarkable determination and charm. He restored \na much needed sense of optimism in America, and he did it with a \ncheerfulness that was absolutely contagious.\n  His optimism was prevalent and penetrating and inspiring even during \nthe darkest moments of his administration. With the Challenger \nexplosion, we grieved and despaired, but when President Reagan spoke of \nhow those courageous astronauts reached out and ``touched the face of \nGod,'' suddenly all of us realized that we, as a country, would make it \nthrough this grievous hour, and the American adventure into space would \ngo on. He was truly the Great Communicator.\n  I came to know and work with Mr. Reagan from a unique and important \nperspective. I was the leader of the opposition party in the U.S. \nSenate during both of President Reagan's terms.\n  From this position, I came to understand and appreciate, probably \neven more than his strongest supporters, his hold on the American \npeople, and the importance of the leadership that he provided.\n  In fact, I found him to be as charming in person as he was when \nspeaking to an audience or appearing on television.\n  Never once did I hear him engage in personal attacks on his \nchallengers.\n  When we disagreed, which was more often than not, it was always in \ncivil tones. He was always smiling, patting you on the back, asking you \nabout your family, and wishing you the best. You simply could not help \nbut like him. He seemed not to confuse differences of opinion with \ndifferences of ideals or values. After all, he liked to point out, ``we \nare all Americans.''\n  That is the way American politics is supposed to be. That was the \ndecency of Ronald Wilson Reagan. He might consider me a political \nopponent, but never a personal enemy. Just as I understood his \ndifficulties as the leader of the free world during 8 years of trial \nand turmoil, he understood my role as the loyal opposition\n  As much as I admired and respected him when he was President, never \nwas\n\n[[Page S6669]]\n\nmy appreciation for him and his wife Nancy stronger than in their \ndealing with his last and greatest struggle--the struggle he eloquently \nand heartbreakingly called the ``journey'' that would lead him ``into \nthe sunset'' of his life--his battle with Alzheimer's disease. He and \nNancy confronted this cruel, crippling disease with an openness and \ndignity that inspired a Nation.\n  Mr. President, my wife Erma and I extend our most heartfelt \ncondolences to Mrs. Reagan. She has been an inspiration to America, \ngracefully fulfilling the role of loyal, loving spouse even as she has \nwatched her greatest love drift away into the fog of Alzheimer's. In \nthe years when they should have been able to enjoy the warm memories of \ntheir storybook life together, she endured personal emotional tortures \nthat are difficult to imagine. In these last years, the vigilance and \ncaring she displayed throughout their marriage led her to become an \noutspoken advocate for medical research, a role for which she has \nearned the immense respect and gratitude of the Nation.\n\n                             A Sunset Fancy\n\n                     (A poem by an unknown author)\n\n     I saw the sun sink in the golden west\n     No angry cloud obscured its latest ray;\n     Around the couch on which it sank to rest\n     Shone all the splendors of a summer day,\n     And long--though lost of view--its radiant light\n     Reflected from the skies, delayed the night.\n\n     Thus when a good man's life comes to a close,\n     No doubts arise to cloud his soul with gloom;\n     But faith triumphant on each feature glows\n     And benedictions fill the sacred room;\n     And long do men his virtues wide proclaim,\n     And generations rise to bless his name.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, for the information of Senators, we are \ngoing to do our wrap-up business, have a couple of closing statements, \nand then we will adjourn for the ceremony tonight.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/09/senate-section/article/S6669-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6669-S6670]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n           JUDGE RICHARD MILLS DELIVERS MEMORIAL DAY ADDRESS\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, one of the most articulate and \nliterate members of our Federal judiciary, U.S. District Judge Richard \nMills, recently delivered an extraordinary Memorial Day address in my \nhometown of Springfield IL. I share it with my colleagues because I \nbelieve it is not only insightful but because it comes from a person \nuniquely suited to speak to the historical impact of World War II.\n  Judge Mills is a major general in the Illinois State Militia and a \nretired colonel in the U.S. Army. He served for 14 months in Korea with \nthe 3rd Infantry Division and headed counterintelligence for the 65th \nInfantry Regiment and the Greek and Belgian Battalions attached to the \n3rd Division. Among his decoration are the Bronze Star, Meritorious \nService Medal, Joint Service Commendation Medal, Korean Service Medal \nwith battle star, and both the U.S. and Republic of Korea Presidential \nUnit Citations. General Mills retired after 33 years in the military, \nActive and Reserve.\n  I am honored to count Judge Mills as a friend and hope you will value \nhis remarks as much as I do.\n  I ask that the remarks of Judge Mills be printed in the Record.\n  The address follows:\n\n                 Address of Major General Richard Mills\n\n       In 1935, when the Italian fascist military machine invaded \n     the undeveloped and primitive nation of Ethiopia on the \n     African continent, Emperor Haille Selassie issued this \n     mobilization order to his people: ``Everyone will now be \n     mobilized and all boys old enough to carry a spear will be \n     sent to Addis Ababa. Married men will take their wives to \n     carry food and cook. Those without wives will take any woman \n     without a husband. Women with small babies need not go. The \n     blind, those who cannot walk, or for any reason cannot carry \n     a spear are exempted. Anyone found at home after the receipt \n     of this order will be hanged.''\n       The imperial edict of the Conquering Lion of Judah, \n     although admittedly harsh, was unquestionably effective. And \n     its very tenor reflects the ultimate hopelessness of a nation \n     invaded by a far superior force and struggling to survive in \n     military conflict. The conscription laws of this country, of \n     course, have never been so elementary, desperate or severe, \n     yet they shared an identical purpose--to provide immediate \n     manpower to defend the nation!\n       Since July 1, 1973, not a single person has been drafted \n     into the armed forces of the United States. Since then, the \n     Selective Service System has operated in its prescribed \n     standy role. And since then we have been an all-volunteer \n     military force in a peacetime capacity, and the role of the \n     Selective Service System is, and will continue to be, one of \n     simply assuring that necessary military manpower will be \n     available in case of an emergency.\n       The Selective Service System, more commonly referred to \n     across the country as ``the draft'', is nothing new because \n     men have been drafted since Biblical time. It is related the \n     Book of Numbers in the Old Testament that God ordered Moses \n     to take a census of men 20 years of age and older. When he \n     and Aaron had accomplished this, they found an army of over \n     600,000 men. Under Julius Caesar in the Roman Empire, men \n     were drafted for military service for 10 years and had to \n     supply their own equipment. The Greek City States required \n     military service of all male citizens, regardless of age, and \n     thereby maintained their independence. But the first really \n     modern draft was instituted by Napoleon, and when he told his \n     generals, ``I need up to 25,000 men a month'', universal \n     military training established itself in France. As a matter \n     of fact, this very policy was adopted after the Napoleonic \n     wars by most European countries, with the exception of Great \n     Britain.\n       During World War 1 and before the end of the war in 1918, \n     nearly 3,000,000 men had been inducted and 24,000,000 had \n     been registered. And in World War II, more than 50,000,000 \n     men were registered and 10,000,000 of those were inducted \n     into the armed forces. I am confident that many of you \n     present today answered the call in this manner.\n       The veterans of America, what kind of people are they?\n       General of the Army Douglas MacArthur answered this \n     question in his famous speech before the U.S. Military \n     Academy's corps of cadets in May 1962: ``Yours is the \n     profession of arms, the will to win, the sure knowledge that \n     in war there is no substitute for victory, that if you lose, \n     the nation will be destroyed, that the very obsession of your \n     public service must be duty, honor, country.''\n       The May 22, 1941 edition of Army Field Manual (FM) 100-5, \n     Field Service Regulations: Operations, which was republished \n     in 1997 by the U.S. Government Printing Office in Washington, \n     DC, spells out the battlefield doctrines used to fight and \n     win World War II. Here is what it says: ``Man is the \n     fundamental instrument of war; other instruments may change \n     but he remains relatively constant. In spite of the advances \n     in technology, the worth of the individual man is still \n     decisive.''\n       World War II was the most important and far reaching event \n     of the 20th century.\n       The total number of people killed, wounded or missing can \n     never be calculated. More than 10 million Allied servicemen \n     and nearly 6 million military men from the Axis countries \n     lost their lives. More than 50 countries took part in the war \n     and the whole world felt its effects.\n       America suffered nearly 300,000 U.S. forces and merchant \n     seamen killed and almost 700,000 wounded. We had 157 navy \n     ships and submarines sunk and 866 merchant ships sent to the \n     bottom.\n       At Pearl Harbor, the heart of the U.S. fleet--18 ships--was \n     destroyed in about 100 minutes. As historian John Keegan \n     wrote, ``It killed 50 million human beings, left hundreds of \n     millions of others wounded in mind or body, and materially \n     devastated much of the heartland of civilization.''\n       World War II became a war of liberation after three \n     decisive turning points: Midway, North Africa and Stalingrad.\n       By autumn 1942, the Allies also were on the offensive in \n     the European theater, successfully landing in North Africa \n     and beginning the trek toward Rome. ``Now this is not the \n     end,'' Winston Churchill said as 1942 closed. ``It is not \n     even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of \n     the beginning.''\n       The Allies invaded Sicily. Then came Anzio Beach and the \n     terrible bloody battle for Monte Cassino, and on up through \n     Italy. The greatest naval armada of all time was assembled \n     for the invasion of Normandy on D-Day, June 6, 1944, where we \n     suffered 14,000 killed in action and 63,000 wounded.\n       In the Pacific, it was a bloody invasion, island by island, \n     ``leapfrogging'' toward Japan. Iwo Jima and Okinawa took \n     heavy tolls. General MacArthur did return to the Philippines \n     as he had promised, but 14,000 were killed and 62,000 were \n     wounded in the battle of Luzon.\n       The crucial year was 1945. For Nazi Germany and the 1,000-\n     year German Reich, it was the end.\n       In Italy, communist partisans captured ``Il Duce''--Benito \n     Mussolini--and his mistress. They were executed and hung by \n     their feet at a Milan gas station on April 28th. The very day \n     Mussolini died, Adolph Hitler married his longtime mistress, \n     Eva Braun, in his bunker. Within hours the same day, Hitler \n     shot himself with the same pistol he carried when he first \n     tried to seize power in a Munich beer hall years before.\n       Also in 1945, America took its final giant steps across the \n     Pacific to victory. Submarines strangled the home islands of \n     Japan.\n\n[[Page S6670]]\n\n     American B-29 bombers incinerated Japan's major cities, \n     reducing industrial production by a third and leaving 14 \n     million homeless. Admiral of the Fleet Chester Nimitz, \n     Pacific commander, convinced Pentagon planners to create \n     airfields even closer than Formosa by capturing Iwo Jima and \n     Okinawa.\n       Kamikaze suicide planes sank 38 ships, damaged 368, and \n     killed over 5,000 sailors. Soldiers of the U.S. 10th Army and \n     the Marines suffered almost 72,000 killed and wounded.\n       But on August 6, 1945, a Boeing B-29 Superfortress named \n     Enola Gay lifted from the runway at Tinian in the Marianas \n     and headed for Japan, nearly 1,500 miles across the open \n     Pacific. Six and a half hours later the atomic bomb was \n     dropped on Hiroshima. It detonated above the city with the \n     force of 20,000 pounds of TNT. Several thousand members of \n     the Second Japanese Army, then outside doing calisthenics, \n     were wiped out in a millisecond and the city was flattened.\n       Three days later Nagasaki suffered the same fate. On August \n     14 the Japanese emperor finally overruled his military chiefs \n     and accepted Allied surrender terms.\n       Americans of World War II understood that to bring down a \n     form of tyranny, it was necessary to sacrifice lives. In \n     liberty and in prosperity, the world after 1945 became a far, \n     far better place than it had been in 1939. World War II was \n     worth fighting, after all. To have lost would have brought \n     unimaginable sorrow and slavery.\n       To the veterans here today that we honor--particularly from \n     World War II--I salute you. You stood tall, you did your \n     duty, you survived, you returned. And we remember with heavy \n     hearts those of our comrades that paid the supreme sacrifice, \n     that were wounded, that were prisoners of war. We who are \n     here are the fortunate ones. It has been truly said: ``In war \n     there are no victors, only survivors.''\n       My fellow veterans, I salute you.\n       God Bless America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/09/senate-section/article/S6670-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6670]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CONGRATULATING EASTER SEALS GOODWILL INDUSTRIES REHABILITATION CENTER\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to honor the 35th anniversary \nof the merger between Easter Seals of New Haven, CT, Goodwill \nIndustries of South Central Connecticut, and the New Haven Area \nRehabilitation Center. The celebration of this historic occasion will \noccur on Monday, June 14, 2004.\n  For 35 years, Easter Seals Goodwill Industries Rehabilitation Center \nhas made remarkable achievements in its mission to enhance employment \nopportunities and the quality of life for people with disabilities and \nother special needs.\n  1930 marked the initial formation of Goodwill Industries of Central \nConnecticut. The New Haven Area Rehabilitation Center and the New Haven \nEaster Seal Society for Crippled Children and Adults were created in \n1954. Eventually, the leaders of these three organizations recognized \nthat they could accomplish far more working together than they could as \nseparate entities. They made the decision to put aside any feelings of \npersonal or institutional pride, and to come together for the benefit \nof those they served. The merger in 1969 was the first in our Nation's \nhistory that involved two major American non profit organizations.\n  The results speak for themselves. In the 35 years since the merger, \nthe Easter Seals Goodwill Industries Rehabilitation Center has served \napproximately 50,000 individuals with disabilities and special needs \nthroughout the New Haven area.\n  Today, Easter Seals Goodwill Industries Rehabilitation Center \ncontinues to provide valuable assistance in career exploration and job \nplacement, work skill development and training, and various other \nemployment support services to individuals with disabilities and \nspecial needs. The center also offers vital social assistance to \nindividuals with disabilities, enabling them to connect with others and \nto become active participants in their local communities. Finally, \nEaster Seals Goodwill Industries works throughout Connecticut to help \nour State's residents find proper housing, transportation, and \neducation.\n  I especially congratulate my good friend Malcolm Gill, who has \ncontributed 20 years of dedication and leadership as President of the \nEaster Seals Goodwill Industries Rehabilitation Center. I also \nrecognize the hard work of the Board of Directors, the staff, and \ncommunity volunteers who selflessly continue to serve the New Haven \ncommunity.\n  On behalf of the State of Connecticut, and the United States Senate, \nI congratulate Easter Seals Goodwill Industries Rehabilitation Center \non 35 outstanding years of service. I wish them continued success for \nmany years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/09/senate-section/article/S6670-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6670]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      A TRIBUTE TO BETTY STRONG, THE GRANDE-DAME OF IOWA POLITICS\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, in the early 1950s, at a time when \npolitical backrooms were still smoke-filled and the sound of a woman's \nvoice was still a cause for heads to turn, Betty Strong involved \nherself in politics in her home State of Iowa and did not hesitate to \nspeak her mind. She turned many heads and made folks in Iowa listen in \nthose days and folks have been listening to what she has had to say \never since.\n  A strong and rare woman, she had a deep and abiding commitment to the \nrough-and-tumble of the political process and will long stand as an \ninspiration to all of us, to every American who believes in the great \nidea of representative democracy, to all those whose values and dreams \nare represented by a political party and by the process through which \nwe elect our representatives.\n  She held firm her deep beliefs. She was, first and foremost, a \nDemocrat. In fact, Betty Strong was the grande-dame of Democrats in \nIowa. She was an organizer who knew how to bring people together for a \ncause, a woman who understood the issues, knew the process better than \nalmost anyone, and felt with every fiber of her being that she had not \nonly the right but the duty as a citizen to fight for what she believed \nwas right and fair and just. She fought on behalf of organized Labor \nand through the Central Labor Council for the basic dignity of the \nAmerican worker, and for a host of causes in her community, and did not \nhesitate to make her opinion known, did not waver when it came to \nbringing about the changes necessary to elect those who agreed with \nher. But partisanship was not what we should remember when we remember \nBetty Strong today.\n  To watch her in action was to understand what America is all about. \nTo see her build a coalition, to rally support, to bring out the best \nin her community to rise to an issue, to support a candidate, to lay \nout a platform, to build consensus, was truly a lesson in the best of \nthe American political dynamic. And, every four years without fail, she \nwas in the vanguard of the unique process we have come to understand as \nthe Iowa Caucuses.\n  I first met her in 1987 when I entered the Iowa Caucuses, and I can \nsay without hesitation or equivocation: I will never forget Betty \nStrong. She was with me then and her memory will remain with me always. \nI wrote her a letter in 1988 thanking her for her help and for her \nlifelong service, and I am honored to know that the letter hung on her \nliving room wall all these years. I will long be beholden to Betty for \nher commitment, for her support, for her help, for the extraordinary \ngrace she showed me and the dignity with which she lived her life and \nfought for the causes to which she was so committed.\n  Iowa has lost a great woman and I would ask my colleagues to join me \nin recognizing the lasting contribution that Betty Strong made to that \nfundamental Tip O'Neill-notion that all politics is local. Today we \nmourn her loss and offer to her family and all of her friends in Iowa \nand across America, the thanks of a grateful Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/09/senate-section/article/S6670-3", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6670-S6671]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTRIBUTE TO PRESIDENT EDWARD PARRISH, PRESIDENT OF WORCESTER POLYTECHNIC \n                               INSTITUTE\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to pay \ntribute to the distinguished president of Worcester Polytechnic \nInstitute, Edward Parrish, as he nears his retirement this year.\n  Ed Parrish came to WPI as president in 1995 after an impressive \ncareer in engineering at NASA and in teaching and academic research. \nFrom the University of Virginia to Vanderbilt and finally to WPI, he \nwas widely recognized for his skill and dedication in engineering and \nengineering education. He has led regional and national efforts to \nexpand the recruitment of students and the scope of engineering \nprograms, and he has demonstrated his commitment\n\n[[Page S6671]]\n\nto the future in these fields by joining in the management of a magnet \nschool for the sciences with the Worcester public schools.\n  He has been a pioneer in improving the quality of education, and \nexpanded the program at WPI to include more integrated projects, cross-\nscience working groups, and problem-solving education. He has created \nnew opportunities for faculty and students to participate in research \nand international study. By modernizing the infrastructure of the \nuniversity, he made it one of the earliest and best-wired campuses in \nthe Nation.\n  Since its founding in 1865, WPI has been a unique institution widely \nrecognized as a pioneer in technology and higher education. Ed Parrish \nhas led a world-class university into the 21st century, expanding both \nthe number and the knowledge of undergraduate and graduate students by \noffering opportunities to work with professionals in real situations on \ncampus, in Massachusetts, and around the world, solving real problems \nthat have an immediate impact on society.\n  Fortunately, Ed has agreed to serve on the Goldwater commission to \nprovide a continuing source of scientists by awarding scholarships to \ncollege students, so that his experience and talent will continue to \nbenefit the lives of students and the life of the Nation in the years \nahead. His 9 years at WPI have been a time of growth and expansion for \nthe university, and all of us in Massachusetts have much to thank him \nfor as he enters this next chapter of his outstanding career. Ed and \nhis family have my best wishes for the future, and I look forward to \nmany opportunities to work with him and learn from him in the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/09/senate-section/article/S6671-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6671]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     TRIBUTE TO HENRY D. MOODY, A DEDICATED ALABAMA PUBLIC SERVANT\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of Mr. \nHenry Moody, a dedicated civil servant from Alabama, who passed on \nApril 26, 2004.\n  Born on April 1, 1932, in Jemison, AL, to Henry and Mattie Moody, \nHenry was one of 13 children. He was raised on the Moody Farm in \nJemison, attended Jemison High School and Auburn University. Upon \ngraduating from college, he enlisted in the military and went on to \nreceive many honors.\n  Following Henry's military service, he began work at the Department \nof Veterans Affairs in Montgomery, AL, where he dedicated 36 years of \nhis life. He served in a number of capacities including loan examiner \nand appraiser and chief appraiser with the Construction and Valuation \nService. In 1976, he was appointed to assistant loan guaranty officer, \nand in 1982, he became loan guaranty officer. Henry served this \nposition with dedication and commitment, and was regarded as a top loan \nguaranty officer in the country.\n  There are few people in this world who dedicate so much of themselves \nto their work. Everyday, Henry Moody remembered the mission of his \njob--to provide quality housing for all veterans. Despite his numerous \naccomplishments, Henry retained a humble spirit. He always banked a \nperson's character and not just their worth, and wanted every person \nwho came into his office to leave with a good experience. He never \nallowed his office staff to use the excuse, ``the computers are not \nworking.'' If that was the case, Henry would find the files himself \nsince many families had driven for miles to see him. His favorite part \nof working at the VA was that every day was different, providing him \nwith new challenges, and with new people to meet. Everyone who came in \ncontact with him was encouraged by his smile and his helpful spirit.\n  Henry was recognized for his dedication and devotion to his job with \nmany honors including induction into Home Builders Association of \nAlabama's, HBAA, prestigious Alabama Building Industry Hall of Fame in \n1990. Additionally, former Alabama Governor Fob James proclaimed July \n3, 1995, as ``Henry Moody Day.'' Both awards were a fitting tribute for \nHenry's commitment to providing quality housing to our country's \nveterans.\n  Henry Moody will be remembered as a pioneer who served as an example \nfor others. He made an impact on all who had the pleasure of meeting \nand knowing him. He lived by two important phrases, ``This too shall \npass,'' and ``God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot \nchange, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the \ndifference.'' Alabama is certainly a better place for having Henry \nMoody as one of our own. He will be greatly missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/09/senate-section/article/S6671-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6671]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:33 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to House Resolution 663, expressing the profound regret and \nsorrow of the House of Representatives on the death of Ronald Wilson \nReagan, former President of the United States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/09/senate-section/article/S6671-3", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6671]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  At 3:15 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bills:\n\n       S. 1233.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to provide \nfinancial assistance to the Eastern New Mexico Rural Water Authority \nfor the planning, design, and construction of the Eastern New Mexico \nRural Water System, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce a bill \nthat authorizes the Bureau of Reclamation to help communities in \neastern New Mexico develop the Eastern New Mexico Rural Water System \n(ENMRWS). The water supply to be made available by this project is \nabsolutely critical to the region's future. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues here in the Senate to help make this project a \nreality.\n  The source of water for the ENMRWS is Ute Reservoir, a facility \nconstructed by the State of New Mexico in the early 1960s. In 1966, \nCongress authorized Reclamation to study the feasibility of a project \nthat would utilize Ute Reservoir to supply water to communities in \neastern New Mexico (Pub. L. 89-561). Numerous studies were subsequently \ncompleted, but it was not until the late 1990s that several \ncommunities, concerned about their reliance on declining and degraded \ngroundwater supplies in the area, began to plan seriously for the \ndevelopment of a regional water system that would make use of the \nrenewable supply available from Ute Reservoir.\n  As part of that process, the Eastern New Mexico Rural Water Authority \nwas formed to carryout the development of the ENMRWS. The Authority \nconsists of nine communities and three counties in eastern New Mexicop \nand has been very effective in finalizing the studies and planning \nnecessary to move forward with the project.\n  This is a very important bill to the citizens of New Mexico. It has \nthe broad support of the communities in the region, as well as \nfinancial support from the State of New Mexico. There is no question \nthat completion of the ENMRWS will provide communities in Quay, \nRoosevelt, and Curry counties with a long-term renewable source of \nwater that is needed to sustain current economic activity and support \nfuture growth and development in the region. I hope my colleagues will \nsupport this legislation, thereby helping to address water needs in the \nrural West.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2513\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Eastern New Mexico Rural \n     Water System Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Entrada Aquifer and the Southern High Plains \n     (Ogallala) Aquifer--\n       (A) provide 100 percent of the municipal and industrial \n     water supplies for communities in East Central New Mexico; \n     and\n       (B) serve a large majority of the agricultural water users \n     in East Central New Mexico;\n       (2) the Entrada and Southern High Plains Aquifers are \n     declining in quantity and deteriorating in quality;\n       (3) despite voluntary conservation efforts and improvements \n     in agricultural water use efficiencies, current estimates \n     indicate that present levels of groundwater use in some areas \n     of eastern New Mexico are not sustainable beyond 12 to 25 \n     years after the date of enactment of this Act;\n       (4) in 1959, the State of New Mexico began construction of \n     the Ute Dam and Reservoir on the Canadian River to develop a \n     long-term sustainable water supply for eastern New Mexico;\n       (5) section 2 of Public Law 89-561 (80 Stat. 711) \n     authorized the development of a feasibility study for a water \n     supply project in eastern New Mexico;\n       (6) since the feasibility study was authorized, a number of \n     studies have been completed as part of the feasibility study \n     process, including a 1994 study by the New Mexico Interstate \n     Stream Commission estimating the firm annual yield of water \n     from Ute Reservoir at 24,000 acre-feet per year;\n       (7) in March 1997, the New Mexico Interstate Stream \n     Commission and the Ute Water Commission entered into an \n     agreement for the purchase of 24,000 acre-feet of water per \n     year for beneficial consumptive use in eastern New Mexico;\n       (8) the Eastern New Mexico Rural Water Authority was \n     established to plan, finance, develop, and operate the \n     Eastern New Mexico Rural Water System;\n       (9) the conceptual design report for the Eastern New Mexico \n     Rural Water System--\n       (A) was finalized in August 2003;\n       (B) incorporates a Bureau of Reclamation willingness and \n     ability to pay report prepared in August 2002; and\n       (C) was subject to a peer review process that resulted in a \n     supplement to the conceptual design report, the Eastern New \n     Mexico Rural Water System Conceptual Design Peer Review Final \n     Report (December 2003);\n       (10) the State of New Mexico--\n       (A) strongly supports the development of the Eastern New \n     Mexico Rural Water System; and\n       (B) has appropriated amounts to the New Mexico Water Trust \n     Fund to assist communities in eastern New Mexico in securing \n     the financial resources necessary to provide an acceptable \n     cost share for development of the system; and\n       (11) completion of the Eastern New Mexico Rural Water \n     System would provide Quay, Roosevelt, and Curry Counties in \n     the State of New Mexico with a long-term reliable and \n     renewable source of water that would--\n       (A) sustain current economic activity; and\n       (B) support future economic development and growth in the \n     region.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to authorize the \n     Secretary of the Interior to provide financial and technical \n     assistance to the Eastern New Mexico Rural Water Authority to \n     plan, design, and construct the Eastern New Mexico Rural \n     Water System to provide a long-term reliable and renewable \n     source of water to communities in eastern New Mexico.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A resolution to authorize the transfer of funds for foreign \ncountries to participate in international peacekeeping or peace \nenforcement operations, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nForeign Relations.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, this legislation supports the President's \nGlobal Peace Operations Initiative. That initiative contemplates a \nmulti-year program to enhance global peacekeeping capacity by training \nand equipping military and security forces to facilitate the deployment \nof trained forces to international peace support operations.\n  The initiative stems from recognition of the concerns that have been \nidentified in dealing with peace support operations. Specifically it \nhas become clear that many countries have the political will to \nparticipate in peace support operations, but lack the capabilities and \nresources required to deploy and sustain themselves in the field. \nSimilarly, some countries have the capacity to conduct traditional \npeacekeeping, but many missions, such as in Liberia, require combat-\nlike peace enforcement tasks.\n  The Group of Eight, meeting this week, has endorsed the President's \nidea that the Group should pursue the goal of training at least 75,000 \ninternational peacekeepers over the next several years and develop a \nplan to provide logistical support around the world. The Group of Eight \nhas had a longstanding interest, expressed at both the Kananaskis and \nEvian summits, in providing technical and financial assistance to \nsustain and strengthen peacekeeping capacity worldwide, particularly in \nAfrica.\n  This bill supports that goal by authorizing a transfer of funding \nfrom the Department of Defense to the State Department for these \nactivities. The administration has made clear to me that the Department \nof Defense believes that the costs for this program would be more than \noffset by the savings realized by not having to deploy U.S. military \nunits to international peace operations.\n  The President's leadership and initiative demonstrates the strong \nU.S. interest in peace and prosperity worldwide and is an expression of \nU.S. confidence in growing African attention to and capacity in \naddressing security problems on and beyond the continent.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 2515. A bill to establish the Inspector General for Intelligence, \nand for other purposes; to the Select Committee on Intelligence.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwill address what I believe are fundamental deficiencies in the \nIntelligence Community's organization and methods of accountability.\n  For some time, we have been engaged in an ongoing national debate \nabout the scope, methods, organization and\n\n[[Page S6676]]\n\nmission of our intelligence agencies. Since the creation of our modern \nIntelligence Community as part of the National Security Act of 1947 \nthere have been numerous recommendations to strengthen the Intelligence \nCommunity leadership and mission to foster better communications and \nbetter serve the national security of the nation. Events over the last \ndecade have highlighted some disturbing intelligence failures--we have \nall spoken sadly of the 1993 World Trade Center Bombing, the Khobar \nTowers tragedy, the attack on the USS Cole, the bombs at our embassies \nin East Africa and of course, September 11. As a Congress we have an \nobligation to address these incidents and work to better our \nintelligence gathering and disseminating capabilities to ensure this \nlist is not added to.\n  As a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence--and a \nformer member of committees on international relations and armed \nservices in both this body and the other--I have participated in this \nnational debate on many fronts and for many years. Irrespective of the \nevents surrounding Director Tenet's recent resignation, I have believed \nstrongly in the need for reform of the Intelligence Community for some \ntime.\n  There is no question that the Intelligence Community requires \nsystemic changes. Specifically, increases in human intelligence, better \ninformation sharing and greater accountability are all issues that \ndesperately need to be addressed, and more importantly, acted on. It is \nmy hope that the Intelligence Committee aggressively pursue specific \nrecommendations based on a Committee-authored report to make \nsubstantive changes that will address the flaws that have been \ntragically revealed.\n  Americans need to know that their intelligence services are doing the \nbest job possible in protecting their security. I say this even while I \nmust recognize the dedication and professionalism of the thousands of \nAmericans who make up our Intelligence Community. Each day across this \ncountry and around the world, they labor, mostly without recognition, \nto keep this country safe from harm. Our intelligence employees work \nunder very demanding conditions and in environments that are extremely \ndangerous and can often shift without notice. They operate in a dizzing \nworld of ``what ifs'' where the rules change daily. It is their \nvigilance upon which we rely to give us the forewarning necessary to \ncounter the many dangers present in our world. Although it is \nimpossible to directly express our deep appreciation for their efforts, \nI charge this body to relay our eternal gratitude to those who serve \nAmerica so well.\n  But too often, breakdowns can occur that put Americans' lives at \nrisk. There are many of us in Congress who believe that we have gone \ntoo long without making any real efforts to reform the Intelligence \nCommunity.\n  However appreciative we are of the service done by those who work in \nthe fifteen agencies that make up our nation's Intelligence Community, \nwe as a Congress have a responsibility to continue to work to find ways \nto help them do an even better job, and more importantly, to ensure \nthat any failures are not repeated and that we learn from past \nmistakes. And at the same time, we have an obligation to the people of \nthis country to ensure that both pride and comfort in our intelligence \nservices exist. The people of this nation, and those of us elected to \nrepresent them, have a right to know that when mistakes are made, \ncorrections soon follow.\n\n  A major focus of mine for many years now has been accountability--\nensuring, for example, that government employees who issue travel visas \nto known terrorists are accountable to the American public for their \nactions. In this same vein, I'd like to see greater accountability \nbrought to the Intelligence Community.\n  The bill I am introducing today--the ``Intelligence Community \nAccountability Act of 2004''--creates an independent Inspector General \nfor Intelligence. This IG is not housed within any one agency, rather, \nit is an Inspector General for the entire Intelligence Community--all \nfifteen agencies and department members.\n  We must recognize that fifteen government agencies with fifteen \ndifferent heads, fifteen different missions, fifteen chains of command \nand fifteen institutional paradigms are often handicapped in \npromulgating national intelligence. This in turn can lead to \ndisconnects. And sadly in this business, such failures can lead to loss \nof life as we have been so graphically reminded over and over.\n  Intelligence comes from a variety of sources and in a wide array of \nforms. The fifteen members of the Intelligence Community must \nadequately interpret what they see, hear and find and then communicate \nthat to policy-makers who decide best how to use it in the defense of \nour homeland and interests abroad. The often used but highly \nappropriate cliche, ``connecting the dots'' requires extensive inter-\nagency cooperation for this to happen. And if that doesn't happen and \nfailures occur as a result . . . who do we hold accountable? How do we \nensure it doesn't happen again?\n  Let me be clear, the Inspector General for Intelligence, or IGI, that \nthis legislation creates will not diminish the power of the IG's that \nalready exist within each of the Intelligence Community member \nagencies. Rather, it will enhance their powers, giving them an \noverarching body to turn to when their own institutional limits are \nreached--when their investigations or complaints involve other \nIntelligence Community members who may be unwilling to cooperate or \nunable to provide answers or where roadblocks caused by inter-agency \n``turf wars'' are reached. It helps to fill a void in the \naccountability and oversight responsibilities of the Director of \nCentral Intelligence in his role as head of the entire Intelligence \nCommunity.\n  In the recent committee report to accompany the FY 2005 Intelligence \nAuthorization bill, the committee acknowledged the need for changes in \nthe Intelligence Community and stated that it believes the process of \nreform ``must begin.'' Therefore, I submit that we begin as soon as \npossible--I know that the Chairman of our committee is committed to \nthis effort and I hope that by bringing my legislation forward at this \ntime, my colleagues can see that I too am eager for progress and \nmomentum.\n  Make no mistake--this effort is intended to be part of a larger push \nto overhaul the entire intelligence community's organizational \nstructure. I welcome such a push and as we move forward in that \nendeavor, I will work to ensure my legislation is included in the \ndeliberations. But until that happens, I implore my colleagues to study \nthe issue, read my legislation and work with me to create this office.\n  In looking at the Intelligence Community, we need to recognize that \nwe are dealing with an amorphous entity made up of fifteen agencies, \nparts of departments, and independent bodies all spread out within our \nfederal government. They each have their own mission, chain of command, \nprocedures, history and institutional paradigms.\n  By law, and specifically according to Executive Order 12333 issued by \nPresident Reagan in 1981, the Director of the Central Intelligence \nAgency wears a ``double hat'' by serving as the Director of the entire \nIntelligence Community.\n  Within the structure created, he often does the best he can. But as \nhead of one of the agencies in the Community, his hands are often tied \nwhen it comes to exercising his authority over the other 14 members of \na community over which he has jurisdiction.\n  Currently the Director of Central Intelligence has limited budget \nauthority over the Pentagon's intelligence budget--which represents \napproximately 85 percent of the total intelligence community budget. \nAccording to Executive Order 12333, which also defines the \nresponsibilities of the Director of Central Intelligence, the DCI is \ncharged with working with the Secretary of Defense to ensure that there \nis no unnecessary overlap between national foreign intelligence \nprograms and Department of Defense intelligence programs. This provides \nhim with limited authority over the DoD intelligence budget, although \nhistorically this authority has not been exercised.\n  My legislation will essentially preserve the powers and role that the \nDirector of Central Intelligence currently enjoys as adivsor to the \nPresident and head of the Intelligence Community, but it would make his \noffice a separate\n\n[[Page S6677]]\n\nentity and a member of the President's Cabinet.\n  I saw firsthand the consequences of serious inadequacies in \ncoordination and communication during my twelve years as ranking member \nof the House Foreign Affairs International Operations Subcommittee and \nchair of the International Operations Subcommittee of the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee. It was this lack of coordination that \npermitted the radical Egyptian Sheik Rahman, the mastermind of the \nfirst World Trade Center bombing in 1993, to enter and exit the U.S. \nfive times unimpeded even after he was put on the State Department's \nLookout List in 1987, and allowed him to get permanent residence status \nby the INS even after the State Department issued a certification of \nvisa revocation.\n  And after the attacks of 9-11, I worked hard to point out the \nimportance of the ``Three C's'' that has been lacking among federal \nagencies that are integral to preventing terrorism: coordination, \ncommunication, and cooperation.\n  This legislation that I am introducing today, is an extension of my \nefforts then.\n  The bottom line is, if knowledge is power, we are only as strong as \nthe weakest link in our information network--therefore, we must ensure \nthat the only ``turf war'' will be the one to protect American turf. In \nour fight against terrorism, we can do no less.\n  We must move heaven and earth to remove the impediments that keep us \nfrom maximizing our defense against terrorism, and that means changing \nthe prevailing system and culture by re-focusing on the ``Three C's'': \ncoordination, communication and cooperation.\n  Many of our greatest victories--those won by the men and women in our \nintelligence services--will be measured by the attacks that never \nhappen . . . in battles we win before they ever have a name . . . in \nconflicts we prevent before they ever claim one American life. I hope \nwe will pass and enact legislation that will help make that possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/09/senate-section/article/S6677-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6677-S6679]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 373--RELATIVE TO THE DEATH OF RONALD WILSON REAGAN, A \n                 FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. FRIST (for himself and Mr. Daschle) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

which was considered \nand agreed to:\n       Whereas Ronald Wilson Reagan, the 40th President of the \n     United States, was born on February 6, 1911, in Tampico, \n     Illinois, to Nelle and John Reagan and raised in Dixon, \n     Illinois;\n       Whereas as a lifeguard at Rock River in Lowell, Illinois, a \n     young Ronald Reagan saved the lives of 77 swimmers;\n       Whereas Ronald Reagan enrolled in Eureka College where he \n     played football, acted in amateur theater, and graduated with \n     a bachelor's degree in economics and sociology;\n       Whereas Ronald Reagan landed his first job as a radio \n     announcer for WOC in Davenport, Iowa, and went on to become a \n     popular sports announcer;\n       Whereas Ronald Reagan launched a movie career that spanned \n     50 movies, including his most famous role as the football \n     legend, ``The Gipper'';\n       Whereas Ronald Reagan, who received more fan mail than any \n     other actor at Warner Brothers Studios except Errol Flynn, \n     served as president of the Screen Actors Guild from 1947 to \n     1960;\n       Whereas on March 4, 1952, Ronald Reagan married his great \n     love, Nancy Davis, who was to become his lifelong confidante \n     and companion;\n       Whereas Ronald Reagan was the father of 4 children: \n     Maureen, Michael, Patti, and Ronald Prescott;\n       Whereas Ronald Reagan hosted the popular television series \n     ``GE Theater'' from 1954 to 1962;\n       Whereas in 1962, Ronald Reagan switched his party \n     affiliation from Democrat to Republican and 2 years later \n     delivered a major televised speech in support of Presidential \n     candidate Barry Goldwater;\n       Whereas in 1966, Ronald Reagan won the governorship of \n     California and in 1970 was reelected to a second term;\n       Whereas Governor Reagan campaigned for the Republican \n     nomination in 1968, and again in 1976;\n       Whereas on July 16, 1980, the former Governor won the \n     Republican nomination and on November 4, 1980, won the United \n     States Presidency in a landslide vote;\n       Whereas President Reagan appointed the first woman to the \n     United States Supreme Court, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor;\n       Whereas on March 30, 1981, only 2 months into his \n     Presidency, Ronald Reagan survived an assassination attempt \n     and upon meeting Nancy in the hospital, quipped with \n     characteristic good humor, ``Honey, I forgot to duck'';\n       Whereas President Reagan delivered on his promise to cut \n     taxes for American workers in 1981, and achieved the historic \n     tax cuts of 1986 which overhauled the Federal tax code and \n     reduced tax rates for almost all taxpayers, including \n     removing 6,000,000 Americans from the tax rolls;\n       Whereas under President Reagan's leadership, inflation \n     fell, interest rates declined, and by the seventh year of his \n     Presidency, the stock market hit an all-time high;\n       Whereas President Reagan presided over the longest economic \n     expansion in the history of the United States until that time \n     and rebuilt the national defenses of the United States;\n       Whereas President Reagan won reelection in 1984 carrying 49 \n     out of 50 States-one of the biggest electoral victories in \n     the political history of the United States;\n       Whereas during summit meetings with Soviet Union President \n     Mikhail Gorbachev in December 1987, President Reagan signed a \n     treaty to eliminate intermediate-range nuclear forces;\n       Whereas President Reagan's steadfast opposition to \n     communism, his unshakeable resolve to defeat the ``Evil \n     Empire'', and his secure belief in government for and by the \n     people, led to the collapse of the Berlin Wall and victory in \n     the Cold War;\n       Whereas President Reagan's belief in freedom as a God-given \n     right of all peoples led to a democratic revolution across \n     Central America;

which was referred to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 375\n\n       Whereas one of the greatest threats in the 21st century is \n     the nexus between terrorism and weapons of mass destruction, \n     which is fueled by failed states and instability that arises \n     in large part from extremist organizations from the Greater \n     Middle East region including nations of the Middle East, \n     North Africa, and Central and South Asia;\n       Whereas the United States must promote security and \n     stability in this troubled region where demographics, \n     religious extremism, autocratic governments, isolation, \n     stagnant economic systems and war have often overwhelmed the \n     talents of the people and the wealth of the region's natural \n     resources;\n       Whereas poverty and economic underdevelopment do not cause \n     terrorism, but, by\n\n[[Page S6678]]\n\n     promoting economic prosperity, political reform, peace and \n     security in the Greater Middle East, the United States and \n     the international community can help reduce the potential \n     that such countries become a source of international \n     terrorism;\n       Whereas advancements in communications, transportation, \n     health and educational opportunities have yet to reach large \n     percentages of the people of the Greater Middle East;\n       Whereas reform and modernization must come from the people \n     and nations within the Greater Middle East and cannot be \n     imposed from countries or individuals outside;\n       Whereas the best way to achieve these goals is to cooperate \n     with our traditional partners and with other countries, \n     specifically in the Greater Middle East on a new paradigm of \n     reform and development;\n       Whereas the Arab Human Development Report of 2003 \n     commissioned by the United Nations Development Programme \n     identified the lack of knowledge, freedom, and the \n     empowerment of women as the most serious challenges to \n     development;\n       Whereas the United States launched the Middle East \n     Partnership Initiative in 2002 to support economic, \n     political, educational reform and the empowerment of women in \n     the Middle East and has undertaken similar programs in North \n     Africa and Central and South Asia that are creating \n     educational and economic opportunity, fostering private \n     sector development, and strengthening civil society;\n       Whereas other members of the Group of Eight (Canada, \n     France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, and the United \n     Kingdom), and the European Union have established and \n     supported similar programs and objectives; and the European \n     Union, in particular, established the Euro-Mediterranean \n     Partnership in Barcelona in 1995 which includes development \n     of economic and financial cooperation and greater emphasis on \n     social, cultural, and political issues;\n       Whereas many nations of the Greater Middle East have \n     individually and multilaterally expressed their interest and \n     intentions to move towards implementing governmental and \n     civil society modernization and reform, and many such \n     countries have declared their commitment to support universal \n     principles of democracy, human rights, and individual \n     freedoms, including freedom for women;\n       Whereas the Alexandria Library in Egypt hosted a conference \n     in March 2004 entitled Critical Reforms in the Arab World: \n     From Rhetoric to Reality to bring together members of civil \n     society in the Middle East including intellectuals, business \n     people, and academics and the conference participants made a \n     statement declaring that they ``are fully convinced that \n     reform is a necessary and urgent matter,'' and that they \n     embraced ``without ambiguity, genuine democracy'';\n       Whereas the Arab League Summit in May 2004 resulted in an \n     assertion of the firm resolve of these nations to reaffirm \n     human rights and freedoms and to carry on reform and \n     modernization, including consolidation of democratic \n     practice, broadening participation of all components of civil \n     society and widening women's participation in the political, \n     economic, social, cultural and educational fields; and\n       Whereas the members of the Group of Eight met in Sea \n     Island, Georgia in June 2004 and committed to cooperate with \n     the countries of the ``Broader Middle East and North Africa'' \n     to assist in advancing their aspirations for political, \n     economic and social reforms: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON GREATER MIDDLE EAST \n                   INITIATIVES FOR REFORM AND MODERNIZATION, \n                   INCLUDING A TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY TRUST.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) in June 2004, the President encouraged the Group of \n     Eight (the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, \n     Japan, Russia, and the United Kingdom) to outline a plan to \n     engage with the countries of the ``Broader Middle East and \n     North Africa'' in a way that allows such countries to \n     establish priorities for reform and modernization in the new \n     millennium;\n       (2) reforms in the countries of the Greater Middle East, \n     including nations of the Middle East, North Africa, and \n     Central and South Asia, must be generated from within by the \n     people and governments of such countries, and can only be \n     effective if undertaken in the context of people taking \n     charge of their own futures;\n       (3) the President should seek to build on the initiatives \n     of the Group of Eight and establish specific mechanisms for \n     accomplishing the goals of reform and modernization of the \n     Greater Middle East such as establishment of a Greater Middle \n     East Twenty-First Century Trust, as described in section 2; \n     the two-way nature of the functions of such a Trust confers \n     ``ownership'' of the processes of reform in the countries of \n     the Greater Middle East and will invite renewed dialog;\n       (4) the members of the Group of Eight and the nations of \n     the Greater Middle East region should follow-up the G-8 \n     Summit with official and private meetings, conferences, and \n     other events to further explore and implement initiatives, \n     including establishing terms of reference for a Greater \n     Middle East Twenty-First Century Trust;\n       (5) the members of the Group of Eight can help effect long-\n     term political and economic change in the Greater Middle East \n     by leveraging financial contributions from Europe, Asia, and \n     the wealthy countries of the region, and by providing the \n     imprimatur of the broad international community;\n       (6) the President should use his considerable leverage with \n     allies inside and outside the region to assist in the \n     promotion of democratic reforms and political freedom; and\n       (7) recognizing that social and political change would be \n     more difficult in an atmosphere of violence, the President \n     should work with other industrialized democracies and with \n     the countries of the Greater Middle East to promote peace and \n     maintain a stable environment for long-term progress.\n\n     SEC. 2. MODEL FOR ESTABLISHING A GREATER MIDDLE EAST TWENTY-\n                   FIRST CENTURY TRUST.\n\n       The Senate urges the President to consider generating \n     support for a Greater Middle East Twenty-First Century Trust \n     (hereinafter referred to as the ``Trust'') in coordination \n     and partnership with the members of the Group of Eight and \n     the countries of the Greater Middle East in a quest for \n     political, economic, and educational reform and for \n     modernization in such countries. The Trust could be organized \n     with the following guidelines:\n       (1) Donors to the Trust could pool resources to deliver \n     grants and work together to define the funding criteria for \n     the Trust based on high priority needs identified by the \n     recipients of such grants.\n       (2) The contributors to the Trust could include wealthy \n     countries of the Greater Middle East, such as Saudi Arabia, \n     Kuwait, and others willing to invest in their own futures and \n     take a stake in the Trust's success.\n       (3) The Trust could be sensitive to cultural concerns of \n     the people and governments of the countries of the Greater \n     Middle East and could respect Islamic financial principles to \n     ensure that the Trust will be accepted in the region.\n       (4) The Trust could reflect advances in understanding of \n     international development and be based on the models of the \n     Africa Action Plan of the Group of Eight, the Global Fund to \n     Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and the Millennium \n     Challenge Corporation, which represent a new form of social \n     compact between governments and donors that does not \n     superimpose a plan from donors but, instead, works with the \n     recipient countries to plan and set priorities for \n     assistance.\n       (5) Contributors to the Trust could use independent \n     indicators to judge if a candidate country is making strides \n     to promote the rule of law, political and civil rights, \n     combat corruption, and modernize economic and education \n     systems.\n       (6) The Trust could be a vehicle for action that would set \n     broad goals and criteria and should include specific programs \n     developed and offered by the countries that will receive \n     assistance from the Trust.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 117--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT \n   THE PRESIDENT SHOULD POSTHUMOUSLY AWARD THE PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF \n                      FREEDOM TO HARRY W. COLMERY\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Specter, and Mr. \nSantorum) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 117\n\n       Whereas the life of Harry W. Colmery of Topeka, Kansas, was \n     marked by service to his country and its citizens;\n       Whereas Harry Colmery earned a degree in law in 1916 from \n     the University of Pittsburgh and, through his practice of \n     law, contributed to the Nation, notably by successfully \n     arguing 2 significant cases before the United States Supreme \n     Court, 1 criminal, the other an environmental legal dispute;\n       Whereas during World War I, Harry Colmery joined the Army \n     Air Service, serving as a first lieutenant at a time when \n     military aviation was in its infancy;\n       Whereas after World War I, Harry Colmery actively \n     contributed to the growth of the newly formed American Legion \n     and went on to hold several offices in the Legion and was \n     elected National Commander in 1936;\n       Whereas in 1943, the United States faced the return from \n     World War II of what was to become an active duty force of \n     15,000,000 soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines;\n       Whereas Harry Colmery, recognizing the potential effect of \n     the return of such a large number of veterans to civilian \n     life, spearheaded the efforts of the American Legion to \n     develop legislation seeking to ensure that these Americans \n     who had fought for the democratic ideals of the Nation and to \n     preserve freedom would be able to fully participate in all of \n     the opportunities the Nation provided;\n       Whereas in December 1943, during an emergency meeting of \n     the American Legion leadership, Harry Colmery crafted the \n     initial draft of the legislation that became the Servicemen's \n     Readjustment Act of 1944, also known as the GI Bill of \n     Rights;\n       Whereas the GI Bill of Rights is credited by veterans' \n     service organizations, economists, and historians as the \n     engine that transformed postwar America into a more \n     egalitarian, prosperous, and enlightened Nation poised to \n     lead the world into the 21st century;\n\n[[Page S6679]]\n\n       Whereas since its enactment, the GI Bill of Rights has \n     provided education or training for approximately 7,800,000 \n     men and women, including 2,200,000 in college, 3,400,000 in \n     other schools, 1,400,000 in vocational education, and 690,000 \n     in farm training and, in addition, 2,100,000 World War II \n     veterans purchased homes through the GI Bill;\n       Whereas as a result of the benefits available to veterans \n     through the initial GI Bill, the Nation gained over 800,000 \n     professionals as the GI Bill transformed these veterans into \n     450,000 engineers, 238,000 teachers, 91,000 scientists, \n     67,000 doctors, and 22,000 dentists;\n       Whereas President Truman established the Presidential Medal \n     of Freedom in 1945 to recognize notable service during war \n     and in 1963, President Kennedy reinstated the medal to honor \n     the achievement of civilians during peacetime;\n        Whereas pursuant to Executive Order No. 11085, the Medal \n     of Freedom may be awarded to any person who has made an \n     especially meritorious contribution to ``(1) the security or \n     national interest of the United States, or (2) world peace, \n     or (3) other significant public or private endeavors''; and\n       Whereas Harry Colmery, noted for his service in the \n     military, in the legal sector, and on behalf of the Nation's \n     veterans, clearly meets the criteria established for the \n     Presidential Medal of Freedom; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that the \n     President should posthumously award the Presidential Medal of \n     Freedom to Harry W. Colmery of Topeka, Kansas.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution \nhonoring the life of Harry W. Colmery of Topeka, KS, and expressing the \nsense of Congress that the President should award Mr. Colmery the \nPresidential Medal of Freedom posthumously.\n  As my colleagues know, the Presidential Medal of Freedom is this \nNation's highest civilian honor. Thus, my colleagues may ask, ``What in \nparticular makes the life of Harry Colmery stand out?'' I would answer \nthat just two weekends ago, we in Washington saw the answer to this \nquestion when thousands of veterans gathered on the National Mall for \nthe dedication of the World War II Memorial. These individuals and \nmillions of their fellow soldiers benefited from the work of Harry \nColmery, the author of the initial draft of the Servicemen's \nReadjustment act of 1944, also known as the GI Bill of Rights.\n  The Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944 was aimed to aid military \nveterans as they transitioned back into civilian life following the \nconclusion of World War II by providing certain useful benefits. Among \nthe historic benefits of this bill was a new educational benefit that \nwould revolutionize America's higher education system. More than 2 \nmillion eligible men and women went to college using these educational \nbenefits in the decade following World War II. The result was an \nAmerican workforce enriched by 450,000 engineers, 238,000 teachers, \n91,000 scientists, 67,000 doctors, 22,000 dentists, and another million \ncollege-educated men and women. An estimated 5 million additional men \nand women received other schooling or job training under the provisions \nof the GI Bill.\n  The success of the GI Bill of Rights was unmistakable. A Veterans \nAdministration study in 1965 showed that the increased earning power of \nGI Bill college graduates led to Federal income tax revenues rising by \nmore than a billion dollars annually. In less than 20 years, the $14 \nbillion cost of the original program had been recovered. Americans like \nprograms that work and, in the decades following World War II, Congress \nbuilt on the success of the original GI Bill. The most recent \nMontgomery GI Bill, approved in 1985, was designed not only to help \nveterans make a transition into the workforce through additional \neducation and training benefits, but also to help support the concept \nof an all-volunteer military. As my colleagues know, the promise of \neducational benefits has been one of the most successful tools given to \nour Nation's military recruiters.\n  Harry Colmery's dedicated service to the veterans of this Nation and \nthe long reach of his work into the lives of millions of Americans \ncertainly make him an individual worthy of the Presidential Medal of \nFreedom.

Mr. President, I want the Record spread with my \nappreciation for the work done by the chairman, Senator Lugar, and the \nranking member, Senator Biden. This is an issue that goes back to the \ndays when the Italian Government was confiscating property and not in \nany way compensating those whose property was taken. This is an effort \nto rectify that situation. I cannot adequately express my appreciation \nto the committee that worked so hard on this issue and to the \nleadership of that committee. This is very important.\n  This involves a prominent family from Nevada. They owned property in \nItaly. The Italian Government wrongfully confiscated the property \ndecades ago, but to date, they have yet to provide compensation to the \nfamily.\n  Adequate compensation is required under treaties we have entered into \nwith Italy. This resolution simply calls upon the Italian Government to \nmake an effort to satisfy this claim and encourages our State \nDepartment to work with the Italian Government to see that the claim is \nresolved. It is noncontroversial and does not cost one penny.\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and any statements relating to the resolution be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 341) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 341\n\n       Whereas the Government of the Italian Republic confiscated \n     the property of Mr. Pier Talenti, a citizen of the United \n     States, and has failed to compensate Mr. Talenti for that \n     property;\n       Whereas the Government of Italy has an obligation under the \n     Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation, signed at Rome \n     February 2, 1948 (63 Stat. 2255) between the United States \n     and the Italian Republic to provide compensation to Mr. \n     Talenti for the confiscated property;\n\n[[Page S6681]]\n\n       Whereas the failure of the Government of Italy to \n     compensate Mr. Talenti runs counter to such Government's \n     treaty obligations and to accepted international standards;\n       Whereas section 1611 of H.R. 1757, 105th Congress, as \n     passed by the Senate on June 17, 1997, expressed the sense of \n     Congress that the ``Italian Republic must honor its Treaty \n     obligations with regard to the confiscated property of Mr. \n     Pier Talenti by negotiating a prompt resolution of Mr. \n     Talenti's case, and that the Department of State should \n     continue to press the Italian government to resolve Mr. \n     Talenti's claim.'';\n       Whereas the Government of Italy has not responded to \n     Diplomatic Note 674 issued in 1996, urging such Government to \n     negotiate a settlement with Mr. Talenti; and\n       Whereas Mr. Talenti has exhausted all legal remedies \n     available to him under the Italian judicial system and has \n     not received ``just and effective compensation'' for the \n     confiscated property from the Government of Italy as required \n     under the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the Government of Italy should--\n       (A) fulfill the requirements of the Treaty of Friendship, \n     Commerce and Navigation signed at Rome February 2, 1948 (63 \n     Stat. 2255) between the United States and the Italian \n     Republic with respect to the property of Mr. Pier Talenti \n     that was confiscated by such Government; and\n       (B) make reasonable efforts to effect a prompt resolution \n     of Mr. Talenti's claims under such Treaty; and\n       (2) the Secretary of State should--\n       (A) continue to press the Government of Italy to resolve \n     Mr. Talenti's claims; and\n       (B) take any further measures, including all appropriate \n     diplomatic initiatives, that the Secretary determines could \n     assist Mr. Talenti in receiving such compensation from the \n     Government of Italy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/09/senate-section/article/S6681-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am honored to have the opportunity to \nrise today to join my colleagues and, indeed, my country men and women \nin paying tribute to our departed and, I would say, sincerely beloved \nformer President Ronald Reagan. We mourn his loss and we give our \ncondolences, of course, to Mrs. Reagan and their family.\n  I cannot claim, as some can in this Chamber, to have known President \nReagan personally and well. In fact, we met a few times while he was \nserving in the White House. I was attorney general of Connecticut and \nvisited with attorneys general. We did have one remarkable rendezvous.\n  Our paths crossed, figuratively speaking, as President Reagan was \ndeparting Washington, having completed his second term as President. I \nwas arriving as a freshman Senator from Connecticut. It was January 14, \n1989, and the outgoing President was set to give his final weekly radio \naddress Saturday morning.\n  As always, he gave a masterful and moving performance, engaging the \nNation with his wisdom and his wit. Senate Majority Leader George \nMitchell, the new Senate majority leader, asked me to give the \nDemocratic response to President Reagan that Saturday morning in \nJanuary. It was a high honor, of course, for me as a freshman Senator \nto be asked to give the weekly radio address but it was, needless to \nsay, a tough act to follow.\n  I looked back to my remarks and in them I see I praised President \nReagan\n\n[[Page S6683]]\n\nfor his love of country, his fervent devotion to freedom, and his \ncommitment to the values of faith, flag, and family. I said I was \n``inspired and encouraged by his sense of patriotism,'' and I urged all \nAmericans to work together on our unfinished business with ``the spirit \nof purpose and confidence that is the legacy of the Reagan years.''\n  Today, 15 years later, I am very proud I was able to speak those \nwords, and proud of their truthfulness. My admiration and respect for \nPresident Reagan has only grown with time. The optimism, the idealism, \nthe patriotism, and confidence he radiated infected us all and are \nexactly what we need today.\n  President Reagan won the trust of the American people and used that \ntrust to lead. I believe he won the trust of the American people \nbecause he reflected their values and they knew he was the real thing, \nthat he stuck to what he believed was right, whether it was popular or \nnot. His leadership was classic democratic leadership, with a small \n``d.'' His moral conviction, combined with his pragmatism, enabled him \nto do an awful lot for our country and the world. He understood what \nAmerica was about, which was freedom and opportunity, and extended both \nin America and throughout the world.\n  After all, he led our country and the free world to victory in the \nfinal battle of the cold war against communism.\n  Ronald Reagan's message of optimism and purpose was carried by one of \nthe most effective messengers ever to occupy the Oval Office. His \nrhetoric, after all, made us swell with pride, sometimes harden with \nindignation, often resonate with emotion. He also made us laugh.\n  I loved President Reagan's jokes and borrowed them often, sometimes \nwith attribution, sometimes not. One of my favorites was the one that \nsaid a lot about him and about what he believed, what he was for, and \nwhat he was against. It was about the commissar who visited the \nCommunist collective farm in Russia. He greeted the farmer, who was the \nhead of the farm, on an inspection tour and asked the farmer how the \npotato crop had been that year.\n  The farmer said: Oh, commissar, the potato crop has been excellent. \nAs a matter of fact, if we took all the potatoes we grew on this farm \nthis year and put them one on top of the other, they would reach all \nthe way up to the feet of God.\n  Troubled, the commissar from Moscow said, comrade farmer, I am glad \nto hear you did so well raising potatoes, but what do you mean about \nreaching up to the feet of God? This is a Soviet Communist collective \nfarm. There is no God.\n  The comrade said, that is okay, because there are no potatoes, \neither. So it was.\n  I heard someone in the last few days since President Reagan's death \nrepeat a one-liner of his where the press was getting on him because \nthey said he was not working hard enough as President. At some public \ngathering, President Reagan said he was aware of these criticisms and \nhe was also aware of the old line that hard work never killed anybody, \nbut, President Reagan said, I figure why should I run the risk? And so \nit was.\n  His sense of humor and exuberance served him and the country well. \nYes, he was a cold warrior, our leader in the final battle of the cold \nwar, but he was also a happy warrior. In this and in so many other \nways, Ronald Reagan reflected the personality and values of the \nAmerican people. You could disagree with his policies, but you could \nnever find his personality or his sincerity disagreeable.\n  He treated Democrats and Republicans alike, which is to say with \nrespect. That attitude was contagious and even infected both Chambers \nof Congress. President Reagan once urged an audience of young people to \nlive lives ``that were a statement, not an apology.''\n  This week we remember a true American giant, whose life was a \nstatement, not an apology--a statement of America's values and its \ntranscendent spirit of our faith in God and our love of country, of our \nnational purpose, which is to uphold and extend the reality of freedom \nand opportunity in the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask the record to reflect my appreciation \nfor the courtesy of Senator Frist. He has a very busy schedule. He has \npeople waiting in his office and it would have been very easy for him \nto go out without giving Senator Lieberman the opportunity to speak. So \nwe appreciate very much his courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of my colleague.\n  Indeed, it has been a different week, a very solemn week, and a week \nthat has required all of us to work together from an organizational \nstandpoint and to pull together what has been almost a celebration of \nthis legacy of Ronald Reagan.\n  This evening members will gather in the Senate Chamber and right \naround that period of time a number of people will be proceeding to the \narrival ceremony. It will indeed be a historic moment for the Senate, \nfor this body, but indeed for the American people. Over 150,000 well-\nwishers are expected to line the streets as President Reagan's flag-\ndraped caisson is drawn up to this building, the Capitol, by a single \nriderless horse.\n  In the past 5 days, we have witnessed a remarkable unity in the \ncountry, a fraternity of spirit in many ways. Partisanship has fallen \naway, and old political foes have set aside disagreements. Americans \nhave come together to celebrate the remarkable achievements of a truly \nremarkable man. Lifeguard--the pictures are imprinted in everybody's \nmind--radio announcer, actor, Governor, father, husband, and finally \nPresident of the United States. Ronald Wilson Reagan achieved \nextraordinary heights.\n\n  But he would tell you, I suspect--and it was reflected in so many of \nthe comments among his friends and colleagues over the last several \ndays--that he was simply being an American, fulfilling the American \ndream. He described the American dream once as ``a song of hope that \nrings through the night air; vivid, tender music that warms our heart \nwhen the least among us aspires to the greatest things.''\n  Ronald Reagan brought that song back to our hearts. He believed we \ncould achieve great things, that America could achieve great things, \nand because of his unshakeable belief in freedom and liberty and \ndemocracy and his ironclad faith in progress, his love and respect for \nhis fellow citizen, we did. We triumphed over the Soviet empire. We \ncreated one of the longest economic expansions in American history. We \nregained our strength and our optimism. We remembered the special \nprivilege it is to be an American.\n  But we also remembered that freedom is not for us alone. It is the \nright of every man and woman across the globe, in every age, in every \ncivilization.\n  In 1964, two decades before he would be reelected in a landslide \nvictory carrying 49 of the 50 United States, Ronald Reagan told the \nNation:\n\n       You and I have the ability and the dignity and the right to \n     make our own decisions and determine our own destiny.\n\n  As we would learn later, it was our destiny to choose Ronald Reagan \nto be our leader, our standard bearer, and our hero. The history books \nwill record Ronald Reagan as one of our greatest Presidents. Of this I \nhave no doubt. And the American people will remember him with love and \nwith affection for generations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/09/senate-section/article/S6683-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6683-S6684]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR MONDAY, JUNE 14, 2004\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

On Monday, following morning business, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the Defense authorization bill. Chairman Warner \nand Senator Levin have been reviewing the submitted amendments and will \nbe here on Monday to resume work on that bill. I expect Members to come \nto the floor to offer amendments on Monday. We anticipate setting votes \non amendments for Monday afternoon.\n  On Monday, we will order any votes to begin at 5:30 on those \namendments to be disposed of. Again, I encourage Members to work with \nthe chairman and the ranking member to schedule consideration of their \namendments. There were a large number of amendments filed, and I hope \nthat most of those amendments will not be offered.\n  It will be a busy week next week as we return to regular business. We \nneed to proceed expeditiously toward completing our work on the Defense \nauthorization bill by the conclusion of next week.\n  With that said, I again thank all of my colleagues who have \nparticipated during these past several days in honoring our former \nPresident.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/09/senate-section/article/S6684-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6684]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, JUNE 14, 2004, AT 1 P.M.\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
