Mr. President, today the Senate will continue to work \nthrough the appropriations process by beginning consideration of H.R. \n2658, the Department of Defense appropriations bill. Last week the \nSenate was able to complete the military construction appropriations \nbill and the legislative branch appropriations bill. The hard work of \nChairman Stevens, Senator Campbell, Senator Hutchison, and the \nDemocratic leader enabled us to work swiftly on those measures.\n  We are expected to continue this work by completing action on several \nmore appropriations measures this week. Two additional bills are ready \nfor action. They are the Homeland Security bill and the Labor-HHS-\nEducation bill.\n  With respect to the Defense appropriations bill today, the two \nmanagers will be here throughout the afternoon and, therefore, Senators \nshould be prepared to come to the floor to offer their amendments. Any \nvotes ordered on those amendments will be stacked to begin at \napproximately 5:15 or 5:30. If an amendment is not available for a vote \nat that time, it would be my intent to have a vote on an executive \nnomination. Later this afternoon we will announce the precise time and \nsubject of today's vote. We will have busy sessions this week to \ncomplete the bills I have previously mentioned. Therefore, rollcall \nvotes can be expected each day.\n  I also want to take a moment this afternoon to thank Chairman Lugar \nfor his hard work and diligence throughout last week's consideration of \nthe State Department authorization. I had hoped that the bill could \nhave been completed last week. However, a number of extraneous issues \nnot related to the underlying subject slowed the bill's passage. It is \nimportant and it is appropriate for the Senate to pass a State \nDepartment authorization as well as foreign aid authorization. Every \nMember does have a right to amend, but I would encourage Members to \nshow restraint and allow the Senate to complete its work on this \nmeasure. There will be other opportunities for these nongermane \namendments, and I hope we will be able to resume the bill for \namendments that relate to the issues of the Department of State and \nforeign aid.\n  On Thursday of this week, Prime Minister Tony Blair will be \naddressing a joint meeting of Congress in the afternoon. We will have \nfurther information and announcements about that as the week goes \nforward. I look forward to a productive week, a very busy week, and do \nbelieve we will make tremendous progress in terms of advancing these \nappropriations bills.\n  Mr. REID. If the distinguished majority leader is finished, I would \nlike to ask a couple questions.\n  When we complete the work on the Defense bill, which hopefully will \nbe this week--I am sure the leader wants it earlier rather than later--\ndo you have an idea yet what bill we will go to after that?\n  Mr. FRIST. We intend to go to either Homeland Security or Labor-HHS. \nI will turn to the distinguished chairman either now or in a few \nminutes to comment on that as we go forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we are ready to go on either bill. We are \ntrying to assure the presence of the ranking members and chairmen of \nthose subcommittees. I prefer to give you that information later today \nif I may.\n\n  Mr. REID. The second question or statement is that Senator Byrd and \nothers have no problem going forward on this bill today. We would just \nask that there be no agreements on time until that is cleared with this \nside. Agreements on time and things of that nature, we would like to be \nadvised if there are time agreements that are needed. We would be happy \nto be cooperative, but we would at least like to know about that.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield to the chairman.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we know of only two amendments so far \nthat may come toward this bill. We would encourage Members to come \nforward and tell us if they are going to offer amendments. It would be \nour hope that we could proceed with this bill in a fashion that we \ncould come to a final\n\n[[Page S9312]]\n\nconclusion tomorrow afternoon and vote on this bill tomorrow afternoon \nand take up one of the other bills so we can move these bills along. \nThis bill came out of our committee unanimously. We have taken care of \nmost of the amendments in our committee. We will cooperate with you in \nevery way to give you advance notice on the votes. If we can find out \nthe number of amendments that are coming, we might even be able to make \narrangements that we would vote early tomorrow morning on the \namendments on this bill and just have one vote on the executive \ncalendar.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, through you to the distinguished chairman of \nthe committee, I have spoken to Senator Byrd today, and he may want to \ngive a statement today. But he has indicated he certainly does \ntomorrow. He and I have talked. There are a number of people who at \nthis stage have not indicated they want to offer amendments, but they \ndo wish to make statements on this very important bill. At this stage \nthere are four or five Senators wishing to do that. That will take a \nlittle bit of time in the morning but should not take a lot of time. I \nonly know of four or five. And as soon as I learn about amendments, I \nwill certainly let the distinguished ranking member know about those \namendments.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/14/senate-section/article/S9312-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9312]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 2658, which the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2658) making appropriations for the Department \n     of Defense for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2004, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Alaska is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it is my privilege and honor once again \nto present to the Senate the Defense appropriations bill for fiscal \nyear 2004. This bill reflects a bipartisan approach that Senator Inouye \nand I have tried to maintain during the time we have served together on \nthe Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. It is always a great pleasure \nfor me to work with him and with his staff member Charlie Houy. We \nbelieve we have a bill that will meet the approval of the Senate with \nvery few amendments.\n  This bill was reported out of the full Appropriations Committee on \nJuly 9 by a unanimous vote; 29 Senators voted in favor of it and no \nSenator objected to it. We have sought to recommend a balanced bill to \nthe Senate. We believe it addresses the key requirements for readiness, \nquality of life, and the reconstitution of our military force.\n  While we are debating this bill on the floor today, there are \nhundreds of thousands of men and women in uniform forward deployed and \nserving our country abroad. They are performing superbly and we are \nproud of what they are accomplishing.\n  The Department of Defense now faces three critical and often \ncompeting challenges:\n  First, conducting simultaneous combat and near-combat operations in \nnumerous theaters at the same time--Iraq, Afghanistan, Bosnia, and \nKosovo, to name a few. We have forces spread throughout the world, \ndeployed in more areas and in more strange circumstances than at any \ntime in the history of this country;\n  Secondly, keeping the readiness of this force at high levels, ready \nto respond when called upon to carry out the global war on terrorism, \nis another great challenge;\n  Lastly, transforming the Department to meet future challenges. We \nmust ensure that our military forces are ready to meet whatever lies \nahead as we move through the 21st century.\n  Transformation is necessary to ensure that U.S. forces continue to \noperate from a position of overwhelming military advantage.\n  Transformed forces are also essential for deterring conflict, \ndissuading adversaries, and assuring others of our commitment to a \npeaceful world.\n  This bill Senator Inouye and I present today reflects a prudent \nbalance among all three of these challenges. It recommends $368.6 \nbillion in discretionary budget authority programs for the Department \nof Defense. This is $3.2 billion below the President's request but \nwithin our 302(b) allocations for the Defense subcommittee.\n  As the Senate will recall, we completed action on a $62.6 billion \nIraq supplemental appropriations bill for the Department of Defense in \nmid-April. This bill rescinds $3.157 billion of those supplemental \nfunds that are not currently required by the Department.\n  This measure is fully consistent with both the objectives of the \nadministration and the Senate-passed 2004 National Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  It honors the commitments we have to our Armed Forces. It helps \nensure that they will continue to have good leadership, first-rate \ntraining, modernized equipment, and quality infrastructure. It also \nfully funds key readiness programs critical to the global war on \nterrorism.\n  These recommendations will make continued progress in supporting our \nmilitary personnel, their families, and modernizing the force. As \nalways, those are our first priorities.\n  In highlighting several of the key initiatives, I note the following:\n  This bill funds an average military pay raise of 4.15 percent and \nprovides $210 million to fund increases in family separation allowances \nand imminent danger pay.\n  It does not recommend consolidation of Guard and Reserve personnel \nappropriations with their respective active component appropriations.\n  For the Army, it is additional funding for their transformation \ninitiative--the Stryker brigade combat teams.\n  For the Navy, additional submarine refuelings, advance procurement of \nLPD-23, and fully funding the last increment of the LHD-8.\n  For the Air Force, it is fully funding the C-17 aircraft and funding \nacquisition of 22 F-22 Raptor aircraft.\n  In light of the contributions of the Guard and Reserve forces and \ndeployments to the Balkans, Afghanistan, and Iraq, this bill adds $700 \nmillion of nondesignated equipment funding--specifically for the \nReserve components.\n  The proposal before the Senate funds the President's request for \nmissile defense.\n  Finally, let me once again thank my cochairman, Senator Inouye, for \nhis support and friendship and invaluable counsel on this bill. I urge \nthe Chair to recognize him for any statement he wishes to make.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to express my very strong support \nfor this measure. The committee has produced a bipartisan bill which \nreflects well on the committee and on the Senate.\n  It has often been said that foreign policy debates should stop at the \nwater's edge. This bill holds true to that principle. This bill \nprovides for our Nation's defense without letting politics drive the \nrecommendations.\n  I commend our chairman, the Senator from Alaska, for the bill being \nbrought to the Senate this afternoon. This important measure provides \nthe spending necessary for the Defense Department for fiscal year 2004. \nThe total in the bill is about $369 billion, as noted by the chairman. \nIt is $3.2 billion below the amount requested by the President, but it \nis the same as the subcommittee's 302(b) allocation.\n  Mr. President, I don't intend to reiterate all of the details the \nchairman has outlined. Suffice it to say that the bill fully funds our \nmilitary personnel programs, including the authorized pay raise. It \nprovides sufficient funding to meet our readiness requirements for the \ncoming year, and it also increases funding for DOD's critical \ntransformation programs.\n  I wish to inform all of my colleagues that consistent with the \nadministration's request, no funds are included in this bill for the \nongoing operations in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  A portion of the fiscal year 2003 supplemental funds provided this \nyear will remain available in the coming year to help offset these \nneeds. But I believe it\n\n[[Page S9313]]\n\nshould be made clear that an additional supplemental funding will most \nlikely be required in the next fiscal year. Only a dramatic improvement \nin the situation in Iraq and in Afghanistan would obviate the need for \nadditional funding for these purposes.\n  I want to offer my personal thanks to the chairman for increasing \nfunding in support of the Army's Stryker brigades and the C-17. These \ntwo programs are critical to the military's transformation plans. The \nadded funding will greatly assist DOD in meeting its goals.\n  The Chairman has presented us with a very good bill, and I encourage \nall of you to support it wholeheartedly.\n  I wish to join my chairman and the Members of the Senate in extending \nour gratitude and admiration for the men and women who are serving us \nthis day. I hope this measure in some small way will indicate to them \nour gratitude and our great admiration.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the managers of this bill, of course, are \ntwo of the most talented and experienced men who serve in the Senate \nand who have ever served here, and their cooperation and partnership in \nmoving this bill through the Senate in years past has been legendary. I \nam sure this year will be no different.\n  The work that has been done in the Defense Subcommittee has created a \nlot of jobs. There is no question about that. It is one of the bright \nspots in the economic pattern of our country. As a result of what is \ngoing on in defense, jobs have been created. But it is not that way \nthroughout most of the economy. Most of the economy is in dire \njeopardy, suffering all kinds of problems. I know we all wish the news \nabout unemployment would get better, but it keeps getting worse. That \nis unfortunate.\n  Late last week, the Labor Department released some of the worst news \nwe have had in a long time as relates to the economy. The number of \nU.S. workers filing for unemployment benefits rose to a 20-year high, \n439,000. Since President George Bush took office, we have lost more \nthan 3.1 million jobs--it is quickly approaching 3.2 million jobs--in \nthe private sector.\n  Unemployment overall jumped last month to 6.4 percent. That does not \ninclude those who have given up hope and stopped looking for work and \nare not included in the 6.4 percent. If we counted all the people \nchronically unemployed, people who simply cannot find a full-time job, \nthe total unemployment rate would be almost 11 percent. Even worse, we \nfind that the unemployment rate for African Americans, Hispanics, and \nAsians is higher, and for teenagers who look for summer jobs to help \npay for expenses during the school year, the job is especially bleak.\n  In Nevada, we have just in the lower figure--that is the 6.4 percent; \nthat is those who are not chronically unemployed--some 55,000 people \nwho cannot find work. People want work. They know the American dream \nbegins with a good job. It begins with owning a home. It begins with \ngiving your children a good education and building a better community. \nBut all this starts with a good job.\n  I have on this chart what has happened since this President has taken \noffice. During the Clinton administration, some 23 million new jobs \nwere created. In this administration, we have a President, for the \nfirst time since we have been keeping numbers, who in multiyears has \nlost jobs. As I indicated, we are approaching 3.2 million.\n  On this chart, we can see that when he took office, there were 5.9 \nmillion unemployed Americans. Now there are 9.4 million. It is easy to \ntalk about numbers and percentages. Every one of these numbers is made \nup of people who are looking for work.\n  I was talking to the junior Senator from Washington. It is hard to \ncomprehend these numbers, but Boeing laid off 35,000 people at once. \nAll at once, 35,000 people got blue slips. We are laying off people all \nthe time.\n  As I have indicated, we have in Nevada tens of thousands of people \nwho cannot find work, and Nevada has a better unemployment record than \na lot of places.\n  Each person who makes up these numbers is someone who was working for \nBoeing, who was working someplace, and is willing to work anyplace, but \ncannot find a job.\n  You can look at a doctor's chart and find out what is wrong with a \npatient. I think we need to look at this chart and recognize that this \npatient, the American economy, is in deep trouble. We have people who \nsimply need a job.\n  The President has not prescribed anything I know of to increase \nemployment other than tax cuts. If tax cuts had been the answer to \nsolve the problems in the economy, the first go-round of tax cuts would \nhave been just the thing.\n  It did not work; so what does he do? He comes back and says: We are \ngoing to have this economy running well; we are going to cut taxes some \nmore. He cut taxes some more.\n\n  We had a surplus when this President took office when the \nunemployment numbers were below 6 percent. We had a situation where we \nhad a surplus over 10 years of more than $7 trillion. That surplus is \ngone. It is zero. This year, we will have the largest deficit in the \nhistory of the world. It will be around $600 billion. We see the \nprinted figures in newspapers and commentary on television. It is over \n$400 billion, approaching $500 billion. Of course, that does not take \ninto consideration the fact that the Social Security surpluses are \nplaced in there to mask the overall deficit.\n  The President said: Things were not so good when I got the economy. \nYou cannot pass the buck, as President Truman said.\n  The buck stops at his office. What we have found is massive \nunemployment. We have hemorrhaging of the economy. We find that some of \nthis is related to the war on terrorism--we realize that--about 20 to \n25 percent of it. The rest is just bad economic policy.\n  What the President inherited was an incredible record of job growth. \nI repeat what I said a moment ago, 23 million new jobs in 8 years. \nEvery one of those new jobs was another door of opportunity opening. \nEvery one of these job losses is a door of opportunity closing. Every \ntime a job has disappeared, the American dream has slipped from another \nfamily's grasp.\n  What should we do? I think it is clear what has been going on has not \nworked. We tried the tax cut route once, and it did not work. We tried \nit again, and it is still not working. We are all against taxes. It \nwould be great if no one had to pay taxes. In fact, people would rather \nhave a strong, vibrant economy than have these tax cuts, of course, \nthat go to those people who are better off in our economy, the so-\ncalled elite.\n  Let's do something different. I would expect if things are going so \nbad, maybe we should have another round of tax cuts. I am afraid that \nis what we are going to hear from this administration. Instead of more \ntax breaks for the elite, who have plenty, we need to do something to \ncreate jobs for those who cannot find work.\n  Prior to September 11, I had a program called the American Marshall \nPlan. It was a program where we would spend money in the public sector \ncreating jobs--water systems, sewer systems, bridges, roads, dams. \nEvery State of the Union has massive projects on the drawing board that \nwe cannot fund. The Energy and Water Development Subcommittee, of which \nI am ranking member and Senator Domenici is now the chairman--I was the \nchairman a short time ago--we have hundreds of water projects we have \nauthorized and for which we cannot pay. There are hundreds of them. \nShould we deauthorize them? These are not water projects just to make \npeople feel good. They are flood projects. They are massive projects.\n  I traveled to the State of Washington with Senator Cantwell to look \nat the Hanford Project. They call it the Hanford reservation where \nnuclear projects have taken place since World War II. They have some \ntremendous problems with nuclear waste. I traveled there. I traveled \nalso to Yakima, WA, and met with a group of people, Democrats and \nRepublicans, about a public works project they believe would be so \nimportant. It would help the Columbia River. It would help the Yakima \nRiver. It would help growth in that area in many different ways. We can \nauthorize another water project, one that is badly needed. We have to \nfigure a way to pay for these projects, expend money for these \nprojects.\n\n[[Page S9314]]\n\n  For every billion dollars we spend on a public works project, whether \nit is highways, putting in a sewer system in a State, city, or county, \nwe create 47,000 high-paying jobs, jobs where people will buy \nrefrigerators, furniture, cars, and homes. Those 47,000 jobs create \nmore jobs. It seems if we spend a few billions doing that rather than \njust tax cuts that have not created any jobs we would be so much better \noff.\n\n  The average school in America is approaching 50 years of age. Then \nthere are places such as Clark County, Nevada where we have to build as \nmany as 18 new schools a year just to keep up with the growth. We need \nhelp building these schools. We need help on roads, bridges.\n  There was an article last week in the newspapers about 40 percent of \nall bridges in the United States are in a state of disrepair. We have \nsome bridges we have had to stop people from traveling over. Some \nschoolbuses let the kids out and let the kids walk across the bridges, \nand they climb back on the bus when they get on the other side because \nthe bridges are in such a state of disrepair.\n  There are broken water pipes. I held a hearing prior to September 11. \nThere were mayors of the city of Atlanta, Las Vegas--I am trying to \nthink of the other cities around the country. Atlanta, I have that \nstuck in my mind because it was such a terrible situation. In fact, the \nmayor said, I am looking forward to my term ending because then I will \nnot have to wake up every morning wondering if the water system is \nbroken down. It is old, dilapidated, decayed. To do their water system \nis going to cost billions of dollars.\n  Some of the water pipes in existence in Washington, DC, are 150 years \nold. One wonders if there are leaks and problems. Of course there are.\n  I will not go through all the other mayors who appeared but there are \nsignificant problems. We need to help them. We can do that with public \nworks dollars. It has to be done some time anyway. Why not do it now to \nhelp stimulate this economy? We can create new jobs by promoting new \ntechnologies and producing energy from renewable nonpolluting sources. \nThose will not only create jobs, they will help us achieve energy \nindependence. We can save existing jobs by helping our financially \nburdened States so they do not have to raise taxes on working families \nor small businesses.\n  I think it speaks volumes if we look around the country. I spoke \ntoday to the Governor of the State of Pennsylvania. The legislature is \nhaving trouble determining how they are going to fund all the things \nthat are required to be done in the State of Pennsylvania. The Governor \nis waiting for the legislature to determine how they are going to do \nthat.\n  In the State of Nevada, the Governor of the State of Nevada had to \ncall three or four special sessions of the State legislature to try to \nfigure out a way to fund the budget they had passed. They could not do \nit. The Governor filed a lawsuit with the Nevada Supreme Court and the \ncourt ruled as to how the legislature is going to fund the money. What \na crazy way to do business.\n  The reason the States and local governments are having all of these \nproblems is the Federal Government has backed off on many commitments \nthat we have had. We have passed on burdens to the States, unfunded \nmandates, in education and in homeland security. The States are paying \nfor this, local governments are paying for this, and that is why we \nfind 47 of the 50 States in deep financial trouble.\n  The king of financial troubles, of course, is the State of \nCalifornia, with a deficit of some $35 billion. The tiny State of \nNevada had a deficit of a billion dollars. There is a constitutional \nrequirement in Nevada that they have to balance the budget. Therefore \nthe Supreme Court had to get into that.\n\n  We can reverse this awful trend. We can save the jobs we have and \nhelp create new ones but we have to be willing to do something \ndifferent than what is going on now.\n  I, again, applaud my two friends and mentors, role models, who are \nmanaging this bill. I am confident that if we have a bill that has \ntheir fingerprints on it, it is something that is good for the national \nsecurity of this country and I am sure in a reasonably short period of \ntime this bill will become law.\n  As I indicated in my conversations this morning with the majority \nleader and the chairman of the committee, I know several people who \nwant to speak on this issue. I do not see a lot of amendments but there \nwill be some amendments on this legislation in an attempt to make it \nbetter than what it is. I look forward to working with my two friends \nto move this legislation along as quickly as possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1217\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, there is a substitute amendment at the \ndesk and I ask for its consideration. For the information of all \nSenators, the amendment is the text of the Senate-reported bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1217.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text \nof Amendments.'')\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 15 minutes as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Alexander are found in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1382, the \nDepartment of Defense appropriations bill for fiscal year 2004, as \nreported by the Senate Committee on Appropriations.\n  I commend the distinguished chairman and the ranking member for \nbringing the Senate a carefully crafted spending bill within the \nSubcommittee's 302(b) allocation and consistent with the discretionary \nspending cap for 2004.\n  The pending bill provides $369.2 billion in budget authority and \n$389.9 billion in outlays in fiscal year 2004 for the Department of \nDefense. Of these totals, $528 million is for mandatory programs.\n  The bill provides $368.637 billion in discretionary budget authority, \n$25 billion less than the subcommittee's 302(b) allocation. The bill \nprovides $389.371 billion in discretionary outlays, $16 million below \nthe 302(b) allocation. Pursuant to an agreement with the \nadministration, the bill provides $3.062 billion less budget authority \nthan was in the President's Defense budget request. These funds were \nshifted to other nondefense spending bills.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nBudget Committee scoring of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                S. 1382, DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS, 2004, SPENDING COMPARISONS, SENATE-REPORTED BILL\n                                   [Fiscal Year 2004 (in millions of dollars)]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                      General\n                                                                      purpose        Mandatory         Total\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill:\n    Budget authority............................................        368.637              528        369,165\n    Outlays.....................................................        389,371              528        389,899\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n    Budget authority............................................        368,662              528        369,190\n    Outlays.....................................................        389,387              528        389,915\n\n[[Page S9315]]\n\n \n2003 level:\n    Budget authority............................................        426,621              393        427,014\n    Outlays.....................................................        393,835              393        394,228\nPresident's request:\n    Budget authority............................................        371,699              528        372,227\n    Outlays.....................................................        393,220              528        393,748\nHouse-passed bill:\n    Budget authority............................................        368,662              528        369,190\n    Outlays.....................................................        388,836              528        389,364\n \n                                        SENATE-REPORTED BILL COMPARED TO:\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n    Budget authority............................................

Mr. President, just before I left the floor, I asked \nthat the substitute amendment, which is the text of the Senate-reported \nbill, be reported. I now ask unanimous consent that the Senate adopt \nthis amendment, make it original text for the purpose of further \namendment, and the usual boilerplate language that goes along with \nthat. But I would like to proceed at that point, and I do have Senator \nByrd's concurrence on this at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1217) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I understand the Senator from New Mexico wishes some \ntime.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 20 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Bingaman are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have now served with 11 Directors of \nIntelligence during my tenure as a Senator. I think I have known each \nof them personally. In fact, my roots in connection with the \nintelligence process go back to World War II when I flew an OSS plane \ninto China frequently, and I have had a great deal of interest in the \nCIA and its operations.\n  I have learned in that timespan that intelligence--good \nintelligence--is essential to force projection and protection of our \nNation. Unfortunately, we cannot publish a list of the numerous \noccasions in which men and women in the intelligence community have \nliterally saved the lives of U.S. military and civilian personnel. \nSometimes I wish we could tell the whole story. It would put into \nbetter perspective the few mistakes the intelligence community \nsometimes makes.\n  However, mistakes in interpreting intelligence data can and will be \nmade. The CIA has not often admitted blame for serious mistakes. Taking \nresponsibility has not been their strong suit in the past, and I have \nnot always been happy with the information the CIA has produced.\n  In working with the intelligence chief, George Tenet, to fully \ndisclose information we have needed to determine proper funding levels \nin our Appropriations Committee for programs and projects he oversees, \nI can assure the Senate he has always been fair, just, and open with \nus.\n  Mr. Tenet is responsible for the accuracy of intelligence information \nhis agency provides to the President and the Congress, and he has now \nacknowledged the CIA's error in interpreting data relating to the \nPresident's State of the Union comment about Iraq.\n  For this I think he should be commended, and that is why I have come \nto the floor: to commend him for his action. Few in this town often \ntake the clear path to acknowledge error. The intelligence and defense \ncommittees are rightly investigating the events leading up to this \nmistake, but I am hopeful that as the Congress and the executive branch \nproceed to determine how this mistake occurred, all realize that those \nof us who work with him on a daily basis, including the President, \ntrust and rely on George Tenet and are ready to defend him as a good \nman and excellent DCI and a man of intelligence, honesty, and candor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have been conferring with our staff, \nwith Senator Inouye's staff, and with Senator Inouye. We request any \nMember who wants to present an amendment for inclusion in a managers' \npackage to disclose that amendment to us by 3 tomorrow afternoon. We \nmake that request because we do have the necessity of having full \ndisclosure of what is in that package. It is often easier to handle \nsome of these very small amendments that move money from one place to \nanother or have a particular interest for one post or one military \nestablishment or another, and we prefer to handle it in the way of \noffering those as one series of amendments in a managers' package if we \ncan.\n  We cannot do that unless people come forward and contact us. We have \nknowledge of several Members who have small amendments of that type, \nand we wish them to know at this time that in order to get this package \ncleared in advance with Senator McCain and others we want to have those \ndisclosed to us by 3 tomorrow or the Members will be compelled to offer \nthe amendments individually.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, a few minutes ago I misspoke in my \nreservation of objection. I indicated that it was the 137th judge we \nwould approve. It is 135. The first one would be 134. The second would \nbe 135. I exaggerated by two. I want that stricken from the record. I \ndidn't exaggerate. I simply made a calculation that was wrong.

Mr. President, I believe the Senate will be voting this \nafternoon on a judiciary nomination, but in the meantime, most of this \nafternoon, and I expect tomorrow and perhaps even the next day, we will \nbe on one of the most important appropriations bills we consider in the \nSenate, and that is the appropriation for the Department of Defense.\n  Most of us know that in recent years we have been faced with some \nvery unusual circumstances that deal with national security both at \nhome and around the world. National security is critically important to \nthis country, both protecting our homeland against acts of terrorism \nand also dealing with trouble spots around the world that threaten our \nnational interests.\n  So as we consider a bill providing the funds for our national defense \nthrough the Department of Defense, I wish to say a couple of things. \nFirst, I thank Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye. I happen to serve on \nthe subcommittee on which they are chairman and ranking member, and I \nthink they have\n\n[[Page S9317]]\n\ndone a remarkable job with this legislation. They should be commended \nby every Member of the Senate for the work they do on national defense. \nI think if all America could see them as they work through subcommittee \nand committee and work with the Department of Defense trying to \nunderstand and analyze all of the programs that are involved with \ndefense issues, they would understand how blessed this country is in \nhaving the leadership of the Senators from Alaska and Hawaii at this \npoint.\n  But, in this debate, I think we are missing a piece to the puzzle of \nnational defense. This bill is a very large bill, it is a very \ncomplicated bill, and in introducing the bill I believe my colleagues \nindicated that this legislation, while very large, does not have any \nfunding in it for the military operations in the country of Iraq.\n  Now, why is that an issue and why is it important? Because at this \npoint we are spending $3.9 billion, nearly $4 billion, a month in Iraq. \nThere was an aggressive war fought in Iraq with valiant and brave young \nmen and women who answered the call to duty, and now, following the \nmajor part of that war, hostilities continue in Iraq. It breaks the \nhearts of all of us to see the deaths and the continuing struggle many \nof our soldiers are going through in Iraq, but they will and we will \nprevail.\n  However, it is clear to everyone from the testimony last week of \nSecretary Rumsfeld and others that this will not be done quickly. This \ncountry is not going to pull out of Iraq in 1 month or 2 months or 4 \nmonths. We now have roughly 140,000 to 150,000 troops in Iraq, and this \nweekend Secretary Rumsfeld and others suggested that that we may have \nto be increase that number. If we are in fact spending nearly $4 \nbillion a month in Iraq, and there is a suggestion perhaps that we will \ndo that for a year, we are talking $48 billion to $50 billion a year in \nexpenditures.\n  We know that is happening. We know that at the start of the fiscal \nyear we will be spending money in Iraq. It is likely to me it will be \nat least at the level that exists this month, last month, or the month \nbefore. If that is the case, then the question is: Where is the money \ngoing to come from? As I understand it, there is not one penny in this \nDefense appropriations bill to fund those needs that exist to support \nthe troops in Iraq.\n  What would typically happen, I suppose, is the funding of $4 billion \na month would be taken out of other programs and shifted around to fund \nthe programs in Iraq and the soldiers who are in Iraq and all the \nequipment and the needs month after month. And then at some point the \nadministration would send a supplemental appropriations request saying, \nwe have an emergency request for Congress to appropriate $36 billion to \n$40 billion to fund those items that respond to the needs of the \nmilitary that is in Iraq.\n  It seems to me that, rather that the administration coming to us 6 \nmonths or 10 months from now, asking to come up with another $30, $40, \nor $50 billion on an emergency basis and adding it to the debt and not \npaying for it, a far better approach would be, since we know the \nexpenditure will exist, since we know this requirement exists, a better \napproach would be for the President to send us a budget amendment; a \nbudget amendment by which this President would say to the Congress, \nhere is the need and here is how we pay for it.\n  The administration should say this is what is happening today in the \ncountry of Iraq. We have American soldiers, men and women wearing \nAmerica's uniform, in substantial numbers, costing $3.9 billion a \nmonth, according to the Secretary of Defense. We know that exists now. \nWe also know that this country is not going to withdraw from Iraq any \ntime soon.\n  So we know on October 1, when the next fiscal year begins, this \nrequirement exists. Therefore, we request the Congress to appropriate X \nbillions of dollars to meet that requirement.\n  That is a straightforward way for this administration to say: Here is \nwhat it is costing us and here is how we think we ought to pay for it. \nWe should not be in a situation in this country where we say to \nAmerica's sons and daughters: You go to war; and by the way, when you \ncome back we will have you pay the bill. If they are risking their \nlives and answering the call to duty for this country, the very least \nwe ought to do is to decide how much this is going to cost and how we \nwill pay for it.\n  There will be, I am sure, many voices of criticism of many items in \nall of these issues dealing with national security and the war in Iraq, \nintelligence, the state of the intelligence information, the quality of \nthe information, who knew what when. All of those are important issues \nfor our country. My point is not to be critical of any operation or \nanyone. My point is to say this Congress knows when we pass this \nappropriations bill that we have a responsibility to fund the \noperations in Iraq. Those operations now cost somewhere between $45 and \n$50 billion a year at an annual rate. Yet there is not a penny in this \nDefense appropriations bill for those purposes.\n  Why? Because the administration has not asked for it. They might say, \nbut we have not done that in the past, not only this administration but \nother administrations. That is true. In the past, other operations have \nbeen funded later by emergency requests. This operation, however, is \nmuch larger, is much more certain to go on for a lengthier period of \ntime, and this operation in Iraq requires the President to send an \namended budget request of some type, saying here is what we expect the \nestimate to be for the next fiscal year, and here is the funding we \nwould like. Then this Congress has a responsibility to respond to the \nPresident in an appropriate way.\n  It is Byzantine to be passing a Defense appropriations bill \npretending that the $4 billion a month we are spending on the military \noperations in Iraq does not exist. We know it exists. We have a \nresponsibility to provide the funding for it, not 10 months from now \nbut now.\n  Let me make one additional point. I mentioned the men and women who \nhave answered the call to duty. Many of them are National Guard men and \nwomen, reservists. They are the citizen soldiers of this country. They \nhave regular jobs, they live in regular homes, have regular families, \nand they lead a normal life. But they are citizen soldiers. They drill \non weekends. They go to a summer camp for the National Guard and \nReserve and from time to time during emergencies they are deployed. \nThey are called up to active duty.\n\n  In the last 4, 5, or 6 years, the National Guard has been used in a \nmuch different way than ever before. Especially now with Afghanistan \nand Iraq, we routinely see substantial numbers of National Guard forces \ncalled up and deployed.\n  Nearly one-third of those who are engaged in the National Guard and \nReserve in my State of North Dakota have been deployed on active duty. \nMany of them were deployed in Bosnia, Kosovo, and now the same ones are \nsent to Iraq or Afghanistan. There will come a time to rethink what we \nare doing with our National Guard and Reserves. I fear that many of our \ncitizen soldiers--probably at the urging of their families--will not be \nreenlisting if we continue to use the National Guard and Reserve the \nway they have been used the last several years. To ask them to go and \nbe deployed for 6 months, 9 months, a year, with no notion of when that \ndeployment ends is a very troublesome circumstance for the Guard and \nReserve.\n  They are proud to serve. They have done a magnificent job. I think \nall of America is proud of the National Guard and Reserve. But at this \npoint the Secretary of Defense needs to think through how we develop a \nrotation plan in order to be able to tell them and their families when \nthey might be rotated back to this country, when they might rejoin \ntheir families, and when they might be reporting back to their jobs.\n  It is a very difficult circumstance for everyone who serves in these \ntheaters, but it is especially difficult for those who have been \nmobilized and deployed as a part of Guard and Reserves. They do not \ncomplain about it. They are wonderful, brave young men and women, as \nare all of those who wear America's uniform, but the Secretary needs to \nthink through how we begin rotation plans to let them and their \nfamilies understand how long these rotations will last.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/14/senate-section/article/S9318-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9318-S9319]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S9318]]\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF SAMUEL DER-YEGHIAYAN, OF ILLINOIS, TO BE A U.S. DISTRICT \n              JUDGE FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will go \ninto executive session.\n  The clerk will report the nomination.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Samuel Der-Yeghiayan, of \nIllinois, to be U.S. District Judge for the Northern District of \nIllinois.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, at 5:30 we are going to be voting on a \nnomination to the Federal bench for the northern district of Illinois. \nThe nominee is Samuel Der-Yeghiayan from Vernon Hills, IL. Senator \nDurbin and I have recommended Samuel Der-Yeghiayan to President Bush, \nwho has appointed Sam, and he has been confirmed out of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. I will say a couple of words in support of his \nnomination.\n  Since 1978, Mr. Der-Yeghiayan has worked in the United States \nDepartment of Justice Immigration and Naturalization Service first as a \ntrial attorney in Chicago, later as acting district director, acting \ntrial appellate attorney, and for about 18 years the chief district \ncounsel for the INS in Chicago. He has a very good reputation.\n  Everyone, whether Republican or Democrat, from the many different \ncommunities in Chicago speaks very highly of Samuel Der-Yeghiayan. He \nhas a very good reputation in legal circles in Illinois.\n  Since the year 2000 he has been acting as an immigration review judge \nin the United States Department of Justice Executive Office for \nImmigration Review. Sam Der-Yeghiayan has his JD degree from Franklin \nPierce Law Center in New Hampshire. He was on the Law Review at \nFranklin Pierce.\n  There is an interesting aspect to Mr. Der-Yeghiayan's background that \nI think makes him somewhat unique. I am advised that he would be the \nfirst immigrant of Armenian descent ever to be named to the Federal \nbench. Mr. Der-Yeghiayan is himself an immigrant, having come to this \ncountry at an early age, and has done very well.\n  I am very proud of his nomination. I believe he is a very fine man, \nhas a wonderful family, and he will be a great asset to our Federal \njudiciary.\n  I thank my colleagues and I thank Senator Durbin for his support for \nthe nominee.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the nomination \nof Samuel Der-Yeghiayan to be United States District Judge for the \nNorthern District of Illinois.\n  Judge Der-Yeghiayan has contributed much to the legal community over \nhis 25 year career, particularly in the area of immigration law. Upon \ngraduation from Franklin Pierce Law Center, Judge Der-Yeghiayan joined \nthe U.S. Department of Justice as a trial attorney with the Immigration \nand Naturalization Service. After spending several years as a trial \nattorney, he was appointed District Counsel for the INS in Chicago, IL. \nIn 2000, he became an immigration judge with the Department of \nJustice's Executive Office for Immigration Review, the position in \nwhich he currently serves.\n  Over the course of his career, Judge Der-Yeghiayan has represented \nthe Government in deportation, exclusion, and other immigration-related \nhearings. He has handled issues relating to constitutional, labor, \ncriminal, and administrative law arising from the enforcement of \nimmigration laws. As a judge, he has presided over court proceedings \nand trials related to removal, deportation, exclusion, and asylum \ncases. He has also done a substantial amount of pro bono work educating \ncongressional staff, State attorneys, bar associations, and law \nenforcement agents on immigration issues. In addition, as a judge, he \nprovides training to pro bono immigration attorneys.\n  I have every confidence that he will make an excellent Federal judge. \nI commend President Bush for nominating him, and I urge my colleagues \nto join me in supporting his nomination.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announced that the Senator from Utah (Mr. Bennett), \nthe Senator from Alabama (Mr. Sessions), the Senator from Oregon (Mr. \nSmith), and the Senator from New Hampshire (Mr. Sununu) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nEdwards), the Senator from Florida (Mr. Graham), the Senator from Iowa \n(Mr. Harkin), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry), the Senator \nfrom Connecticut (Mr. Lieberman), the Senator from Maryland (Ms. \nMikulski), and the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Miller) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from Iowa \n(Mr. Harkin) and the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would each \nvote ``yea''.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

BRACK TO BE U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE \n                         DISTRICT OF NEW MEXICO\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in \norder that I speak for 1 minute with reference to the nomination of \nRobert C. Brack, which is currently going to be accepted by the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, and I shall not, as the \nmanager of the legislation on the floor, I wonder if the Senator would \nmind, then, even though the normal order would be for the managers to \ngo first--I have no objection to my more senior colleague going first--\nthat I be recognized immediately after the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I didn't know you wanted to speak. I saw the calendar \nsaid that he was going to be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, in a couple moments the Senate will \napprove Robert C. Brack for district court judge of New Mexico. It is \nnot always easy to find somebody, when you recommend them and they have \nfinished this process and received, as in this case, full approval of \nthe Democratic Senator--the committee approved them rather quickly--it \nis not always easy to find that kind of person. And then secondly, it \nis not always easy to know that you have really got the right \nindividual, that they are going to do justice to that terrific \nresponsibility which is theirs for such a long period of time under our \nConstitution. But in this man's case, I am certain of both. I am \ncertain he is as good as there is. Far be it for me to say he\n\n[[Page S9319]]\n\nis the very best in New Mexico. Who knows that? But he is very good at \nthe law.\n  Secondly, after being good at law, he had a shot at being a judge, \nand he was a very good judge at the district court level where you have \ngeneral jurisdiction. When you add all that together, you just feel \ngood about it. And you can end up telling the Senate, thank you this \nevening in advance and the President, thank you for sending this man to \nNew Mexico to become a district judge in our State.\n  I yield the floor. If I offended or sought precedence over the \ndistinguished Senator, I did not intend to. I apologize.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, there is no offense. I know no offense was \nmeant and none was taken.\n  As the distinguished senior Senator from New Mexico knows, he and I \nconsulted at some length on this nomination, and I was happy to move \nforward. In fact, while the Senator is still on the floor, why don't we \ngo ahead and pass the nomination. Then I will address the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, Executive Calendar No. 292 \nis approved.\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, with that confirmation of the New Mexican \njudge, the Senate will now have confirmed 135 judicial nominees of \nPresident Bush. These include 35 confirmed so far this year. I mention \nthat number of 35 because I looked back to the third year of the last \nPresidential term--President Clinton's--when the Republicans controlled \nthe Senate. They only allowed 34 judges to be confirmed in all of 1999. \nIn fact, we have now confirmed more than twice the total number of \njudges confirmed in the 1996 session, when a Republican Senate majority \nrefused to consider any circuit court nominees and confirmed only 17 \ndistrict court judges in that entire session.\n  I mention that, Mr. President, because some believe this has become \npoliticized. Well, maybe it was for 6 years, but it is not politicized \nnow. We have actually reduced judicial vacancies to the lowest number \nin 13 years. Currently, there are more Federal judges on the bench than \nat any time in our history. We have confirmed 35 this year, and in the \n1996 session with President Clinton, the Republican Senate majority \nrefused to consider any circuit court nominees and only confirmed 17 \ndistrict court judges during the whole session--half of what we have \nconfirmed already.\n  At a similar time in President Clinton's term--the third year of the \nterm--they allowed 34 judges to be confirmed the whole year. We have \ndone 35 so far. By every single standard, during the time when the \nDemocrats were in the majority and now, we have confirmed far more \njudges at a far faster rate for President Bush than the Republican \nmajority allowed during the time of President Clinton.\n  I note that in the cases of both of today's nominees, the home State \nSenators include both a Republican and a Democrat Senator who supported \nthe nomination; both worked for the nomination. Working with these home \nState Senators makes it far easier and makes the confirmation process \nproceed more smoothly.\n  I congratulate the nominees confirmed today and the four Senators who \ncame together in a bipartisan effort to get them through.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the motion to reconsider is \nlaid upon the table and the President will be notified of the Senate's \naction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/14/senate-section/article/S9319-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9319]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, earlier today, Senator Lamar Alexander \nannounced his decision on this Senate floor to join Senators Gregg, \nChafee, and me in cosponsoring the Clean Air Planning Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Alexander be added as a \ncosponsor of S. 843.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, we are delighted at this decision. We \nwelcome him as a cosponsor. The Clean Air Planning Act is a sensible \nsolution to a vexing and challenging problem. We welcome the support of \nSenator Alexander on this bill and the opportunity to work with him and \nother colleagues in this body to pass a strong bipartisan piece of \nclean air legislation later this year. Together, we can pass \nlegislation that will control harmful emissions, provide cleaner air, \nand let more people live longer and healthier lives. We can do so in a \nway that does not impose hardship on those who produce electricity or \non the consumers or an industry that relies on affordable electricity.\n  There are several advantages for the Nation that the Clean Air \nPlanning Act will provide, and I want to mention several of those at \nthis time.\n  First of all, let me begin with public health and environmental \nbenefits. The Clean Air Planning Act will achieve substantially greater \nemissions reductions than the administration's Clear Skies Act. The \nClean Air Planning Act will generate an additional 23 million tons of \nSO2 reductions, 3 million tons of nitrogen oxide reductions, \n240,000 pounds of mercury reductions, and 764 million tons of carbon \ndioxide reductions relative to the Clear Skies Act in the first 20 \nyears of the program.\n  As a result, the human health benefits are likely to be substantially \ngreater under the Clean Air Planning Act than the Clear Skies \nlegislation. An EPA analysis has concluded that in 2020, the Clean Air \nPlanning Act would avoid almost 6,000 premature deaths from fine \nparticulate matter when compared with Clear Skies on an annual basis--\nnot a cumulative basis.\n  Let me return to CO2 and business certainty. From the \nperspective of the electric generating sector, business certainty is a \nmajor driver for the enactment of multipollutant legislation. Without \nCO2 included, electric-generating companies will continue to \nmake their investment decisions in the face of major business \nuncertainty. This raises the specter of stranded investments.\n  By lifting the uncertainty surrounding future action on \nCO2, the Clean Air Planning Act creates a more favorable \nclimate for the expansion of U.S. coal markets and stimulates the \ndevelopment of clean coal technologies.\n  Let me talk for a moment about diverse generation mix. The Clean Air \nPlanning Act and Clear Skies will both preserve a diverse fuel mix. \nBoth bills are projected to have minimal impact on coal use. In 2010, \ncoal use is expected to be about 2 percent lower under the Clean Air \nPlanning Act than under Clear Skies--50 percent versus 48 percent. Coal \nis projected to constitute 45 percent of the electric generating mix in \n2020 under either bill, Clear Skies or the Clean Air Planning Act.\n\n  An important question is, What will it cost to buy the relative \nadvantages of the Clean Air Planning Act?\n  In both 2010 and 2020, total annual electric system costs under the \nClean Air Planning Act are projected to be only 2.5 percent higher than \nunder Clear Skies. This includes the cost of regulating CO2 \nunder the Clean Air Planning Act. On a net present value basis, the \ntotal cost differences between Clear Skies and the Clean Air Planning \nAct over a 20-year period, from 2005 to 2025, is in the range of 2 to 3 \npercent.\n  The EPA itself has conceded that retail electricity prices would \nincrease by only two-tenths of a cent per kilowatt hour more under the \nClean Air Planning Act than under Clear Skies, which amounts to about \n$1.20 per month for the average residence.\n  According to the EPA, the CO2 reduction plan could be \ncarried out at ``negligible'' cost--that is their word--to the \nindustry. Specifically, we can achieve the CO2 goal in our \nbill--returning electricity industry emissions to 2001 levels by 2013--\nfor approximately $300 million in additional costs on top of the $103 \nbillion the industry will already be spending to produce electricity. \nThat is just 0.3 percent--not 3 percent, not 30 percent, but 0.3 \npercent.\n  Let me conclude. Once again, I thank Senator Alexander for having the \ncourage to join us in this effort. I know it is not a decision that he \nmade lightly. As a former Governor, he shares my commitment to getting \nthings done in the Senate and in our Nation's Capital, with a \ncommitment to focusing on policies that are the right thing for this \nNation to do. Speaking for Senators Gregg, Chafee, and myself, we \nwelcome the support of the junior Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S9320]]\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I want my Senate colleagues to know I \nhave decided to join Senators Carper, Chafee, and Gregg as cosponsors \nof the Clean Air Planning Act. I have studied major clean air proposals \nbefore the Senate and have concluded that this legislation is the best \nbalanced proposal because it would reduce pollution emitted by \npowerplants while permitting the maximum possible economic growth and \nenergy efficiency. I hope other colleagues will come to the same \nconclusion as the debate about how to clean America's air becomes front \nand center.\n  Cleaner air should be the urgent business before the Senate. The \ncondition of the air in my State of Tennessee is completely \nunacceptable to me and ought to be completely unacceptable to every \nTennessee citizen.\n  My home is 2 miles from the boundary of the Great Smokey Mountains \nNational Park, which has also become the Nation's most polluted \nnational park. Only Los Angeles and Houston have higher ozone levels \nthan the Great Smokies. Only a few miles away from the Great Smokies is \nKnoxville, which is on the American Lung Association's list of top 10 \ncities with the dirtiest air. Memphis and Nashville--our two largest \ncities--are on the top 20 list. Chattanooga barely escapes the top 25 \nlist.\n  This polluted air is damaging to health, especially that of the \nelderly, small children, and the disabled. It ruins the scenic beauty \nof our State, which is what most of us who grew up in Tennessee are \nproudest of. And it is damaging to our economic growth.\n  Clean air is the No. 1 priority of the Pigeon Forge Chamber of \nCommerce. Business leaders there at the foot of the Smokies know that \nvisitors are not going to drive 300 miles and spend their tourism \ndollars to see smoggy mountains.\n  The mayors of our major cities in Tennessee also understand that \ncleaner air means better jobs. They know that if our metropolitan areas \nare not able to meet Federal standards for clean air, new restrictions \nwill make it harder for auto parts suppliers and other industries to \nexpand and bring good new jobs into our State. The mayors also know our \ncities cannot comply with the Federal standards without some help. \nTennessee's clean air problem requires a national solution.\n  Much of our air pollution is our State's own doing--specifically, \nthat which comes from emissions from cars and trucks and from the coal \npowerplants of the Tennessee Valley Authority. But as much as a third \nof our air pollution comes from outside Tennessee. Winds blow pollution \nsouth from the industrial Midwest and north from the South toward the \nhighest mountain range in the eastern United States, the Great Smokies. \nAnd when the wind gets to the mountains, the pollution just hangs \nthere, which is an additional reason the Great Smokies and the \nKnoxville metropolitan area have such a problem.\n  There are three major clean air proposals before the Senate. I have \nstudied each to determine which would be the best for Tennessee and for \nour Nation.\n  The most important of these is President Bush's Clear Skies \nlegislation. The President deserves great credit for putting clean air \nat the top of the agenda, as only a President can do, because his \nproposal relies upon market forces instead of excessive regulation. It \nlimits costly litigation and creates certainty.\n  In addition, the President's proposal would take significant steps \nforward in reducing sulfur, nitrogen, and mercury pollutants.\n  Last year, during my campaign for the Senate, I made clean air a \npriority and often said the President's proposal is an excellent \nframework upon which to build meaningful clean air legislation but that \nit does not go far enough, fast enough to solve Tennessee's problems. \nThe Clear Skies legislation is a good start, but it does not go far \nenough, fast enough in my back yard.\n  I believe the Clean Air Planning Act, which I am cosponsoring, is the \nbest proposal for Tennessee and for our Nation. Here are the reasons:\n  First, the Clean Air Planning Act adopts the market-based framework \nof the President's proposal so that it also reduces regulation, \nlitigation, and creates certainty.\n  Second, it would take our country farther faster in reducing three \nmajor pollutants: sulfur, nitrogen, and mercury.\n  Third, it extends its market-based framework of regulation to carbon \ndioxide with a modest requirement that by 2013 the carbon emitted by \npowerplants would be at 2001 levels, causing a 3- to 5-percent \nreduction in the overall United States projected level in 2013.\n  Fourth, the Clean Air Planning Act, of which I am a cosponsor, does \nnot weaken existing laws in important ways that the Clear Skies \nproposal would. Here are the two ways the Clear Skies proposal does \nthat:\n  First, Clear Skies would prevent Tennessee, for 10 years, from going \nin to court to force another State to meet the Federal clean air \nstandards. Since pollutants blowing in from other States is one of our \ngreatest problems, this is a legal right we do not want to give up.\n  Second, the Clear Skies proposals would remove the right of the \nNational Park Service to comment on the effect of powerplant emissions \nmore than 30 miles away from a national park. Again, since much of the \npollution in the Smokies is blown in from more than 30 miles away, this \nis a review that ought to be considered.\n  While the President's proposal, in my judgment, does not go far \nenough, the other major proposal before this Senate goes too far too \nfast. It is a proposal by Senator Jeffords, the Clean Power Act, which \nrequires carbon emissions of the utilities sector to be at 1990 levels \nby the time we reach the year 2009.\n  I believe this proposal would cost so much to implement that it would \ndrive up the cost of electricity and drive offshore thousands of good \njobs. It would significantly damage our economy and our future.\n  There is also the Climate Stewardship Act sponsored by Senators \nMcCain and Lieberman which would regulate carbon emissions produced by \nthe entire economy and does so on a very rapid timetable.\n\n  I would not support these two proposals because I am not convinced \nthey are based upon good science. It would be foolish to take huge, \nexpensive steps to solve problems which we do not know exist. But it is \nalso unwise to completely ignore what we do know.\n  My reading of the Report of the National Academy of Sciences on \nGlobal Warming and my discussion with scientists, especially those at \nOak Ridge National Laboratory, have persuaded me that some additional \nsteps must be taken to limit carbon dioxide emissions.\n  The Senate is working on clean air legislation that will likely \ngovern our production of energy and the accompanying pollution for the \nnext 10 to 15 years. It would be unwise to do nothing, just as it would \nbe unwise to do too much.\n  The President himself has recognized the seriousness of problems with \ncarbon emissions and has initiated a voluntary program of emission \nreduction which is having some success. But for the next 10 to 15 \nyears, I believe we should take the next step and institute modest, \nmarket-based caps.\n  It is important to recognize that our Clean Air Planning Act applies \nonly to carbon produced by powerplants, not that produced by the entire \neconomy. In fact, it would permit powerplants to purchase credits from \nother sectors of the economy which can prove to be a substantial \nbenefit and income for agriculture.\n  There is still much to learn about the effect of human activity on \nglobal warming, specifically that caused by the production of carbon \ndioxide. I will continue to monitor the science as it is presented and \nmake my judgment at the time based upon what I believe to be good \nscience.\n\n[[Page S9321]]\n\n  Senator Carper has asked the Environmental Protection Agency to \nreview our proposed legislation to determine its effect on the health \nof Americans, and its cost. According to the EPA analysis prepared in \nNovember of 2002--last year--the Clear Skies Act would prevent 11,900 \npremature deaths, 7,400 chronic bronchitis cases, and 10,400 hospital \nvisits. Our Clean Air Planning Act would prevent 17,800 premature \ndeaths from air pollution, 5,900 more people annually than under Clear \nSkies, and save $140 billion in health care costs, $50 billion more \nthan Clear Skies.\n  The EPA internal analysis from November of 2002 also estimates that \nClear Skies would cost electric utilities $84.1 billion in the year \n2010, while our legislation would cost $86.2 billion in the year 2010. \nIn 2020, Clear Skies would cost $100.9 billion. Our legislation would \ncost $103.4 billion. In short, according to that EPA internal analysis, \nour legislation does a better job of improving health and reducing \nhealth care costs and would cost only slightly more.\n  Last week, before the Senate Energy Committee, we discussed again the \nemergency that is being caused by a shortage of natural gas and the \nconsequence of higher prices. Chemical companies in America are \nreducing salaries and pushing jobs overseas. Americans living in homes \nheated by natural gas should expect a 30-percent increase in their \nbills this winter in our State.\n  During the last week in July, the Senate will have the opportunity to \nconsider both the natural gas crisis and the urgent need for cleaner \nair. We will be debating the Energy bill which has been reported by our \ncommittee. The bill's purpose is to encourage a diversity of cleaner, \nnewer technologies for producing energy so that we may have a steady \nsupply of low-cost energy and, at the same time, a cleaner environment.\n  Mr. President, as I said, during the last week in July the Senate \nwill have an opportunity to consider both the natural gas crisis and \nthe need for cleaner air. We will be debating the Energy bill which has \nbeen reported by our committee. We have worked hard on that bill, both \nparties. We believe we have a good bill.\n  The bill's purpose is to encourage a diversity of cleaner, newer \ntechnologies for producing energy so that we may have a steady supply \nof low cost energy and at the same time a cleaner environment. But for \nus to avoid facing repeated winters with higher gas prices, to avoid \nkeeping jobs from moving overseas, and to keep our air clean and \nhealthy, we are going to have to face some tough decisions and make \ndifferent choices than we have so far been willing to make.\n  We need to explore for natural gas in Alaska and other offshore areas \nin the United States and build a new pipeline to bring it south. We \nneed to shed our reluctance to use nuclear powerplants that we invented \nand join France and Japan and the rest of the world in expanding our \nuse of this clean form of energy.\n  We need to advance our understanding and use of clean coal \ntechnologies, especially coal gasification. Coal produces one-half of \nour electricity and will continue to produce much of it for the \nforeseeable future.\n  We should increase the use of other renewable forms of energy, \nincluding solar, ethanol, and wind power. We need to get serious about \nsensible conservation practices, such as using alternatives to idling \ntruck engines when truckers are stopped for a break.\n  I am proud to be the principal sponsor of President Bush's hydrogen \ncar proposal which offers great promise in the long term to reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil and to clean our air because its fuel uses no \noil or gasoline and its only emission is water.\n  In summary, President Bush has made a good beginning by placing clean \nair on the agenda as only a President can and by offering a framework \nto build a strong proposal. But with respect, he hasn't gone far \nenough, fast enough. On the other hand, my colleagues, Senators McCain, \nLieberman, and Jeffords, go too far, too fast, relying on unsettled \nscience to put controls on our economy that are unjustified and that \nwould cost so much that thousands of jobs would go overseas.\n  The Clean Air Planning Act, which I cosponsor, is, in my judgment, \nthe best balanced solution. It has the advantages of the market-based \napproach suggested by the President. It goes further faster than the \nPresident's proposal in reducing pollutants from sulfur, from nitrogen, \nand from mercury. It places modest controls on carbon, and it does not \nweaken the existing clean air law.\n  Devising a plan for maintaining the proper balance of clean air, \nefficient energy, and good jobs for the next 10 to 15 years deserves \nthe urgent attention of the Senate. I look forward to being an active \nparticipant in the debate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/14/senate-section/article/S9321-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9321-S9323]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           ADMINISTRATIVE DETENTIONS AND RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, we in America firmly believe that what \ndistinguishes our country in the history of the world is our commitment \nto individual liberty and freedom. At the bedrock of a free society is \nthe obligation that the Government takes on to afford individuals \ncertain legal protections, the most basic of which is the freedom from \nincarceration unless the Government can prove that you have committed a \ncrime.\n  Today we are witnessing the abandonment by this current \nadministration of our historic commitment to this most basic legal \nprotection. The core element of due process law is the requirement that \nif individuals are taken into custody by the Government, then within \nsome reasonable time, they will be advised of the crimes of which they \nare accused. They will be charged with those crimes and they will be \nprosecuted.\n  This administration, working through the Justice Department, headed \nby Attorney General Ashcroft, and the Pentagon, headed by Secretary of \nDefense Rumsfeld, has taken the position that as to many individuals it \nnow has in custody, no such legal requirements attach.\n  It is my view that regardless of whether the person in custody is an \nAmerican citizen or a foreigner, regardless of where he or she is \napprehended, and regardless of the Government's preconceptions about \nhis or her guilt, that person should be entitled to some reasonable \nstandard of due process. Secrecy and disregard for the rule of law are \nnot the ideals upon which a free and open society are based.\n  To demonstrate the basis for my concern, I would like to describe to \nthe Senate some of the actions that have been taken in recent months by \nthe administration. These actions fall into three different categories. \nThere are those that affect immigrants. There are those that affect so-\ncalled material witnesses. There are those that affect so-called enemy \ncombatants.\n  Let me start first with immigrants. In the case of immigrants, the \ninspector general in the Department of Justice has recently documented \nthe abusive treatment of many immigrants by the FBI and the Justice \nDepartment in the period since 9/11. According to the IG's recent \nreport, many immigrants were detained following 9/11 even though the \nFBI had no evidence that they were connected to terrorism. The report \nstates that some detainees did not receive their so-called charging \ndocuments for more than 9 months after they were arrested. Even after \nthey were charged, many detainees were held in ``extremely restrictive \nconditions of confinement'' for ``weeks and months with no clearance \ninvestigation being conducted.''\n  The Attorney General would have us accept with no dissent that \nextraordinary times require extraordinary measures, even if it is at \nthe expense of individual civil liberties. In my view, the fact that \nthese immigrants were detained on alleged immigration violations does \nnot permit the Government to totally disregard their rights. While the \n9/11 detainees were entitled to be represented by an attorney at their \nown expense, the inspector general found in many cases that the \nGovernment made it very difficult for detainees to obtain an attorney \nor to speak with that attorney on a regular basis.\n  I hope the newly established Department of Homeland Security, which \nnow has jurisdiction over immigration violators, will follow the \ninspector general's recommendation that it ensure that ``detainees have \nreasonable access to counsel, legal telephone calls, and visitation \nprivileges consistent with their classification.''\n\n[[Page S9322]]\n\n  I am also troubled by the veil of secrecy which the administration \nhas drawn around these detainees. The public and the Congress have a \nright to know the names of individuals detained in connection with the \nSeptember 11 investigation. If we had had timely knowledge of the names \nof people discussed in the inspector general's report, we might have \nbeen able to shine some light on the process to ensure those \nindividuals' rights were not violated.\n  Unfortunately, a recent circuit court of appeals decision allows the \nDepartment of Justice to continue circumventing the Freedom of \nInformation Act. The decision is likely to be appealed, and I hope that \nthe earlier court decision ordering the release of the names will be \nupheld. In the meantime, however, I hope the Attorney General will do \nthe right thing and voluntarily release the names of the September 11 \ndetainees. I was pleased to join Senators Feingold, Kennedy, Durbin, \nand Corzine last week in formally making that request. I hope the \nAttorney General will agree.\n  Now let me speak about material witnesses.\n  The second way in which the administration has been detaining people \nis under the authority of the material witness statute. This little-\nknown statute permits the Government to arrest and detain a potential \nwitness whose testimony is material in a criminal proceeding and who is \nlikely to flee. The statute says:\n\n       Release of a material witness may be delayed for a \n     reasonable period of time until the deposition of the witness \n     can be taken pursuant to the Federal Rules of Criminal \n     Procedure.\n\n  The issue here is the manner in which the statute has been applied \nand, in addition, the unreasonable length of time the administration \nhas detained some individuals under this statute.\n  On the first point, the administration appears to be using the \nmaterial witness statute to detain some individuals without any \nintention of ever calling them to testify before a grand jury. In fact, \na Washington Post article published last November reviewed 44 material \nwitness cases. In 20 of the 44, the material witnesses were never \ncalled to testify.\n  I share the concern of those who believe the administration is \nmisapplying the statute in order to hold individuals without due \nprocess while those individuals themselves are being investigated. I \nwould like to give the administration the benefit of the doubt, but \ntheir answers to a recent House Judiciary Committee inquiry shed little \nlight on their intentions. In those answers, they stated:\n\n       We can only provide information about those material \n     witnesses whose status has been made public in court \n     proceedings.\n\n  The administration also refuses to provide the public with the \nspecific number of people who have been detained, saying only that:\n\n       As of January 2003, the total number of material witnesses \n     detained in the course of the September 11 investigation was \n     fewer than 50.\n\n  Again, the public and the Congress are faced with the veil of \nsecrecy. Tell me, Mr. President, what is the harm to national security \nin revealing the specific number of people who have been detained under \nthe material witness statute or the list of charges that have been \nbrought against such people? The public and the Congress have a right \nand an obligation to know.\n  One last troubling point is the unreasonable length of time many \nmaterial witnesses have been held. Again, the Justice Department \nrefuses to provide any specific information. I know Senator Leahy has \nwritten to the Attorney General for more information on actions that \nhave been taken under the material witness statute. He has requested a \nresponse by the end of this week. I very much hope that that response \nwill be forthcoming. We need to know more about the Justice \nDepartment's use of the material witness statute, and the Congress \nneeds to study whether changes should be made to ensure that due \nprocess is followed for individuals who are detained under this \nstatute.\n  Finally, we come to the third category of individuals who have been \ndetained; that is, individuals the administration deems to be ``enemy \ncombatants.''\n  To date, the administration is holding three individuals within the \nUnited States as enemy combatants, and close to 700 are being held at \nthe United States military base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. In all cases, \nthese individuals are being held incommunicado, with no access to \ncounsel and no opportunity for judicial review.\n\n  It is not unreasonable to ask who qualifies as an ``enemy \ncombatant.'' Since the Justice Department will not reveal the \nidentities of many of the people it is holding, it is very difficult to \ntell. Most of these individuals were taken into custody in Afghanistan \nor Pakistan and are alleged to have been engaged in action against \nUnited States troops. At least a few of those held as enemy combatants \nare citizens of allied countries. According to the Financial Times, \nnine of those being held in Guantanamo are British citizens. At least \none, Jose Padilla, is a U.S. citizen being held in South Carolina. \nAnother, Ali Saleh Kahlah Al-Marri, is a citizen of Qatar and had been \nscheduled to go on trial this month in Illinois on charges of lying to \nthe FBI. With the trial date approaching last month, the Justice \nDepartment removed him from the court system and jailed him in a Navy \nbrig in South Carolina. Now that he is an enemy combatant and is \nclassified as such, our Government takes the position that he need not \nbe charged with any crime, he need not be given a hearing, his attorney \nis denied the right to see him, and he can be jailed indefinitely by \nthe military in this condition.\n  President Bush has announced that 6 of the 700 or so ``enemy \ncombatants'' will be tried by a military tribunal. There are serious \nquestions about the procedures intended to be used in those trials. But \neven more serious questions relate to those who remain in jail without \nany prospect of charges being brought or trials being conducted.\n  The obvious question is: Where do we go from here with regard to \nthese individuals?\n  The administration has labeled these people ``enemy combatants'' and \nhas asserted the right to keep them incarcerated, presumably until our \nenemies are vanquished. But the President has made it clear that the \n``war on terrorism'' in which we are engaged is of indefinite duration.\n  Is it the President's view that we can keep these individuals in \nprison in Guantanamo from now on without revealing who they are, \nwithout charging them with crimes, without affording them a hearing at \nwhich they can protest their innocence?\n  This is not a tenable position. This is not consistent with the \ncommitment to liberty and the rule of law on which this country was \nfounded. We demand that other governments show greater respect for \nhuman rights than this, and we should demand better from our own \nGovernment as well.\n  Let me say what I hope is obvious; that is, I am not advocating the \nrelease of these individuals. What I am advocating is that we afford \nthem the right to be charged and to be tried for their alleged crimes. \nMost of those designated as enemy combatants have been in custody for \nmore than 18 months without being charged.\n  The Bush administration takes the position that they are not \nprisoners of war and, therefore, do not enjoy the protections of the \nGeneva Convention. Our Federal courts take the position that these \nindividuals are in Guantanamo, not within territory controlled by the \nUnited States, and therefore the courts have no authority to ensure \nthat basic rights are protected.\n  In the case of Al Odah, et al, v. United States, the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia sidestepped any responsibility for \nthe enforcement of the Constitution by deciding that it had no \njurisdiction over the detainees at Guantanamo. The argument used was \nthat since the United States only occupies Guantanamo Naval Base under \na lease it signed with Cuba in 1903, therefore, the court reasoned that \nCuba is the sovereign nation with jurisdiction in Guantanamo and \npresumably the detainees should look to Castro for a remedy.\n\n  The end result of all this legal maneuvering and sidestepping is that \nwith regard to these individuals, our own Government has successfully \nmanaged to avoid and evade any obligation to abide by procedural due \nprocess.\n  In the view of our Attorney General and the Secretary of Defense, \nthere is\n\n[[Page S9323]]\n\nno obligation to bring charges, there is no obligation to afford a \nhearing within a reasonable period of time, there is no obligation to \npermit legal counsel, and, in fact, there is no obligation to reveal \nwho is being held in this enemy combatant status.\n  The Attorney General further asserts that if a prosecution in the \ncourt system is not proceeding in a promising manner, he has the \nprerogative of unilaterally removing the defendant from the court \nsystem and jailing him for an indefinite period without the need to \nprove the individual's guilt.\n  The administration's treatment of immigrants, material witnesses, and \npersons labeled as ``enemy combatants'' makes a mockery of our \nprofessed commitment to individual rights. Our great Nation does not \nhave to abandon its Constitution and trample on the individual rights \nwe hold dear to deal with the threats of a modern world. Terrorism is a \nthreat to our Nation, but the undermining of our constitutional rights \nis also a threat.\n  The idea of America is admired and emulated all over the world, in \nlarge part because we believe that the right to liberty is fundamental. \nIn those circumstances when the State has reason to deprive a person of \nliberty, that individual should have the right to know what he or she \nis charged with and to have access to meaningful review of those \ncharges.\n  I urge the President, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of \nDefense to advise the Congress and the American people of the steps \nthey will take to afford basic procedural rights to all those I have \ndiscussed here. Too many generations of Americans have fought to \nprotect these rights for us to look the other way as they are being \ndenied and disregarded. Our children and grandchildren would expect \nbetter of us, and we should expect better of ourselves.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/14/senate-section/article/S9323-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9323]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           AMERICORPS FUNDING\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate showed its \nstrong support for the AmeriCorps program on Friday by defeating an \namendment to strip the $100 million in emergency fiscal year 2003 \nfunding that we in the Senate Appropriations Committee provided as part \nof the fiscal year 2004 Legislative branch spending bill. Without these \nemergency funds, Vermont will lose all but 15 to 20 of its over 100 \nAmeriCorps volunteers, and communities across the Nation are facing \nsimilar losses.\n  The dedicated young people who have answered AmeriCorps' honorable \ncall to service contribute enormously to the strength of our \ncommunities. Whether they are helping to house the homeless, feed the \nhungry, or keep disadvantaged youth safe in fun and educational \nafterschool activities, they are often filling a sorely needed gap that \nthe community cannot otherwise fill.\n  We must not let this vital part of our social safety net to unravel \nin Vermont and across the Nation, and that is why I am pleased to have \ncosponsored Senator Mikulski's amendment in the Appropriations \nCommittee to add $100 million for AmeriCorps, and why I voted on Friday \nto defeat the amendment to strip the money out. I urge all of my \ncolleagues in Congress, as well as the President, to support this \nemergency funding.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the $100 \nmillion included in the legislative branch appropriations bill for the \nAmeriCorps service program. It gives me great pride to know that more \nthan 27,000 people of all ages and backgrounds are helping solve \nproblems and strengthen communities through 79 national service \nprojects across Wisconsin. This year alone, more than 700 individuals \nhave committed to serve in Wisconsin communities as AmeriCorps members. \nTo date, more than 3,900 Wisconsin residents have qualified for \neducation awards totaling more than $17,000,000. It is a tragedy to \nthink just a few days ago, all of this may have been brought to a halt. \nIt is with the swift action of the Senate last Friday, in preserving \nthe $100 million appropriation to make AmeriCorps whole, that we are \nable to ensure that AmeriCorps continues to provide every opportunity \nfor Americans of all ages and backgrounds to engage in service.\n  AmeriCorps has proven an excellent outlet through which people may \nget involved in their community. Throughout the State of Wisconsin, \nAmeriCorps volunteers work closely with local nonprofit agencies and K \nthrough 12 schools. These individuals perform substantial amounts of \ndirect service that have benefited our State's citizens. They are \ntutoring and mentoring students in schools and afterschool programs, \nteaching children and adults how to read, building and rehabilitating \nlow-income housing, providing street outreach to runaway and homeless \nyouth, cultivating community gardens, and most importantly, \ndemonstrating to others the joy that a selfless act can bring and in \nreturn, recruiting others to become volunteers.\n  As our Nation faces a period of uncertainty, AmeriCorps programs are \nin a position to help build a stronger, more engaged citizenry while \ntackling some of our country's most pressing problems. Last week, the \nSenate was able to show its commitment to volunteerism all across the \ncountry by sustaining such a vital program at such a crucial time. I am \npleased that the Senate voted to maintain this funding in the bill, and \nI hope that the House of Representatives will agree in conference to \nretain it. Without such action, the critical services AmeriCorps \nprograms have provided over the years would not be possible and the \ncommunities that have come to rely on AmeriCorps would suffer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/14/senate-section/article/S9323-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9323-S9325]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      EXTENSION OF NORMAL TRADE RELATIONS TO SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nSenate Amendment No. 1149, which would grant the President the \nauthority to extend normal trade relations to Serbia and Montenegro.\n  As my colleagues may be aware, Serbia and Montenegro is one of just \nfour countries that is currently denied normal trade relations, NTR, by \nthe United States. Others in that group include North Korea, Cuba and \nLaos. Although there are certainly challenges in Serbia and Montenegro \nthat must be addressed, as we discussed during a hearing of the Foreign \nRelations Committee 2 weeks ago, there is no doubt among my colleagues \nthat this country no longer belongs in this category of ``bad actors.''\n  While the President has the authority to extend normal trade \nrelations to most countries, the case of Serbia and Montenegro is \ndifferent. In 1992, Congress revoked most favored nation status for \nYugoslavia in response to the policies of former Yugoslav dictator \nSlobodan Milosevic, who was supporting nationalist Serbian aggression \nin the conflicts in Croatia and Bosnia.\n  The legislation passed in 1992, P.L. 102-420, prohibits the extension \nof normal trade relations to Yugoslavia, now Serbia and Montenegro, \nuntil certain conditions have been met. The President must certify that \nSerbia and Montenegro has ceased armed conflict with other peoples of \nthe former Yugoslavia, agreed to respect the borders of the former \nYugoslav states, and ended all support to Bosnian Serb forces.\n  As written, the law intended to stop Milosevic from aiding Serbian \nforces responsible for brutal atrocities during the 1990s. There is no \ndoubt that the situation in Serbia and Montenegro has changed, and that \nthe spirit of these conditions has been met. However, some support for \nBosnian Serb forces is permitted under the Dayton Peace Accords signed \nin 1996. Given the situation on the ground in the early 1990s, the \nlegislation enacted in 1992 did not provide the flexibility for this \nsituation. As such, a legislative fix is required to permit the \nPresident to extend NTR to Serbia and Montenegro.\n  With Milosevic behind bars at The Hague and the current government \ntaking action to promote democratic reforms following the assassination \nof Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic on March 12, 2003, I believe \nthat it is time to take action to extend normal trade relations to \nSerbia and Montenegro. While we should continue to call on Serbia and \nMontenegro to meet its international obligations to apprehend war \ncriminals and cooperate with the International Criminal Tribunal for \nthe Former Yugoslivia, we should take this step to promote trade, \neconomic development, and improved relations between the United States \nand Serbia and Montenegro.\n\n[[Page S9324]]\n\n  Many of my colleagues agree. A provision to give the President the \nauthority to extend NTR to Serbia and Montenegro is included in S. 671, \nthe Miscellaneous Trade and Technical Corrections Act of 2003. While \nthis is an appropriate vehicle for this measure, I am frustrated that \nthis important piece of legislation is being held up indefinitely in \nthe Senate. I submit for the record a letter of June 26, 2003, signed \nby myself and 65 of my colleagues calling for Senate passage of this \nbill.\n\n  As a member of the Senate who pays close attention to developments in \nsoutheast Europe, I am committed to doing all that I can to make sure \nthat this critical piece of legislation is passed during this session \nof Congress, and I am hopeful to work closely with my colleagues to get \nthis done as soon as possible.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the June 26, 2003 letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                                    June 26, 2003.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     Majority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader: We are writing to express our support \n     for quick Senate action on the Miscellaneous Trade and \n     Technical Corrections Act of 2003 (S. 671). The House of \n     Representatives passed similar legislation in the 107th \n     Congress, but the Senate was unable to complete action on it \n     before the Congress adjourned. On March 5, 2003, the House of \n     Representatives again overwhelmingly approved this important \n     legislation. The United States Senate has an opportunity to \n     pass a non-controversial bill that will provide crucial \n     savings and an economic boost to U.S. manufacturers, \n     consumers, and workers. However, this important legislation \n     is stalled awaiting action in the Senate.\n       For more than 20 years Congress has regularly utilized the \n     Miscellaneous Tariff bill procedure to move non-controversial \n     and largely technical trade legislation. S. 671 accomplishes \n     three vital measures: (1) it enables eligible U.S. \n     companies to import products duty free if the product is \n     not manufactured domestically; (2) it helps create jobs \n     for American workers by allowing companies to be more \n     competitive and function more cost efficiently; (3) it \n     significantly reduces costs for U.S. consumers. Should the \n     Miscellaneous Trade and Technical Corrections Act of 2003 \n     fail to pass the Senate a second time, any future \n     opportunity for businesses to benefit from this valuable \n     procedure may be jeopardized.\n       Failure to enact the duty suspensions in S. 671 has \n     resulted in extraneous costs to U.S. manufacturers--through \n     taxes paid on imports that cannot be purchased domestically--\n     of roughly $32 million dollars in just the first five months \n     of this year. Manufacturing in the United States had \n     undergone 33 months of declining employment, and this bill \n     will create immediate benefits to American businesses and \n     will strengthen our economy. We strongly urge you to take the \n     necessary steps to move this legislation without further \n     amendments under normal Senate procedure.\n       Thank you for your time and consideration of this matter. \n     Please do not hesitate to contact us should you require \n     additional information regarding this request.\n           Sincerely,\n         Senators Alexander, Allen, Bayh, Biden, Bingaman, Bond, \n           Breaux, Brownback, Bunning, Campbell, Cantwell, Carper, \n           Chafee, Chambliss, Clinton, Cochran, Coleman, Collins, \n           Conrad, Cornyn, Corzine and Craig.\n         Senators Dayton, DeWine, Dodd, Domenici, Durbin, Edwards, \n           Ensign, Enzi, Feinstein, Graham of South Carolina, \n           Hagel, Harkin, Hatch, Hollings, Hutchinson, Inhofe, \n           Inouye, Jeffords, Kennedy, Kerry, Kyl, and Landrieu.\n         Senators Lautenberg, Leahy, Lieberman, Lincoln, Lott, \n           Lugar, McCain, Miller, Murkowski, Murray, Nelson of \n           Nebraska, Pryor, Roberts, Santorum, Schumer, Smith, \n           Snowe, Talent, Thomas, Voinovich, Warner, and Wyden.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I support Senator Voinovich's efforts to promote normal \ntrade relations with Serbia and Montenegro. Serbia and Montenegro is \none of only a handful of countries that do not have normal trade \nrelations with the United States, and the lack of normal trade \nrelations subjects Serbia and Montenegro to high tariff rates, making \nit difficult for them to grow their economy.\n  While I do not believe that the State Department authorization bill \nis the appropriate vehicle for this important legislation, I share the \nconcern of Senator Voinovich and so many other members that the \nmiscellaneous tariff reduction legislation, which includes the \nprovision granting normal trade relations to Serbia and Montenegro, \nmove forward expeditiously.\n  This legislation has been held up for six months for reasons \nunrelated to any of the provisions in the legislation. In addition to \nthe provision for Serbia and Montenegro, the legislation contains a \nnumber of tariff eliminations that help U.S. companies and workers, as \nwell as three provisions that are important for economic development in \nAfrica.\n  Recently I joined 65 of my colleagues in signing a letter to Senate \nMajority Leader Frist urging him to bring the legislation up under \nnormal Senate procedures. It is my hope that this legislation will pass \nthe Senate soon.\n  I thank my colleague for raising this important issue, and I pledge \nto work with him on its passage.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I rise in strong support of granting normal trade \nrelations status to Serbia and Montenegro, which was revoked from \nYugoslavia under U.S. sanctions in 1992. Senator Voinovich submitted an \namendment to the Department of State Authorization bill to grant normal \ntrade relations status to Serbia and Montenegro. However, because this \nmatter is within the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee, which I \nchair, I felt it necessary to object to including the provision on that \npiece of legislation.\n  Still, I understand Senator's Voinovich's frustration. The Finance \nCommittee reported out legislation which would renew normal trade \nrelations status for Serbia and Montenegro on March 20, 2003, in the \nMiscellaneous Trade and Technical Corrections Act of 2003, S. 671. This \nbill generally passes each year by unanimous consent in the Senate.\n  Unfortunately, the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill has been held up for \nmonths by the insistence of some Senators on including an unrelated, \ncontroversial provision to the bill. This provision cannot be included \nin the bill because other Senators will object. By holding up this \nimportant piece of legislation, U.S. manufacturers and workers whose \nbusinesses rely on duty suspensions are being harmed. They are losing \nmoney, and facing the possibility of laying off workers every day that \nwe fail to act.\n  This is important legislation, and I know that I am not the only one \nwho thinks so. Sixty-six of my colleagues sent a letter to the Majority \nLeader, urging him to bring up S. 671 for a vote. I support their \nefforts, and hope this vitally important legislation will move as soon \nas possible. I would like to thank Senator Voinovich for raising the \nissue, and ask that all my colleagues recognize not only the \nimportance, but the urgency of this legislation.\n  I will submit for the record a letter in support for NTR for Serbia \nand Montenegro, from the America's Development Foundation, ADF, a \nnonprofit organization assisting the international development of \ndemocracy. The ADF is working in Serbia to promote economic and social \ndevelopment through a program called Community Revitalization through \nDemocratic Action, or CRDA.\n  I will continue to try and pass normal trade relations for Serbia and \nMontenegro and appreciate my colleague's strong support and advocacy on \nthe issue.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter to which I referred be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n                             America's Development Foundation,\n\n                                     Alexandria, VA, July 3, 2003.\n     Senator Charles E. Grassley,\n     Chairman, Committee on Finance, Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Grassley: Thank you for your leadership in \n     passing S. 671 out of the Senate Finance Committee. As you \n     are well aware this measure contains provisions that will \n     grant historic Normal Trade Relations (NTR) status to Serbia \n     & Montenegro.\n       America's Development Foundation (ADF) is a U.S. nonprofit \n     private voluntary organization dedicated to the international \n     development of democracy. We are very interested in the \n     economic and social development of Serbia & Montenegro. Among \n     our many activities around the world, we are now engaged in \n     revitalizing 70 communities located in 12 municipalities \n     comprising more than a million people in the Vojvodina region \n     of Serbia. Our broad portfolio of work is supported by the \n     United States Agency for International Development (USAID) \n     and includes providing assistance for income generating \n     activities for farmers and small and medium enterprises.\n\n[[Page S9325]]\n\n       ADF is strongly supportive of the Bush Administration and \n     your Congressional leadership in highlighting the clear \n     linkages between development and trade. The economic growth \n     supported by free trade and open markets creates new jobs and \n     increased income for many people. From our direct/experience \n     working in Serbia, ADF sees a wonderful potential in further \n     advancing such linkages. NTR for Serbia & Montenegro will \n     promote its economic and social development and enhance the \n     prospects for strengthening democracy. Perhaps most \n     importantly, NTR for Serbia & Montenegro is in our nation's \n     direct national interests. Open markets and increased \n     investment will result not only in benefiting the people of \n     Serbia & Montenegro but also U.S. investment, trade and other \n     important strategic interests.\n       Thank you for championing S. 671. ADF looks forward to \n     quick passage of the bill by the U.S. Senate.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Michael Miller,\n     President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/14/senate-section/article/S9325-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9325]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEAD START PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I rise to express my opposition \nto any proposed changes to Head Start that would dismantle the program. \nI understand the Bush administration is attempting to turn the Head \nStart program into a State block grant. A block grant is an amount of \nmoney that the Federal Government gives to the States for a specific \npurpose. Head Start is a well-respected program with a record of \nsuccess. It is a comprehensive program that helps disadvantaged \nchildren and their families with early child development, literacy and \nhealth screenings. Why would we want to block grant a successful \nprogram? Too often block grants become an excuse to cut funding in the \nfuture. I do not believe that Head Start would be improved by changing \nsuccessful local programs by imposing a new layer of administration at \nthe State level. I am distressed to know that so many children of low-\nincome families will be denied the opportunity to enhance their early \nchildhood development.\n  The Head Start program was designed to help communities meet the \nneeds of underprivileged preschool children from ages three to five and \ntheir families. Head Start provides diverse services in four areas--\neducation, health, parent involvement, and social services. Head \nStart's educational program is designed to meet the needs of each \nchild, the community served, and its ethnic and cultural \ncharacteristics. Every child is involved in a comprehensive health \nprogram, which includes immunizations; medical, dental, and mental \nhealth; and nutritional services. An essential part of Head Start is \nthe involvement of parents in parent education, program planning, and \noperating activities. Finally, specific social services are geared to \neach family.\n  The West Virginia Head Start Association represents 24 Head Start \nprograms statewide. Each Head Start program is unique in providing \nservices to their families to meet the specific needs in the community. \nIn 2000-01, West Virginia Head Start programs received funding to \nenroll 6,700 children. Over the years, I have enjoyed visiting local \nHead Start programs to visit with children and meet with parents, \nteachers and staff about the importance of early education.\n  From the early stages of the Head Start program, Head Start has \nexpanded to include services for pregnant women and children under the \nage of 3. The goal of Early Head Start is to encourage the development \nof infants and toddlers by assisting parents in recognizing their value \nas the caregiver and teacher of their children. Early Head Start \nprovides services in and out of the home to families with young \nchildren and expectant families. They include parent education, \nnutrition services, case management, and support groups for parents. In \n2000-01, West Virginia received funding to enroll 325 children in 12 \ncounties.\n  Early childhood development provides a safe and structured learning \nenvironment that prepares our sons and daughters to succeed to the best \nof their abilities regardless of ethnic background and income level. \nSince 1965, the program has been providing services to increase a \nchild's readiness for school. Rather than restructuring Head Start, we \nshould build on its success and invest in professional development, \nquality and expansion to cover more children.\n  It is disappointing that the Bush Administration is trying to \nreorganize Head Start rather than investing in its strengths. I hope \nthat the Senate will take a bipartisan approach to the reauthorization \nof Head Start, and build on the success of Head Start, not dismantle \nit. When I was Chairman of the Children's Commission years ago, our \nbipartisan Commission called for full funding of Head Start so that all \neligible children were served. Serving all children and continuing to \ninvest in quality should be our goals for the reauthorization of this \nprogram so that our children truly enter school ready to learn.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/14/senate-section/article/S9325-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9325]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IN REMEMBRANCE OF STROM THURMOND\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, it is a privilege today to pay tribute \nto the memory of the late Strom Thurmond. Often outspoken, sometimes \ncontroversial, but always passionate, Strom was an unparallel servant \nof the people. He always put his Nation first, whether in combat on the \nbeaches of Normandy or here in the halls of the Senate.\n  He made a career of giving back to his country. But he was also a \nwonderful human being.\n  Strom often reminded me that Colonel William Barret Travis, who was \nin command at the Alamo, was from his home county in South Carolina. \nWhile Strom himself missed the Alamo by a few years, he demonstrated \nthat he too embodies the spirit of the Alamo and the sense of duty and \ncommitment to his country that we Texans associate with Colonel Travis.\n  Strom's journey into the history books began back in the 1920s when \nhe graduated from his beloved Clemson.\n  He went on to become a teacher and athletic coach, county \nsuperintendent of education, town and county attorney, eleventh circuit \njudge, South Carolina governor, soldier, president of the Reserve \nOfficers Association and finally, a U.S. Senator--a position he held \nfor a remarkable 48 years. For many, that would be five lifetimes of \ncareers. But not Strom. It was just enough to keep him busy for the \ncentury he was on this Earth.\n  Strom lived every day of his life to the fullest.\n  I'm still amazed that he volunteered to return to active duty \nmilitary service, though he was way past the age of being drafted. At \nthe age of 41 he flew onto the beaches of Normandy in a glider--staring \ndeath in the face, and smiling.\n  He served in the Pacific and European theaters, earning 18 \ndecorations, medals and awards including the Legion of Merit, the \nPurple Heart, and the Bronze Star for Valor. He rose to the rank of \nMajor General in the U.S. Army Reserves.\n  In the Senate Strom focused particular attention on taking care of \nour men and women in the military.\n  I served with Strom while he chaired the Armed Services committee and \nsaw the reflection of his time in the service in everything he did. He \nworked for one purpose--to ensure our country's national defense \nremained strong. From military health care to quality of life for \nservice members and their families, he knew that to recruit and retain \nour Nation's finest, we had to treat them well.\n  The Capitol has not been the same since Strom left last year. The wit \nand wisdom he collected over a century of living made him one of the \nmost entertaining and enlightening figures in modern politics. There \nwill always be an empty place in the heart of the Senate created by his \nabsence.\n  The eulogies that came from both sides of the aisle at his memorial \nservice last week were testament to the evolution Strom undertook \nduring his time in the Senate. A career once marked by division ended \nin unity and with dignity.\n  He will be greatly missed by his family, friends, colleagues and his \ncountry. He began his career in public service as a coach--eight \ndecades later he was a coach and teacher to us all to the very end.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/14/senate-section/article/S9325-3", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9325-S9326]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 TAIWAN\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I want to take a few moments and talk \nabout Taiwan which has been a reliable friend and ally of the U.S. in \nAsia for over 50 years. After the terrorist attacks of\n\n[[Page S9326]]\n\nSeptember 11, Taiwan quickly announced its support for the allied war \nagainst terrorism. Taiwan has since supported the ally efforts to rid \nIraq of Saddam Hussein and has offered humanitarian and developmental \nassistance in rebuilding Iraq for a free Iraqi people. For that, we \ncertainly owe Taiwan a great deal of thanks.\n  Taiwan has shown itself to be a democratic and freedom embracing \nrepublic even while it has undergone threats posed by the People's \nRepublic of China, PRC. As the world focuses on continuing tensions in \nthe Middle East and Africa, the nuclear situation in North Korea, and \nother threats, we must not ignore the military threat posed by the PRC \nto our friends in Taiwan. The United States must continue to stand with \nTaiwan. It is an island of freedom that must be supported.\n  Aside from simply supporting Taiwan's democratic principles of open \nelections, human rights, and freedom of assembly and religious beliefs, \nwe must also work to help them with their economy and support of \nmarkets and trade. I hope at some point the United States takes a \nserious and significant step in further strengthening our economic and \npolitical ties through a free trade agreement.\n  Taiwan is the United States' eighth largest trading partner and its \nlargest investment partner. A study produced by the U.S. International \nTrade Commission showed a net gain of $3.4 billion for the U.S. economy \nfrom a free trade agreement with Taiwan. And this benefits both \nAmerican workers and businesses as well as those in Taiwan. It seems to \nbe a winning situation for both Taiwan and the United States. With \nTaiwan's recent accession to the World Trade Organization, now is the \nright time to seriously consider beginning free trade negotiations with \nTaiwan.\n  While some say a free trade agreement may muddle our and Taiwan's \nrelationship with the PRC, I am hopeful such an agreement will benefit \nall. An agreement could bring about a moderation and softening in the \nPRC's stance toward Taiwan; treating Taiwan as a partner to help it \nmodernize and foster in itself democratic reforms.\n  Also, we need to make sure the United States stands behind Taiwan and \nhelps put an end to the PRC's military might and strategic deployments \nwhich at times paint a real disturbing and threatening picture for \nTaiwan. The PRC has accelerated its military buildup and now has over \n400 M-class missiles along its southeastern coast. And too many times \nthe PRC has routinely conducted live-fire practicing around the Taiwan \nStrait.\n  When the PRC conducts these exercises, it further destabilizes the \nregion. It undermines the right of the people of Taiwan to live without \nintimidation and threats from the PRC. The PRC even sought to keep \nTaiwan from seeking assistance of the World Health Organization during \nthe SARS outbreak, which in fact originated on mainland China and still \nsomewhat remains a problem in Asia.\n  We cannot stand by when the PRC provokes Taiwan. Even as we deal with \npressing issues around the world, we must not lose sight of our vital \ninterests in Taiwan. I strongly supported President Bush's approval in \nApril of 2002 of a sale of Kidd-class destroyers, anti-submarine P-3 \n``Orion'' aircraft, and diesel submarines to Taiwan. In accord with the \nTaiwan Relations Act, we must continue to speak out in defense of \nTaiwan, and use our strongest diplomacy to urge the PRC, as a \nresponsible member of the international community, to abandon its \nrhetoric and provocative actions, and maintain a dialogue with \ndemocratic Taiwan.\n  While we are so heavily engaged with the war on terrorism and \ninvolvement in Iraq, we must not lose sight of the democratic and \nfreedom-loving Taiwan. I urge my Senate colleagues to encourage Taiwan \nto be strong and firm with its democratic principles, and I urge this \nbody to make sure we stand up for and support Taiwan when she needs it \nthe most. A strong Taiwan is not only good for her and her people, but \nit is a beacon of hope and encouragement for all those who have \nstruggled and fought for democracy and the freeing of the human spirit. \nI thank the Senate for allowing me to raise these issues, and may God \nbless Taiwan--the Republic of China--richly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/14/senate-section/article/S9326-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9326]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave young man from \nBatesville, IN. Sgt. Chad L. Keith, 21 years old, was killed in Baghdad \non July 7, 2003 when he was ambushed while on patrol with his unit. \nChad joined the Army with his entire life before him. He chose to risk \neverything to fight for the values Americans hold close to our hearts, \nin a land halfway around the world.\n  Chad was the eleventh Hoosier soldier to be killed while serving his \ncountry in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Today, I join Chad's family, his \nfriends, and the entire Batesville community in mourning his death. \nWhile we struggle to bear our sorrow over his death, we can also take \npride in the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer \nplace. It is this courage and strength of character that people will \nremember when they think of Chad, a memory that will burn brightly \nduring these continuing days of conflict and grief.\n  Chad Keith spoke to his mother over the phone only days before his \ndeath, telling her that he was hot and tired, but proud to be making a \ndifference in the world and following in the footsteps of several of \nhis uncles who also served in the military. He was described by \nteachers and classmates as a polite, respectful young man who always \nhad a smile on his face.\n  Chad was born in Pennsylvania, then moved to Newark, OH, before his \nfamily settled in Batesville. Chad graduated from Batesville High \nSchool in 2000 and then joined the Army, where he was assigned to the \nelite 82nd Airborne. Friends and family say that serving in the \nmilitary had been a lifelong dream for Chad, who was only days away \nfrom being promoted to sergeant, an honor that now has been awarded \nposthumously. Chad leaves behind his parents, Kimberly and Mark \nHitzges, two sisters, Courtney and Nicole, and a brother, Alex.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Chad Keith's \nsacrifice, I am reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed \nthe families of the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg:\n\n       We cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow \n     this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled \n     here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or \n     detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \n     say here, but it can never forget what they did here.\n\n  This statement is just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, \nas I am certain that the impact of Chad Keith's actions will live on \nfar longer than any record of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Chad L. Keith in the official \nrecord of the United States Senate for his service to this country and \nfor his profound commitment to freedom, democracy and peace. When I \nthink about this just cause in which we are engaged, and the \nunfortunate pain that comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that \nfamilies like Chad's can find comfort in the words of the prophet \nIsaiah who said, ``He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord \nGod will wipe away tears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God \nbless the United States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/14/senate-section/article/S9326-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9326-S9327]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     TRIBUTE TO JAMES HOLLINGSHEAD\n\n Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity \nto recognize and honor an outstanding citizen of Mississippi, Mr. James \nHollingshead of Waynesboro, who recently displayed extreme heroism and \nbravery while in Destin, FL.\n  On Sunday, June 8, 2003, Mr. Doyle Mosley and his wife Linda were \nenjoying their annual family vacation in Destin, FL. During the day, \nthe waves had become increasingly high and a red flag had been put out \nby the lifeguards warning of potentially dangerous waves. The Mosleys' \ntwo oldest grandsons ventured into the water with their wake boards. \nInstantly they were caught in a dangerous and deadly riptide.\n  While one of the boys was able to remain on his board and return \nsafely to shore, the other, Cal Tackett, was in\n\n[[Page S9327]]\n\nserious danger. James Hollingshead, a complete stranger to the Mosleys \nand their grandsons, was walking down the beach with his wife when he \nsaw what was occurring. Although he was a total stranger, he \nimmediately rushed into the water in an effort to save Cal, risking his \nown life. After much struggle and effort, Mr. Hollingshead and Cal \neventually made it safely to shore. Although Mr. Hollingshead was \nunaware of it at the time, ironically enough, the Mosleys are also \nMississippians--residents of Greenwood.\n  This fortunate and happy outcome to a potentially disastrous \nsituation can only be fully understood and appreciated when put in \nperspective. I understand nine people lost their lives on this beach on \nthat tragic day. Thanks to the bravery and unselfish act of James \nHollingshead, Cal Tackett and the Mosley family were spared this \noutcome.\n  It is all too easy for us in the rush of our daily lives to turn a \nblind eye to the needs of others and forego lending a hand to our \nfellow citizens in need. On the fateful day of June 8th, James \nHollingshead made a different choice, a choice that made all the \ndifference in the lives of the Mosley and Tackett families. He set an \nexample for all of us that should not be ignored or forgotten. That is \nwhy I felt compelled to share with you this story of bravery and \ncourage. To quote the Mosleys, ``. . . it is so wonderful to know that \nthere are people like James Hollingshead, who care and act unselfishly \nfor a fellow citizen.'' Mr. Hollingshead, thank you for your courage, \nbravery and a job well done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/14/senate-section/article/S9327-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9327]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         IN RECOGNITION OF GOODSPEED MUSICAL'S 40TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate Goodspeed \nMusicals of East Haddam, CT, which is celebrating its 40th anniversary \non July 16, 2003.\n  Goodspeed has come a long way in 40 years. It was originally formed \nin 1959 to save the historic Goodspeed Opera House from destruction. \nNot only did Goodspeed Musicals succeed in that effort, it restored the \n19th century landmark to its former glory, and reopened it in 1963 as a \nprofessional theatre.\n  In the four decades since, Goodspeed Musicals has played a vital role \nin perpetuating and promoting the art of musical theatre--not only in \nthe State of Connecticut but nationally and even internationally. From \nits modest beginnings, Goodspeed has gone on to produce over 186 \nmusicals, including 43 world premiere productions and 16 that went on \nto Broadway.\n  In addition to performances at the Goodspeed Opera House, Goodspeed \nMusicals now also stages shows in the Norma Terris Theatre in Chester. \nIts growth is a testament to the hard work of so many Goodspeed \nemployees, volunteers, members, and supporters, and to the enjoyment \nand wonder that musical theatre can instill in so many people.\n  Over the years, Goodspeed has showcased classics by composers such as \nGilbert and Sullivan and Cole Porter. But it has also been a palace \nwhere emerging artists have been able to develop their work and present \nit to audiences for the first time. It has produced more than 63 new \nshows--the largest number of new musicals for any theatre in America.\n  Productions such as Annie, Man of La Mancha, and Shenandoah had their \nworld premieres at Goodspeed. And countless actors, musicians, \nchoreographers, directors, and other members of the theatre community \nhave had their careers advanced and enriched by working at Goodspeed.\n  Goodspeed productions that have made it to Broadway have earned over \na dozen Tony awards. And for its contributions to American musical \ntheatre, Goodspeed Musicals has earned two Tony awards of its own.\n  In addition to producing musical theatre, Goodspeed Musicals has also \ndevoted itself to promoting understanding the art form. At Goodspeed's \nMax Showalter Center for Musical Theatre Education, students--both \nprofessional and amateur--gain a greater appreciation of all aspects of \nmusical theatre and also participate in training and development \nprograms that help them put their knowledge into practice.\n  Goodspeed has become an integral part of a rich and vibrant arts \nculture in the State of Connecticut. Along with the Shubert and Long \nWharf Theatres in New Haven, the Bushnell and the Hartford State in our \nState's capital, and numerous other theatres, production companies, and \nmusical groups, Goodspeed provides an environment where musical theatre \nand the performing arts can, and will, continue to thrive and flourish.\n  On a personal note, as a resident of East Haddam and a member of \nGoodspeed's Board of Directors, I have enjoyed many a magical evening \nat the Goodspeed Opera House. And it is my fervent hope that Goodspeed \nMusicals will continue to inspire and entertain for many years to come.\n  I offer my warmest congratulations to Michael Price, the remarkably \ntalented Executive Director of Goodspeed Musicals, and to everyone who \nhas been a part of Goodspeed over the past 40 years. I wish them and \nGoodspeed Musicals nothing but continued success in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/14/senate-section/article/S9327-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9327]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO RENEE HAMMOND\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, it is my privilege today to \nrecognize Renee Hammond of Dora, AL. On May 10, 2003, Mrs. Hammond was \nvacationing in Florida to recuperate from eye surgery. As she was \nwalking on the beach with friends, she noticed some commotion near the \nwater's edge. Two teenage girls had gotten caught in a strong undertow. \nA man from a nearby condominium ran into the water and quickly pulled \none of the girls to safety. However, a policeman, who had gone in the \nwater first, barely made it to shore with the younger of the two girls. \nMrs. Hammond, with the help of another woman, pulled the young girl \nonto the beach and began to perform rescue breathing. After only a few \nmoments, the girl was gasping for air, coughing up water, and \neventually breathing some on her own. Mrs. Hammond persisted in helping \nthe girl by gently patting her on the back as she continued coughing up \nwater. Eventually the paramedics arrived on the scene and took over. \nMrs. Hammond maintained her compassionate, helpful manner as she \nchecked on the others involved in the incident, including the policeman \nthat had rescued the girl. As her husband stood amazed and impressed by \nher natural ability to give care, Mrs. Hammond proved humble, \ncommending the paramedics for a job well done.\n  Renee Hammond is a shining example of a nurse and a citizen, serving \nnot only in her work environment, but also in a sudden time of need to \nhelp save the life of a stranger. As a nurse in Walker County, AL, she \nis a heroine everyday in the lives of those she helps. As a self-\nsacrificing, brave woman, Mrs. Hammond is a heroine to that young girl \nfrom the beach and to the rest of us. Her example serves us as \ncitizens, encouraging us to be honorable, to do the right thing, and to \nput the needs of others before our own.\n  Renee is the wife of J.R. Hammond, a mine worker, who is also a \nremarkable man. He has been a tremendous advocate for the American \n``working man.''\n  Mr. President and members of the Senate, please join me in \nrecognizing Renee Hammond as a heroine among us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/14/senate-section/article/S9327-3", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9327-S9328]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              90TH BIRTHDAY OF VIRGINIA DAVIS GILL, PH.D.\n\n Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my \ncongratulations and best wishes to Virginia Davis Gill, Ph.D., on the \noccasion of her 90th birthday.\n  Born on July 17, 1913, Dr. Gill has dedicated her life to public \nservice. Her career as a social worker, a school teacher, and a health \nadministrator spanned over seven decades, reflecting Dr. Gill's \ncommitment to serving her community. Indeed, Dr. Gill did not retire \nuntil she was 75 years of age.\n  Throughout her career, Dr. Gill's leadership included active \ninvolvement in the American Red Cross and serving as a national board \nmember of United Cerebral Palsy. Following her retirement, Dr. Gill was \nselected to attend the 1995 White House Conference on Aging.\n  Dr. Gill lives in my home State of Maine, but she is loved here in \nWashington, DC, as well. Our own Attending Physician of the Capitol, \nthe distinguished Dr. John Eisold, is presenting an American flag to \nhis longtime friend to honor her birthday.\n  Together with Dr. Gill's brother, Mr. Wadsworth Davis, and her son, \nMr.\n\n[[Page S9328]]\n\nWalter Gill, I join in saluting the life of this remarkable woman and \nin wishing her the happiest of birthdays.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/14/senate-section/article/S9328-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9328]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need \nfor hate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in Houston, \nTX. On September 21, 2001, a 30-year-old political refugee from Iraq \nwas returning home at approximately midnight when he was threatened and \ninjured by a gunman. As he opened his car door, the victim was \napproached by a young man who greeted him in Arabic. Suddenly, the \nattacker drew out a handgun and pointed it to the victim's head. When \nthe victim offered money, the gunman said, ``I don't want your money. \nYour people killed my people. You are from the Middle East.'' The \nvictim grabbed for the gun and was shot in the left hip in the \nstruggle. The gunman fled on foot.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/14/senate-section/article/S9328-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9328]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n Mr. HARKIN.

A bill to provide for the environmental restoration of the \nGreat Lakes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the ``Great Lakes \nEnvironmental Restoration Act'' with Senator DeWine and our other bill \nsponsors. I also want to thank Representatives Emanuel and Reynolds and \nthe rest of the House members who are introducing similar Great Lakes \nrestoration legislation over in the House today.\n  Many of my colleagues are aware of the importance of the Great Lakes \nto the eight States which border them. The lakes provide our drinking \nwater, they provide our largest recreational resource, they are \ntremendously important to our economy, and they impact our quality of \nlife. Over time, we have seen numerous changes in the lakes from water \nlevels to fish populations to water quality. Some of these changes are \npart of a natural cycle, but many of these changes are the direct \nresult of management policies. For example, the Great Lakes Fishery \nCommission and its partners have been able to reduce sea lamprey \npopulations by 90 percent. The lake sturgeon appear to be improving as \na result of the efforts by Federal and State managers, fishermen, and \nother water users. As of April 2002, approximately 84 percent of high-\nlevel PCB wastes had been destroyed, up from approximately 40 percent \nin spring 1998. And the first U.S. Area of Concern--Presque Isle Bay, \nPA--has been upgraded to a ``recovery area.'' While the Great Lakes \nhave made strides in recovering after the environmental protections \nwere put in place in the early 70s, there has been very slow progress \nin the last 10-15 years because the Federal commitment has not kept up \nwith the needs of the Great Lakes.\n  This legislation that we are introducing today will provide the \nFederal commitment of funding and resources to keep pace with the \nrestoration needs of the Great Lakes.\n  The Great Lakes face problems like beach closings, contaminated \nsediments, and invasive species, and the Federal Government needs to \n``jump start'' our restoration efforts in the Great Lakes. I believe \nthat with the help of the governors, the mayors, the wide array of \nnongovernmental organizations, and other interested parties, this \nlegislation would provide some of the resources needed to keep pace \nwith needs of the lakes.\n\n  In April, the GAO completed its study on Great Lakes Restoration \nefforts, and they reported that while there were many on-going \nrestoration efforts from dozens of Federal and State Great Lakes \nprograms, there was no over-arching, coordinated plan for the Great \nLakes. GAO also reported that an environmental indicators and \nmonitoring system needed to be developed in order to measure overall \nrestoration progress. The report emphasizes that limited Great Lakes \nfunding has always been a problem.\n  The legislation we are introducing today has three components to \naddress the problems outlined by the April 2003 GAO report. First, the \nlegislation authorizes $600 million in annual funding for the EPA's \nGreat Lakes National Program Office to provide grants to the Great \nLakes States, municipalities and other applicants based on the \nrecommendations and priorities of a Great Lakes Environmental \nRestoration Advisory Board. These grants will require a 20 percent \nfunding commitment from the region, and every State will receive at \nleast 6 percent of the total amount of funding available for the year. \nThe Great Lakes Environmental Restoration Advisory Board will be led by \nthe Great Lakes governors, but it will include views of a whole range \nof people interested in the Great Lakes such as mayors, Federal \nagencies, Native American tribes, environmentalists, industry \nrepresentatives, and Canadian observers. This Advisory Board will \nprovide priorities on restoration issues such as invasive species \ncontrol and prevention, wetlands restoration, contaminated sediments \ncleanup, and water quality improvements. By providing grant priorities, \nthe region will shape the future of the Great Lakes.\n  Second, this legislation establishes a Great Lakes Federal \nCoordinating Council in order to coordinate Federal activities in the \nGreat Lakes. According to the GAO study, environmental restoration \nactivities in the Great Lakes are uncoordinated. EPAs Great Lakes \nNational Program Office is equipped to serve as the Council leader, and \nFederal participants include NOAA, the Army Corps of Engineers, the \nDepartment of State, the Department of Health and Human Services, the \nDepartment of Agriculture and the Department of Interior. The Council \nwould meet at least three times per year to ensure that the efforts of \nFederal agencies concerning environmental restoration and protection of \nthe Great Lakes are coordinated, effective, complementary, and cost-\nefficient. The Council would also provide a list of its funding \npriorities to the Office of Management and Budget.\n  Third, this bill gives the Great Lakes National Program Office the \nmandate to work with other Federal agencies and Canada to identify and \nmeasure water quality and other environmental factors on a regular \nbasis. The initial set of data collected through this network will \nserve as a benchmark against which to measure future improvements. \nThose measurements will help us make decisions on how to steer future \nrestoration efforts. With a clearer picture of how the Great Lakes are \nchanging, we can change course when needed and spend public funds on \nthe most pressing demands. This provision will address GAO's finding \nthat there is no data collected regularly throughout the Great Lakes, \nand that the existing data are inadequate to determine whether water \nquality and other environmental conditions are improving.\n  The Great Lakes are a unique and valuable resource, and we cannot \nafford to continuously underfund their protection. Congress must act to \nenhance their restoration and protection. As the current caretakers and \nbeneficiaries, we owe nothing less to the region and the American \npeople.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I am proud to join my fellow Great Lakes \nTask Force chair, Senator Carl Levin,\n\n[[Page S9331]]\n\nin introducing today the Great Lakes Environmental Restoration Act. I \nwould like to thank our Senate cosponsors--Senators Voinovich, \nStabenow, Coleman, Durbin, Schumer, and Clinton--for supporting this \nlegislative effort.\n  The Great Lakes hold one-fifth of the world's surface freshwater, \nhold an estimated six quadrillion gallons of water, cover more than \n94,000 square miles, and drain more than twice as much land. The Great \nLakes ecosystem includes such diverse elements as northern evergreen \nforests, deciduous forests, lake plain prairies, and coastal wetlands. \nOver thirty of the basin's biological communities--and over 100 \nspecies--are globally rare or found only in the Great Lakes Basin. The \n637 State parks in the region accommodate more than 250 million \nvisitors each year. And, the Great Lakes Basin is home to more than 33 \nmillion people--that is one-tenth of our entire U.S. population.\n  The eight Great Lakes States comprise more than one-third of the \nnational manufacturing output, and the lakes represent a critical \nshipping land for these States' manufactured goods and other natural \nresources. Ohio's nine ports on Lake Erie annually handle 70 million \ntons of cargo--that is almost seven tons of cargo for every Ohio \nresident, with a total value of over $1.5 billion.\n  My colleagues in Congress and I understand the value of the Great \nLakes as a natural resource to the region, and we have been making \nprogress in improving the overall quality of the lakes. Over the last \nfew years, I have worked to secure $34 million for Ohio and the Great \nLakes States to expand public access to the lakes. And now, I am \nworking to address invasive species through the National Invasive \nSpecies Council Act, which I introduced, and the National Aquatic \nInvasive Species Act, which I cosponsored. Senator Levin and I have \nworked together as cochairs of the Great Lakes Task Force since 2000.\n  We have fought to secure needed Great Lakes funding for the NOAA \nwater level gauges, the replacement ice-breaking vessel, the Mackinaw, \nand sea lamprey control money for the Great Lakes Fishery Commission. \nWe both met with the U.S. Trade Representative in an effort to prevent \nwater from the Great Lakes from being diverted abroad. And, we also \nworked together to authorize the Great Lakes Basin Soil Erosion and \nSediment Control Program in the 2002 farm bill. Last fall, we passed \nthe Great Lakes Legacy Act, which provides up to $50 million per year \nto the EPA to clean up contaminated sediments at Areas of Concern. The \nPresident provided $15 million in his fiscal year 2004 budget to get \nthis program started.\n  These steps, in conjunction with the efforts by our States, are \npositive, but unfortunately--based on the Federal Government's current \nlevel of funding--we are not able to keep pace with the problems facing \nthe Great Lakes. An April 2003 GAO report found that the Federal \nGovernment has spent about $745 million over the last 10 years on Great \nLakes restoration programs. Now, consider the fact that the GAO \nreported that the eight Great Lakes States spent $956 million during \nthat same 10-year period. The Federal Government is simply not spending \nenough to protect and improve the Great Lakes--one-fifth of the world's \nfreshwater.\n  There is ample evidence to show that this current level of commitment \nis simply not enough. In 2001, there were nearly 600 beach closings as \na result of E. colie bacteria, and State and local health authorities \nissued approximately 1,400 fish consumption advisories in the Great \nLakes. In the years since the United States and Canada signed the Water \nQuality Agreement and agreed to give priority attention to the 43 \ndesignated Areas of Concern, the United States has not been able to \nremove any of the U.S. sites from the list of Areas of Concern.\n  For several years, I have been calling for a plan to restore the \nlakes and have been urging the Governors, mayors, the environmental \ncommunity and other regional interests to agree on a vision for the \nfuture of the Great Lakes--not just the immediate future, but many \nyears down the road. I have said that we must work together as partners \nto create and implement a long-term strategy on how we are going to \nrestore and protect the lakes and that it is time for us to come \ntogether and develop a plan and put it in place.\n  This bill would build upon the efforts by the Great Lakes States, \nwhich have convened a Working Group to establish their Great Lakes \ngoals and priorities. Many of our regional interest groups and agencies \nhave prepared strategic plans and priorities. And, we have brought in \nthe President's Council on Environmental Quality so that the President \nwill better understand the value of a long-term plan for the Great \nLakes. I can't emphasize how important it is to have all of these \ninterests working toward the same goal.\n  A Great Lakes restoration program must be an equal partnership \nbetween the local, State, and Federal Governments and other interested \ncitizens and organizations. I believe that this legislation would \nprovide the tools needed for the long-term future of the Great Lakes. \nFirst, this legislation creates a $6 billion Great Lakes restoration \ngrant program to augment existing Federal and State efforts to cleanup, \nprotect, and restore the Great Lakes. In the April 2003 GAO report, the \nGAO reported that insufficient funding is often cited as a limitation \nto restoration efforts. Therefore, an additional $600 million in annual \nfunding would be appropriated through the EPA's Great Lakes National \nProgram Office, and the Program Office would provide grants to the \nGreat Lakes States, Municipalities, and other applicants in \ncoordination with the Great Lakes Environmental Restoration Advisory \nBoard. This funding would provide the extra resources that existing \nprograms do not have.\n\n  While the Great lakes are a national and international resource, I \nbelieve that the region, not the bureaucrats in Washington, needs to be \nsetting its priorities and guiding the future efforts on the lakes. \nThis bill would require very close coordination between the EPA and the \nState and regional interests before grants are released. The Great \nLakes Environmental Restoration Advisory Board, led by the Great Lakes \nGovernors, would include mayors, Federal agencies, Native American \ntribes, environmentalists, industry representatives, and Canadian \nobservers. This advisory board, which would include all of the \ninterests in the Great Lakes, would provide priorities on restoration \nissues, such as invasive species control and prevention, wetlands \nrestoration, contaminated sediments cleanup, and water quality \nimprovements. Additionally, this advisory board would provide \nrecommendations on which grant applications to fund. Ultimately, the \ninput from the advisory board would mean that the region would be \ninvolved in determining the long-term future of the Great Lakes.\n  As the April 2003 GAO study reported, environmental restoration \nactivities in the Great Lakes are uncoordinated. So, the second goal of \nthis legislation is the establishment of a Great Lakes Federal \ncoordinating council to coordinate Federal activities in the Great \nLakes. The EPA's Great Lakes National Program Office would serve as the \ncouncil leader, and participants would include the key Federal agencies \ninvolved in Great Lakes work, such as NOAA, the Army Corps of \nEngineers, the Department of Agriculture, and the Department of \nInterior. The council would meet at least three times per year to \nensure that the efforts of Federal agencies concerning environmental \nrestoration and protection of the Great Lakes are coordinated, \neffective, complementary, and cost-efficient. The council also would \nprovide a list of its funding priorities to the Office of Management \nand Budget.\n  Finally, our bill would address the GAO's second recent finding that \nenvironmental indicators and a monitoring system for the Great Lakes \nneed to be developed to measure progress on new and existing \nrestoration programs.\n  The Great Lakes are threatened by many problems, and I have worked \nwith Senator Levin and my other colleagues from the Great Lakes states \nto try to address those problems on an issue-by-issue basis. These \nprograms are working to correct problems. However, the rate of our \nprogress has not able to keep pace with the growing number of threats. \nFor those of my colleagues who know the problems facing Great Lakes and \neven other large watersheds like the Chesapeake Bay, the\n\n[[Page S9332]]\n\ngulf coast, or the Everglades, you will agree that we need to refocus \nand improve our efforts on the Great Lakes to help reverse the trend \ntoward additional degradation.\n  The Great Lakes are a unique natural resource for Ohio and the entire \nregion, and they need to be protected for future generations. I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in support of this bill and in our efforts to \nhelp preserve and protect the long-term viability of our Great Lakes.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. McCain, Mr. Hollings, \n        Mr. Inouye, and Mr. Breaux:)\n  S. 1400. A bill to develop a system that provides for ocean and \ncoastal observations, to implement a research and development program \nto enhance security at United States ports, to implement a data and \ninformation system required by all components of an integrated ocean \nobserving system and related research, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Ocean and \nCoastal Observation Systems Act of 2003. This bill would help develop \nand formalize an integrated network of ocean observing systems around \nour Nation's coastlines, thereby fulfilling a critical information need \nthat is essential in marine science, resource management, and maritime \ntransportation and safety.\n  Like other coastal States, Maine has a strong and deep connection to \nour coastline and oceans. We are highly dependent on the fisheries \nresources and other essential services provided to us by the sea, and \nwe understand that our lives and livelihoods are firmly rooted in how \nwell we understand and adapt to ocean conditions. While we are able to \npredict tides and other cyclical changes with some accuracy, our best \nknowledge of the ocean has basically come through direct experience out \non the water in often dangerous conditions--until recently.\n  In 2001, a new era in ocean and coastal observing began when the Gulf \nof Maine Ocean Observing System, or GoMOOS, deployed ten observation \nbuoys in the Gulf of Maine. This prototype system has transformed how \nwe gather information about the ocean and track ocean conditions over \ntime. On the surface, these buoys take measurements of wind speed, wave \nheight, temperature, and--for the first time--fog. Under the water's \nsurface, these buoys measure currents, temperature, salinity, \nturbidity, dissolved oxygen, and other key environmental variables. By \nmodifying the instrumentation, other data can be gathered from these \nplatforms.\n  Scientists and seafarers have been gathering this kind of information \nfor decades. What sets the GoMOOS observation buoy system apart from \nthe traditional data gathering approach, however, is that it takes all \nthese ocean and surface condition measurements on an hourly basis \nthrough a network of linked buoys, and these real-time measurements can \nbe monitored and accessed by the general public through the internet. \nNot only do the Gulf of Maine buoys gather more data on more variables, \nbut the unprecedented geographical distribution and greater frequency \nof these measurements has increased the range and timeliness of our \nocean knowledge. By linking this comprehensive information with other \ndata gathering systems and making it accessible via the internet, \nGoMOOS provides a tremendous public service and fills a critical \ninformation need in coastal regions.\n  The need for this type of access to ocean information is not limited \nto the Gulf of Maine. The U.S. coastline spans 95,000 miles, and all \nStates that border our oceans and Great Lakes can and will benefit from \nthis type of service. Ocean and coastal observing systems have been \nplanned or developed for other coastal regions, many in conjunction \nwith the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, state coastal \nmanagement agencies, universities, and other regional partners. As \nthese systems evolve, they develop different approaches for collecting, \nmanaging, processing, and communicating data through their network. As \nis often the case, however, data from these regional systems are \nincompatible with data from other regions. When this occurs, we lose a \nvaluable opportunity to link these systems and develop a comprehensive \npicture of coastal and ocean conditions around the Nation.\n\n  The Ocean and Coastal Observation Systems Act seeks to solve this \nproblem by coordinating and institutionalizing ocean and coastal \nobservation efforts with the support of the Federal Government. This \nAct would promote the ongoing development of these regional systems, \nlink them through a network of compatible data systems, and provide a \nsystem which anyone could access to better understand and track \nregional and national ocean and coastal conditions. It would call on \nthe National Ocean Research Leadership Council to design, operate, and \nimprove a nation-wide ocean and coastal observation system, and to \ncoordinate and administer an ocean data research and development \nprogram. This Council would plan these activities through a \ncollaborative interagency planning office and carry them out through a \njoint operations center, led by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration.\n  The American public--over half of which lives along our coastlines--\nwill be very well served through the many uses and applications of this \nsystem. Fisheries scientists and managers can use this information to \npredict ocean conditions related to productivity and incorporate this \ninformation into their management system. Fishermen, sailors, Coast \nGuard search-and-rescue units, the military, and others who venture out \non the ocean can better predict sea conditions to know when and where \nto go out safely, and shippers can transport goods more efficiently. \nOcean scientists and regulators can better understand, predict, and \nrapidly respond to the distribution and impacts of marine pollution. \nEducators and students can learn more about how and why oceans function \nas they do. Clearly, anyone who uses and depends upon the ocean stands \nto benefit from this integrated system.\n  As a coastal State Senator, I am very proud to introduce this bill. I \nwould like to thank my co-sponsors, Senators Kerry, McCain, Hollings, \nInouye and Breaux, for contributing to this legislation and supporting \nthis national initiative. I must also thank all the dedicated \nprofessionals in the ocean and coastal science, management, and \nresearch communities that have been instrumental in developing both the \ngrassroots regional observation systems as well as this legislation. \nTheir ongoing commitment gives me confidence that this bill, once \nenacted, will serve the public well by facilitating better \nunderstanding of our nation's oceans and coasts.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1400\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Ocean Observation and \n     Coastal Systems Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The 95,000-mile coastline of the United States is vital \n     to the Nation's homeland security, transportation, trade, \n     environmental and human health, recreation and tourism, food \n     production, scientific research and education, historical and \n     cultural heritage, and energy production.\n       (2) More than half the Nation's population lives and works \n     in coastal communities that together make up 11 percent of \n     its land and its most ecologically and economically important \n     regions, supporting approximately 190 sea ports, containing \n     most of our largest cities, and providing access to coastal \n     waters rich in natural resources.\n       (3) More than 95 percent of the Nation's trade moves by sea \n     and nearly half of all goods, including energy products, \n     carried in maritime commerce are hazardous materials.\n       (4) The rich biodiversity of marine organisms provides \n     society with essential food resources, a promising source of \n     marine products with commercial and medical potential, and an \n     important contribution to the national economy.\n       (5) The oceans drive climate and weather factors causing \n     severe weather events and threatening the health of coastal \n     ecosystems and communities by creating or affecting both \n     natural and man-made coastal hazards such as hurricanes, \n     tsunamis, erosion, oil spills, harmful algal blooms, and \n     pollution, which can pose threats to human health.\n\n[[Page S9333]]\n\n       (6) Each year, the United States Coast Guard relies on \n     ocean information to save 4,380 people, conducts over 65,000 \n     rescue missions, and carries out more than 11,680 \n     environmental cleanups and responses to pollution.\n       (7) Safeguarding homeland security requires improved \n     monitoring of the Nation's ports and coastline, including the \n     ability to track vessels and to provide rapid response teams \n     with real-time environmental conditions necessary for their \n     work.\n       (8) Advances in ocean technologies and scientific \n     understanding have made possible long-term and continuous \n     observation from space and in situ of ocean characteristics \n     and conditions.\n       (9) Many elements of an ocean and coastal observing system \n     are in place, though in a patchwork manner that is \n     fragmented, intermittent, incomplete, and not integrated.\n       (10) Important coastal uses, such as tourism, recreation, \n     and fishing, require assurance of healthy coastal waters, and \n     while the interagency National Coast Condition Report \n     provides an annual assessment of the status and quality of \n     coastal waters, substantial data gaps exist that could be \n     reduced through measurement of coastal quality through a \n     coordinated observing system that incorporates Federal, \n     State, and local monitoring programs.\n       (11) National investment in a sustained and integrated \n     ocean and coastal observing system and in coordinated \n     programs of research would assist this Nation and the world \n     in understanding the oceans and the global climate system, \n     strengthen homeland security, improve weather and climate \n     forecasts, strengthen management of marine resources, improve \n     the safety and efficiency of maritime operations, and \n     mitigate coastal hazards.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to provide \n     for--\n       (1) development and maintenance of an integrated system \n     that provides for sustained ocean and coastal observations \n     from in situ, remote, and vessel platforms, and that promotes \n     the national goals of assuring national security, advancing \n     economic development, conserving living marine resources, \n     protecting quality of life and the marine environment, and \n     strengthening science education and communication through \n     improved knowledge of the ocean;\n       (2) implementation of a research and development program to \n     enhance security at United States ports and minimize security \n     risks; and\n       (3) implementation of a data and information system \n     required by all components of an integrated ocean and coastal \n     observing system and related research.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to authorize appropriations for activities under the \nFederal railroad safety laws for fiscal year 2004 through 2008, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Today, I am joined by Senator Hollings in introducing the \nFederal Railroad Safety Improvement Act. This legislation would \nreauthorize the Federal rail safety program, which expired at the end \nof fiscal year 1998.\n  The rail safety program, which is administered by the Federal \nRailroad Administration, FRA, encompasses a range of inspection, \nresearch, education, and oversight initiatives aimed at protecting the \nsafety of railroad employees; ensuring track and equipment are properly \nmaintained; enhancing grade crossing safety; safeguarding the \ntransportation of hazardous materials by rail; and overseeing the \nindustry's safety practices and procedures. FRA also monitors Amtrak \nand, in the past two years, has assumed a more active role in \nprotecting the investment of the taxpayers in that troubled enterprise.\n  There have been remarkable improvements in rail safety over the past \n20 years, attributable to both the safety program and the Staggers Act, \nthe landmark legislation enacted in 1980 to partially deregulate the \nfreight railroads. According to FRA statistics, the rail industry's \ntrain accident rate has declined 68 percent since the Staggers Act was \npassed and the rate of employee injuries and fatalities has fallen 74 \npercent. The number of grade crossing collisions declined 72 percent \nfrom\n\n[[Page S9335]]\n\n1980 through 2002, while fatalities declined 57 percent.\n  The Federal Railroad Safety Improvement Act would renew our \ncommitment to a strong rail safety program. The legislation would \nauthorize $166 million for rail safety in fiscal year 2004, the amount \nrequested by the Administration, rising to $200 million in fiscal year \n2008. Included in these authorizations would be additional funds to \ncontinue initiatives to test and install positive train control, PTC, \nsystems on passenger and freight railroad rights-of-way. Some federal \nsupport of PTC technology is warranted; PTC has been on the National \nTransportation Safety Board's ``most wanted'' list since 1990, but is \ncost-prohibitive for the railroads to install on a widespread basis.\n  Our proposed legislation also would make improvements to grade \ncrossing safety by formally establishing a national crossing inventory, \nreauthorizing Operation Lifesaver, and requiring the development of \nmodel state legislation with penalties for drivers who violate crossing \nsigns, signals, and gates. The legislation also would direct FRA to \ndevelop a plan for a joint initiative with states and municipalities to \nclose 1 percent of all public and private grade crossings each year for \na 10-year period. This is an ambitious goal but one that would clearly \nsave lives.\n  The legislation we propose today also would address long-standing \nconcerns about employee fatigue in the rail industry. The bill would \nrequire that a working group be convened within FRA's Railroad Safety \nAdvisory Committee to consider what legislative or other changes may be \nappropriate to address fatigue management and report back to the Senate \nCommerce Committee and the House Committee on Transportation and \nInfrastructure within 18 months following enactment. While the \nrailroads and rail labor organizations have initiated a number of \ndiscrete pilot projects to address fatigue, it is unclear whether real \nprogress is being made. If a consensus cannot be reached by the working \ngroup, the Department of Transportation would be required to submit its \nown recommendations within 2 years following enactment.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in moving this bill \nthrough the legislative process in the weeks ahead. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1402\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Railroad Safety \n     Improvement Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. AMENDMENT OF TITLE 49, UNITED STATES CODE.\n\n       Except as otherwise expressly provided, whenever in this \n     Act an amendment or repeal is expressed in terms of an \n     amendment to, or a repeal of, a section or other provision, \n     the reference shall be considered to be made to a section or \n     other provision of title 49, United States Code.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Res. 16. A joint resolution to approve the ``Compact of Free \nAssociation, as amended between the Government of the United States of \nAmerica and the Government of the Federated States of Micronesia'', and \nthe ``Compact of Free Association, as amended between the Government of \nthe United States of America and the Government of the Republic of the \nMarshall Islands'', and otherwise to amend Public Law 99-239, and to \nappropriate for the purposes of amended Public Law 99-239 for fiscal \nyears ending on or before September 30, 2023, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senators \nBingaman, Craig and Akaka--colleagues from the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources--I am pleased to introduce legislation recently \ntransmitted by the Administration that would strengthen our Nation's \nrelationship with two Pacific Island nations with which we have a \nspecial bond--the Federated States of Micronesia, FSM, and the Republic \nof the Marshall Islands, RMI.\n  The United States has a long history of involvement in the islands of \nMicronesia in the Western Pacific--from 19th century voyages of \nNantucket whaling ships, that inspired the literature of Herman \nMelville, to the development of nuclear weapons and missile defense \nsystems that are cornerstones of our Nation's military strength. In \n1947, following the bloody battles of World War II on the beaches of \nKwajalein and Saipan, our nation's role changed fundamentally when the \nUnited States became Administrator of the region under the United \nNation's Trusteeship system. As Administrator of the U.N. Trust \nTerritory of the Pacific Islands, the United States governed the \nislands for over forty years; not as an occupation force or as \nsovereign, but with the obligation to promote the political, economic, \nand social development of the inhabitants.\n  In 1986, the United States fulfilled its obligation to the U.N. with \nrespect to the islands of Micronesia and the Marshall Islands following \nimplementation of the Compact of Free Association. The Compact formally \nended U.S. Administration and allowed these countries to achieve self-\ngovernment and recognition as full members of the community of nations. \nHowever, and most significantly, the Compact also allowed the United \nStates and these new nations to maintain the special relationship \nforged during the Trusteeship. For seventeen years now, the Compact has \ncontinued to provide for mutual defense as well as political and \neconomic stability in a region of vital interest to the United States.\n  The legislation being introduced today is necessary to update and \nextend various provisions of the Compact, particularly the economic \nassistance provisions that are due to expire on September 30 of this \nyear. Representatives of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands and the \nUnited States have invested tremendous effort over the past four years \nin negotiating these amendments. We commend Al Short, Peter Christian, \nand Gerald Zackios, the U.S., FSM, and RMI negotiators, respectively, \nfor their years of work to strengthen the Compact and the special \nrelationship between our nations.\n  The agreements reached by the negotiators, as reflected by this \nlegislation, would provide the resources needed to assure continued \neconomic development and mutual security in the islands. Pursuant to \nthose agreements, trust funds will be established to provide a \nmechanism for the eventual phase-out of annual financial assistance \nfrom the United States. The parties have also agreed to changes that \nwill assure greater accountability and effectiveness in the use of U.S. \nfinancial and program assistance. Continued access to the vitally \nimportant Ronald Reagan Missile Test Site at Kwajalein Atoll is \nprovided. The Compact's immigration provisions have been updated to \nreduce threats to our country's homeland security and to reduce the \nimpact of migration on the neighboring islands of Hawaii, Guam, and the \nNorthern Mariana Islands. These changes are made while continuing to \nallow citizens of the FSM and RMI the opportunity to migrate to the \nUnited States as non-immigrants for education, employment, and \nresidence.\n  Congressional consideration of this legislation comes at a time when \nthe issue of nation-building is receiving increased attention. Our 60 \nyears of experience of nation-building in Micronesia and the Marshall \nIslands underscores the importance of partnership, planning, adequate \nresources, and sustained commitment. The task in the former Trust \nTerritory has turned out to be neither easy nor quick. However, \nvirtually all who have examined the Compact agree that it has \nsuccessfully met its objectives of promoting self-government, mutual \ndefense and economic stability. There is also agreement that there is \nmuch more to be done. The FSM and RMI still have tremendous challenges \nin improving health and education and in further developing their \neconomies so that they can provide health and education and in further \ndeveloping their economies so that they can provide more resources to \nmeet the basic needs of the people. This is a particularly daunting \ntask given that each nation is dispersed over a vast area of the remote \nwestern Pacific Ocean.\n  We too face a considerable challenge given how little time we have to \nconsider this package. The assistance provisions of the current Compact \nexpire in just 11 weeks. While the negotiators have done an excellent \njob, it is our understanding that they, and the General Accounting \nOffice, will present several issues to Congress for further \nconsideration and we expect that there will be a need for fine-tuning \nthe package.\n  We look forward to working with our colleagues in the Senate, House, \nand the Administration in trying to meet the demanding deadline, to \nconsider these remaining issues, and to assure the continued success of \nthe special relationship between the United States, Micronesia and the \nMarshall Islands.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/14/senate-section/article/S9338-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9338-S9339]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1215.

Designation of America's National World War II \n     Museum. (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The National D-Day Museum, operated in New Orleans, \n     Louisiana by an educational foundation, has been established \n     with the vision ``to celebrate the American Spirit''.\n       (2) The National D-Day Museum is the only museum in the \n     United States that exists for the exclusive purpose of \n     interpreting the American experience during the World War II \n     years (1939-1945) on both the battlefront and the home front \n     and, in doing so, covers all of the branches of the Armed \n     Forces and the Merchant Marine.\n       (3) The National D-Day Museum was founded by the preeminent \n     American historian, Stephen E. Ambrose, as a result of a \n     conversation with President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1963, \n     when the President and former Supreme Commander, Allied \n     Expeditionary Forces in Europe, credited Andrew Jackson \n     Higgins, the chief executive officer of Higgins Industries in \n     New Orleans, as the ``man who won the war for us'' because \n     the 12,000 landing craft designed by Higgins Industries made \n     possible all of the amphibious invasions of World War II and \n     carried American soldiers into every theatre of the war.\n       (4) The National D-Day Museum, since its grand opening on \n     June 6, 2000, the 56th anniversary of the D-Day invasion of \n     Normandy, has attracted nearly 1,000,000 visitors from around \n     the world, 85 percent of whom have been Americans from across \n     the country.\n       (5) American World War II veterans, called the ``greatest \n     generation'' of the Nation, are dying at the rapid rate of \n     more than 1,200 veterans each day, creating an urgent need to \n     preserve the stories, artifacts, and heroic achievements of \n     that generation.\n       (6) The United States has a need to preserve forever the \n     knowledge and history of the Nation's most decisive \n     achievement in the 20th century and to portray that history \n     to citizens, visitors, and school children for centuries to \n     come.\n       (7) Congress, recognizing the need to preserve this \n     knowledge and history, appropriated funds in 1992 to \n     authorize the design and construction of The National D-Day \n     Museum in New Orleans to commemorate the epic 1944 Normandy \n     invasion, and subsequently appropriated additional funds in \n     1998, 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2003 to help expand the exhibits \n     in the museum to include the D-Day invasions in the Pacific \n     Theatre of Operations and the other campaigns of World War \n     II.\n       (8) The State of Louisiana and thousands of donors and \n     foundations across the country have contributed millions of \n     dollars to help build this national institution.\n       (9) The Board of Trustees of The National D-Day Museum is \n     national in scope and diverse in its makeup.\n       (10) The World War II Memorial now under construction on \n     the National Mall in Washington, the District of Columbia, \n     will always be the memorial in our Nation where people come \n     to remember America's sacrifices in World War II, while The \n     National D-Day Museum will always be the museum of the \n     American experience in the World War II years (1939-1945), \n     where people come to learn about Americans' experiences \n     during that critical period, as well as a place where the \n     history of our Nation's monumental struggle against worldwide \n     aggression by would-be oppressors is preserved so that future \n     generations can understand the role the United States played \n     in the preservation and advancement of democracy and freedom \n     in the middle of the 20th century.\n       (11) The National D-Day Museum seeks to educate a diverse \n     group of audiences through its collection of artifacts, \n     photographs, letters, documents, and first-hand personal \n     accounts of the participants in the war and on the home front \n     during one of history's darkest hours.\n       (12) The National D-Day Museum is devoted to the combat \n     experience of United States citizen soldiers in all of the \n     theatres of World War II and to the heroic efforts of the men \n     and women on the home front who worked tirelessly to support \n     the troops and the war effort.\n       (13) The National D-Day Museum continues to add to and \n     maintain one of the largest personal history collections in \n     the United States of the men and women who fought in World \n     War II and who served on the home front.\n       (14) No other museum describes as well the volunteer spirit \n     that arose throughout the United States and united the \n     country during the World War II years.\n       (15) The National D-Day Museum is engaged in a 250,000 \n     square foot expansion to include the Center for the Study of \n     the American Spirit, an advanced format theatre, and a new \n     United States pavilion.\n       (16) The planned ``We're All in this Together'' exhibit \n     will describe the role every State, commonwealth, and \n     territory played in World War II, and the computer database \n     and software of The National D-Day Museum's educational \n     program will be made available to the teachers and school \n     children of every State, commonwealth, and territory.\n       (17) The National D-Day Museum is an official Smithsonian \n     affiliate institution with a formal agreement to borrow \n     Smithsonian artifacts for future exhibitions.\n       (18) Le Memorial de Caen in Normandy, France has formally \n     recognized The National D-Day Museum as its official partner \n     in a Patriotic Alliance signed on October 16, 2002, by both \n     museums.\n       (19) The official Battle of the Bulge museums in Luxembourg \n     and the American Battlefield Monuments

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Great Black \n     Americans Commemoration Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Black Americans have served honorably in Congress, in \n     senior executive branch positions, in the law, the judiciary, \n     and other fields, yet their record of service is not well \n     known by the public, is not included in school history \n     lessons, and is not adequately presented in the Nation's \n     museums.\n       (2) The Great Blacks in Wax Museum, Inc. in Baltimore, \n     Maryland, a nonprofit organization, is the Nation's first wax \n     museum presenting the history of great Black Americans, \n     including those who have served in Congress, in senior \n     executive branch positions, in the law, the judiciary, and \n     other fields, as well as others who have made significant \n     contributions to benefit the Nation.\n       (3) The Great Blacks in Wax Museum, Inc. plans to expand \n     its existing facilities to establish the National Great \n     Blacks in Wax Museum and Justice Learning Center, which is \n     intended to serve as a national museum and center for \n     presentation of wax figures and related interactive \n     educational exhibits portraying the history of great Black \n     Americans.\n       (4) The wax medium has long been recognized as a unique and \n     artistic means to record human history through preservation \n     of the faces and personages of people of prominence, and \n     historically, wax exhibits were used to commemorate noted \n     figures in ancient Egypt, Babylon, Greece, and Rome, in \n     medieval Europe, and in the art of the Italian renaissance.\n       (5) The Great Blacks in Wax Museum, Inc. was founded in \n     1983 by Drs. Elmer and Joanne Martin, 2 Baltimore educators \n     who used their personal savings to purchase wax figures, \n     which they displayed in schools, churches, shopping malls, \n     and festivals in the mid-Atlantic region.\n       (6) The goal of the Martins was to test public reaction to \n     the idea of a Black history wax museum and so positive was \n     the response over time that the museum has been heralded by \n     the public and the media as a national treasure.\n       (7) The museum has been the subject of feature stories by \n     CNN, the Wall Street Journal, the Baltimore Sun, the \n     Washington Post, the New York Times, the Chicago Sun Times, \n     the Dallas Morning News, the Los Angeles Times, USA Today, \n     the Afro American Newspaper, Crisis, Essence Magazine, and \n     others.\n       (8) More than 300,000 people from across the Nation visit \n     the museum annually.\n       (9) The new museum will carry on the time honored artistic \n     tradition of the wax medium; in particular, it will recognize \n     the significant value of this medium to commemorate and \n     appreciate great Black Americans whose faces and personages \n     are not widely recognized.\n       (10) The museum will employ the most skilled artisans in \n     the wax medium, use state-of-the-art interactive exhibition \n     technologies, and consult with museum professionals \n     throughout the Nation, and its exhibits will feature the \n     following:\n       (A) Blacks who have served in the Senate and House of \n     Representatives of the United States, including those who \n     represented constituencies in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, \n     Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and \n     Virginia during the 19th century.\n       (B) Blacks who have served in the judiciary, in the \n     Department of Justice, as prominent attorneys, in law \n     enforcement, and in the struggle for equal rights under the \n     law.\n\n[[Page S9356]]\n\n       (C) Black veterans of various military engagements, \n     including the Buffalo Soldiers and Tuskegee Airmen, and the \n     role of Blacks in the settlement of the western United \n     States.\n       (D) Blacks who have served in senior executive branch \n     positions, including members of Presidents' Cabinets, \n     Assistant Secretaries and Deputy Secretaries of Federal \n     agencies, and Presidential advisers.\n       (E) Other Blacks whose accomplishments and contributions to \n     human history during the last millennium and to the Nation \n     through more than 400 years are exemplary, including Black \n     educators, authors, scientists, inventors, athletes, clergy, \n     and civil rights leaders.\n       (11) The museum plans to develop collaborative programs \n     with other museums, serve as a clearinghouse for training, \n     technical assistance, and other resources involving use of \n     the wax medium, and sponsor traveling exhibits to provide \n     enriching museum experiences for communities throughout the \n     Nation.\n       (12) The museum has been recognized by the State of \n     Maryland and the city of Baltimore as a preeminent facility \n     for presenting and interpreting Black history, using the wax \n     medium in its highest artistic form.\n       (13) The museum is located in the heart of an area \n     designated as an empowerment zone, and is considered to be a \n     catalyst for economic and cultural improvements in this \n     economically disadvantaged area.\n\n     SEC. 3.
