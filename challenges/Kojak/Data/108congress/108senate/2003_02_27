Mr. President, the Senate will spend the day in executive \nsession trying to reach an agreement for a time to vote on the Estrada \nnomination.\n  Yesterday, every issue raised by my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle was answered by Chairman Hatch and my Republican colleagues \nin a 2-hour, rapid paced, very responsive question-and-answer colloquy, \ndesigned to further clarify the Record. We continued the discussion \nwell into the evening. I think we closed the Senate at about 2 o'clock \nin the morning. That partly explains starting a bit later today.\n\n[[Page S2876]]\n\n  Mr. President, the Miguel Estrada nomination was submitted by \nPresident Bush in May 2001--almost 2 years ago. We know that he has not \nonly the support of the majority party, but he has support from a \nmajority of the Members--more than 51 Senators--in this body. And that \nwas demonstrated in a letter that was sent by Senator McConnell and 51 \nother colleagues to the President, dated February 25, 2003.\n  Yet my colleagues on the other side of the aisle continue to practice \njustice delayed, which, incidentally, is increasingly being called, by \nthe American people, justice denied, because that delay is denying the \nmajority will of this body.\n  My objective, since February 5--since this nomination came to the \nfloor of the Senate--has been to provide all of our Senators with a \nforum for informed deliberation, for tempered deliberation, for \nthorough consideration. I have been very clear from the beginning that \nmy intention was to have a vote--an up-or-down vote--and to move this \nnomination to the constitutionally mandated question: Will the Senate \nadvise and consent to this nomination--yes or no, yea or nay, up or \ndown? That is all that we ask.\n  It is the majority leader's job, after consultation with the minority \nleader, to schedule this yea or nay vote. I have asked, on numerous \noccasions, for a time certain for this vote. Again and again, each of \nmy requests has been rejected.\n  The nomination has been pending now for 3 weeks--or more than 3 \nweeks--and I do believe there has been ample time for Members to \ndeliberate on this nominee. There is no doubt about the outcome if we \nare allowed to vote on it. The sheer number of signatures on that \nFebruary 25 letter reflects that the confirmation would occur. Yet \nDemocrats continue to refuse to set a time for this dispositive vote.\n  So, once again, I say: Let's vote. I hope that Members do come to the \nfloor during today's proceedings to discuss this important nomination.\n  With respect to rollcall votes--because I know a number of our \ncolleagues are very interested in what the plans will be for both \ntoday, tomorrow, and on Monday--I will be discussing the schedule with \nthe Democratic assistant leader or the Democratic leader today in \nrelation to the schedule so that very shortly we can determine when \nthese votes will be scheduled.\n  The Judiciary Committee is still meeting as we speak. But I hope to \nhave some information here within the next hour or hour and a half so \nwe can set up votes over the next couple days.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Democratic whip.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the two leaders have met several times in \nthe last 12 hours. That is fair. And there is progress being made as to \nwhat the majority leader is going to do next week. We will be happy to \ncooperate in any way we can. We have this little dust-up here. We have \nto work around that.\n  As I indicated--the leader was not on the floor at the time \nyesterday--we know we have a problem with the Estrada nomination.\n  But we are not trying to delay. We have allowed the committees to go \nforward. We have tried to cooperate with the majority leader anytime he \nhas had other legislation to bring forward. We will continue to do \nthat. We just need to figure out some way to get through the \nparliamentary problem we have now with the Estrada nomination. We will \ncontinue to be advocates for our position in that regard, but we stand \nready, as the majority leader has been told by Senator Daschle, to work \nwith him in any way we can to help move legislation.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we will continue to work aggressively. I \nthink everybody in this body understands our goal. I appreciate the \ngood nature. We will continue to push forward for a vote. I did have \nthe opportunity to talk to the leader on the other side of the aisle. \nThe Democratic leader and I discussed plans over the next several \nweeks. That discussion is very important. I believe we are making \nprogress there. Again, in terms of votes, either later today or \ntomorrow morning, hopefully within an hour or hour and a half, we can \nmake decisions. In all likelihood, we will be voting Monday afternoon \nand throughout Tuesday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/27/senate-section/article/S2876-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2876]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now go into executive session and resume consideration of \nExecutive Calendar No. 21, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Miguel \nEstrada, of Virginia, to be United States Circuit Judge for the \nDistrict of Columbia.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, for the past several weeks, as we have \nheard this morning, this body has done very little beyond the debate on \nthe nomination of Miguel Estrada. Hour upon hour, day upon day, week \nupon week, the debate has continued. We have heard every argument there \nis to make on both sides of the issue. We have heard them from just \nabout every Senator, and we have heard them over and over. It has been \npretty repetitious.\n  I don't mean to diminish the importance of this debate about a \nsingle, very important job. After all, it goes to the heart of the \nSenate's role under the constitutional system of government. The \nquestion is whether this constitutionally responsible body will be \ndiminished to such an extent that we just become a rubberstamp for \nWhite House judicial nominations; that is, whether we will agree to \nautomatically confirm nominees even if they refuse to answer publicly \nthe most basic of our questions on their jurisprudential perspectives. \nIt is hard to understand how we can give a lifetime appointment to a \njob without having a job interview.\n  This is an important debate. All of us believe that. That is why we \nhave had 3 weeks of consideration. It is one that reaches well beyond \nthe specifics of the individual candidate. It deserves our careful \nconsideration. The Constitution charges the Senate with the \nresponsibility to provide advice and consent on judicial nominations. \nThose of us on this side will attend to that responsibility.\n  Of all the issues facing our Nation at this most challenging time in \nour history, there are other--certainly in my view and I suspect the \nview of most of my colleagues--issues that are of a higher priority. It \nis a profound mistake on the part of the majority to insist on staying \non this nomination indefinitely while Mr. Estrada and the \nadministration, with all due respect, continue what some would term \n``stonewalling'' while there are so many vital issues our Congress \nshould be addressing.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Today, I will focus in particular on the problem, along with the \ndrastic, dramatic threat of terrorism we face daily and the prospect of \nwar with Iraq, which we heard the President talked about last evening, \nthat is probably uppermost in the minds of my constituents in New \nJersey and, I suspect, across the country, and that is the state of our \neconomy. It is in serious need of attention.\n  I have been listening to New Jerseyans from around the State, from \nall walks of life, all ethnic, religious, racial backgrounds, the long-\nterm unemployed, to manual laborers, to midlevel managers, to CEOs, to \nretirees and soccer moms. For just about all of them, there is a \ntremendous sense of anxiety with respect to the state of our economy \nand their families' economic security. People are concerned about \nwhether they will have a job, whether their savings will be there when \nthey retire, whether they will be able to pay for their college \neducations, whether they will be able to have health care. There are \nserious concerns, flat-out kitchen table concerns for all Americans. I \nknow that is the case in my home State.\n  An anecdotal perspective on this country's anxiousness has now been \nbacked up by hard statistics from the conference board released this \nweek.\n\n[[Page S2877]]\n\nSometimes we divorce these statistics from the reality. I certainly see \nit in people's faces and the words, but we saw it actually monitored in \na statistic released by the conference board this week. We saw consumer \nconfidence drop from 78, almost 79 percent, of the population last \nmonth to 64 percent. That is the lowest level since October of 1993. \nThat is probably one of the sharpest drops in history; I did not check \nthe actual number, but far greater than post-September 11, and it is \nreflective of a dramatic undermining of the strength of well-being felt \nby most Americans.\n\n  Americans around the country are deeply concerned about our Nation's \neconomy. They have a good reason to be. After all, since January 2001, \nthe number of unemployed has increased by nearly 40 percent--almost 8.5 \nmillion people. About 2.5 million private sector jobs have been lost in \nthat period, and there are now about 2.5 job seekers for every job \nopening in America. Think about that, 2.5 people applying for every job \nnow available.\n  Not only have the number of unemployed Americans increased, those out \nof work are now jobless for longer periods of time. Over the past year, \nthe average number of weeks individuals have spent unsuccessfully \nseeking work has increased by about a month, and 20 percent of the \nunemployed have been looking for work more than 6 months. There are 1 \nmillion of these long-term unemployed workers in America and almost \n100,000 falling off the rolls for unemployment insurance benefits each \nmonth. Just slightly fewer than 100,000 each month are dropping off the \nbenefits because they can't find jobs.\n  While there are no great and solid statistics on it, there are a lot \nof people dropping out of the job market. The job market is not \ngrowing, and it is one of the reasons--the statistics show the \nunemployment rate certainly up dramatically and skyrocketing--a lot of \npeople have just stopped looking. The lack of jobs has also slowed wage \ngrowth. Recently, only those workers with the very highest of incomes \nhave experienced any wage increases in the economy, any wage increases \nat least that have outpaced inflation. For lower wage earners, that \ngrowth has absolutely stalled to zero. That is not, obviously, helping \ncreate the demand that will drive our economy and make a real \ndifference in people's lives.\n  The Bush administration's record on job creation is on track to be \nthe worst in 58 years. In fact, to just equal what transpired during \nthe Eisenhower administration, which currently has the worst record, \nyou would have to create 96,000 new jobs each month starting today and \ncontinuing each month for the remainder of this President's term; \n96,000 is a lot of jobs to create, particularly when we have been \nlosing jobs at a rate almost that fast each month.\n  It is extraordinary what we have to do to turn the economy around. \nWithout a significant increase in job creation, we will have the worst \n4-year record in the history of any President.\n  Unfortunately, there is little evidence to suggest that it will turn \naround. For instance, according to the employment outlook survey \nconducted by Manpower, Inc., which came out this week, which is the \nprivate sector's best gauge of what is going on in the employment \nmarket, only 22 percent of America's employers are going to increase \nthe number of jobs in the upcoming two quarters. The rest of them are \neither going to reduce jobs or stay the same.\n  Mr. President, 22 percent is a very low number by any historical \nmeasure. I don't understand why we are debating one job on the floor of \nthe Senate when we are failing to address the fundamental needs and \nrequirements for all American families, their jobs, and their well-\nbeing.\n  Of course, the problems with the economy are much deeper than just \nreflected in what is probably the most important place--the job market. \nBut there is a lack of confidence in a whole host of sectors in the \nAmerican economy. Our businesses are now operating at only about 75 \npercent of capacity. That is well below any of the averages we have had \nhistorically, which is about 81 percent. Our States are suffering with \nsome of the most severe fiscal crises they faced in decades, forcing \nGovernors and State legislators to approve steep tax increases. In my \nState, the average increase in property taxes was 7.1 percent. New York \nCity increased property taxes 18.5 percent, and they are trying to put \na commuter tax on so everybody who surrounds the city is helping to \nbail it out with lots of legitimate needs on homeland defense and first \nresponders. We are putting unbelievable pressure on those individuals \nwho are responsible for State and local governments.\n  In the upcoming fiscal year, estimates of the total State deficits \nare roughly $90 billion cumulatively. And we are talking about a $36 \nbillion tax cut to be administered this year. That is way overblown by \nwhat is happening at our State and local levels.\n  Briefly, I will mention that investors are in a state of shock. The \nstock market has declined dramatically in the last 2 years and couple \nof months, losing almost $5 trillion in value in that period of time. \nThose are unbelievable numbers, but when you translate that into \n401(k)s and IRAs of individuals--at least in my State--I think that is \nabout a 40 percent decline in value, on average. It is a huge loss of \nthe retirement security that many families have seen happen in their \nfinancial well-being. When the President's program was announced in \nearly January, actually the Dow Jones Industrial Average was supposed \nto be benefited by that program, but it dropped by over 10 percent.\n  Our Federal budget, which 2 years ago was projected to enjoy a 10-\nyear surplus at $5.6 trillion, now looks at record deficits for \nabsolutely years to come--as far as the eye can see, some would say--\nand will be increasing the public debt over the same horizon as we \nprojected that $5.6 billion surplus to $2 trillion worth of public \ndebt. That is a fiscal reversal in this country of $8 trillion. It is \nan $8 trillion negative cash swing in the country's cashflow.\n  I don't want to tell you what I would do if I were back running a \ncompany and we had an $8 trillion negative cashflow, but it would \nprobably be grounds for change in policies and programs--maybe even a \nchange in CEOs.\n  When you add all these concerns together, it is clear that the \neconomic record of the Bush administration is bordering on abject \nfailure. Now the administration's response to the problem is, let's do \nmore of the same. Having based its economic policy on large tax breaks \nfor the most fortunate among us, the President's response to that \nfailed policy is let's stay the course, let's have more tax breaks \ntargeted for those with the highest income, and let's run larger budget \ndeficits and increase our national debt even more, and let's reduce \nnational savings--which is the way we create growth in this country--\neven more.\n\n  Whatever happened to the simple view that I think there has been a \nbipartisan sense of, which is that rising tides lift all boats? Are we \nnot thinking about the economy in its totality? Why don't we have \neverybody participating? I don't understand why we are sticking with \npolicies that look to be not serving the country well.\n  As I have suggested, there used to be a business leader who said, \n``If it's broke, fix it.'' It is really nothing more than common sense. \nIf things are not working, I think you have to adjust policies; you \nhave to think about doing something differently if you are stuck in a \nrut. This administration is doing just the reverse. It has dug itself \ninto a hole, and its response is to dig deeper. If we don't challenge \nthese policies, the long-term implications could reduce our Nation's \nstandard of living not just in the near term but for decades to come.\n  At a time when we are challenged with domestic security and \ninternational security, when we are asking for sacrifice from our men \nand women in uniform, for all of the country to understand we have \nserious challenges to our national security, why we are not \nunderstanding that this is a time for us to pull together and have \nshared sacrifice is hard for me to understand.\n  Frankly, if one projects the cost of the President's tax cut package \nbeyond 10 years--if you put that structure in place while the \ndemographic bubble of the baby boomers comes into play, frankly--I \ndon't care about dynamic scoring--we will end up running, by almost all \nobjective analyses, catastrophic deficits, as Chairman Alan Greenspan \ntestified just this morning at a House hearing on aging. It will be\n\n[[Page S2878]]\n\na real challenge to be able to maintain Social Security and Medicare at \nanything similar to today's programs for the future seniors of America.\n  We are putting those programs at risk, we are putting our fiscal \nposition at risk, if we stay the course with the policies we have \ntoday. Considering all these facts, unfortunately, it is difficult for \nthe administration to provide effective leadership, in my view, on the \neconomy because its credibility has been badly eroded. There is a \ntremendous credibility gap, and it results from the repeated use of \nfigures and claims that are just badly misleading in many ways. As a \nmatter of fact, starting to come out are regular analyses by \neconomists, people in the press, and I think one needs to honestly look \nat and challenge what some of these predictions and analyses point to \nand compare them with the facts.\n  Let me provide a few examples. The President's rhetoric would lead \none to believe that his tax plan will provide a meaningful economic \nstimulus, get jobs growing, and it is all about jobs. When you dig into \nthe numbers, it turns out that the reality is very different. In fact, \nonly $36 billion of the President's planned $675 billion on the table \nwould kick in this year--$36 billion in a $10 trillion economy. It is \njust an absolute drop in the bucket relative to what would be needed to \nactually drive this economy forward, by anybody's measure, any \nobjective measure of what it takes to get an economy moving.\n  There is virtually no one in Congress I have been able to find who \nwould argue that this is a program that will stimulate or revitalize \nthis economy, nor does it make sense to argue that the President's \ndividend exclusion somehow is going to stimulate the economy, when its \nreal effect will be to shift cash off the corporate balance sheet. If \ncorporations are going to invest in jobs and research and development, \nand if they are going to put money to work in building, plant, and \nequipment, they need cash. You cannot go to a bank unless you have \nmargin to put down. You need to invest in those things to drive our \neconomy.\n  By definition, dividend exclusion is going to take money off the \nbalance sheets of companies, and the capacity to invest and retain and \ncreate jobs is going to be diminished. That is why there is this \nargument about whether, if you are going to have a dividend exclusion, \nyou ought to at least do it at the corporate side of the income \nstatement as opposed to through an exclusion.\n  We have heard that from Chairman Greenspan. We see that from almost \nany reasonable economic analysis. Cash on the balance sheets is how you \nget business done, as far as investment and creating jobs. It is almost \na truism. Instead of driving economic growth, it is actually \nantigrowth, and I think we will end up with less economic stimulus by \nthe nature of the structure, even if we thought it was an appropriate \ntime for that reform on something other than a revenue-neutral basis. \nIn other words, the President's claims about the stimulative impact of \nhis proposal, in my view, and I think a vast majority of independent \nanalysts, is little more than rhetoric. The reality is quite different.\n  There are other elements with which people can deal with regard to \nthe credibility of the proposals of the administration claiming \nbenefits of this tax cut are going to go--I think this is the quote--\n``92 million Americans receive an average tax cut of $1,083.'' That is \nthe claim.\n  As we are hearing over and over, that is pretty misleading because \nthe average tax cut is inflated by the huge breaks going to a very \nnarrow set of folks, while a lot of other people are getting very small \ntax cuts. In fact, a half of all taxpayers would get a tax cut not of \n$1,083, but less than $100. This is a difference between mean and \naverage, and 78 percent of Americans would get reductions of less than \n$1,000.\n  When I went to business school, our required reading included the \nbook ``How to Lie with Statistics.'' There are some spinmeisters who \nmust have reviewed this work and learned it well, as far as I can tell. \nI am sure Americans understand how averages are put together, and they \ncan cover great sins.\n  Similarly, the White House likes to claim the amount of income tax \npaid by high-income Americans would actually rise under this proposal. \nWe hear this under the arguments of class warfare. When you consider \nthe real measure of who benefits in terms of increases in something \nthat is simple for people to understand, aftertax take-home pay--the \nstuff people can actually buy groceries with or pay the bills with--it \nturns out that--no surprise--it is the most fortunate who do best under \nthe Bush plan.\n  The tax reduction for those making $45,000 would amount to less than \n1 percent of their aftertax take-home pay. Those making more than \n$525,000 would see an increase of more than three times that rate, and \nin real dollars those are substantial numbers. But with the aftertax, \nwhat people can actually use in their everyday lives, the opposite is \nbeing promoted from what the reality is. Again, there is a credibility \ngap.\n  I also argue the credibility gap applies to the administration's \nclaims that their plan will help seniors. In fact, over half of all \ndividends paid to the elderly go to seniors with incomes over $100,000. \nI think it is great they planned and saved, but the number of seniors \nout of the roughly 40 million seniors who have incomes over $100,000 is \nabout 3.5 million. That is where over half of this dividend exclusion \nbenefit would go. By the way, only about a quarter of all seniors would \nreceive any benefit.\n  To say this is going to somehow vastly improve the position of \nseniors in America is just a gross overstatement. I wish to revert back \nto comments I made earlier. The vast majority of seniors depend on \nSocial Security and Medicare as the basis for protecting their economic \nsecurity and their well-being over a period of time, and we are doing \njust the opposite of what is necessary to protect Social Security and \nMedicare in the future years. It is depressing. That is what Chairman \nGreenspan talked about an hour ago in a hearing of the House Committee \non Aging: the risks to Social Security and Medicare if we do not change \nour economic policies and do something to straighten out our fiscal \npolicies in this country.\n\n  Let's consider the administration's claims about how cutting taxes on \ndividends will benefit millions of Americans. The truth is, only 22 \npercent of those with incomes under $100,000--this is the vast majority \nof income-tax-paying Americans--reported any dividends in the year \n2000, and the average tax cut from the dividend exclusion for those \nwith modest incomes of between $30,000 and $40,000--by the way, the \naverage income for individuals in America is something close to \n$40,000--those people are going to get a $29 tax cut associated with \nthis dividend exclusion.\n  There is a real credibility gap. We are exaggerating and distorting \nthe claims about the power of this tax cut. We are talking in terms \nthat really do not relate to the vast majority of Americans. I think \nthe word is starting to get out. There are serious questions in the \nminds of Americans that at a time when we have the potential for war \noffshore, and we certainly have threats of terrorism at home, why are \nwe focusing so much of our benefits of what we are doing with regard to \ntax proposals on such a narrow segment when the broad economy, that \nrising tide that would help everyone, is suffering and there is no \nstimulus going to it?\n  This is not the only area, by the way, where some of these claims, \nrelative to reality, are setting up a real pattern of a credibility gap \nfor the administration. The Secretary of Defense, on a number of \noccasions, argued the cost of war in Iraq might be $50 billion to $60 \nbillion, something in that neighborhood. But when the President's top \neconomic adviser last December--maybe it was in November--to his credit \nsuggested this figure was far too low and the actual cost could be as \nhigh as $200 billion, what happened? He got fired.\n  The dissidence between what is talked about in the public relative to \nwhat the analysis is by a lot of people who are trying to look at this \nin a serious-minded way so we understand what our needs are as a nation \nis troubling to a lot of folks and accentuates this credibility gap.\n  It is time for the administration to be more forthcoming about the \nreal costs of the impending war. The American people have a right to \nknow. I am glad this week we started to see a little\n\n[[Page S2879]]\n\nof that discussion, but even in that context, we need to consider the \nongoing costs of rebuilding Iraq in the aftermath of a war, presuming \nthat war goes the way we expect, presuming that it is relatively short \nin nature.\n  Even yesterday's estimate of $60 billion to $95 billion that we read \nabout in the papers included only 1 year of reconstruction costs--1 \nyear--when almost every expert I have heard come before the Foreign \nRelations Committee has talked about a decade, maybe a little bit more, \nbut a very long-term program. By the way, all we have to do is think \nabout Korea. We are still in Korea 53 years after a war on that \npeninsula.\n  The administration should play it straight with everyone about the \ncosts we are going to face, just as we ought to play it straight with \nregard to our budget, with regard to tax cuts. In my view, we need to \ntalk straight so we can build up the trust of the American people and \nthose who watch us around the world. Trust does matter. It is \nimportant. That is what we are asking corporate America to do, to clean \nup its act. That is why we want accounting statements that are true. I \nthink people expect to truly understand what the nature of the current \nsituation is as we go forward.\n  Actually there is a serious credibility problem that is causing us \nproblems abroad as well. I think whether or not we are believed by some \nof the populations abroad is reflected in how much opposition we have \nseen from a lot of countries, not just in their political establishment \nbut by literally millions of people who have shown up, probably most \nclearly in Great Britain, which has been our strongest supporter with \nregard to the Iraqi situation. The population is someplace else. Why is \nit we are not able to make our case clear?\n  I think part of this comes from credibility in how we frame these \nissues, how the information has been brought forward. All one has to do \nis look at what is going on in the economy to bring about some \ncredibility questions, when we get on to some of these issues of \nnational security.\n  In this context, let me return to the issue of the nomination of \nMiguel Estrada. As with many of the claims about the Bush budget, too \nmany of the claims from the other side on this issue simply lack \ncredibility. One of those--probably the most irritating--is the claim \nthat somehow those who oppose the Estrada nomination, or at least would \nlike to have information to prepare ourselves for a vote, are somehow \nanti-Hispanic.\n  Does that suggest that groups such as the Congressional Hispanic \nCaucus, the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed \nOfficials, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, the \nNational Puerto Rican Coalition are anti-Hispanic? I do not get it.\n  We are making a judgment about how the constitutional process is \nsupposed to work, not talking about whether or not someone is qualified \nor disqualified because of ethnic background. As far as I am concerned, \nthese kinds of demagogic attacks on Hispanic groups and those who show \ncommon cause with them lack credibility. The facts do not meet the \ncircumstance, and they are part of an attempt to intimidate opponents \nof Mr. Estrada's nomination to stay silent in fulfilling our rightful \nand responsible position of advice and consent in selecting judges for \nlifetime appointments to the courts of our country.\n  It is not going to work, and one reason it is not going to work is \nthe American people expect us to do our job--it is very simple--just as \nthey expect us to pay attention to the economy and do those things that \nwill get us flat off our back and get the economy moving. These things \nreally are common sense, in my view. We are spending weeks upon weeks \ndebating whether one individual is appropriate for a job because many \nof us do not understand what his views are, and he is unwilling to \nanswer questions, unwilling to have a job interview, and we are \nforgetting about the 2\\1/2\\ million private sector jobs that we have \nlost and the 8 million-plus people who are searching for a job. One job \nversus 8 million.\n  I have a very hard time understanding where those priorities come \nout. What is more important to the American people?\n  A couple of days ago, I asked the distinguished Democratic leader \nabout some conversations he had with the Governors who have been around \ntown from both sides of the aisle. We have all met with them. We have \nsympathized with some of their needs. I asked if one single Governor \nlobbied the leader about the Estrada nomination, either to move it on \nor take it off, or what is happening. Not a single one spoke to the \ndistinguished leader about that nomination.\n  It should not surprise anyone that our Nation's Governors are more \nconcerned about the economy and the terrible fiscal crisis they face, \nand here we are talking about this one individual who has been \nnominated for this one seat on the Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia.\n\n  I know from my conversations with people in New Jersey that they feel \nthe same way, and I am sure Americans across America agree. Why is the \nSenate spending all this time worrying about this one job--I do not get \nit--while we ignore the millions of Americans who have lost their jobs? \nWe see the consumer confidence falling off the charts. We see our stock \nmarket reeling. We see the dollar declining. We are not paying \nattention to the real things that people are concerned about that make \na difference to their lives, their kids' lives, their families' lives. \nThis Estrada nomination is not the priority of the American people, and \nI do not think it is the priority of my Democratic colleagues.\n  In a moment, I am going to make a unanimous consent request that we \nat long last make the economy our top priority. I am going to ask that \nat least for now we move off the Estrada nomination, as we have done \nfor other concerns--we have passed the omnibus appropriations bill. We \nwere able to take up the child pornography issue this week. We ought to \nfocus on our economy.\n  The bill for which I will ask unanimous consent was proposed by the \ndistinguished Democratic leader. It includes, among other things, \nmiddle-class tax cuts, aid to the States, an expansion of benefits for \nunemployed Americans, those 100,000 people a week who are dropping off \nthe unemployment rolls right now, and establish rules to restore long-\nterm fiscal discipline and health in our economy.\n  I recognize my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are not \nlikely to agree to this proposal, but as Democrats continue to \nemphasize the importance of dealing with our economy, I hope someone on \nthe other side will begin to question the decision to spend days upon \ndays and weeks upon weeks on the nomination of this one individual. I \nhope they will come to appreciate that there is little time to waste \nwhen it comes to boosting our economy and taking care of America's \nfamilies and getting on to the priority of creating jobs for Americans. \nI hope they will adapt their priorities, the priorities of the Senate, \nto those of the American people, which is jobs and economic security.\n\n\n                       Unanimous Consent Request\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending nomination be set aside and \nthat the Senate take up and begin debate on Calendar No. 21, S. 414, a \nbill to provide an immediate stimulus to our Nation's economy.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Reserving the right to object, the way to resolve the \nnomination is to schedule an up-or-down vote.\n  I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The objection is heard.\n  The Senator from New Jersey has the floor.\n  Mr. CORZINE. With full expectation and understanding of the position, \nI am disappointed with the objection that has been raised, but I am not \nsurprised. We have a critical need to get focused on our economy in \nthis country. The needs of the American people are not being addressed. \nIt is not because we are having this debate. We could move off this \ndebate and move to the economy today, then come back to it like we did \nwith regard to the omnibus appropriations.\n  The American people should know there are proposals on the table that \nwould stimulate this economy and get it moving, instead of seeing \nunemployment rates skyrocket, instead of seeing deficits as far as the \neye can see being\n\n[[Page S2880]]\n\nput in place, with no attention being drawn to them, without dealing \nwith the core things that matter in families' lives, in real people's \nlives. We could do that and still come back to this and have a full \nconstitutional and responsible debate about what is needed to review a \ncandidate and get on with the real needs facing our country.\n  I find it very difficult to understand where we are with regard to a \nlot of these priorities at this point in time, and I hope we will see \nthe light before we have to go further with more of these serious \nproblems that our American families face with their economic security.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, it is my pleasure today to come before the \nSenate to lend my support to a man of tremendous character and \nextraordinary legal credentials, Mr. Miguel Estrada. We have heard a \nlot about this nominee. We have heard a lot about why we should be \nfocusing, why we shouldn't. As I discussed before, I would like to see \nus get on to things like the economy, like the budget. The simplest way \nto do that is to have an up-or-down vote on Miguel Estrada.\n  I will share a few facts about Mr. Estrada and the importance of the \nnomination to our legal system. Mr. Estrada is an American success \nstory. He came to this country at the age of 17 as an immigrant from \nHonduras, speaking very little English. He overcame amazing obstacles \nto rise to the top of the legal profession. After graduating magna cum \nlaude from Harvard Law School, Miguel became a law clerk to the Supreme \nCourt Justice Anthony Kennedy. Since that time, he served as a Federal \nprosecutor in New York and Assistant Solicitor General of the United \nStates for 1 year in the Bush Administration and 4 years in the Clinton \nadministration. He was handed nothing, and his achievements are the \nproduct of hard work, perseverance, and a commitment to education. He \nis actually living the American dream.\n  Among other accomplishments, Mr. Estrada has argued 15 cases before \nthe Supreme Court of the United States, including one case in which he \nrepresented a death row inmate pro bono. The American Bar Association \nunanimously rated Mr. Estrada as well qualified for the DC Circuit. \nThis is the ABA's highest possible rating, and the rating typically \nused as the gold standard for judicial nominees in the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, especially on the Democrat side.\n  Mr. Estrada served as a member of the Solicitor General's Office in \nboth the Bush and Clinton administrations. He is enthusiastically \nsupported by both President Bush and President Clinton. The long list \nof Hispanic groups backing Miguel Estrada's nomination includes the \nLeague of United Latin American Citizens, the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of \nCommerce, the Latino Coalition, the Hispanic Bar Association, and the \nNational Association of Small Disadvantaged Businesses.\n  Sadly, Mr. Estrada's extraordinary accomplishments and his desire to \nserve our country have not been enough to protect him from the \nbaseless, vicious, and partisan attacks he has endured through this \nprocess. Now is not the time to play partisan games with the United \nStates judicial system. America is facing a judicial vacancy crisis in \nour Federal courts. The U.S. Courts of Appeals are currently 15 percent \nvacant, with 25 vacancies out of 167 authorized seats. The DC court, \nwhich is the court we are trying to get Miguel Estrada onto, has four \nvacancies on a 12-judge court.\n  Adding to this crisis, caseloads in the Federal courts continue to \ngrow dramatically. Filings in the Federal appeals court reached an all-\ntime high last year. The Chief Justice recently warned that the current \nnumber of vacancies, combined with the rising caseloads, threatens the \nproper functioning of the Federal courts. He has asked the Senate to \nprovide every nominee with a prompt up-or-down vote.\n  Chief Rehnquist is right. Every judicial nominee deserves a prompt \nhearing and a chance at an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor. This \nnominee is not being assessed by the traditional standards of quality \nor by his ability to follow the law as a judge. There is no question \nthat this nomination is being delayed and possibly blocked because of a \ndistorted analysis of his qualifications, policies, and personal views. \nMy colleagues on the other side of the aisle are blocking this \nnomination simply because he is President Bush's nominee. This is a \ndetriment to the integrity of this body. It is unfair to the nominee. \nAnd it is unfair to the American people.\n\n  I am asking my colleagues in the Senate today to do what we were \nelected to do, to allow this body to work its will, and to give Mr. \nEstrada the up-or-down vote he deserves. I add that the precedent we \nare setting, this 60-vote threshold for circuit court nominees, is a \ndangerous precedent. Right now the Republicans are in the majority and \nwe have the Presidency. At some point the Democrats are going to be \nback in the majority. At some point the Democrats are going to hold the \nPresidency again. Paybacks are very ugly. But make no mistake about it, \nwith the precedent being set here, unless this can be worked out, those \npaybacks will come back to haunt the other side of the aisle.\n  It is vitally important we work this out for the health of the \njudiciary in this country. It should not become a political tool to be \nbandied about just because somebody thinks that somebody may have a \nparticular ideology.\n  We realize that having a Republican Hispanic on the DC Circuit Court \nof Appeals is something the other side does not like.\n  But just because they don't like the politics of that does not mean \nthat they should object to him getting on the court. He deserves this. \nHe is qualified for it. He has the integrity to carry it out. And we, \nas a body, should give this man an up-or-down vote. If we give him an \nup-or-down vote he will be confirmed by the Senate.\n  I believe it is our constitutional duty to give him an up-or-down \nvote. He has had all the hearings he needs to have. We have been doing \nthis for almost 2 years now. We need to give this well-qualified \ncandidate the vote he deserves.\n  I want to raise a couple of points. The Senator from New Jersey was \ntalking about the economy. He says we have to get on the economy. I \nagree, we need to take care of the economy. I have some proposals. The \nPresident has some proposals. There are going to be other Senators who \nwill have proposals to try to stimulate the economy. The Senator from \nNew Jersey indicated he doesn't think what the President is doing is \ngoing to have enough of an impact. I have a proposal that actually, the \nfirst year alone, according to the Joint Tax Committee, will bring $135 \nbillion worth of investment into this country. I hope the other side of \nthe aisle is going to join us in that. That is significant even in the \nsize economy that we have.\n  What the President has laid out as part of his plan--I don't agree \nwith all of it, but there are some good things in it. He has laid out a \nplan, not only for this year but for solid growth and, in future years, \nto have good, solid, long-term fiscal policy and long-term growth.\n  I agree with some of the things the other side of the aisle is \ntalking about with respect to budget deficits. We do have a problem in \nthe outyears with budget deficits. But if we do not fix the economy, we \nknow we will never fix the deficits. We will continue to go further and \nfurther into debt. That is why it is critical for us to fix the \neconomy, so we produce more tax revenues so we don't have these huge \ndeficits and threats to Medicare and threats to Social Security and \nthreats to our defense spending in the future.\n  We have proven here in Washington, DC, we can't cut spending. We can \nmaybe slow down the rate of growth sometimes, but we can't cut \nspending. As Ronald Reagan talked about--I don't remember the exact \nquote, but as he said in the early 1980s: The best way to eternal life \nis to become a Federal agency or department in Washington. He said that \nbecause he realized once a program starts, it develops a constituency \nand it is impossible to cut it. So I believe if the other side is \nconcerned\n\n[[Page S2881]]\n\nabout the deficit, they should join some of us on this side of the \naisle and start cutting out some of the waste and overspending in \ncertain parts of our Government.\n  Having said that, let me conclude by saying let's have an up-or-down \nvote on Miguel Estrada so we can get on to some of the other important \nissues. Make no mistake about it, though; the judiciary and this part \nof what we do is a very important part of our role as Senators in \nfulfilling our obligation, our oath of obligation to defend and support \nthe Constitution. We can get on to other things. The budget was not \nenacted last year. For the first time since 1974 we did not have a \nbudget. Because of that, we ended up with some serious problems last \nyear. The appropriations bills didn't get finished until just a couple \nof weeks ago.\n  We are asking the other side to not continue to obstruct the will and \nthe work of this body, to join us, have an up-or-down vote, let the \nSenate work its will on this nomination so we can get on to other \nimportant business of the country. We have a lot of things to do. Let's \njoin together. Let's work across the aisle. Let's join hands. There are \na lot of good things we can do for the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise to express my great dismay at the \npolicy of the President of the United States that he seems to be \nattempting to impose on the Senate, which would require each and every \none of us in this body to betray the Constitution, to betray our oath \nof office, and to ignore the constitutional mandate that we give \nmeaningful advice and consent on judicial nominees coming before this \nbody.\n  I will never betray the Constitution and my oath. I don't care \nwhether we have to be here night after night. I am not going to go down \nthat road. I speak as a Senator who has voted in favor of somewhere in \nthe range of 100 judicial nominees that President Bush has sent to this \nbody, virtually all conservative Republicans. I wish it were different. \nI wish there were more progressive judges before us. But I understand \nthe President's prerogative, and I respect his right to nominate \nwhomever he may wish.\n  But this nomination before us is unprecedented. It is not only a \nmatter of Mr. Estrada, it is a matter of the sanctity of our \nConstitution. It goes to the very oath of office we have taken. It \nwould make a travesty of this body and of the Constitution for us to do \notherwise than to object to the manner in which this particular nominee \nhas been presented to the Senate.\n  The other nominees who have come before this body--for whom I have \nvoted over and over again, somewhere in the range of 100 already--we at \nleast knew what was their legal philosophy. They tended to be \nconservative Republicans and that is the President's prerogative and I \nvoted for them, but they had either been Federal judges or State \njudges, allowing us to look at their rulings in the past, or they had \nbeen legal scholars with a significant body of work that allowed us to \nview what the inner workings of their minds were and allowed us to \ndetermine whether they were, in fact, within the mainstream of American \njurisprudential thought. This nominee stands unique. The precedent \nwould be catastrophic to our Republic if we start, for the first time \never, to approve secret judges, stealth judges, judges who have no \nrecord and who will disclose no record to the Senate.\n  We have no way of knowing what this individual's legal philosophy \nmight be. We have reason to believe he is undoubtedly a capable lawyer, \nin terms of his technical skills as a Solicitor, but we have no idea \nwhere he stands otherwise. The question is not whether we will have \nHispanic Republican judges on the District of Columbia Court of \nAppeals. That is irrelevant. I voted repeatedly, as have my colleagues \non my side of the aisle, for Hispanic judges and other high officials \nin our Government. I am proud to have played a role in supporting our \nHispanic colleagues in issue after issue, and position after position. \nBut this, this is a sham. This is a travesty. I believe any Senator who \nthinks seriously about his oath and reads the Constitution, the \nobligation--not the right but the obligation of the Senate to provide \nadvice and consent on these offices is a profoundly important role.\n  It is one thing to approve or not approve Cabinet appointees and \nother advisers to the President; they come and they go. It is a serious \nmatter, but at least there is not a lifelong appointment involved. In \nthis case, we have a lifetime appointment to the second highest court \nin the land. What is worse, if we submit to this failure to abide by \nour constitutional obligations to make a meaningful decision about \nadvice and consent, we will have opened the floodgate because it will \nbecome apparent to this President that the strategy to use from here on \nout is to continue to find individuals who have no track record, who \nmay have a secret ideological agenda, and to send them one after \nanother through the Senate to be rubberstamped by this institution. \nThat is not acceptable. This is a matter of enormous importance.\n  These individuals, and this particular individual about whom we are \ndebating today, if confirmed, will likely serve on this bench for the \nrest of our lifetimes, for many of us in this body. President Bush may \ncome and he may go, but these appointments will last a lifetime.\n  So it is with enormous concern that I rise to express my opposition \nto this strategy because that is what this is about. It is about a \nstrategy. It is not about whether a Hispanic Republican should be on \nthe bench. It is not about whether a conservative should be on the \nbench, so long as they fall within the mainstream of American juris \nprudential thought. The question is, Should this Senate be allowed any \nidea about this individual's ideology, about his legal \nphilosophy? There we know nothing. We would be surrendering our \nconstitutional prerogatives and our constitutional obligations were we \nto respond any other way than we have attempted to do on this side. \nObviously, we can move on to other agenda items, whether it be \nstimulating the economy, education, health care, or what have you. All \nthat is required is for leadership of our colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle in support of the President to either withdraw this \nnominee or to have him respond to reasonable questions about his \nphilosophy. There is no effort here to require this individual to \nanswer questions that have not been put to other judges. The question \nis not his response to specific items before the Court. It would be \ninappropriate to ask those kinds of questions. But this is astonishing. \nThis is stonewalling. That is what this is. It is unacceptable.\n\n  Again, over 100 judges that President Bush has nominated have been \nconfirmed by this body, and most have gone through with my support. \nMost of them were conservative Republican judges. That is fine. But \nthis is different. I hope the American public understands the profound \nconsequences that would flow from our surrendering of our \nconstitutional obligation to at least make meaningful decisions about \nwhether to confirm a particular nominee.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. President, I also want to express my great frustration and my \ngreat sadness in many ways over priorities that President Bush has \nrecently exhibited relative to our young men and women in uniform and \nthe likely war we are about to embark upon.\n  Americans all across this country, including my wife and myself, are \nabout to send our finest young men and young women into harm's way in \nthe Iraq region. We can debate the wisdom of that. But that is the \nreality. I think we all see this coming. We can take great pride in \nthese men and women in uniform, the courage they show, and their \ncommitment to America. They are asking for so little and, yet, they are \nwilling to do whatever is required of our American military. They are \nthe greatest military ever fielded in terms of the sophistication of \ntechnology they deal with and the requirements they meet.\n  But while we put this military together and send them on their way \nwith flags flying and salutes and the prayers of all of us, the \nPresident simultaneously has recommended now in his 2004 budget \nrecommendation that we cut impact aid education funding for the \nchildren of these very troops who we are sending into war. Is it \nbecause we can't afford to finance quality\n\n[[Page S2882]]\n\neducation of the children of our military? No. President Bush also, as \nwe recall, has called for over $100 billion of tax cuts for primarily \nthe very wealthiest of Americans--primarily on Wall Street. So rather \nthan asking America's wealthiest families to sacrifice at a time of \nwar, the request seems to be of the middle class and the working \nfamily, send your sons and daughters into combat, and we will ask \nAmerica's wealthiest no sacrifice whatever. In fact, we will cut their \ntaxes and we will come back to these families who are sending their \nsons and daughters into combat and tell them we can't afford to educate \nyour kids while you are gone. And these spouses remain. The Guard and \nReserve and active-duty spouses in South Dakota and across every State \nin our land are worried to death about the prospects of their loved \nones, but proud, and upholding America's ideals as they go into heaven \nknows what kind of combat circumstance they will face with weapons of \nmass destruction arrayed against them. We hope whatever combat occurs \nwill be swift and decisive and conclude positively for us. But \nobviously we all know there is great risk for everyone's sons and \ndaughters who go into circumstances such as this.\n\n  Is it asking too much of President Bush to at least not cut the \neducation funding for the children who are left behind? Is that asking \ntoo much? It says a lot about the priorities of this administration, \nthat we would array the world's finest military on the one hand, \nprovide tax relief for the world's wealthiest people on the other hand, \nand simultaneously beg poverty when it comes to the schools for the \nchildren of our military personnel. Shame on the President. Shame on \nthe President for these kinds of priorities. America deserves better. \nOur fighting men and women deserve better than this. Fiscal \nresponsibility is not the issue. Priority is the issue.\n  Then when our military personnel come home again, what do they find \nbut the Veterans Administration underfunded yet again. The \nadministration is asking for higher copayments, higher deductibles, and \ndenies hundreds of thousands of our veterans access to VA health care \nthey were promised. What kind of signal does that send? How are you \ngoing to continue to attract the very best of America's young men and \nwomen to wear our Nation's uniform when they find that while we do that \nand pat them on their back and salute them and send them onto combat--4 \nyears, 5 years--at the same time we are not going to take care of their \nkids. When they come home, we are not going to take care of their \nhealth care obligations as we promised we would.\n  It is long overdue that some of these priorities be met off the top \nof the barrel, rather than the bottom of the barrel and the crumbs that \nare left over half doing other things.\n  I don't know how we can expect in the day and age of a voluntary \nmilitary to continue to attract the best and the brightest of our young \npeople who deal with the sophisticated kinds of technology they are \nrequested to do now, if they know simultaneously--and they increasingly \ndo--that once they leave home and once they come back, they will in too \nmany cases be treated shabbily by our government, which is too busy \nstuffing its pockets with cash rather than meeting its obligations to \nthose who are laying their lives literally on the line for America's \nfreedom and American values.\n  As a member of the Senate Budget Committee, today I also expressed \nalarm at recent news reports of still larger than expected Federal \nbudget deficits, after an unprecedented 4 years in a row of budget \nsurpluses during the final 4 years of the past Clinton administration--\nthe years in which we were in the black. We were paying down on the \naccumulated national debt. We were not borrowing from the Social \nSecurity trust fund. We now find the bipartisan Congressional Budget \nOffice telling us this red ink will be an astonishing $199 billion. As \nrecently as 2001, we had a surplus of $127 billion.\n  Mr. President, in 2001--2 years ago--we had a surplus of $127 \nbillion, which followed 3 preceding surplus years in the black. That \nwas responsible budgeting. Some experts now are saying that the 2004 \ndeficit is going to break all records, at over $350 billion, if war \nexpenses and the cost of the Bush tax policies are assumed.\n  The budget surplus, the paying down of the national debt, and the \npreservation of the Social Security trust funds--which was what we all \nhad when this administration commenced--have all gone away. The days of \nnot borrowing from the Social Security trust fund are over. We are \nback. And we are told by the White House budget people at OMB that we \nwill continue to borrow under the President's budget and tax plans out \nof the Social Security trust fund for the remainder of the decade.\n  The paying down of the national debt has gone away. The ability to \navoid continued high debt service so we can redirect those dollars, \ninstead, to education, to health care, to our veterans, to our \nmilitary, whatever it might be, has all gone away, because we are going \nto increasingly pay debt service under the President's budget plan.\n  The CBO indicates that our Nation will not see a budget surplus again \nuntil 2007, and then only if there are no war expenses, no additional \ntax cuts, and no Medicare prescription drug legislation. We all know \nthat is not going to happen. We are going to have war expenses. We do \nnot know what they will be. We will pay whatever it takes to make sure \nour men and women in uniform are supported. Whatever the cost is, we \nwill pay it. But the war and the follow-on occupation is likely to cost \nat least $100 billion.\n  We know the President has tax cut after tax cut lined up primarily \nfor his wealthiest contributors. And then we know, as well, that we \nneed to move on to prescription drug legislation that is long overdue. \nWe are the only major democratic society in the world that does not \nhave some kind of prescription drug or national health care strategy.\n  So what we find here is President Bush's proposal to borrow yet \nanother $1 trillion. Now we are not even talking ``B,'' we are talking \nthe ``T'' word. Mr. President, $1 trillion over the coming decade in \norder to finance Wall Street tax breaks has to be approached with great \ncaution. This seems, to me, to be part of an agenda designed to make it \nimpossible to have strong Federal funding for education, veterans, \nagriculture, and seniors for generations to come.\n  This overall strategy strikes me as one that we saw a glimmer of in \nthe 1980s; and that is, a strategy designed to primarily break the \nFederal Government, to deny all resources. Because when our friends in \nthe far political right try to advance the cause of eliminating \nMedicare, downsizing Social Security, downsizing or eliminating \nveterans health care, withdrawing from supporting our schools, getting \nout of the afterschool and daycare programs, getting away from rural \nelectricity and rural development programs--when they try to do that, \nthey are always met with resistance from the American people, Democrats \nand Republicans alike.\n  They have never been able to win that war because Americans want that \nkind of partnership--that constructive partnership--between Washington \nand our communities and our States. So in a very cynical tactic, what \nhas been discovered here is that while they cannot win the war on the \nmerits of eliminating that partnership, they can try to break the \nGovernment, to deny it the revenue it needs, so that they can come to \nthe American public and say: Well, we would love to support \nthose afterschool programs, we would love to have more police on the \nbeat, we would love to help our fire departments, and we would love to \nmake sure all our young people could afford to go to college or \ntechnical programs, but, oh, we are broke; we don't have the money.\n\n  That is apparently how some people hope this debate will conclude. \nThey cannot win on the merits of the policy, but what they can try to \ndo is come up with a tax policy that enriches the wealthiest \ncontributors while simultaneously making it increasingly impossible for \nthis Federal Government to live up to its obligations to its people and \nto build a stronger society, offering more opportunity for every young \nAmerican--Black, Hispanic, Native American, Caucasian, whoever they \nmight be.\n  I feel great frustration. I hope the American public understands what \nreally is going on here relative to the President's budget-and-tax \nagenda. It is a radical agenda. If you don't believe\n\n[[Page S2883]]\n\nit is a radical agenda, look at what this President is willing to do, \neven to the children of our men and women in uniform. It is appalling.\n  Look at what the President is willing to do to try to stack the \ncourt, possibly with ideologues, far outside the mainstream of American \njurisprudential thought, to bend the Constitution, to break the \nConstitution, by bringing nominees to this body who will not share with \nus their judicial thoughts, who have no scholarly writings, who have no \npast judicial decisions to look to. They are stealth judges, secret \njudges.\n  We cannot allow that to stand. We cannot allow that to happen in our \nNation. Our country has been a beacon of democracy, a beacon of \nopenness, a beacon of opportunity. We cannot walk away from that. The \nConstitution has been the bulwark of making sure that those remain our \nideals. For this body to walk away, and to allow for a rubberstamp \nprocess to go on, that any individual can come before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee and the full Senate without the Senate or the \ncommittee having any idea who he is or what his agenda really is would \nbe a travesty. It is completely unacceptable.\n  So, again, I have been proud to work in a bipartisan manner on the \nconfirmation of roughly 100 judges--virtually all conservative \nRepublican judges. But I draw the line here. This is unprecedented, and \nthe constitutional ramifications of what would occur and what precedent \nwould be set would be devastating to this Nation. It would make a \nmockery of our oath, a mockery of the Constitution, for this body to do \nanything other than to insist that this nominee share with the body his \nphilosophy relative to legal issues, his jurisprudence.\n  So I hope we can soon either get to the bottom of who this individual \nis or move on to other issues that are pressing before our Republic--\nranging from health care, education, support of our men and women in \nuniform. There is much we need to be doing.\n  Frankly, there is very little pending on the floor at this time, but \nthere is much that ultimately we need to be doing. I hope, in the \ncontext of taking on these additional issues, we will do it with fiscal \nresponsibility, which not only involves not succumbing to the \ntemptation to sink our country deeper and deeper and deeper into red \nink as far as the eye can see, but also involves correcting President \nBush's budget priorities to the degree that we take care of these kids \nof our military men and women, that we resist the President's \ntemptation to take money away from these schoolhouses in order to give \nit to Wall Street and to wealthy contributors for political campaigns.\n  That isn't what we are here for. Those aren't the people we \nrepresent. Those aren't the ideals we represent. And this Nation \ndeserves better.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                                Medicaid\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to address two or three issues \nthis afternoon. I very much appreciate the chance to do so. First, let \nme begin with a subject that is extremely important to my State and to \nmany of our States. That is Medicaid. I want to address two different \nproposals there. First, there is a proposal the administration has made \nrelated to Medicaid.\n  We don't have a written proposal as yet, but we do have various \nstatements from Secretary Thompson. We had a hearing this morning in \nthe Finance Committee that the Presiding Officer attended, as did I. We \nhave had testimony and oral statements and very brief descriptions, but \nwe do not have a written proposal or even a detailed outline of what \nmight be proposed by the administration. But in what they are \nproposing, I find some real serious concerns.\n  The other proposal I want to discuss is one I am working on with \nCongressman Dingell--we hope to introduce it probably early next week--\nentitled ``Saving Our States.'' I will try to describe a little bit \neach of these.\n  The Nation's Governors have been here this week. I had the good \nfortune to speak to them last Sunday at one of their subcommittee \nmeetings on human resources about Medicaid. It is clear that they are \nunder severe stress at this point fiscally. It is estimated the States \nare facing nearly a $30 billion shortfall this year and an $80 billion \nshortfall in fiscal year 2004. In my view, it is important that the \nFederal Government respond to that. We cannot just ignore the fact that \na growing number of our citizens are uninsured and that more and more \npeople are being dropped from the Medicaid Program and the SCHIP \nprogram.\n  The Federal Government needs to fundamentally reassess its own role \nin providing health care and reassess its relationship to the States in \nthis regard. As I indicated, I am working with Congressman Dingell to \nprepare legislation to do just that.\n  Let me talk first about the administration's proposal in very broad \nterms, as I understand it. It contains two parts. One is a set of \nreforms where, as the Secretary very eloquently described, it would \nallow States to adopt the best practices. It would allow States to put \nmore emphasis on preventive care for seniors. It would allow States to \nhave the flexibility they need to meet their particular needs. All of \nthat is, of course, very good public policy, at least as stated in its \nmost general form.\n  As a general matter, I certainly believe the President and the \nSecretary will find strong support in Congress for that effort. But the \nsecond part of their proposal is the one that gives me concern. That is \nthe restructuring of the financing. This part is much more difficult. \nWhat this does is basically say that for optional groups and for \noptional services--and that is an interesting definition as to what is \noptional; you will find that most of the services and groups currently \ncovered by Medicaid turn out to be optional, and most of the funding \nthat is currently spent on Medicaid turns out to be funding for \noptional groups and optional services--States would have the ability to \nget extra money for the first 7 years if they agreed that they would \nessentially live by a capped amount of Federal funding from now on. It \nwould be about what they were getting in the year 2000 plus a 9-percent \nincrease per year. That is the basic proposal.\n  In addition to that, they are saying not only are we going to give \nthe States a little extra money, we will reduce the amount of growth in \nthat portion that the State in fact provides. So this is going to save \nmoney for the Federal Government. It will save money for the States.\n  The one thing that is not discussed and that I have great concern \nabout is the effect on the people who are supposed to be getting the \nhealth care services under this program; that is, the low-income \nchildren and the seniors.\n  When you look at these definitions, optional groups, which seniors \nwould you think might be in an optional group? Well, under the \ndefinition I have been given, if your income is over 74 percent of the \nFederal poverty rate, you are in an optional group. That means if your \nincome gets anywhere up over about $7,500 or $8,000 per year, somewhere \nin that range--and I can get the exact figure--you are in an optional \ngroup. That means the total resources going to assist in your health \ncare are being capped and are not going to grow as the population \nneeding those services grows, are not going to grow as the usage of \nthose services grows, are not going to grow as the health care cost of \nthose services grows. We all know that there is growth in all three of \nthose areas. That concerns me greatly.\n  The other part of this which I can understand and makes it somewhat \nattractive to Governors, some of the Governors who were here this week, \nis that the Federal proposal says, if you agree to this, not only do \nyou get a little extra Federal money but the amount of State money that \nyou are going to have to put in is also going to be capped. The growth \nin that is also going to be capped. In other words, we will be able to \nsave you money in your State budget.\n  This is great for the States; it is great for the Federal Government. \nThe problem is that the health care services available to low-income \nchildren and to seniors in our society are going to be reduced and \nreduced very substantially over the next 10 years under this proposal. \nSo that has been my concern.\n  Allow me to cite a couple of quotations from people who have spent\n\n[[Page S2884]]\n\na lot of time studying this. The AARP executive director and CEO, Bill \nNovelli, has said, in relation to the administration's proposal:\n\n       This proposal handcuffs states because it leaves people \n     more vulnerable in future years as states struggle to meet \n     increased needs with decreased dollars.\n\n  Another quote, from the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities:\n\n       The Bush Administration proposal fails people with \n     disabilities and dishonors the nation's commitment to its \n     residents--it is not in the national interest. . . .What the \n     Medicaid program calls ``optional'' services are, in reality, \n     mandatory disability services for the children and adults who \n     need them. These services often are not only life-saving, but \n     also the key to a positive quality of life--something \n     everyone in our nation deserves.\n\n  I believe strongly that the Federal Government at this particular \ntime in our Nation's history should not be stepping away from its \ncommitment to seniors, to people with disabilities, and to low-income \nchildren. It should not be leaving the States with the primary \nresponsibility for dealing with growth in the cost of the services to \nthese groups in the future.\n  The administration will point out that the proposal does provide more \nfunding up front to the States. The proposal is to give $12.7 billion \nmore over the first 7 years to help the States. But there is something \nof an element of bait and switch in that after the first 7 years, that \nadditional funding goes away.\n  Secretary Thompson noted in his press conference that is after he has \nleft his position, and I am sure it is after most of the Governors will \nhave left their positions and probably after many of us will have left \nthe Senate. That does not give us an adequate justification for putting \nin place a system that cuts funding for these vitally needed services \nin future years.\n  The administration points out that they are promising the block grant \nfor optional populations in a way that will increase at the same \npercentages that are projected in its budget. This is difficult to \nrespond to, frankly, until we see a written proposal. We need a written \nproposal from the administration. We do not have that as yet. We do not \nhave that on the Medicaid subject. We do not have that on Medicare \neither. And I hope those will be forthcoming soon because they are \nextremely vital programs for all of our States.\n\n  Let me also talk a little about the proposal that I have, along with \nCongressman Dingell, that we are going to introduce next week. And I \nwill go into more detail about it next week.\n  Our idea is that there are certain groups that receive health care \nservices under Medicaid, where the Federal Government needs to step up \nand pay the full cost of those services--or something very close to the \nfull cost. One such group is so-called dual eligibles. These are people \nwho are eligible for Medicare benefits, but are also low income enough \nthat they are eligible for Medicaid at the same time.\n  Current law says for those who are covered under the Medicaid law the \nStates pay the lion's share of that cost. We are saying the States \nshould not have to pay the lion's share of that cost. This is something \nwhere these folks have become eligible for Medicare. We should be \npaying 100 percent of that cost at the Federal level.\n  Another group the Federal Government should be underwriting the cost \nof providing services for are illegal immigrants who come to our health \ncare providers needing emergency attention. Here you can get into quite \na philosophical argument as to whether or not these services should be \nprovided. The reality is, if you are a doctor, if you are working in an \nemergency room and someone shows up who needs emergency care, you are \nobligated under your Hippocratic oath and the laws of decency, \nbasically, to provide that care, if you are able to do so. To turn a \nperson away because they do not have the right health insurance \ncoverage, or they cannot demonstrate to you their financial solvency, \nwhen their circumstance is critical, is just not the way we should do \nbusiness.\n  The question is, Once that person has come into that emergency room \nand asked for that emergency care, who should reimburse the hospital \nfor it? Who should pay the cost of that physician? At the current time, \nthe States are picking that up, or the counties are picking that up, or \nthe health care providers themselves are doing this on a pro bono \nbasis. The reality is the Federal Government should be responsible for \nthat, and we are proposing that in our legislation.\n  Another group, of course, is Native American citizens. We have a \ngreat many Native Americans in my home State. The Federal Government \nshould be stepping up to its responsibility to ensure that health care \nfor these individuals is provided. We propose that as part of our \nproposal for saving our States as well.\n  I will have another chance to talk this ``saving our States'' \nproposal when we introduce it early next week. I very much wanted to \nmake reference to it today and indicate my great concern about the \nproposal I understand the administration is about to present to us. The \ntruth is, the cost of providing health care is very high, and it is not \ngetting any cheaper. We need to budget that in and we need to \nacknowledge that and we need to recognize that as a matter of public \npolicy in this country, we should provide that basic care to seniors, \nto low-income children, to those who are disabled. The Medicaid Program \ndoes that. We need to keep the Medicaid Program sound and not undermine \nit by rationing back on the dollars we are willing to spend on those \nbasic services.\n\n\n                Southwest Regional Border Authority Act\n\n  Mr. President, let me also talk about a bill I introduced yesterday. \nThis is a bill entitled Southwest Regional Border Authority Act. We \noffered this same bill last May. I am very pleased this year I am \njoined by Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, and also Senator Barbara Boxer. \nThis legislation would create an economic development authority for the \nSouthwest border region that would be charged with awarding grants to \nborder communities in support of local economic development projects. \nThe need for a regional border authority is acute. The poverty rate in \nthe Southwest border region is over 20 percent, nearly double the \nnational average of 11.7 percent. The unemployment rate in Southwest \nborder counties can reach as high as six times the national \nunemployment rate. The per capita personal income in the region is \ngreatly below the national average. In many border counties, the per \ncapita personal income is less than 50 percent of the national average. \nThere is a lack of adequate access to capital that has made it \ndifficult for businesses to get started in this region.\n\n  In addition, the development of key infrastructures, such as water, \nwaste water, transportation, public health, and telecommunications--all \nof these areas of infrastructure need have failed to keep pace with the \npopulation explosion and the increase in commerce across our border \nwith Mexico.\n  Mr. President, the counties in the Southwest border region are among \nthe most economically distressed in the Nation. It should be noted that \nthere are only a few such regions of economic distress throughout the \ncountry. Virtually all of the other regions that face this same \neconomic distress are, in fact, served by regional economic development \ncommissions today. These commissions include the Appalachian Regional \nCommission, the Delta Regional Authority, the Denali Commission in \nAlaska, and the Northern Great Plains Regional Authority.\n  In order to address the needs of the border region in a similar \nfashion, we are proposing this Regional Economic Commission for the \nSouthwest border. The bill is based on four guiding principles.\n  First, it starts from the premise that people who live on the \nSouthwest border know best when it comes to making decisions as to how \nto improve their own communities.\n  Second, it employs a regional approach to economic development and \nencourages communities to work across county and State lines where \nappropriate. All too often in the past, the efforts to improve our \nregion have hit roadblocks as a result of poor coordination and \ncommunication between communities.\n  Third, it creates an independent agency, meaning it will be able to \nmake decisions that are in the best interest of the border communities, \nwithout being subject to the politics of Federal agencies.\n  Finally, it brings together representatives of the four Southwest \nborder States and the Federal Government as partners to work on \nimproving the\n\n[[Page S2885]]\n\nstandard of living for people living on the border.\n  This is not just another commission, and it is certainly not just \nanother grant program. I believe this Southwest regional border \nauthority not only will help leverage new private sector funding, it \nwill also help to better target the Federal funds that are available to \nthose projects that are most likely to produce results.\n  The legislation accomplishes this through a sensible mechanism of \ndevelopment planning. The purpose of the planning process is to ensure \nthat priorities are reflected in the projects funded by the authority. \nIt also is to provide flexibility to the authority to fund projects \nthat are regional in nature.\n  I think the process has various advantages, and there are great \nbenefits that can be derived from setting up this border authority. I \nbelieve very strongly this legislation is overdue. It is something that \nshould have happened several years ago. For too long, the needs of the \nSouthwest border have been ignored, overlooked, and underfunded.\n  I am confident the creation of a Southwest regional border authority \nnot only will call attention to the great needs that exist on the \nborder, but will help us to meet those needs. I urge my colleagues to \ngive attention to this legislation that we have introduced. I hope \nother colleagues will choose to support it. I hope we can have a \nhearing on it in the near future and move the legislation through the \nSenate and through the House to the President for signature.\n  Mr. President, let me say a few words about the Estrada nomination as \nwell. I know that is a subject of great concern to many on both sides \nof the aisle. I have taken some time in the last couple of days to \nreview the transcript of the testimony that Mr. Estrada gave in the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  I have been struck by his position, as stated numerous times in that \ntestimony, that he was not willing to share his views on any issue \nrelated to judicial philosophy or court decisions with the committee.\n  I was particularly struck by the discussion he had with our \ncolleague, Senator Schumer. Senator Schumer was asking about Mr. \nEstrada's earlier statement that he saw as part of his job working for \nJustice Kennedy recommending law clerks and asking them questions, of \ncourse, interviewing them before he made the recommendation.\n  Senator Schumer said:\n\n       Isn't it appropriate that you would ask those questions? \n     Isn't it also appropriate that we would be asking you some \n     questions to try to determine your views?\n\n  Mr. Estrada said in response to that question:\n\n       Questions that I asked in doing my job for Justice Kennedy \n     were intended to ascertain whether there were any strongly \n     felt views that would keep that person from being a good law \n     clerk to the Justice.\n\n  That is entirely appropriate, in my view, and a very well-stated \nposition. That, in my view, is the exact job we have to perform as we \nscreen and consider the various nominees for Federal court positions \nthat the President sends us. We need to determine whether they have any \nstrongly felt views that would keep them from being good members of the \nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia, good members of the \ndistrict court, or good members of the Supreme Court.\n  My own position is that I am willing, and have demonstrated many \ntimes on the Senate floor my willingness, to support conservative \nnominees to the court. I believe many of those people are making \nexcellent judges in our Federal court system. But I also want to be \nsure their views on issues that relate to their duties are mainstream, \nthat they are not extreme. The only way I know to carry out that \nresponsibility is to ask some questions to determine whether they have \nstrongly felt views, as Mr. Estrada said, that would keep them from \nbeing, as he said in the case he was referring to, a good law clerk to \nthe Justice.\n  In the Senate, when we are considering people for lifetime \nappointments to the Federal judiciary, we have a heavier responsibility \nto be sure there are no strongly held views that would keep these \nindividuals from being good judges in our Federal court system for the \nremainder of their lives. That is what I believe we should be trying to \ndo. I think that is what many members of the Judiciary Committee were \ntrying to do in the hearing that took place on Mr. Estrada.\n  His view was that he would not respond to questions that were put to \nhim about any such views, and he repeatedly said he did not think it \nwas appropriate for him to comment on any personal views he might have. \nSince, of course, he would not comment on his personal views, there is \nno way to determine whether any of them are extreme.\n  I do not think that is an adequate carrying out of responsibilities \nby the Judiciary Committee. I do not think it is an adequate carrying \nout of responsibilities by the Senate. And I think we do need more \ninformation. That has been my position. Before we move ahead with this \nnomination, we should get more information.\n  I hope the Judiciary Committee will consider reconvening a hearing, \nonce again providing the nominee with an opportunity to respond, as \nother nominees have traditionally responded. That is all we are asking, \nnot that he give us information others were not asked to give or others \ndid not give, but that he essentially provide basic information.\n  He may express some views with which I do not agree. That is fine. \nMany judges for whom I have voted also, I believe, expressed views with \nwhich I did not agree. At least I was confident their views were not \nextreme. At least I was confident their views were mainstream and that \nthey were within the mainstream as far as their conception of where the \nlaw is and where the law ought to go.\n  I hope very much we can get the additional information we have been \nasking for and can proceed to dispose of this nomination. That would be \nmy great hope. I do not know what the intent of the majority leader is \nat this point or the intent of the Judiciary Committee. I hope we can \nproceed in that manner.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, last evening, there was a lot of talk about \nwhether memos at the Solicitor General's Office had ever been made \npublic. I am going to talk about that, but I think we should put this \nwhole debate involving Miguel Estrada in a framework that people who \nare watching the debate who are not familiar with Senate procedure can \nbetter understand what is going on.\n  In effect, Miguel Estrada has asked his employer, the Federal \nGovernment, to give him a job to last for life. As with any job, one \nusually has to have an interview. In this instance, in addition to an \ninterview, you bring whatever papers you have, whether it is a resume \nor other documents that your employer may want to find out if you \nshould be hired. In the instance of Miguel Estrada, he simply has not \nfilled out the requisite papers, he has not answered the questions or \nsupplied the necessary information.\n  An employer in Nevada, whether a company that sold tires or a company \nthat sold food--it would not matter what it is--if somebody applied for \na job, they would have to answer the questions that employer asked and \ngive the requisite papers. In this instance, Democratic members of the \nJudiciary Committee believe he has not answered the questions. By \nreading the transcript, it is quite clear that is true.\n  But yesterday, the distinguished Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch, \nengaged in extensive discussion regarding the release of Solicitor \nGeneral memoranda. As everyone by this time knows, we have asked that \nMiguel Estrada release memos he wrote while he was an attorney in the \nSolicitor General's Office. The administration has refused to provide \nthese documents.\n  There are two basic charges raised by my distinguished colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle about these memoranda: First, the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee, Senator Hatch, has argued that \nwhen such\n\n[[Page S2886]]\n\nmemos were provided in the past, they were leaked.\n  My colleague argued that they have never, ever been given to anyone \non Capitol Hill.\n  Second, he qualified his remarks by saying to the extent memos had \nbeen provided, they were provided because there was some allegation of \nimproper behavior by the nominee in connection with the memo.\n  I will place in the Record a series of correspondence between the \nJudiciary Committee and the Justice Department from 1987 that \ndemonstrates in fact such documents were provided. This is only one \ninstance. These letters show that these memoranda were not leaked. They \nshow that they were in fact provided freely by the Justice Department.\n  In a letter dated August 10, 1987, then Judiciary Committee Chairman \nBiden set forth a request for several types of documents relating to \nthe nomination of Judge Bork to the Supreme Court. In the letter, \nSenator Biden requested four classes of Bork-related memos: He \nrequested those that related to the Watergate controversy; second, all \ndocuments generated or involving Solicitor General Bork relating to the \nconstitutionality, appropriateness, or use of the pocket veto; third, \nall documents generated to or involving then Solicitor General Bork \nregarding school desegregation; fourth, all documents generated to or \ninvolving then Solicitor General Bork in forming the U.S. position in a \nseries of specific cases.\n  These requests involved memoranda provided by attorneys in the \nSolicitor General's Office to the Solicitor General recommending such \nthings as whether to file amicus briefs in particular cases.\n  In this instance, what happened to Senator Biden's request? Well, in \nfact a letter came to him dated August 24 from then Republican \nAssistant Attorney General Bolton to Democratic Senator Joe Biden. In \nthat letter, the Justice Department declined to provide documents \nrelating to the Watergate controversy. This denial of documents was \nbased on executive privilege. The documents involved did not include \nBork but, rather, related to communications between and among close \nadvisers to the President and the President.\n  Yesterday, Senator Crapo made reference to the fact that some \ndocuments were not turned over to the committee during this time. While \nit is true that the Watergate documents were not turned over, and this \nis based on executive privilege, that does not affect our debate. \nSolicitor General memoranda from Estrada to his supervisors are not \ncovered by executive privilege. No one has ever claimed they are.\n  In 1987, however, the Justice Department did provide the other \ndocuments I described above which were requested in the Biden letter. \nIn these materials, the Justice Department noted in the letter: The \nvast majority of the documents that have been requested reflect or \ndisclose internal deliberations within the executive branch. We wish to \ncooperate to the fullest extent with the committee and to expedite \nJudge Bork's confirmation process. The letter concludes that the \ndocuments referred to above would be provided. The letter confirms the \nnature and circumstances under which the Solicitor General memoranda \nwere provided to the Judiciary Committee during Bork's hearings.\n  So what about the argument that to the extent memoranda have been \nprovided, they were only provided when the request alleged misconduct \nor malfeasance on the part of the nominee or other attorneys involved \nin the matter? This simply is not true.\n  I have a list of internal attorney memoranda provided during the \nBork, Reynolds, and Rehnquist nominations. These documents, some of \nwhich are from the Solicitor's Office, others from other parts of the \nJustice Department, were made public and given to Senator Biden, and in \nother instances given to others. For example, all documents related to \nschool desegregation between 1969 and 1977 relating to Bork in any way, \nthere was no allegation of misconduct; documents related to Halpren v. \nKissinger, no allegation of misconduct.\n  I have about 14 of these that were made a part of proceedings before \nthe Senate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this list be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       All documents related to school desegregation between 1969 \n     and 1977 relating to Bork in any way (disclosure included, \n     among others, the SG Office memos about Vorcheimer v. \n     Philadelphia, known as ``the Easterbrook memo''; United \n     States v. Omaha; United States v.

Kissinger (civil suit for \n     4th Amendment violations for wiretapping): No allegation of \n     misconduct or malfeasance by the nominee.\n       Memos about whether to file an amicus brief in Hishon v. \n     King & Spaulding (gender discrimination at a law firm): No \n     allegation of misconduct or malfeasance by the nominee or \n     anyone else at the Justice Department.\n       Memos regarding Wallace v.

Mr. President, this outlines seven pages of documents he \nwants and certain guidelines that would be followed so that the \nAttorney General's Office would be protected.\n  In addition, I ask unanimous consent that a letter dated August 24 of \nthat same year to Joseph R. Biden from Mr. Bolton, the Assistant \nAttorney General, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Legislative and \n           Intergovernmental Affairs,\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr.\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Biden: This responds further to your August \n     10th letter requesting certain documents relating to the \n     nomination of Judge Robert Bork to the Supreme Court. \n     Specifically, this sets forth the status of our search for \n     responsive documents and the methods and scope of review by \n     the Committee.\n       As we have previously informed you in our letter of August \n     18, the search for requested documents has required massive \n     expenditures of resources and time by the Executive Branch. \n     We have nonetheless, with a few exceptions discussed below, \n     completed a thorough review of all sources referenced in your \n     request that were in any way reasonably likely to produce \n     potentially responsive documents. The results of this effort \n     are as follows:\n       In response to your requests numbered 1-3, we have \n     conducted an extensive search for documents generated during \n     the period 1972-1974 and relating to the so-called Watergate \n     affair. We have followed the same procedure, in response to \n     request number 4, for all documents relating to consideration \n     of Robert Bork for the Supreme Court by President Nixon or \n     his subordinates. We have completed our search of relevant \n     Department of Justice and White House files for documents \n     responsive to these requests. The Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation also has completed its search for responsive \n     documents, focusing on the period October-December 1973 and \n     on references to Robert Bork generally.\n       Most of the documents responsive to requests numbered 1-4 \n     are in the possession of the National Archives and Records \n     Administration, which has custody of the Nixon Presidential \n     materials and the files of the Watergate Special Prosecution \n     Force. The Archives staff supervised and participated in the \n     search of the opened files of the Nixon Presidential \n     materials and the files of the Watergate Special Prosecution \n     Force, which was directed to those files which the Archives \n     staff deemed reasonably likely to contain potentially \n     responsive documents.\n       Pursuant to a request by this Department under 36 C.F.R. \n     1275, the Archives staff also examined relevant unopened \n     files of the Nixon Presidential materials, and, as required \n     under the pertinent regulations, submitted the responsive \n     documents thus located for review by counsel for former \n     President Nixon. Mr. Nixon's counsel, R. Stan Mortenson, \n     interposed no objection to release of those submitted \n     documents that (a) reference, directly or indirectly, Robert \n     Bork, or (b) were received by or disseminated to persons \n     outside the Nixon White House. Mr. Mortenson on behalf of Mr. \n     Nixon objected to production of the documents which are \n     described in the attached appendix. Mr. Mortenson represents \n     that these documents constitute purely internal \n     communications within the White House and contain no direct \n     or indirect reference to Robert Bork.\n       Mr. Mortenson also objected on the same grounds to \n     production of unopened portions of two documents produced in \n     incomplete form from the opened files of the Nixon \n     Presidential materials:\n       1. First page and redacted portion of fifth page of \n     handwritten note of John D. Ehrlichman dated December 11, \n     1972.\n       2. All pages other than the first page of memorandum from \n     Geoff Shepard to Ken Cole dated June 19, 1973.\n       Mr. James J. Hastings, Acting Director of the Nixon \n     Presidential Materials Project, has reviewed these two \n     documents and has advised us that the unopened portions of \n     neither document contain any direct or indirect reference to \n     Judge Bork.\n       Our search has not yielded a copy of the document \n     referenced in paragraph ``a'' of your request numbered 3, \n     which, as you correctly note, is printed at pages 287-288 of \n     the Judiciary Committee's 1973 ``Special Prosecutor'' \n     hearings.\n       Among the documents collected by the Department are certain \n     documents generated in the defense of Halperin v. Kissinger, \n     Civil Action No. 73-1187 (D. D.C.), a suit filed against \n     several federal officials in their individual capacity, which \n     remains pending. The Department has an ongoing attorney-\n     client relationship with the defendants in Halperin, which \n     precludes us from releasing certain documents containing \n     client confidences and litigation strategy, without their \n     consent. 28 C.F.R. 50.156(a)(3).\n       All documents responsive to request number 5, concerning \n     the pocket veto, have been assembled.\n       All documents responsive to request number 6 have been \n     assembled. The exhibits filed by counsel for Edward S. Miller \n     on July 12, 1978 and referred to in your August 10 letter, \n     remain under seal by order of the United States District \n     Court for the District of Columbia. However, a list of the \n     thirteen documents has been unsealed. We have supplied \n     copies of eleven of these documents, including redacted \n     versions of two of the documents (a few sentences of \n     classified material have been deleted). We have supplied \n     unclassified versions of two of these eleven documents, as \n     small portions of them remain classified. We are precluded \n     by Rule 6(e) of the Rules of Criminal Procedure from \n     giving you access to two other exhibits--classified \n     excerpts of grand jury transcripts--filed on July 12, \n     1978. We also searched the files of several civil cases \n     related to the Felt and Miller criminal prosecution, as \n     well as the documents generated during the consideration \n     of the pardon for Felt and Miller.\n       With respect to request number seven, Judge Bork has \n     previously provided to the Committee a number of his \n     speeches, which we have not sought to duplicate. We have \n     sought and supplied any additional speeches, press \n     conferences or interviews by Mr. Bork, as well as any \n     contemporaneous documents which tend to identify a date or \n     event where he gave a speech or press interview during his \n     tenure at the Department.\n       On request number eight, there are no documents in which \n     President Reagan has set forth the criteria he used to select \n     Supreme Court nominees, or their application to Judge Bork, \n     other than the public pronouncements and speeches we have \n     assembled.\n       Our search for documents responsive to request number nine \n     has been time-consuming and very difficult, and is not at \n     this time entirely complete. In order to conduct as broad a \n     search as possible, we requested the files in every case \n     handled by the Civil Rights Division or Civil Division, \n     between 1969-77, which concerned desegregation of public \n     education. Although most of these case files have been \n     retrieved, several remain unaccounted for and perhaps have \n     been lost. We expect to have accounted for the remaining \n     files (which may or may not contain responsive documents) in \n     the next few days. We have also assembled some responsive \n     documents obtained from other Department files. The \n     Department of Education is nearing completion of its search \n     of its files, and those of its predecessor agency, HEW.\n       We have assembled case files for the cases referred to in \n     question ten, with the exception of Hill v. Stone, for which \n     there is no file. We have no record of the participation of \n     the United States in Hill v. Stone, or consideration by the \n     Solicitor General's office of whether to participate in that \n     case.\n       A few general searches of certain front office files are \n     still underway, and we expect those searches to be concluded \n     in the next few days. We will promptly notify you should any \n     further responsive documents come into our possession.\n       As you know, the vast majority of the documents you have \n     requested reflect or disclose purely internal deliberations \n     within the Executive Branch, the work product of attorneys in \n     connection with government litigation or confidential legal \n     advice received from or provided to client agencies within \n     the Executive Branch. The disclosure of such sensitive and \n     confidential documents seriously impairs the deliberative \n     process within the Executive Branch, our ability to represent \n     the government in litigation and our relationship with other \n     entities. For these reasons, the Justice Department and other \n     executive agencies have consistently taken the position, in \n     response to the Freedom of Information Act and other \n     requests, that it is not at liberty to disclose materials \n     that would compromise the confidentiality of any such \n     deliberative or otherwise privileged communications.\n       On the other hand, we also wish to cooperate to the fullest \n     extent possible with the Committee and to expedite Judge \n     Bork's confirmation process. Accordingly, we have decided to \n     take the exceptional step of providing the Committee with \n     access to responsive materials we currently possess, except \n     those privileged documents specifically described above and \n     in the attached appendix. Of course, our decision to produce \n     these documents does not constitute a waiver of any future \n     claims of privilege concerning other documents that the \n     Committee request or a waiver of any claim over these \n     documents with respect to entities or persons other than the \n     Judiciary Committee.\n       As I have previously discussed with Diana Huffman, the \n     other documents will be made available in a room at the \n     Justice Department. Particularly in light of the voluminous \n     and privileged nature of these documents, copies of \n     identified documents will be produced, upon request, only to \n     members of the Judiciary Committee and their staff and only \n     on the understanding that they will not be shown or disclosed \n     to any other persons. Please have you staff contact me to \n     arrange a mutually convenient time for inspection of the \n     documents.\n       As I stressed in my previous letter, if the Committee is or \n     becomes aware of any documents it believes are potentially \n     responsive but have not been produced, please alert us as \n     soon as possible and we will attempt to locate them.\n\n[[Page S2889]]\n\n       Should you have any questions or comments, please contact \n     me as soon possible. Thank you for your cooperation.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                  Laura Wilson\n\n                                    (for John R.

These clearly indicate that Bolton acknowledged materials \nwould be forthcoming.\n  The reason these are important is that we have said this man who has \nno judicial record whatsoever--and I heard the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer give a statement yesterday about the many judges who have been \ndistinguished who have not had judicial experience. We have never \ndebated that. We agree, one does not have to have judicial experience \nto be a good judge. If that were the case, there would never be any \ngood judges, quite frankly. Somebody has to start someplace. In fact, \nwe would never have judges. That is what is referred to as a red \nherring.\n  We have never alleged that Miguel Estrada is disqualified from being \na judge because he has not been a judge. That is something that the \nmajority has talked about a lot, but we have never raised that as an \nissue.\n  What we have said is that those instances where we can learn \nsomething about his political philosophy and his philosophy as it \nrelates to jurisprudence, we need to know something about that. The \nonly place we can go to look is in relation to when he worked at the \nSolicitor's Office because he has not answered the questions we have \nasked him about the cases he prepared and took to trial when he was an \nAssistant Attorney General or when he argued cases before appellate \ncourts.\n  As I have said on a number of different occasions, I have been to \ncourt lots of times. I have represented all kinds of different people. \nIn all the cases I took, when I argued a case before a jury and before \na court, one could not find out what my political or judicial \nphilosophy was. The reason was I was being paid to represent somebody \nand carrying out my responsibilities as a lawyer.\n  So the fact that he has been before the Supreme Court and other \nappellate courts and has tried cases adds to someone's capabilities, \nbut it does not allow us to find out about a person who is going to the \nsecond highest court in the land, if he passes this test. That is not \nenough. We need to know something about him. That is the reason we have \nraised these issues.\n  One thing my friend from Vermont raised, and I thought it was so good \nlast evening: One does not have to graduate first in their class at \nHarvard to be a judge, but we heard assertions that Miguel Estrada has \ngraduated first in his class. He has not. But he could graduate last in \nhis class. He went to Harvard, which is one of the top two or three law \nschools in the entire country. The mere fact he went to Harvard means \nhe is really smart.\n  He did not graduate first in his class. He was not editor of the Law \nReview. He was, with 71 other men and women at Harvard, part of the Law \nReview. He was 1 of 71. That is a pretty large group. As I have \nindicated, they are all smart.\n  The fact that he was an editor adds to his qualifications, but do not \ntry to puff him up to make him something that he is not. He was not \neditor of the Law Review.\n  I think we are off on a lot of tangents. As Senator Hatch laid out so \nclearly last night, I think it is tremendous that a man came from \nCentral America when he was 17 years old, went to Columbia University, \nalso a school that is hard to get in, so he must have done well on his \ntests. I think it is tremendous that he was able then to go to Harvard. \nBut let's not try to make this a rags-to-riches story because it was \nnot. He did well, and that is tremendous. He is an immigrant to \nthis country who has done well academically, but let's not build this \nup to some kind of a Horatio Alger story as some have said. I think the \nguy has done very well, and that is commendable. But we have heard all \nof these assertions that he graduated first in his class and he was \neditor of the Law Review, which is not true. It does not take away from \nwhat a smart man he must be.\n\n  We heard a lot last night, with Senators asking questions of Senator \nHatch about all the editorials from around the country. Of course, \nthere are lots of editorials that oppose Miguel Estrada. There is no \nneed to read all of them, but I would like to read one from the New \nYork Times. It may only be one newspaper, but the circulation makes up \nfor a lot of smaller newspapers.\n\n[[Page S2890]]\n\n  This editorial is 411 words long and is entitled ``Full Disclosure \nfor Judicial Candidates.''\n\n       The Constitution requires the Senate to give its advise and \n     consent on nominees for federal judgeships. But in the case \n     of Miguel Estrada, the Bush administration's choice for a \n     vacancy on the powerful United States Court of Appeals for \n     the District of Columbia Circuit, the Senate is not being \n     given the records it needs to perform its constitutional \n     role. The Senate should not be bullied into making this \n     important decision in the dark.\n       Mr. Estrada, who has a hearing before the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee tomorrow, has made few public statements about \n     controversial legal issues. But some former colleagues report \n     that his views are far outside the legal mainstream.\n       The best evidence of Mr. Estrada's views is almost \n     certainly the memorandums he wrote while working for the \n     solicitor general's office, where he argued 15 cases before \n     the Supreme Court on behalf of the federal government. In \n     these documents, he no doubt gave his views on what position \n     the government should take on cases before the Supreme Court \n     and lower federal courts. Reading them would give the Senate \n     insight into how Mr. Estrada interprets the Constitution, and \n     in what direction he believes the law should head.\n       There are precedents for this. When Robert Bork was \n     nominated to the Supreme Court in 1987, the Senate was given \n     access to memos prepared while he was solicitor general. The \n     administration has no legal basis for its refusal to supply \n     these documents. Congress has oversight authority over the \n     solicitor general's office, which is part of the Justice \n     Department, and therefore has a right to review its records. \n     Attorney-client privilege and executive privilege are \n     inapplicable for many reasons, including their inability to \n     override the Senate's constitutional duty to investigate \n     fully this judicial nomination.\n       This is an administration that loves secrecy, on issues \n     ranging from the war in Iraq to Vice President Dick Cheney's \n     energy task force. And it seems to think that if Congress is \n     ignored, it will simply go away. Congress must insist on \n     getting the documents it needs to evaluate Mr. Estrada, and \n     it should not confirm him until it does.\n  There are three things that can be done and we have been saying this \nfor the 3 weeks we have been on this matter. No. 1, pull the \nnomination. What does that mean? That means go to something else. No. \n2, try to invoke cloture. File a motion to invoke cloture and to do \nthat you need 60 votes. That certainly is within the framework of the \nSenate for these many years. I also recognize the other way to do this \nis for Mr. Estrada to come before the Senate and answer the questions \nthat we ask and also supply the memoranda that the New York Times says \nhe should supply. That would be the way to get over this.\n  We have had now for several days statements made that we should not \nbe on this, that Miguel Estrada is making hundreds of thousands of \ndollars a year as a lawyer, fully employed at a large law firm here in \nWashington, DC. We believe that for the many people who are unemployed, \nthe many people who have lost their jobs, 2.8 million during the 2 \nyears of this administration, we should be dealing with those people \nwho are not employed and underemployed people with no health insurance \nor who are underinsured, people who are trying to make it educationally \nand otherwise in this society. That is what we should be dealing with. \nRather than spending 3 weeks on a man who is fully employed, making \nhundreds of thousands of dollars a year, we think we should get off \nthis and go to something else.\n  We are, as has been indicated, here for the duration. If the majority \ndecides they would rather spend the Senate's valuable time on Miguel \nEstrada, they can do that. But I say that idle time is time we cannot \nmake up later. There is a limited amount of time and a limited amount \nof legislative days that we have. We could be going to something else.\n  These filibusters occur very infrequently. I have been here more than \ntwo decades now and filibusters are very rare. Once in a while you have \nto stand for what you believe is right. As the New York Times \nindicated, we believe we are right.\n  Now, there was a lot of name calling last night. Both my friend from \nColorado and my friend from Tennessee have the absolute right to voice \ntheir opinion. I don't think any less of Members for voicing opinions \nbecause they disagree with me. I don't think this is the time to name \ncall. We have an actual factual dispute in the Senate. It is now in a \nprocedural bog. We have to figure a way out of this. It should be a \ndebate that is worthy of the traditions of the Senate. That is what \nthis is all about. The Senate traditionally has had debate we read \nabout in our history books. That is what I want the people who read \nabout this debate to see in years to come--not calling each other \nnames, negative in nature but, rather, referring to a person's position \nas one of conviction.\n  I listened to the speech of the Presiding Officer who indicated he \nwould wait until next Tuesday to give his maiden speech, but he felt so \npassionate--that is my word, not his--about this issue that he wanted \nto give it a few days early. More power to the Senator from Tennessee. \nThat is certainly fine. That is tremendous that the Senator from \nTennessee made his speech and he feels strongly about the issue. It \ndoes not mean I have to agree with him. But I admire and respect his \nposition.\n  Everyone on the other side should understand we also have conviction \nand feel passionately about this issue, and sometimes there are \nstalemates. This may be one of those. There may be a very tough \ndecision that the majority leader has to make to pull this nomination. \nIf he wants to go through a cloture vote, second cloture vote, a third \ncloture vote, eat up more time of the Senate, we are here. We are here \nfor the duration. I don't think because we are involved in this debate \nthat people suddenly need to say the Senate will never be the same. Of \ncourse it will be the same. We survived the filibuster with the Abe \nFortas nomination. We survived that. It was very tough at the time. I \nwatched that from the sidelines. We survived the filibusters conducted \nagainst President Clinton's nominees. The problem the Republicans had \nat that time, they did not have enough votes to stop cloture from being \ninvoked because there were Republicans of good will who decided it was \nthe wrong thing to do. That is good.\n\n  The fact there were filibusters and some people felt so strongly is \nhard to comprehend, but even after the filibuster was ended with the \ncloture vote then people still moved to postpone that nomination. It \nwent that far.\n  The Senate survived that. And the Senate will survive this little \ndustup that is going on here.\n  The point I am trying to make, let's feel good about other people's \npositions. You do not have to be mean spirited about someone \ndisagreeing with you. I hope, however long this debate takes, whether \nit is ended today, Friday, next week, or a month from now, that people \nwill speak well about each other in the Senate and not resort to name \ncalling. That is not good at all.\n  I hope we can move on to some of the other important issues now \nfacing this country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I stand in support of Miguel Estrada, and \nthe need for a vote on his nomination. I listened to the comments of my \ncolleague from Nevada, and I ask myself, what is this debate really \nabout? The debate is about whether a majority of Senators should have \nthe opportunity to voice their opinion through a vote on Miguel \nEstrada. I, for one, feel like I have adequate information. There is \nmore than a majority of Senators in this body who obviously feel they \nhave adequate information to take a vote on Miguel Estrada.\n  This filibuster is unprecedented. We have never had a filibuster of \nthis nature before on a circuit court judge up for consideration before \nthis body. I think it is time we recognize that in the Constitution \nthere is an advise and consent provision. Many of us feel the debate \nhas reached the point where enough questions have been asked and now \nthe full body of the Senate is ready to proceed to a vote.\n  When a judge starts through the nomination process, he is introduced \nto the Senate through resolution. The nomination goes to the committee. \nThere is also a process where individual Senators can express their \nconcerns through a blue slip process. Then there are hearings and votes \nin committee, and then the nomination comes to the floor for a vote.\n  Miguel Estrada has gone through this process. He has even received \nthe highest recommendation from the American Bar Association. That is a \nbody of peers, peers he has done business with on a regular basis, who \nunderstand his\n\n[[Page S2891]]\n\nrecord, who know him personally, and who appreciate and respect his \nprofessional competence to the point they are willing to give him the \nhighest rating the American Bar Association will give to any nominee.\n  I think he has a great story. He came to this country with a limited \nEnglish language ability at the age of 17. He could speak Spanish \nhardly any English at all. If you come here at 17 and don't know the \nlanguage and you graduate from a university magna cum laude and then go \nand serve on the Harvard Law Review--it is simply an outstanding \nacademic accomplishment.\n  This individual's accomplishments did not stop with graduation; they \ncontinued through his professional life. Not just anybody gets to argue \nbefore the Supreme Court of the United States. That is a select group \nof people. So as far as I am concerned, let's simplify this debate, as \nmy colleague suggested. Let's have a vote. That is what we are talking \nabout. Let's just bring up Miguel Estrada for a vote in the Senate. I \nthink it is time. I think a lot of debate has been going on. There are \nsome differences of opinion about things that can be argued about. But \nif we have a vote, each individual Senator has an opportunity to make \nup his or her mind as to how they feel, as to whether or not there is \nenough information, to make up their minds as to whether they think \nthis is the quality of person they would like to have on the DC Court \nof Appeals.\n  The assistant Democratic leader suggested there are three ways to \nresolve this problem. He said we can pull the nomination, file cloture, \nor submit the nominee to additional questioning. I suggest another: To \ndo what we do for most nominees; that is, have the debate, which we are \nhaving and have done, set a time certain for a vote, which the other \nside simply has refused to do, and then vote up or down. Unfortunately, \nthey are not going to permit that to happen.\n  Last night I joined a majority of my colleagues to display our unity \nin support for Miguel Estrada, a display of support that is \nparticularly important in the midst of this Democrat-led filibuster. \nBut last night was more than just a display. It was an attempt to break \nthe logjam, a good will invitation to carry out the Senate's duties as \ncommanded by the advice and consent clause of the Constitution. My \ncolleagues and I gathered here on the floor last night, ready to act. A \nmajority of this body is willing to move forward on the nomination of \nMiguel Estrada by taking a simple up-or-down vote. That is all we are \nasking for, a simple up-or-down vote on a nominee who is more than \nqualified to assume the judgeship of the DC Circuit Court, the second \nmost important court in the United States.\n  Hoping to proceed, my colleagues and I participated in a dialog with \nChairman Hatch, a back-and-forth exchange of questions and answers. I \nadmire, I have to say, the ability and knowledge of Chairman Hatch and \nhis dedication to this cause, especially as it became apparent that we, \nonce again, would be denied the opportunity to vote, held hostage by a \ngame of entrenchment politics.\n  Every time I hear one of my colleagues address the nomination of Mr. \nEstrada, I cannot help but to be both impressed and shocked, impressed \nwith the character and integrity, the intellect and principles of Mr. \nEstrada; and shocked that such a capable man, who has the opportunity \nto become the first Hispanic judge on the DC Circuit Court, cannot even \nreceive a vote, a simple up-or-down vote.\n  The majority of my colleagues are ready to move forward on the \nnomination. We are ready to vote. I cannot cast judgment on those who \noppose Mr. Estrada. If they want to vote no, that is their choice. I \nrespect that. It is their right. I understand that. I voted against \njudges whom I believed were not fit to serve. But it is implausible to \nthink he should be denied a vote entirely.\n  Newspapers, radio stations, television programs across the country \nare demanding that the stalemate end, and that the minority party allow \nthe Senate to proceed and to break off a filibuster that could amount \nto a major shift in constitutional authority.\n  Last week I spent the Presidents Day recess traveling across the \nState of Colorado. In every community, big or small, concerned citizens \nshared their beliefs on the importance of this nomination and the need \nto provide a vote for Miguel Estrada. They were appalled that we were \nnot moving forward, that their representative in the Senate would not \nhave an opportunity to vote on a very important consideration for the \njudiciary. Perhaps some disagree on whether he should be confirmed, but \nthey all agree there should be at least a vote, and they agree it \nshould be done without shifting constitutional authority in a manner \nthat imposes a supermajority requirement on all judicial nominations. I \nam afraid that is where we are headed.\n  Let me share with you a couple of editorials that ran in Colorado's \ntwo major newspapers, one published in the Denver Post, the other \nappearing in the Rocky Mountain News.\n  The Denver Post, a paper that endorsed Al Gore in 2000, and by no \nmeans an arm of the Republican party, demands that Estrada be given his \nday in court, that the Senate be provided a vote. The paper confirms \nthe outstanding quality of the nominee, noting that he is a picture \nbook example of an immigrant pursuing the American dream.\n  The Denver Post also recognizes his outstanding credentials, stating \nthat while he may lack judicial experience, so, too, do a majority of \nthose now sitting on the DC Circuit Court, some of whom were nominated \nby Presidents Carter and Clinton.\n  I have a statement here from the editorial in the Denver Post on the \nposterboard beside me.\n\n       The key point is that there should be a vote . . . a \n     filibuster should play no part in the process.\n\n  The Rocky Mountain News simply described the Democrats tactics as \n``ugly,'' commenting on their attempt to thwart the Senate's \nmajoritarian decisionmaking.\n  The editorial calls the filibuster:\n\n       . . . irresponsible, a hysteria being acted out to keep \n     Estrada from serving on the US Court of Appeals for the \n     District of Columbia.\n\n  On the chart I have a quote from both papers highlighting the need to \nend the filibuster and to proceed to a vote.\n  The Denver Post:\n\n       The key point is that there should be a vote . . . a \n     filibuster should play no part in the process.\n\n  The Rocky Mountain News concludes that:\n\n       The Democrats have no excuse. Keeping others from voting \n     their consciences on this particular matter is simply out of \n     line.\n\n  Editorial boards across the country echo this very same sentiment. \nMore than 60 major newspapers are calling for an end to the filibuster.\n  I would like to share with my colleagues here this afternoon a few of \nthose. Let me name a few:\n  The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette; in California, Redding, and The Press \nEnterprise; The Hartford Courant; The Washington Post; in Florida, The \nTampa Tribune and The Florida Times-Union; The Atlanta Journal \nConstitution and the Augusta Chronicle; the Chicago Tribune in \nIllinois, along with the Chicago Sun-Times, and Freeport Journal \nStandard; The Advocate in Baton Rouge, Louisiana; The Boston Herald; \nThe Detroit News and Grand Rapids Press; in New Mexico the Albuquerque \nJournal; in Nevada, the Las Vegas Review Journal; the Winston-Salem \nJournal in North Carolina; in North Dakota, the Grand Forks Herald; the \nProvidence Journal in Rhode Island; in West Virginia, the Wheeling News \nRegister/Intelligencer; and nationally, the Investor's Business Daily \nand the Wall Street Journal.\n  I would also like to refute one of the arguments being put forward by \nthe Democrats against Mr. Estrada.\n  For 11 days we have heard statements that the nominee is not \nqualified to serve because he lacks judicial experience. This standard \nis simply ridiculous.\n  Had it applied to their own Democratic nominees, it would have \nprevented some of the most capable attorney's from being seated on the \nfederal bench.\n  Under the experience litmus test, the late Justice Byron ``Whizzer'' \nWhite, a great Coloradan, who was nominated to the Supreme Court by \nPresident John F. Kennedy, would never have been confirmed.\n  Nor would another great Coloradan, Judge Carlos Lucero, who was \nnominated by President Bill Clinton to the\n\n[[Page S2892]]\n\nTenth Circuit Court of Appeals, have been confirmed.\n  To consider a lack of judicial experience as the poison pill of the \nEstrada nomination while ignoring the confirmation of Democratic \nnominees Justice White and Judge Lucero, is a double standard of the \nhighest order.\n  The majority of this body, a majority elected by the American people, \nis ready to proceed with the nomination of Miguel Estrada.\n  I have no doubt that the obstructionists have their own reason to \nvote against the nominee. But they have no reason to prevent a vote \nentirely.\n  I hope that my colleagues will realize the danger of the path they \nhave chosen, and will end this course of obstruction.\n  While I believe a full and fair debate of Presidential nominees is of \nparamount importance, obstructing an up-or-down vote fails the public \ntrust and is a disservice to our system of justice.\n  I know how I am going to vote. I am voting for a highly qualified \nindividual. A nominee who the American Bar Association has stated is \n``highly-qualified.'' That individual is Miguel Estrada, and he \ndeserves a vote by the United States Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                title ix\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, yesterday, the President's Commission on \nOpportunity in Athletics released its recommendations for Title IX and \nsome of the findings are a haunting reminder of the way things used to \nbe.\n  It seems that many of the Commissioners believe that men's sports \nhave suffered because of women's programs. They believe that it is okay \nto count ``slots'' instead of actual women players. And some believe \nthat since men are better ``naturally'' at sports compared to women--\nthat is their word and not mine. That is a true statement if it comes \nfrom me, but it is not a true statement when it comes from other women \nwho are more athletically different--and, therefore, men deserve more \nfunding and support. I don't think we should forget that was the excuse \nused for decades and for generations to keep women out of college, out \nof math and science classes, and out of the workplace.\n\n  I remember as a young girl reading stories of the first women back in \nthe 19th century who wanted to go to medical school to become a doctor \nor to a law school to become lawyers and who wanted to go to college to \nfurther their education. There were court decisions which said women \nnaturally were not suited for higher education. It will wear out their \nbrain. It will undermine their health, and they certainly are not fit \nto go into the courtroom or into the operating room. Thank goodness we \nhave come a long way from those days.\n  But I think about it frequently because my mother was born before \nwomen could vote. Lest we forget that many of the changes which we now \ntake for granted did not come about just because somebody changed their \nmind. It is because we had to fight for work and for the kind of \nprogress which we can see all around us.\n  For 30 years, title IX has encouraged millions of girls and women to \nparticipate in sports. In 1972, only 1 out of every 27 women \nparticipated in sports. Today, that number is 1 in 2. The program \nworks. I think we should recognize the extraordinary progress we have \nmade.\n  I remember very well that although I loved playing sports and \nathletics as a young girl, I was never very good at it. But I played \nhard, and it was a major influence on my understanding of my abilities, \nmy limits, teamwork, and sportsmanship. It was hard for me to accept \nthe fact that many of my friends and colleagues who were more talented \nreally hit a wall. There were not the kind of interscholastic teams \navailable at the high school level which we now take for granted. There \nwere not scholarships available in most sports for most girls who had \nthe capacity to compete and be good. The colleges were in no way \nfulfilling the need and desire that young women had to further their \nathletic pursuits. There really wasn't anything that you could point to \nas being professional athletic options for extremely well-qualified and \nmotivated women.\n  I believe passionately that title IX changed the rules on the playing \nfield and opened up the opportunities so more girls and women could see \nthemselves on that field--and create conditions that would encourage \nour institutions actually to respond to those needs and desires.\n  I was very pleased to hear last night that Secretary Paige announced \nhe would only consider the recommendations of the Commission that the \nCommission unanimously agreed upon. And I applaud that announcement.\n\n  But I believe that the minority report, which was written by Julie \nFoudy, the captain and 9-year veteran of the U.S. Women's National \nSoccer Team, and Donna de Varona, an Olympic swimmer with two gold \nmetals, raises questions about whether any of these recommendations can \nactually be described as unanimous.\n  The introduction of the report reads as follows:\n\n       After . . . unsuccessful efforts to include . . . our \n     minority views within the majority report, we have reached \n     the conclusion that we cannot join the report of the \n     Commission.\n\n  And Julie Foudy and Donna de Varona go on to say:\n\n       Our decision is based on our fundamental disagreement with \n     the tenor, structure and significant portions of the content \n     of the Commission's report, which fails to present a full and \n     fair consideration of the issues or a clear statement of the \n     discrimination women and girls still face in obtaining equal \n     opportunity in athletics--\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n     [secondly,] our belief that many of the recommendations made \n     by the majority would seriously weaken Title IX's protections \n     and substantially reduce the opportunities to which women and \n     girls are entitled under current law; and, [third,] our \n     belief that only one of the proposals would address the \n     budgetary causes underlying the discontinuation of some men's \n     teams, and that others would not restore opportunities that \n     have been lost.\n\n  Their goal in issuing this minority report was to make sure it was \nincluded in the official record of the Commission. Unfortunately, it is \nmy understanding that the Secretary of Education today has refused to \ninclude the minority report. I think that is fundamentally unfair. To \nme, that report should belong with the majority report, especially \nsince those two women, probably between them, have more direct personal \nexperience in what athletics can mean to a woman's life and what it was \nlike before IX, when Donna was competing, and what it was like after IX \nwas enacted, when Julie helped to lead our women's soccer team to the \nWorld Cup Championship.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I am going to ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record this minority report. I am doing so because I \nbelieve it is important that on this issue we hear from the people who \nhave the most to lose: women athletes, women students. Julie and Donna \nwere invited to join the Commission to represent that point of view, \nand their voices should be heard. For the information of my colleagues, \nthe minority report can be found at http://www.womensports \nfoundation.org/binary-data/WSF--Article/pdf--file/944.pdf.\n  Now, along with my colleagues, Senator Daschle, Senator Kennedy, \nSenator Murray, Senator Snowe, and Senator Stevens, who care so deeply \nabout this issue, we will continue to keep a watchful eye on the \nDepartment of Education because the truth is, they do not need \npermission from the Commission or anyone else to adopt the changes the \nCommission has proposed; they can propose to change the regulations or \noffer guidance at any time.\n  So I am here today in the Chamber to say that I, and many of my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle--men and women alike; athletes \nand nonathletes alike--will fight to protect title IX for our daughters \nand our granddaughters and generations of girls and women to come.\n  But let me also add, my support of title IX and my support of the \nright of the minority to be heard with respect to the Commission's \nrecommendations does not, in any way, suggest that I do not believe in \nthe importance of sports for young men, because I do. I strongly \nsupport sports for all young people.\n\n[[Page S2893]]\n\n  In fact, I think it is very unfortunate that physical education has \nbeen dropped from so many of our schools, that so many of our \nyoungsters not only do not have the opportunity to discharge energy and \nengage in physical activities, but to learn about sports, to find out \nthat maybe something would inspire their passion and their commitment.\n  There are other ways to ensure that all boys and girls, all men and \nwomen have the opportunity for athletic experiences, to participate on \nteams.\n  I was somewhat distressed, when the Commission was appointed, with \nthe number of Commissioners who represented an experience that is not \nthe common experience; namely, the experience of very high stakes, big \ncollege and university football, which of course is important; I very \nmuch believe that. But that is only one sport, and it is a very \nexpensive sport.\n  I think there are ways, without taking anything away from anyone--\nboys, girls, men, women--that we can listen to the voices of \nexperience, such as Julie's and Donna's, and come to recognize that \nthere may be other reasons, besides the law, that some men's teams have \nbeen discontinued, which I am very sorry about and wish did not have to \nhappen and believe should not have happened if there had been a fairer \nallocation of athletic resources across all sports.\n  So I think we can come to some agreements that would serve perhaps to \ncreate additional opportunities, but we should not do it to the \ndetriment of girls and women.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to come to the floor to recognize this \nvery important piece of legislation which has literally changed the \nlives of girls and women and should continue to do so. What we ought to \nbe doing is looking for ways we can enhance the physical activity, the \nathletic, competitive opportunities of boys and girls.\n  One of the biggest problems we have confronting us now is obesity \namong young people. We need to get kids moving again. We need to get \nthem in organized physical education classes, intramural sports, \ninterscholastic sports, afterschool sports, and summer sports, so they \ncan have an opportunity to develop their bodies and their athletic \ninterests, as well as their minds and their academic pursuits.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, also, for the information of my colleagues, \n``Open to All,'' the report of the Secretary of Education's Commission \non Opportunity in Athletics can be found at http://ed.gov/pubs/\ntitleixat30/index.html.\n\n\n                           Homeland Security\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Now, Mr. President, on another issue that is of deep \nconcern to me, I come also to raise questions about our commitment to \nhomeland security. This is something I have come to this Chamber to \naddress on numerous occasions, starting in those terrible days after \nSeptember 11, 2001. And it is an issue I will continue to address in \nevery forum and venue that I possibly can find because, unfortunately, \nI do not believe we have done enough to protect ourselves here at home.\n  On February 3, Mitch Daniels, the Director of the Office of \nManagement and Budget, said:\n\n       There is not enough money in the galaxy to protect every \n     square inch of America and every American against every \n     conceived threat.\n\n  This statement bothered me at the time. It has continued to bother \nme. I suppose, on the face of it, it is an accurate statement. Not only \nisn't there enough money in the United States, the world, or the galaxy \nto protect every square inch, but what kind of country would we have if \nwe were trying to protect every square inch? That would raise all sorts \nof issues that might possibly change the character and quality of life \nhere in America.\n  But I do not think that is what really motivated the statement. The \nstatement was a kind of excuse, if you will, as to why this \nadministration has consistently failed to provide even the rudimentary \nfunding that we have needed for our first responders and to deal with \nnational security vulnerabilities.\n  We have learned, in the last few months, that threats do exist all \nover our country. It is not just New York City or Washington, DC, that \nsuffered on September 11. We know that in the months since then, we \nhave seen many other parts of our country respond to alerts--our latest \norange alert--which have required huge expenditures of resources in \norder to protect local water supplies, bridges, chemical plants, \nnuclear powerplants, to do all that is necessary to know that we have \ndone the best we can.\n  Life is not certain. There is no way any of us knows where we will be \nin an hour or in a day or in a year. But what we try to do is to plan \nfor the worst, against contingencies that might undermine our safety. \nAnd then we have to just hope and trust and have faith that we have \ndone enough. But if we do not try, if we do not make the commitment, if \nwe do not provide the resources, then we have essentially just put up \nour hands and surrendered to what did not have to be the inevitable.\n  When I heard Mr. Daniels make that comment, I thought to myself, if \nyou had made a list of every community in America that might possibly \nbe a site for an al-Qaida terrorist cell, I am not sure that \nLackawanna, NY, would have made that list. It is a small community \noutside of Buffalo where the FBI, in cooperation with local law \nenforcement, uncovered such a cell of people who had gone to Bin \nLaden's training camps in Afghanistan and then come back home, most \nlikely what is called a sleeper cell. Their leader was in Yemen where \none of our predator aircraft found him and took action against him and \nhis compatriots who are part of the al-Qaida terrorist campaign against \nus. If we were just thinking, where should we put money to protect \nourselves, I am not sure Lackawanna, NY, would have been on that list. \nYet we have reason to believe it should be on any list anywhere. Just \nyesterday four men in Syracuse, NY, were accused of sending millions of \ndollars to Saddam Hussein.\n  I don't know that we can sit here in Washington and say: Well, we \ncan't possibly protect everybody so we shouldn't protect anybody. But \nthat seems to be the attitude of this administration. That is what \nconcerns me most. We should be doing everything we possibly can to make \nour country safer. We should be thinking 24 hours a day, 7 days a week \nabout new steps, smart steps that we should be taking. Why? Because \nthat is what our enemies do when they think about how to attack us. If \nsomebody is on CNN or the Internet, it doesn't stop at our borders. \nThat is viewed and analyzed in places all over the world. We know that \nthey are working as hard as they possibly can to do as much harm to us \nand our way of life as they possibly can.\n  Since September 11, our first responders, our mayors, police and fire \nchiefs have said over and over again they need Federal support so they \ncan do their jobs to protect the American people. During this recent \ncode orange alert, they have done a remarkable job. They have responded \nto their new responsibility as this country's frontline soldiers in the \nwar against terrorism with grace, honor, and a dedication that \nWashington should emulate.\n  We have had the opportunity to do so. We could have already had in \nthe pipeline and delivered more dollars to pay for needed training, \npersonnel, overtime costs, equipment, whatever it took as determined by \nlocal communities that they require to do the job we expect them to do. \nBut every time the Senate has tried to do more for our first \nresponders, the administration and some in Congress have said we should \ndo less.\n  Senator Byrd stood right over there last summer and offered an \namendment, which the Senate supported, that would have provided more \nthan $5.1 billion in homeland security funding. It included $585 \nmillion for port security; $150 million to purchase interoperable radio \nso that police, firefighters and emergency service workers can \ncommunicate effectively, a problem we found out tragically interfered \nwith communication on September 11 in New York City; another $83 \nmillion to protect our borders. But in each case, despite having passed \nit in the Senate, the administration and Republican leaders settled for \nfar less. They called such spending ``unnecessary.'' In some cases, \nsuch as the funding for interoperable radios, not only did we not get \nthe increase to buy this critical equipment, the funding was cut by $66 \nmillion.\n  It was during that debate that we needed the administration's \nsupport. But instead, they opposed such efforts,\n\n[[Page S2894]]\n\nand the President himself refused to designate $5.1 billion last August \nas an emergency to do the kinds of things that mayors and police chiefs \nand fire chiefs and others have been telling me and my colleagues they \ndesperately need help doing.\n\n  The paper today says the President acknowledges we need to do more. I \nwelcome that acknowledgment. But I have learned that we have to wait to \nsee whether the actions match the words. We have to make sure this new \nawareness about having shortchanged homeland security doesn't translate \ninto taking money away from the functions that firefighters and police \nofficers are called upon to do every day, transferring it across the \ngovernment ledger, relabeling it counterterrorism, and wiping our hands \nof it and saying: We did it.\n  That just doesn't add up. That is what they tried to do for the last \nyear, take money away from the so-called COPS program, which put police \non the beat onto our streets, which helped to lower the crime rate \nduring the 1990s, taking money away from the grants that go to fire \ndepartments to be well prepared to get those hazardous materials, \nequipment, and suits that will protect them and claiming that we take \nthat money away, we put it over here, and we say we have done our job. \nThat is just not an appropriate, fairminded response.\n  We cannot undo the past, but every day we don't plan for the future \nis a lost day. I don't ever want to have a debate in the Senate about \nwhat we should have done or we could have done or we would have done to \nprotect ourselves, if only we had taken as seriously our commitment to \nhomeland security as the administration takes our commitment to \nnational security.\n  Last month I issued a report about how 70 percent of the cities and \ncounties in New York are not receiving any Federal homeland security \nfunding. I commissioned this study because I wanted to know for myself \nwhether maybe some money had trickled down into their coffers that I \nwas not aware of. Well, 70 percent say they had gotten nothing; 30 \npercent say they had gotten a little bit of the bioterrorism money that \nwe had appropriated. But then I also asked them, how much did they need \nand what did they need it for and how did they justify their needs. And \nI must say, most of the requests were very well thought out, prudent \nrequests for help that in this time of falling revenues and budget \ncrunches, city and county governments just cannot do themselves.\n  When that orange alert went out a week or so ago, what happened? I \nknow in New York City, if you were there, you would have seen an \nintense police presence because our commissioner of police, our mayor, \nknew they had to respond. They had to get out there and keep a watchful \neye. But there was no help coming from Washington for them to do that. \nIt may be a national alert, but it is a local response. And we are not \ntaking care of the people we expect to make that response for us.\n  Then I was concerned to see that in so many of the discussions of \npotential weapons of mass destruction, doctors and nurses and hospital \nadministrators are saying: We are not ready. We do not have the \nfunding. We don't even have the funding to do the preventive work, the \nsmallpox vaccination. We don't have the means to be ready for some kind \nof chemical or biological or radiological attack.\n  When we had the incident a few months ago of the shoulder-fired \nmissile that was aimed at the Israeli airline in Kenya--thankfully it \nmissed--I called the people in the new Department of Homeland Security. \nI said: What are our plans? How do we respond to the threat posed by \nshoulder-fired missiles?\n\n  The response I got back was: Well, that is a local law enforcement \nresponsibility.\n  Are we going to provide more funding so we can have more police \npatrols on the outskirts of large airports similar to the ones we have \nin New York and other States have?\n  Well, no, that is not in the cards. You just go out there and keep an \neye out for those shoulder-fired missiles.\n  Time and time again we hear about a threat. We hear the conversations \nfrom our government officials. We listen to the experts tell us what we \nhave to be afraid of. And if you are a police chief or a fire chief \nsitting in any city in our country, you are sitting there in front of \nthe television set saying to yourself: My goodness, how am I going to \nprotect my people? How am I possibly going to do the work I need to do \nwhen my State budget is being cut, when my local budget is being cut, \nwhen the Federal budget is not providing me any resources? How am I \ngoing to do that?\n  It is a fair question. Yet when we dial 911, we expect that phone to \nbe answered, not in this Chamber, not down at the other end of \nPennsylvania Avenue in the White House, but right in our local precinct \nand our local firehouse. Yet in place after place around America, we \nread stories about police being laid off or being enticed into early \nretirement to save money, firehouses being closed or firefighters being \nencouraged to take early retirement, not filling classes in the police \nand fire academy.\n  There is something wrong with this picture. Now, we have done all we \nknow to do to give our men and women who wear military uniforms every \nbit of support we believe they need. If we are going to put them in \nharm's way, then we owe it to them, to their families, to equip them \nand train them, and give them the best possible protection so they can \nfulfill their mission without harm to themselves.\n  But this is a two-front war. We hear that all the time. My gosh, \nthere is nothing else coming across the airwaves except about what is \nhappening in the Persian Gulf and on the Korean peninsula and what is \nhappening with al-Qaida. We know we are in a global war against terror \nand against weapons of mass destruction. That is good offense. We need \nto be out there trying to rid the world of weapons of mass destruction, \nrid the world of tyrants and dictators who would use such weapons.\n  But what about defense? What about what happens here at home? We have \nnot done what we need to do to protect our homeland or our hometowns. \nThat is absolutely unacceptable. The one thing we have learned from the \nhorrors of September 11 is that in this new globalization of \ntransportation and information we now live in, boundaries mean very \nlittle. Part of the reason we were immune from attack through many \ndecades--with the exception of Pearl Harbor and the attack on this city \nand on Baltimore in the War of 1812--is we were protected by those big \noceans, and with friendly neighbors to the north and south. But those \ndays are gone. You can get on a jet plane from anywhere. You can be in \na cave in Afghanistan and use your computer. You can transfer \ninformation about attacks and about weapons of mass destruction with \nthe flick of a mouse.\n  So we have to upgrade and transform our homeland defense, just as we \nhave to think differently about our military readiness and capacity. \nThis does not come cheaply. This is not easy to do. I spend a lot of \ntime talking with police, firefighters, hospital administrators, and \nfront line doctors and nurses; they are ready to make the sacrifice to \nperform in whatever way they are expected to do so to protect us. But \nwe are not giving them the help they need.\n  Now, we can remedy this. It was a good sign when the President \nadmitted today that he and his administration have not funded homeland \nsecurity, and I am glad to hear they have finally admitted that. But \nnow we have to do something about that admission. It cannot be just a \none-day headline. We have to figure out, OK, now that you are seeing \nwhat we see, what we have been worried about, let's do something. Let's \nmake sure that whatever budget is sent up here has money in it for \nthese important functions, so we can look in the eyes of our police \nofficers, firefighters, and emergency providers, and say we have done \nthe best we know how to do.\n  That doesn't mean we are 100 percent safe. There is no such thing. \nThat is impossible. That is not something we can possibly achieve. But \nwe have to do the best we can. I believe it is probably a good old \nadage to ``hope for the best, but prepare for the worst.'' When you \nhave done all you knew how to do, when something does happen, \nhopefully, you are prepared to deal with it.\n  From my perspective, Mr. President, this is a national priority that \ncannot wait. Many of the commentators and pundits of the current theme \ntalk about the likely military action necessitated by Saddam Hussein's \nrefusal to\n\n[[Page S2895]]\n\ndisarm, and point to the possibility that such action will trigger an \nupsurge in potential attack not only here at home but on American \nassets and individuals around the world. It would be impossible \nto write any scenario about the next 10 years without taking into \naccount the potential of future terrorism.\n\n  But what is not impossible--in fact, what is absolutely necessary--is \nfor us to be able to say to our children and the children of \nfirefighters and police officers and emergency responders that we did \nall we knew to do; we were as prepared as we possibly could be. That is \nwhat I want to be able to say, and I know we cannot do that without the \nresources that will make it a real promise of security, instead of an \nempty promise.\n  So, Mr. President, it is my very strong hope that in the wake of the \nadministration's recognition of the failure thus far to fund homeland \nsecurity, now we can get down to business; that we not only can fund \nit, but do it quickly, get the money flowing, and get local communities \nready to implement it, and we can get about the business of making \nAmerica safer here at home. I will do everything I can to realize that \ngoal. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle as we provide the kind of homeland security Americans deserve.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted \nto speak in morning business for up to 25 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Arkansas is \nrecognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Pryor are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise once again to speak in support of \nthe confirmation of Miguel Estrada, an exceptionally well qualified \nnominee who does not deserve to have his nomination obstructed by this \nfilibuster. I have been a strong supporter of Mr. Estrada's since he \ncame before the Judiciary Committee last year. At that time, I argued \nthat his nomination should come up for a floor vote, but we were not \nallowed to vote on his nomination then. Here we are a year later, and I \nam still strongly supporting Mr. Estrada, and I am still arguing for a \nfloor vote, and that vote is still being refused. I think it is \nshameful to continue holding up the vote on this very qualified \njudicial nominee, who, by the way, will make an excellent member of the \nUS Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit.\n  I know my colleagues heard Mr. Estrada's credentials many times last \nweek. In fact, I am pretty sure that some of my colleagues could quote \nhis credentials in their sleep. However, I think it is important that \nthe Senate is reminded of how qualified this nominee is who is being \nfilibustered. Not only is he regarded as one of the Nation's top \nappellate lawyers, having argued 15 cases before the Supreme Court of \nthe United States, but the American Bar Association, which I think \nDemocrats consider the gold standard of determination of the person's \nqualifications to be a judicial nominee, has given him a unanimous \nrating of, in their words, ``well qualified.'' This happens to be the \nhighest American Bar Association rating. It is a rating they would not \ngive to just any lawyer who comes up the pike. According to the \nAmerican Bar Association, quoting from their standard:\n\n       To merit a rating of well qualified, the nominee must be at \n     the top of the legal profession in his or her legal \n     community, having outstanding legal ability, breadth of \n     experience, the highest reputation for integrity and either \n     have demonstrated or exhibited the capacity for judicial \n     temperament.\n\n  We ought to demand that more qualified people like Miguel Estrada be \nappointed to the bench rather than fighting his nomination.\n  As my colleagues know, I am not a lawyer. There is nothing wrong with \ngoing to law school, but I did not. I have been on the Judiciary \nCommittee my entire time in the Senate. I know some of the \nqualifications that are needed to be a Federal judge, particularly a \nFederal judge on this DC Circuit that handles so many appeals from \nadministrative agencies and is often considered, by legal experts, to \nbe the second highest court of our land.\n  Mr. Estrada's academic credentials are stellar. He graduated from \nColumbia University with his bachelor's degree magna cum laude and was \nalso a member of Phi Beta Kappa. Then he earned his juris doctorate \nfrom Harvard University, also magna cum laude, where he was editor of \nthe Harvard Law Review. Mr. Estrada did not just attend Harvard Law \nSchool; he graduated with honors. He also served as the editor of the \nHarvard Law Review. To be selected as the editor of a law review is a \nfeat that only the most exceptional of law students attain.\n\n  While Mr. Estrada certainly has the intellect required to be a \nFederal judge, his professional background also gives testament to his \nbeing qualified for a Federal Court of Appeals judgeship as opposed to \njust any judgeship.\n  After law school, Mr. Estrada served as a law clerk to the Second \nCircuit Court of Appeals and as a law clerk to Justice Kennedy, on the \nUnited States Supreme Court. Subsequently, he served as an Assistant US \nAttorney and deputy chief of the appellate section of the US Attorney's \nOffice of the Southern District of New York, and then as assistant to \nthe Solicitor General of the United States of America.\n  Mr. Estrada has been in the private sector as well. He is a partner \nwith the Washington, DC, office of the law firm of Gibson, Dunn & \nCrutcher. In this exceptional career, Mr. Estrada has argued 15 cases \nbefore the United States Supreme Court. He won nine of those cases. Mr. \nEstrada is not just an appellate lawyer; he is one of the top appellate \nlawyers in the country. So for a young lawyer, I think I can give my \ncolleagues a person who can truly be labeled an American success story. \nIn fact, instead of degrading his ability to serve as a circuit court \njudge, we should all be proud of Mr. Estrada's many accomplishments.\n  This is the nominee that the Democrats are filibustering. I fail to \nunderstand why a nominee of these outstanding qualifications, and who \nhas been honored by the ABA with its highest rating, would be the \nobject of such obstruction. In all my years on the Judiciary \nCommittee--and that has been my entire tenure in the Senate--\nRepublicans never once filibustered a Democratic President's nominee to \nthe Federal bench. There are many I may have wanted to filibuster, but \nI did not do it--we did not do it--because it is not right.\n  In fact, as I understand it, in the entire history of the Senate \nneither party has ever filibustered a judicial nominee. Going back over \n200 years, Republicans and Democrats have resisted the urge to obstruct \na nominee by filibustering. Good men of sound judgment have come to the \nconclusion that to use this tool of last resorts to obstruct a \nnomination is, at best, inappropriate, and, at worst, just down right \nwrong.\n  This nominee, like all nominees, deserves an up-or-down vote. \nAnything less is absolutely unfair. I hope my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle will reconsider this filibuster. The Senate should \nnot cross this Rubicon and establish new precedent for the confirmation \nprocess.\n  Over 40 newspapers from across the country have published editorials \nadvocating that the Senate give Mr. Estrada a vote. Even the Washington \nPost, which is not exactly a bastion of conservatism, published an \neditorial last week entitled, ``Just Vote.'' In that editorial, the \nPost correctly characterized the Democrats obstructionist efforts. With \nregard to the Democrat request for the internal memos Mr. Estrada \ndrafted while he was in the Solicitor General's Office, the Post said\n\n[[Page S2896]]\n\nthat this filibuster of Mr. Estrada goes beyond the normal political \nconfirmation games, because,\n\n       Democrats demand, as a condition of a vote, answers to \n     questions that no nominee should be forced to address--and \n     that nominees have not previously been forced to address.\n\n  I agree with the Post:\n\n       It's long past time to stop these games and vote.\n\n  I make a unanimous consent request that this Washington Post \neditorial, ``Just Vote'' be printed in the Record after my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  [See exhibit 1.]\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Those denying the Senate an up-or-down vote on Mr. \nEstrada's nomination claim that he has not answered questions or \nproduced documentation, and so he should not be confirmed to the \nFederal bench. I can think of a number of Democratic nominees who did \nnot sufficiently answer question that I submitted to them, but that did \nnot lead me to filibuster. As far as I know, Mr. Estrada has answered \nall questions posed to him by the Judiciary Committee members.\n  His opponents claim that he has refused to hand over certain in-house \nJustice Department memoranda. What actually is happening is that the \nDemocrats on the Judiciary Committee have requested that the Department \nof Justice submit to the Committee, internal memoranda written by \nMiguel Estrada when he was an attorney in the Solicitor General's \nOffice. These internal memos are attorney work product, specifically \nappeal, certiorari, and amicus memoranda, and the Justice Department \nhas rightly refused to produce them.\n  The Department of Justice has never disclosed such sensitive \ninformation in the context of a Court of Appeals nomination. These \nmemoranda should not be released, because they detail the appeal, \ncertiorari and amicus recommendations and legal opinions of an \nassistant to the Solicitor General. This is not just the policy of this \nadministration, the Bush administration, a Republican administration. \nThis has also been the policy under Democratic Presidents.\n  The inappropriateness of this request prompted all seven living \nformer Solicitors General to write a bipartisan letter to the Committee \nto express their concern regarding the Committee's request and to \ndefend the need to keep such documents confidential. The letter was \nsigned by Democrats Seth Waxman, Walter Dellinger, Drew Days III and \nRepublicans Ken Starr, Charles Fried, Robert Bork and Archibald Cox. \nThe letter notes that when each of the Solicitors General made \nimportant decisions regarding whether to seek Supreme Court review of \nadverse appellate decisions and whether to participate as amicus curiae \nin other high profile cases, they:\n\n       relied on frank, honest and thorough advice from [their] \n     staff attorneys like Mr. Estrada . . .\n\n  and that the open exchange of ideas which must occur in such a \ncontext\n\n       Simply cannot take place if attorneys have reason to fear \n     that their private recommendations are not private at all, \n     but vulnerable to public disclosure.\n\n  The letter concludes that\n\n       Any attempt to intrude into the Office's highly privileged \n     deliberations would come at a cost of the Solicitor General's \n     ability to defend vigorously the United States litigation \n     interests, a cost that also would be borne by Congress \n     itself.\n\n  The Democratic committee member's request has even drawn criticism \nfrom the editorial boards of the Washington Post and Wall Street \nJournal. On May 28, 2002, in an editorial entitled ``Not Fair Game'' \nthe Washington Post editorialized that the request\n\n       For an attorney's work product would be unthinkable if the \n     work had been done for a private client. . . . [and] legal \n     advice by a line attorney for the federal government is not \n     fair game either.\n\n  According to the Post editorial\n\n       . . . In elite government offices such as that of the \n     solicitor general, lawyers need to speak freely without \n     worrying that the positions they are advocating today will be \n     used against them if they ever get nominated to some other \n     position.\n\n  On May 24, 2002, the Wall Street Journal in an editorial entitled \n``The Estrada Gambit'' also criticized the request, calling it ``one \nmore attempt to delay giving Mr. Estrada a hearing and a vote.'' The \nJournal further criticized the Committee's request in a later \neditorial, entitled ``No Judicial Fishing'', calling the request \n``outrageous'' and noting that the goal of the request ``is to delay, \ntrying to put off the day when Mr. Estrada takes a seat on the D.C. \nCircuit Court of Appeals.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these two editorials also \nbe printed in the Record after my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  [See exhibit 2.]\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. Estrada is not the only former deputy or assistant \nto the Solicitor General nominated to the Federal bench. In fact, there \nare seven others now serving on the Federal Courts of Appeals. None had \nany prior judicial experience, and the committee did not ask the \nJustice Department to turn over any confidential internal memoranda \nthose nominees prepared while serving in the Solicitor General's \nOffice. The seven nominees were: Samuel Alito on the 3rd Circuit, Danny \nBoggs on the 6th Circuit, William Bryson and Daniel Friedman on the \nFederal Circuit, Frank Easterbrook and Richard Posner on the 7th \nCircuit, and A. Raymond Randolph on the D.C. Circuit. Why should Mr. \nEstrada be treated any differently?\n  During Mr. Estrada's hearing, Judiciary Committee Democrats alleged \nthat the committee has reviewed the work product of other nominees, \nincluding memos written by Frank Easterbrook, by Chief Justice \nRehnquist when he served as a clerk to Justice Jackson, and by Robert \nBork when he was an official at the Justice Department.\n  For the record, there is no evidence that the Department of Justice \never turned over confidential memoranda prepared by Frank Easterbrook \nwhen he served in the Solicitor General's Office. There also is \nno evidence that the committee even requested such information.\n\n  During Robert Bork's hearings, the Department did turn over memos \nJudge Bork wrote while serving as Solicitor General, but none of these \nmemos contained the sort of deliberative materials requested of Mr. \nEstrada and the Justice Department. The Bork materials include memos \ncontaining Bork's opinions on such subjects as the constitutionality of \nthe pocket veto, and on President Nixon's assertions of executive \nprivilege and his views of the Office of Special Prosecutor. None of \nthe memos contain information regarding internal deliberations of \ncareer attorneys on appeal decisions or legal opinions in connection \nwith appeal decisions. Moreover, the Bork documents reflected \ninformation transmitted between a political appointee, namely the \nSolicitor General, and political advisors to the President, rather than \nthe advice of a career Department of Justice attorney to his superiors, \nas is the case with Mr. Estrada.\n  You see, the Judiciary Committee has never requested and the \nDepartment of Justice has never agreed to release the internal memos of \na career line attorney. To ask that Mr. Estrada turn over his memos is \nunprecedented, and frankly unfair. No Member of this body would ever \ncondone a request to turn over staff memos. What my staff communicates \nto me in writing is internal and private. I am sure every other Senator \nfeels the same way as I do. This Democrat fishing expedition needs to \nstop. Miguel Estrada is a more than well qualified nominee and he \ndeserves a vote on his nomination, today.\n  In conclusion, we are again seeing an attack on another very \ntalented, very principled, highly qualified legal mind. It all boils \ndown to this, Mr. Estrada's opponents refuse to give him a vote because \nthey say they do not know enough about him. They further contend that \nthe Justice Department memos, which they know will never be released, \nare the only way they can find out what they need to know about Mr. \nEstrada. It is a terrible Catch-22.\n  These obstructionist efforts are a disgrace and an outrage. We must \nput a stop to these inappropriate political attacks and get on with the \nbusiness of confirming to the Federal bench good men and women who are \ncommitted to doing what judges should do, interpret law as opposed to \nmaking law from the bench, because it is our responsibility to make law \nas members of the legislative branch.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S2897]]\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 18, 2003]\n\n                               Just Vote\n\n       The Senate has recessed without voting on the nomination of \n     Miguel Estrada to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. \n     Circuit. Because of a Democratic filibuster, it spent much of \n     the week debating Mr. Estrada, and, at least for now, enough \n     Democrats are holding together to prevent the full Senate \n     from acting. The arguments against Mr. Estrada's confirmation \n     range from the unpersuasive to the offensive. He lacks \n     judicial experience, his critics say--though only three \n     current members of the court had been judges before their \n     nominations. He is too young--though he is about the same age \n     as Judge Harry T. Edwards was when he was appointed and \n     several years older than Kenneth W. Starr was when he was \n     nominated. Mr. Estrada stonewalled the Judiciary Committee by \n     refusing to answer questions--though his answers were similar \n     in nature to those of previous nominees, including many \n     nominated by Democratic presidents. The administration \n     refused to turn over his Justice Department memos--though no \n     reasonable Congress ought to be seeking such material, as a \n     letter from all living former solicitors general attests. He \n     is not a real Hispanic and, by the way, he was nominated only \n     because he is Hispanic--two arguments as repugnant as they \n     are incoherent. Underlying it all is the fact that Democrats \n     don't want to put a conservative on the court.\n       Laurence H. Silberman, a senior judge on the court to which \n     Mr. Estrada aspires to serve, recently observed that under \n     the current standards being applied by the Senate, not one of \n     his colleagues could predictably secure confirmation. He's \n     right. To be sure, Republicans missed few opportunities to \n     play politics with President Clinton's nominees. But the \n     Estrada filibuster is a step beyond even those deplorable \n     games. For Democrats demand, as a condition of a vote, \n     answers to questions that no nominee should be forced to \n     address--and that nominees have not previously been forced to \n     address. If Mr. Estrada cannot get a vote, there will be no \n     reason for Republicans to allow the next David S. Tatel--a \n     distinguished liberal member of the court--to get one when a \n     Democrat someday again picks judges. Yet the D.C. Circuit--\n     and all courts, for that matter--would be all the poorer were \n     it composed entirely of people whose views challenged nobody.\n       Nor is the problem just Mr. Estrada. John G. Roberts Jr., \n     Mr. Bush's other nominee to the D.C. Circuit, has been \n     waiting nearly two years for a Judiciary Committee vote. \n     Nobody has raised a substantial argument against him. Indeed, \n     Mr. Roberts is among the most highly regarded appellate \n     lawyers in the city. Yet on Thursday, Democrats invoked a \n     procedural rule to block a committee vote anyway--just for \n     good measure. It's long past time to stop these games and \n     vote.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, May 24, 2002]\n\n                           The Estrada Gambit\n\n       Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy keeps saying he's \n     assessing judicial nominees on the merits, without political \n     influence. So why does he keep getting caught with someone \n     else's fingerprints on his press releases?\n       The latest episode involves Miguel Estrada, nominated more \n     than a year ago by President Bush for the prestigious D.C. \n     Circuit Court of Appeals. Mr. Estrada scares the legal briefs \n     off liberal lobbies because he's young, smart and \n     accomplished, having served in the Clinton Solicitor \n     General's office, and especially because he's a conservative \n     Hispanic. All of these things make him a potential candidate \n     to be elevated to the U.S. Supreme Court down the road.\n       Sooner or later even Mr. Leahy has to grant the nominee a \n     hearing, one would think. But maybe not, if he keeps taking \n     orders from Ralph Neas at People for the American Way. On \n     April 15, the Legal Times newspaper reported that a \n     ``leader'' of the anti-Estrada liberal coalition was \n     considering ``launching an effort to obtain internal memos \n     that Estrada wrote while at the SG's office, hoping they will \n     shed light on the nominee's personal views.''\n       Hmmm. Who could that leader be? Mr. Neas, perhaps? Whoever \n     it is, Mr. Leahy seems to be following orders, because a \n     month later, on May 15, Mr. Leahy sent a letter to Mr. \n     Estrada requesting the ``appeal recommendations, certiorari \n     recommendations, and amicus recommendations you worked on \n     while at the United States Department of Justice.''\n       It's important to understand how outrageous this request \n     is. Mr. Leahy is demanding pre-decision memorandums, the kind \n     of internal deliberations that are almost by definition \n     protected by executive privilege. No White House would \n     disclose them, and the Bush Administration has already turned \n     down a similar Senate request of memorandums in the case of \n     EPA nominee Jeffrey Holmstead, who once worked in the White \n     House counsel's office.\n       No legal fool, Mr. Leahy must understand this. So the \n     question is what is he really up to? The answer is almost \n     certainly one more attempt to delay giving Mr. Estrada a \n     hearing and vote. A simple exchange of letters from lawyers \n     can take weeks. And then if the White House turns Mr. Leahy \n     down, he can claim lack of cooperation and use that as an \n     excuse to delay still further.\n       Mr. Leahy is also playing star marionette to liberal \n     Hispanic groups, which on May 1 wrote to Mr. Leahy urging \n     that he delay the Estrada hearing until at least August in \n     order to ``allow sufficient time . . . to complete a \n     thorough and comprehensive review of the nominee's \n     record.'' We guess a year isn't adequate time and can only \n     assume they need the labor-intensive summer months to \n     complete their investigation. (Now there's a job for an \n     intern.) On May 9, the one-year anniversary of Mr. \n     Estrada's nomination. Mr. Leahy issued a statement \n     justifying the delay in granting him a hearing by pointing \n     to the Hispanic group's letter.\n       These groups, by the way, deserve some greater exposure. \n     They include the Mexican American Legal Defense and \n     Educational Fund as well as La Raza, two lobbies that claim \n     to represent the interests of Hispanics. Apparently they now \n     believe their job is to help white liberals dig up dirt on a \n     distinguished jurist who could be the first Hispanic on the \n     U.S. Supreme Court.\n       The frustration among liberals in not being able to dig up \n     anything on Mr. Estrada is obvious. Nam Aron, president of \n     the Alliance for Justice, told Legal Times that ``There is a \n     dearth of information about Estrada's record, which places a \n     responsibility on the part of Senators to develop a record at \n     his hearing. There is much that he has done that is not \n     apparent.'' Translation: We can't beat him yet.\n       Anywhere but Washington, Mr. Estrada would be considered a \n     splendid nominee. The American Bar Association, whose \n     recommendation Mr. Leahy one called the ``gold standard by \n     which judicial candidates have been judged,'' awarded Mr. \n     Estrada its highest rating of unanimously well-qualified. \n     There are even Democrats, such as Gore advisor Ron Klaim, who \n     are as effusive as Republicans singing the candidate's \n     praises.\n       When Mr. Estrada worked in the Clinton-era Solicitor \n     General's office, he wrote a friend-of-the-court brief in \n     support of the National Organization of Women's position that \n     anti-abortion protestors violated RICO. It's hard to paint a \n     lawyer who's worked for Bill Clinton and supported NOW as a \n     right-wing fanatic.\n       We report all of this because it reveals just how poison \n     judicial politics have become, and how the Senate is \n     perverting its advise and consent power. Yesterday the \n     Judiciary Committee finally to help fellow Pennsylvania \n     Brooks Smith.\n       Mr. Estrada doesn't have such a patron, so he's fated to \n     endure the delay and document-fishing of liberal interests \n     and the Senate Chairman who takes their dictation.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the nomination \nof Miguel Estrada to the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia.\n  The President has the right to make judicial nominations. The Senate \nhas the Constitutional responsibility to advise and consent. I take \nthis responsibility very seriously. This is a lifetime appointment for \nour nation's second most important court. Only the Supreme Court has a \ngreater impact on the lives and rights of every American.\n  The District of Columbia Circuit is the final arbiter on many cases \nthat the Supreme Court refuses to consider. That means it's responsible \nfor decisions on fundamental constitutional issues involving freedom of \nspeech, the right to privacy and equal protection.\n  In addition, the D.C. Circuit has special jurisdiction over Federal \nagency actions. That means the D.C. Circuit is responsible for cases on \nissues of great national significance involving labor rights, \naffirmative action, clean air and clear water standards, health and \nsafety regulations, consumer privacy and campaign finance. The \nimportance of this court highlights the importance of placing skilled, \nexperienced and moderate jurists on the court.\n  I base my consideration of each judicial nominee on three criteria: \ncompetence, integrity and commitment to core Constitutional principles.\n  I don't question Mr. Estrada's character or competence. He is clearly \na skilled lawyer. Yet the Senate does not have enough information to \njudge Mr. Estrada's commitment to core Constitutional principles.\n  He has refused to answer even the most basic questions during his \nhearing in Senate Judiciary Committee. For example, he was asked to \ngive examples of Supreme Court decisions with which he disagreed. He \nrefused to answer. He was asked basic questions on his judicial \nphilosophy. He refused to answer.\n  The Constitution gives the Senate the responsibility to advise and \nconsent on judicial nominations. This consent should be based on \nrigorous analysis. The nominee doesn't have to be an academic with a \npaper trail. Yet the nominee must be open and forthcoming. He or she \nmust answer questions that seek to determine their commitment to core \nConstitutional principles.\n\n[[Page S2898]]\n\n  This is a divisive nomination--at a time when our Nation should be \nunited. Our Nation is preparing for a possible war in Iraq. We are \nalready engaged in a war against terrorism. We are also facing a weak \neconomy. Americans are stressed and anxious. The Senate should be \nworking to reduce this stress--to make America more secure; to \nstrengthen our economy and to deal with the ballooning cost of health \ncare.\n  I urge the administration to nominate judicial candidates who are \nmoderate and mainstream--and to instruct those nominees to be \nforthright and forthcoming with the Senate so the Senate can address \nthe significant issues that face our Nation today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as \nif in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, one of our most important \nresponsibilities as Senators is the confirmation of Federal judges. \nFederal judges are appointed for life, and they will be interpreting \nlaws affecting the lives of all our citizens for many years to come. \nYet my colleagues across the aisle suggest that something far less than \na full review of a nominee's record is warranted. Republican Senators \npretend that by seeking additional information to help us understand \nMr. Estrada's views and judicial philosophy, we are upsetting the \nproper constitutional balance between the Senate and the executive \nbranch. They claim the Senate has to consent to the President's \njudicial nominees, as long as they have appropriate professional \nqualifications.\n  In fact, the Constitution gives a strong role to the Senate in \nevaluating nominees. The role of the Senate is fundamental to the basic \nconstitutional concept of checks and balances at the heart of the \nFederal Government. And when we say ``check'' we don't mean blank \ncheck.\n  The debates over the drafting of the Constitution tell a great deal \nabout the proper role of the Senate in the judicial selection process. \nBoth the text of the Appointments Clause of the Constitution and the \ndebates over its adoption make clear that the Senate should play an \nactive and independent role in selecting judges.\n  Given recent statements by Republican Senators, it is important to \nlay out the historical record in detail. The Constitutional Convention \nmet in Philadelphia from late May until mid-September of 1787. On May \n29, 1787, the Convention began its work on the Constitution with the \nVirginia Plan introduced by Governor Randolph, which provided ``that a \nNational Judiciary be established, to be chosen by the National \nLegislature.'' Under this plan, the President had no role at all in the \nselection of judges.\n  When this provision came before the Convention on June 5, several \nmembers were concerned that having the whole legislature select judges \nwas too unwieldy. James Wilson suggested an alternative proposal that \nthe President be given sole power to appoint judges.\n  That idea had almost no support. Rutledge of South Carolina said that \nhe ``was by no means disposed to grant so great a power to any single \nperson.'' James Madison agreed that the legislature was too large a \nbody, and stated that he was ``rather inclined to give [the appointment \npower] to the Senatorial branch'' of the legislature, a group \n``sufficiently stable and independent'' to provide ``deliberate \njudgements.''\n  A week later, Madison offered a formal motion to give the Senate the \nsole power to appoint judges and this motion was adopted without any \nobjection. On June 19, the Convention formally adopted a working draft \nof the Constitution, and it gave the Senate the exclusive power to \nappoint judges.\n  July of 1787 was spent reviewing the draft Constitution. On July 18, \nthe Convention reaffirmed its decision to grant the Senate the \nexclusive power. James Wilson again proposed ``that the Judges be \nappointed by the Executive'' and again his motion was defeated.\n  The issue was considered again on July 21, and the Convention again \nagreed to the exclusive Senate appointment of judges.\n  In a debate concerning the provision, George Mason called the idea of \nexecutive appointment of Federal judges a ``dangerous precedent.'' The \nConstitution was drafted to read: ``The Senate of the United States \nshall have power to appoint Judges of the Supreme Court.''\n  Not until the final days of the Convention was the President given \npower to nominate Judges. On September 4, 2 weeks before the \nConvention's work was completed, the Committee proposed that the \nPresident should have a role in selecting judges. It stated: ``The \nPresident shall nominate and by and with the advice and consent of the \nSenate shall appoint judges of the Supreme Court.'' The debates, make \nclear, however, that while the President had the power to nominate \njudges, the Senate still had a central role.\n  Governor Morris of Pennsylvania described the provision as giving the \nSenate the power ``to appoint Judges nominated to them by the \nPresident.'' The Constitutional Convention adopted this reworded \nprovision giving the President the power, with the advice and consent \nof the Senate, to nominate and appoint judges.\n  The debates and the series of events proceeding adoption of the \n``advise and consent'' language make clear, that the Senate should play \nan active role. The Convention having repeatedly rejected proposals \nthat would lodge exclusive power to select judges with the executive \nbranch, could not possibly have intended to reduce the Senate to a \nrubber stamp role.\n  The reasons given by delegates to the Convention for making the \nselection of judges a joint decision by the President and the Senate \nare as relevant today as they were in 1787. The framers refused to give \nthe power of appointment to a ``single individual.'' They understood \nthat a more representative judiciary would be attained by giving \nmembers of the Senate a major role.\n  From the start, the Senate has not hesitated to fully exercise this \npower. During the first 100 years after ratification of the \nConstitution, 21 or 81 Supreme Court nominations--one out of four--were \nrejected, withdrawn, or not acted on. During these confirmation \ndebates, ideology often mattered. John Rutledge, nominated by George \nWashington, failed to win confirmation as Chief Justice in 1795.\n  Alexander Hamilton and other Federalists opposed him, because of his \nposition on the controversial Jay Treaty. A nominee of President James \nPolk was rejected because of his anti-immigration position. A nominee \nof President Hoover was rejected because of his anti labor view. Our \nRepublican colleagues are obviously aware of this. Their recent \nstatements attempting to downplay the Senate's role stand in stark \ncontrast to the statements when they controlled the Senate during the \nClinton administration. At that time, they vigorously asserted their \nright of ``advice and consent.''\n  Indeed, while public debate and a demand to fully review a nominee's \nrecord is consistent with our duty of ``advice and consent,'' many of \nthe actions by Republicans were damaging to the nominations process. \nDemocrats have made clear our concerns about whether Mr. Estrada has \nmet the burden of showing that he should be appointed to the DC \nCircuit, but Republicans resorted to tactics such as secret holds to \nblock President Clinton's nominees. For instance, it took four years to \nact on the nomination of Richard Paez, a Mexican-American, to the Ninth \nCircuit. Senate Republicans repeatedly delayed floor action on Judge \nPaez through use of anonymous holds.\n  Republicans voted to indefinitely postpone action on Judge Paez's \nnomination. Finally, in March 2000, 4 years after his nomination and \nwith the Presidential election on the horizon, Judge Paez was \nconfirmed, after cloture was invoked.\n  Reviewing Mr. Estrada's nomination is our constitutional duty. We \ntake his nomination particularly seriously because of the importance of \nthe DC Circuit, the Court to which he has been nominated. The important \nwork we do in Congress to improve health care, protect workers rights, \nand protect civil rights mean far less if we fail to fulfill our \nresponsibility to provide the\n\n[[Page S2899]]\n\nbest possible advice and consent on judicial nominations. Tough \nenvironmental laws mean little to a community that can't enforce them \nin our federal courts. Civil rights laws are undercut if there are no \nremedies for disabled men and women. Fair labor laws are only words on \npaper if we confirm judges who ignore them.\n  What we know about Mr. Estrada leads us to question whether he will \ndeal fairly with the range of important issues affecting everyday \nAmericans that came before him.\n  Mr. Estrada has been actively involved in supporting broad anti-\nloitering ordinances that restrict the rights of minority residents to \nconduct lawful activities in their neighborhoods. Mr. Estrada has \nsought to undermine the ability of civil rights groups like the NAACP \nto challenge these broad ordinances which affect the ability of \nminority citizens to conduct activities such as drug counseling and \nvoter outreach in their communities.\n  Information we need to know about Mr. Estrada's record has been \nhidden from us by the Department of Justice. Democratic Senators have \nasked for Mr. Estrada's Solicitor General Memoranda. We have moved for \nunanimous consent to proceed to a vote on his nomination, after those \nmemoranda are provided. Yet, the White House refuses to provide any of \nMr. Estrada's memos, even though there is ample precedent for allowing \nthe Senate to review these documents.\n  Even as Republicans refuse to allow us to see Mr. Estrada's memos \nfrom his time in public office--and even as Mr. Estrada declined to \nanswer many basic questions about his judicial philosophy and \napproach--Republicans repeatedly make clear that they are familiar with \nMr. Estrada's views and judicial philosophy.\n  Since his nomination, Republican Senators have repeatedly praised Mr. \nEstrada as a ``conservative.'' A recent article from Roll Call states \nthat the Republican Party is confident that Mr. Estrada will rule in \nsupport of big business. The article also states that the Republican \nParty has asked lobbyists to get involved in the battle over Mr. \nEstrada's nomination.\n  I have spoken in recent days about the importance of the DC Circuit \nand it's shift to the right in the 1980s and 1990s. In the 1960s and \n1970s, the DC Circuit had a significant role in protecting public \naccess to agency and judicial proceedings, protecting civil rights \nguarantees, overseeing administrative agencies, protecting the public \ninterest in communications regulation, and enforcing environmental \nprotections. In the 1980s, however, the DC Circuit changed dramatically \nbecause of the appointment of conservative judges. As its composition \nchanged, it became a conservative and activist court--striking down \ncivil rights and constitutional protections, encouraging deregulation, \nclosing the doors of the courts to many citizens, favoring employers \nover workers, and undermining federal protection of the environment.\n  It seems clear that Mr. Estrada has been nominated to the DC Circuit \nin the hope that this court will continue to be more interested in \nfavoring big business than in protecting the rights of workers, \nconsumers, women, minorities, and other Americans.\n  Mr. Estrada's nomination is strongly opposed by those concerned about \nthese rights. Republicans repeatedly praise Mr. Estrada as a Hispanic--\nbut many Hispanic groups oppose his nomination. The Congressional \nHispanic Caucus, the Mexican American Legal Defense Fund, the Southwest \nVoter Registration Project, 52 Latino Labor Leaders representing \nworking families across the country, the California League of United \nLationo Citizens, the California La Raza, the Puerto Rican Legal \nDefense Fund and fifteen past presidents of the Hispanic National Bar \nAssociation, whose terms span from 1972 until 1998 have stated their \nopposition to Mr. Estrada. As these Presidents write:\n\n       Based upon our review and understanding of the totality of \n     Mr. Estrada's record and life's experiences, we believe that \n     there are more than enought reasons to conclude that Mr. \n     Estrada's candidacy falls short. [These] reasons include: his \n     virtually non-existent written record, his verbally expressed \n     and un-rebutted extreme views, his lack of judicial or \n     academic teaching experience (against which his fairness, \n     reasoning skills and judicial philosophy could be properly \n     tested), his poor judicial temperament, his total lack of \n     connection whatsoever to, or lack of demonstrated interest in \n     the Hispanic community, his refusals to answer even the most \n     basic questions about civil rights and constitutional law, \n     his less than candid responses to other straightforward \n     questions of Senate Judiciary Committee Members.\n\n  I would like to include in the Record statements at the end of my \nremarks of two of the past National Presidents of the League of United \nLatin American Citizens opposing Mr. Estrada's nomination. The first \nstatement is from Belen Robles, a native Texas who has a long and \nactive involvement in the Latino civil rights community. He writes that \nhe is ``deeply troubled with the nomination of Miguel Estrada.'' He is \ntroubled by the positions that Mr. Estrada has taken on racial \nprofiling, and on whether the NAACP had standing to put forward the \nclaims of African-Americans arrested under an anti-loitering ordinance.\n  Mr. Robles writes:\n\n       As a former National President of LULAC, I know very well \n     that on many occasions LULAC has been a champion of the \n     rights of its membership in civil rights cases. We asserted \n     those rights on behalf of voters in voting cases in Texas, \n     and in many other civil rights cases. Under his view, Mr. \n     Estrada could decide that a civil rights organization such as \n     LULAC would not be able to sue on behalf of its members. NO \n     supporter of civil rights could agree with Mr. Estrada's \n     confirmation.\n\n  Ruben Bonilla, an attorney in Texas who is also a past National \npresident of LULAC, opposes the confirmation of Mr. Estrada.\n  Mr. Bonilla writes:\n\n       I am deeply troubled with the double standard that \n     surrounds the nomination of Mr. Estrada. It is particularly \n     troubling that some of the Senators have accused Democrats or \n     other Latinos of being anti-Hispanic, or holding the American \n     dream hostage. Yet, these same Senators in fact prevented \n     Latinos appointed by the Clinton Administration from ever \n     being given a hearing. Notably, Corpus Christi lawyer Jorge \n     Rangel, and El Paso attorney Enrique Moreno, and Denver \n     attorney Christine Arguello never received hearings before \n     the judiciary committee. Yet, these individuals who came from \n     the top of their profession were schooled in the Ivy League, \n     were raised from modest means in the Southwest, and in fact \n     truly embodied the American Dream. These highly qualified \n     Mexican-Americans never had the opportunity to introduce \n     themselves and their views to the Senate, as Mr. Estrada did.\n\n  Mr. President, the Senate is entitled to see Mr. Estrada's full \nrecord. Both the Constitution and historical practices require us to \nignore the Administration's obvious ideological nominations. Judicial \nnominees who come before the Senate should have professional \nqualifications and the right temperament to be a judge. They should be \ncommitted to basic constitutional principles. Many of us have no \nconfidence that Mr. Estrada has met this burden. I urge the Senate to \nreject this nomination.\n  I ask unanimous consent that supporting material be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          HNBA's Past Presidents' Statement, February 21, 2003\n\n       We the undesigned past presidents of the Hispanic National \n     Bar Association write in strong opposition to the nomination \n     of Miguel A. Estrada for judgeship on the Court of Appeals \n     for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n       Since the HNBA's establishment in 1972, promoting civil \n     rights and advocating for judicial appointments of qualified \n     Hispanic Americans throughout our nation have been our \n     fundamental concerns. Over the years, we have had a proven \n     and respected record of endorsing or not endorsing or \n     rejecting nominees on a non-partisan basis of both Republican \n     and Democratic presidents.\n       In addition to evaluating a candidate's professional \n     experience and judicial temperament, the HNBA's policies and \n     procedures governing judicial endorsements have required that \n     the following additional criteria be considered: The extent \n     to which a candidate has been involved in, supportive of, and \n     responsive to the issues, needs and concerns or Hispanic \n     Americans, and the candidate's demonstrated commitment to the \n     concept of equal opportunity and equal justice under the law.\n       Based upon our review and understanding of the totality of \n     Mr. Estrada's record and life's experiences, we believe that \n     there are more than enough reasons to conclude that Mr. \n     Estrada's candidacy falls short in these respects. We believe \n     that for many reasons including: his virtually non-existent \n     written record, his verbally expressed and un-rebutted \n     extreme views, his lack of judicial or academic teaching \n     experience, (against which his fairness, reasoning skills and \n     judicial philosophy could be properly tested), his\n\n[[Page S2900]]\n\n     poor judicial temperament, his total lack of any connection \n     whatsoever to, or lack of demonstrated interest in the \n     Hispanic community, his refusals to answer even the most \n     basic questions about civil rights and constitutional law, \n     his less than candid responses to the other straightforward \n     questions of Senate Judiciary Committee members, and because \n     of the Administration's refusal to provide the Judiciary \n     Committee the additional information and cooperation it needs \n     to address these concerns, the United States Senate cannot \n     and must not conclude that Mr. Estrada can be a fair and \n     impartial appellate court judge.\n       Respectfully submitted,\n\n\n     John Roy Castillo, et al.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  [From The Oregonian, Feb. 24, 2003]\n\n              Estrada Would Destroy Hard-Fought Victories\n\n                         (By Dolores C. Huerta)\n\n       As a co-founder of the United Farm Workers with Cesar \n     Chavez, I know what progress looks like. Injustice and the \n     fight against it take many forms-from boycotts and marches to \n     contract negotiations and legislation. Over the years, we had \n     to fight against brutal opponents, but the courts were often \n     there to back us up. Where we moved forward, America's courts \n     helped to establish important legal protections for all farm \n     workers, all women, all Americans. Now, though, a dangerous \n     shift in the courts could destroy the worker's rights, \n     women's rights, and civil rights that our collective actions \n     secured.\n       It is especially bitter for me that one of the most visible \n     agents of the strategy to erase our legal victories is being \n     called a great role model for Latinos. It is true that for \n     Latinos to realize America's promise of equality and justice \n     for all, we need to be represented in every sector of \n     business and every branch of government. But it is also true \n     that judges who would wipe out our hard-fought legal \n     victories--no matter where they were born or what color their \n     skin--are not role models for our children. And they are not \n     the kind of judges we want on the federal courts.\n       Miguel Estrada is a successful lawyer, and he has powerful \n     friends who are trying to get him a lifetime job as a federal \n     judge. Many of them talk about him being a future Supreme \n     Court justice. Shouldn't we be proud of him?\n       I for one am not too proud of a man who is unconcerned \n     about the discrimination that many Latinos live with every \n     day. I am not especially proud of a man whose political \n     friends--the ones fighting hardest to put him on the court--\n     are also fighting to abolish affirmative action and to make \n     it harder if not impossible for federal courts to protect the \n     rights and safety of workers and women and anyone with little \n     power and only the hope of the courts to protect their legal \n     rights.\n       Just as we resist the injustice of racial profiling and the \n     assumption that we are lesser individuals because of where we \n     were born or the color of our skin, so too must we resist the \n     urge to endorse a man on the basis of his ethnic background. \n     Members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus met with Miguel \n     Estrada and came away convinced that he would harm our \n     community as a federal judge. The Mexican American Legal \n     Defense and Educational Fund and the Puerto Rican Defense and \n     Education Fund reviewed his record and came to the same \n     conclusion.\n       Are these groups fighting Miguel Estrada because they are \n     somehow anti-Hispanic? Are they saying that only people with \n     certain political views are ``true'' Latinos? Of course not. \n     They are saying that as a judge this man would do damage to \n     the rights we have fought so hard to obtain, and that we \n     cannot ignore that fact just because he is Latino. I think \n     Cesar Chavez would be turning over in his grave if he knew \n     that a candidate like this would be celebrated for supposedly \n     representing the Hispanic community. He would also be \n     dismayed that any civil rights organization would stay silent \n     or back such a candidate.\n       To my friends who think this is all about politicians \n     fighting among themselves, I ask you to think what would have \n     happened over the last 40 years if the federal courts were \n     fighting against worker's rights and women's rights and civil \n     rights. And then think about how quickly that could become \n     the world we are living in.\n       As MALDEF wrote in a detailed analysis, Estrada's record \n     suggests that ``he would not recognize the due process rights \n     of Latinos,'' that he ``would not fairly review Latino \n     allegations of racial profiling by law enforcement,'' that he \n     ``would most likely always find that government affirmative \n     action programs fail to meet'' legal standards, and that he \n     ``could very well compromise the rights of Latino voters \n     under the Voting Rights Act.''\n       Miguel Estrada is only one of the people nominated by \n     President Bush who could destroy much of what we have built \n     if they become judges. The far right is fighting for them \n     just as it is fighting for Estrada. We must fight back \n     against Estrada and against all of them. If the only way to \n     stop this is a filibuster in the Senate, I say, Que viva la \n     filibuster!\n                                  ____\n\n\nStatement of Ruben Bonilla, in Opposition to the Confirmation of Miguel \n                                Estrada\n\n       I write to join other Latinos in opposing the confirmation \n     of Miguel Estrada to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. I have \n     a long history of involvement in the Latino civil rights \n     community. I am an attorney in Corpus Christi, Texas, and am \n     a past National President of LULAC. I am deeply concerned \n     with the betterment of my community.\n       I am deeply troubled with the double standard that \n     surrounds the nomination of Miguel Estrada. It is \n     particularly troubling that some of the senators have accused \n     Democrats or other Latinos of being anti-Hispanic, or holding \n     the American dream hostage. Yet, these same senators in fact \n     prevented Latinos appointed by the Clinton Administration \n     from ever being given a hearing.

Yet, these individuals who \n     came from the top of their profession were schooled in the \n     Ivy League, were raised from modest means in the Southwest, \n     and in fact truly embodied the American Dream. These highly \n     qualified Mexican Americans never had the opportunity to \n     introduce themselves and their views to the Senate, as Mr. \n     Estrada did.\n       In addition to my concerns regarding this double standard. \n     I am also concerned that Mr. Estrada showed himself unwilling \n     to allow the Senate to fully evaluate his record. He was not \n     candid in his responses. Yet, Mr. Estrada, as every other \n     nominee who is a candidate for a lifelong appointment, must \n     be prepared to fully answer basic questions, particularly \n     where there is no prior judicial record or scholarly work to \n     scrutinize. By declining to give full and candid responses, \n     he frustrated the process. Individuals with values should be \n     called to explain those values honestly and forthrightly. We \n     can demand no less from those who would hold a lifelong \n     appointment in our system of justice.\n       Finally, I am also concerned with some of the answers that \n     Mr. Estrada did give when he was pressed. For example, I \n     understand that as an attorney he argued that the NAACP did \n     not have legal standing to press the claims of African \n     Americans who had been arrested under a particular ordinance. \n     As a former National President of LULAC, I know that on many \n     occasions LULAC has represented the rights of its membership \n     in voting cases, and in other civil rights matters. I would \n     be troubled that if he were confirmed, Mr. Estrada would not \n     find a civil rights organization to be an appropriate \n     plaintiff, and would uphold closing the courthouse door on \n     them.\n       Given these concerns, I oppose the confirmation of Mr. \n     Miguel Estrada.\n\n Statement of Belen Robles in Opposition to the Confirmation of Miguel \n                                Estrada\n\n       I write to join other Latino leaders and organizations in \n     opposing the confirmation of Miguel Estrada to the DC Circuit \n     Court of Appeals. As a native Texan, I have a very long and \n     active involvement in the Latino civil rights community and \n     have worked hard to ensure that Latinos have real choices \n     about their lives. I am a past National President of the \n     League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC).\n       I am deeply troubled with the nomination of Miguel Estrada. \n     I am very troubled with the positions he seems to have taken \n     about our youth being subjected to racial profiling. As I \n     understand his position, he does not believe that racial \n     profiling exists, and has many times argued that the \n     Constitution gives police officers unbridled authority and \n     power. In our communities, racial profiling does exist and \n     our children have been subjected to it. This is an issue that \n     Latino organizations, including LULAC have long cared about. \n     In all of the years that I was involved with civil rights, \n     LULAC always stood to protect our community, including our \n     youth when law enforcement exceeds their authority.\n       I am also concerned that Mr. Estrada did not allow the \n     Senate to fully evaluate his record. He was not open in his \n     responses, but instead was evasive. Yet, anyone appointed to \n     a lifelong position has to be willing to answer questions \n     fully. The American people have a right to know who sits in \n     our seats of justice. And to demand that the person be fair.\n       Mr. Estrada has also taken actions against organizations \n     that make me believe that he would not be fair. For example, \n     as an attorney he argued that the NAACP did not have legal \n     standing to put forward the claims of African Americans who \n     have been arrested under a particular ordinance. As a former \n     National President of LULAC, I know very well that on many \n     occasions LULAC has been a champion of the rights of its \n     membership in civil rights cases. We asserted those rights on \n     behalf of voters in voting cases in Texas, and in many other \n     civil rights cases. Under his view, Mr. Estrada could decide \n     that a civil rights organization such as LULAC would not be \n     able to sue on behalf of its members. No supporter of civil \n     rights could agree with Mr. Estrada's confirmation.\n       I oppose the confirmation of Mr. Miguel Estrada.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          Hispanic Bar Association\n\n\n                                              of Pennsylvania,\n\n                               Philadelphia, PA, January 28, 2003.\n     Hon.

Nevertheless, it \n     was the Hispanic National Bar Association's public \n     endorsement of this candidate that prompted our organization \n     to initiate its own evaluation of Mr. Estrada.\n       To that end, the HBA created a Special Committee on \n     Judicial Nominations to develop a process for reviewing and \n     potentially endorsing not only Mr. Estrada, but also all \n     future candidates for the Judiciary. As part of the process, \n     we contacted Mr. Estrada, asked to interview him, and invited \n     him as a guest of the HBA to meet the members of our \n     organization. Mr. Estrada, for stated good cause, declined \n     our invitations. Notwithstanding Mr. Estrada's non-\n     participation, the Committee completed its work and reported \n     its findings to the HBA membership on November 14, 2002. \n     Following the Committee's recommendation, the membership \n     voted not to support Mr. Estrada's nomination.\n       The HBA recognizes and applauds Mr. Estrada for his \n     outstanding professional and personal achievements. Indeed, \n     the HBA adopts the American Bar Association's rating of \n     ``well-qualified'' with regard to Mr. Estrada's professional \n     competence and integrity. However, employing the ABA's seven \n     established criteria for evaluating judicial temperament, the \n     HBA finds Mr. Estrada to be lacking. Our organization could \n     find no evidence that Mr. Estrada has demonstrated the \n     judicial position. In addition, the HBA seeks to endorse \n     individuals who have ``demonstrated awareness and sensitivity \n     to minority, particularly Hispanic concerns.'' Sadly, we also \n     could find no evidence of this quality in Mr. Estrada.\n       The HBA shares the concern of the president of the \n     Judiciary Committee that only the best-qualified and most \n     suitable individuals be appointed to the federal bench. \n     Furthermore, the HBA appreciates the efforts, as evidenced by \n     Mr. Estrada's nomination, to consider and promote members of \n     the rapidly growing Latino population to positions of high \n     visibility and importance. However, we believe that there are \n     a myriad of other well-qualified Latinos whose integrity, \n     professional competence, and judicial temperament would be \n     beyond reproach and who would therefore be better suited for \n     this position.\n       The Hispanic Bar Association of Pennsylvania regrets that \n     it cannot support the nomination of Mr. Estrada to the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. \n     We respectfully request that you oppose the confirmation of \n     his nomination.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n                                        Arlene Rivera Finkelstein,\n     President, and the Special Committee on Judicial Nominations \n        on behalf of the Hispanic Bar Association of Pennsylvania.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today is the 12th day, as remarkable \nas that seems, that the Senate is debating this nomination instead of \ndoing what it has to for the important business of the American people, \nas I see it. It is quite clear the other side is just not going to get \ncloture on this nomination. So the choice is either bring forward a \ncloture motion or move on to other business.\n  The Nation's Governors are in Washington meeting with President Bush \nand Members of Congress to discuss critically important issues, such as \nhomeland security, rising unemployment, and increasing State deficits. \nThese are serious issues that need attention, but we are delaying \ntending to the needs of the American people with endless debate on a \njudicial nominee who is refusing to tell the Senate almost anything \nabout his judicial philosophy or decisionmaking process.\n  This hide-the-ball strategy being used by Mr. Estrada, frankly, I \nthink is an affront to the Senate and the American people. We have the \nright to get complete and thoughtful answers to legitimate concerns \nabout his approach to his interpretation of the U.S. Constitution and \nthe laws of the country.\n  I was formerly a businessman. Sometimes there are processes that are \nnot dissimilar to our functions here. One of them is to be able to \nunderstand what a nominee or an appointment of a high-ranking executive \nmight include and a review of that person's potential, that person's \nexperience, that person's attitude before you put him to work.\n  My fellow Senators on the other side of the aisle would have the \nSenate, considered the most deliberative body in world history--and, I \nassume, also considered one of the most thoughtful places in the world \nin terms of Government and deliberative bodies--vote to confirm a \nnominee to a lifetime--lifetime, and it is important people realize \nthat means you cannot be fired from the job; this means you can go as \nlong as you want to, and when you are finished with your service, your \nsalary continues at exactly the same level it did when you went to work \nevery day--a lifetime appointment without disclosure of what I and my \ncolleagues consider required information.\n  In the business world, this practice would have been unheard of, and \nthe American people deserve better. If someone were seeking a post and \nthey appeared before a congressional committee or a department head and \nsaid, I would like the job, but I am not willing to answer that \nquestionnaire, that would make that aspirant unacceptable under any \ncondition. It should be a requirement when a lifetime-tenured job is \nunder discussion, something so important as the circuit court of \nappeals where people, after getting a decision from district court, go \nto get the judgment of wise and experienced people. His unwillingness \nto answer questions, to talk about what he stands for, and what he \nbelieves is a shocking disregard for appropriate behavior.\n  Responsible business owners do not hire senior managers without first \nconducting a complete and thorough review of that candidate's job \napplication. The candidate would answer questions that give \ninterviewers an opportunity to measure the candidate's decisionmaking \nprocess and views on work-related issues. A candidate cannot simply \nrefuse to answer important questions of fitness, philosophy, or \ntemperament. No business executive would hire a candidate who refused \nto answer basic inquiries. These are not private matters. They become \nthe matters of the employer, be it government or business. Those in \nbusiness would put their businesses at risk and leave themselves \nsusceptible to future lawsuits based on negligent hiring practices.\n  No one is doubting the fact Mr. Estrada is bright and intelligent, \nbut his repeated refusal to provide the Senate with any insight into \nhis views on the law and the U.S. Constitution is incomprehensible. I \njust cannot understand it. How can we make an informed decision about a \njudicial nominee if the nominee refuses to provide the Senate with \nsufficient information about his judicial philosophy and, therefore, \nhis temperament?\n  The questions being asked are not prohibited by law or judicial or \nprofessional ethics codes. Instead of entertaining continuing with \nthese dilatory tactics, the Senate should simply move on to the \nimportant business of the American people concerned about the \nprotection of their homeland; move on to repair a hemorrhaging Federal \nbudget that under this administration has been converted from a $5.6 \ntrillion surplus into a 2.$1 trillion deficit; move on to provide \nStates that are experiencing dire economic conditions with more Federal \nassistance that would help them weather the storms during these times \nof increasing unemployment, threatening war with Iraq, and a sustained \nfear of potential terrorist acts.\n  In the most recent CNN Gallup poll, 50 percent of Americans believe \nthe economy is the most pressing issue confronting the Nation. Thirty \npercent of Americans believe the war with Iraq is the most important \nissue, second to jobs and the economy.\n  The nomination of Mr. Estrada did not make the list of important \nconcerns facing the Nation. Since January 2001, the number of \nunemployed Americans has increased by nearly 40 percent, with nearly \n8.3 million Americans out of work.\n  Since President Bush took office, 2.3 million private sector jobs \nhave been lost and the unemployment rate for Latinos by way of example \nhas increased 33 percent. According to the Department of Labor, there \nare now 2.4 jobseekers for every job opening. So rather than focusing \non creating jobs for 8.3 million Americans, the Senate is targeted on \nthe job of one attorney, a very successful attorney who made a lot of \nmoney. But how does that influence what the American people see as \ntheir need?\n\n[[Page S2902]]\n\n  This is the same thinking that has produced an economic stimulus \npackage that overwhelmingly favors the top 1 percent of American \ntaxpayers while giving very little to those who really need some \neconomic help.\n  The Senate needs to move on to the important work of protecting the \nhomeland. CIA Director Tenet and FBI Director Mueller have both \ntestified that America is still vulnerable to terrorist attack, and we \nkeep on hearing alarms described in different colors. The American \npublic does not understand what the difference between red and yellow \nis. They just know it scares them. It panics them. They do not know \nwhat to do. I get phone calls from people in New Jersey asking, Should \nwe stay out of New York City? Should we not take our children on a \ntrip? Should we stay home? The answer to all of those is that we do not \nreally know, but we ought to get on with finding out.\n  The omnibus appropriations bill provides less than half of the $3.5 \nbillion in funding promised to law enforcement people, firefighters, \nand emergency medical personnel. Meanwhile, America's ports, borders, \nand critical infrastructure remain dangerously unprotected.\n  Once again, instead of focusing on protecting the homeland and \nfunding our first responders, the work of the Senate is being delayed \nin order to secure the appointment of a judicial nominee who refuses to \nshare his views with the American people.\n  I do not intend to demean or diminish the importance of this \nnomination. It is very important. To the contrary, the nomination at \nissue is to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, which is the \nmost powerful intermediate Federal appellate court, second only to the \nU.S. Supreme Court. The DC Circuit is more powerful, it is observed, \nthan other Federal courts because it has exclusive jurisdiction over a \nbroad array of far-reaching Federal regulations that enforce critical \nenvironment, consumer, and worker protection laws.\n  As history has shown, DC Circuit Court judges are often tapped to \nserve on the Supreme Court. Presently, three of the nine Supreme Court \nJustices--Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, and Ruth Bader \nGinsburg--previously served on the DC Circuit.\n  The Senate has a constitutional responsibility. The constitutional \njudicial confirmation process grants authority to the President of the \nUnited States to make the nominations and gives the Senate an equally \nsignificant role to agree by advising and consenting with the \nPresident's recommendation before a nominee can sit on the Federal \nbench. These important, mutually coexisting roles of the President and \nthe Senate are central to the democratic system of separation of powers \nand checks and balances.\n\n  Mr. Estrada must provide the Senate with a full and complete \nunderstanding of his views of the law and the Constitution, including \nimportant civil rights laws that protect all Americans, especially \nminorities, women, the elderly, and the disabled. However, if he is \nunwilling or the White House is unwilling to nominate judicial nominees \nwho are willing to answer reasonable, nonintrusive, and legitimate \ninquiries of the Senate, then these nominees should not be confirmed.\n  The role of the Senate in the confirmation process is advise and \nconsent. It does not say anyplace to rubberstamp all Presidential \nnominations. The Senate should not abdicate its responsibility to \nthoroughly review judicial nominations. It is a responsibility, it is \nan obligation, for each one of us. Rather, the Senate is dutybound to \nensure that each nominee maintains the utmost commitment to upholding \nthe Constitution of our country--following precedent, listening to \narguments without fear or favor, and rendering judgment without \npersonal bias. Miguel Estrada has failed to respond to legitimate \ninquiries to the Senate and the American people.\n  As I said before, it is time to move on to the important work of the \nAmerican people, and let this appointment fall as it should unless Mr. \nEstrada has a reckoning with himself and his obligation and comes to \nthe Senate to discuss his views in response to questions posed by the \nSenate.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is from the State of New Jersey. Of course, the \nState of New Jersey is very aware of the news that is put out in the \nNew York Times and the editorials put out in the New York Times. Is \nthat a fair statement?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. It is a very important paper, yes.\n  Mr. REID. I do not know if the Senator is aware that I read into the \nRecord this morning a New York Times editorial from last fall dealing \nwith Estrada. I ask the Senator if he is aware of the first paragraph \nof an editorial written February 13, 2003, in the New York Times?\n  Is the Senator also aware that last night the majority read into the \nRecord a number of editorials from around the country?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I am aware of that.\n  Mr. REID. Does the Senator from New Jersey know the circulation of \nthe New York Times?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I do not know precisely, but it is in the----\n  Mr. REID. It is in the millions.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I am sorry?\n  Mr. REID. It is over a million.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Over a million certainly on the weekends.\n  Mr. REID. Yes, I am sure it is.\n  Is the Senator aware of this editorial that says, paragraph No. 1, \n``The Bush administration is missing the point in the Senate battle \nover Miguel Estrada, its controversial nominee to the powerful DC \nCircuit Court of Appeals. Democrats who have vowed to filibuster the \nnomination are not engaging in 'shameful politics,' as the President \nhas put it, nor are they anti-Latino, as Republicans have cynically \ncharged. They are insisting that the White House respect the Senate's \nrole in confirming judicial nominees''?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I am. I am also aware of the fact that there are \nLatino organizations that are unalterably opposed to this nomination.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield for a question, is he aware that \nit is led by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I am aware of all that.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield for a further question, it would \nbe difficult, would it not, to say that the Congressional Hispanic \nCaucus was anti-Hispanic?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I absolutely agree that there would typically be a \ndetermination by them to support the nomination, but they are not. If \nthe Senator will help sharpen my memory, I think they said keep on \ntalking in the close of that editorial piece.\n  Mr. REID. We are going to find out. If the Senator would yield for \nanother question?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. REID. I ask if the Senator from New Jersey agrees with that first \nparagraph of the editorial that I just wrote--read. I wish I had \nwritten it, but I read it.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I agree with the Senator and wish I had written it as \nwell.\n  Mr. REID. It is a short editorial. It is only three paragraphs. I \nwill ask the Senator a question if he would yield.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. ``The Bush administration has shown no interest in working \nwith Senate Democrats to select nominees who could be approved by \nconsensus, and has dug in its heels on its most controversial choices. \nAt their confirmation hearings, judicial nominees have refused to \nanswer questions about their views on legal issues. And Senate \nRepublicans have rushed through the procedures on controversial \nnominees. Mr. Estrada embodies the White House's scorn for the Senate's \nrole. Dubbed the `stealth candidate,' he arrived with an extremely \nconservative reputation but almost no paper trail. He refused to answer \nquestions, and although he had written many memorandums as a lawyer in \nthe Justice Department, the White House refused to release them.''\n\n  Does the Senator from New Jersey agree with the statement made in \nthis editorial, second paragraph, by the New York Times?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I agree with it fully. I read that editorial. I was \nin total agreement with their logic, coming from New Jersey where we \nhad candidates who were recommended for the\n\n[[Page S2903]]\n\nappeals court languish--nothing happening for months and months and \nmonths. The protests we hear now from our friends on the other side \nabout the process are a bit shameless because we had a nominee from \nCalifornia, Mr. Paez, who waited, I believe, 1,500 days.\n  Mr. REID. One thousand five hundred four days.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Waiting for a review by the committee, and could not \nget that.\n  If we talk about obstinate approaches to the process about deliberate \nobstruction, the record is very clear.\n  When we presented candidates, when the Democrats were a majority, \nthey could not move them because the Republican side of the Senate \nwould not permit any action at all.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for an additional question?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I am happy to yield to my friend from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. The final paragraph of this short but powerful editorial, \ndoes the Senator from New Jersey agree with this:\n\n       The Senate Democratic leader, Tom Daschle, insists that the \n     Senate be given the information it needs to evaluate Mr. \n     Estrada. He says there cannot be a vote until senators are \n     given access to Mr. Estrada's memorandums and until they get \n     answers to their questions. The White House can call this \n     politics or obstruction. But in fact it is Senators doing \n     their jobs.\n\n  Would the Senator agree with this statement?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I agree 100 percent with that statement, and I think \nwe ought to get on with the business of the American people.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield for another question before he \nleaves the floor. The Senator mentioned there were aspirants to be \nappellate judges, and is the Senator aware that a number of these \npeople were from New York? Is that true?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Indeed, that is true.\n  I just got a letter from a district court judge in New Jersey, \nconsidered one of the most brilliant and able district court judges, \nwho was recommended for the circuit court of appeals in our district \nand decided after a long wait that he was not going to get a chance to \nbe heard for a circuit court job. He informs me in his letter that he \nis going back to the law firm after 10 years on the Federal bench--a \ndistinguished jurist, a great loss. He could not get a hearing, so he \ndecided to withdraw rather than sit there and be dangled like a kite in \nthe wind.\n  Mr. REID. Is the Senator aware of the names of 79 Clinton judicial \nnominees who were not confirmed by the Republicans?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I am fully aware of that. I listened when the \ndistinguished Democratic whip read that list the first time, and I took \nthe liberty of reading the list a second time to make sure it was \nclearly understood.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, it is very interesting to hear the \ndiscussions. It is very similar to what we have heard now for a couple \nof weeks. I could not agree more with the Senator from New Jersey who \nsays let's get on with it. I have a suggestion as to how we can do \nthat. There are more than a majority in this Senate who are satisfied \nwith this candidate and ready to vote. All we need to do is have an up-\nor-down vote. Those who are opposing that are in the minority. They can \nstudy as many things as they choose. The fact is, the majority of the \npeople on this floor are satisfied this candidate is the right \ncandidate and it is time to go. I could not agree more.\n  We have a lot of things to do. We have gone through the hearings, we \nhave gone through all the background, and certainly most of us would \nlike to get away from this delay tactic and get on with our work. I \nhave to say that when the majority is ready to go, that is what we \nought to do. I suggest that.\n  I will discuss another subject for a moment.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Thomas pertaining to the introduction of S. 475 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, again I hope we find ourselves in a \nposition to move forward. I don't think there is a soul here who would \nnot admit we have talked enough about this judicial nomination. I don't \nthink there is a soul here who would deny we have all made up our \nminds, we all know exactly what we are going to do. It is very clear \nthat the majority on this floor is prepared to vote for this nominee \nand we are being held up over here by a minority that simply continues \nto ask for something that is not necessary because the majority has \nalready been determined. So I hope we can move on and do the business \nof this country for these people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Crapo pertaining to the submission of S. Con. \nRes. 11 are printed in today's Record under ``Submission on Concurrent \nand Senate Resolutions.'')\n\n\n                       Judiciary Committee Action\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I wanted to come to the floor this \nafternoon to discuss a matter that occurred in the Judiciary Committee \ntoday that is deeply troubling.\n  During a mark-up of 3 controversial circuit court nominees, the \nChairman of the Judiciary Committee refused to observe the long-\nstanding rules of the committee and brought two circuit court \nnominations to a vote despite the fact that there was a desire by \nseveral members of the minority to continue debate.\n  This situation is very specifically addressed by Committee Rule No. \n4, which reads as follows:\n\n       The Chairman shall entertain a non-debatable motion to \n     bring a matter before the Committee to a vote. If there is \n     objection to bring the matter to a vote without further \n     debate, a rollcall vote of the Committee shall be taken, and \n     debate shall be terminated if the motion to bring the matter \n     to a vote without further debate passes with ten votes in the \n     affirmative, one of which must be cast by the Minority.\n\n  At the time that the chairman attempted to bring the nominations of \nJohn Roberts and Deborah Cook to a vote, objections were lodged by at \nleast 2 members of the committee.\n  In fact, I believe that this rule was read into the Record in an \neffort to make clear to the chairman that it was not appropriate under \nthe committee rules to bring these matters to a vote.\n  Despite the fact that this action represented a clear violation of \nthe committee rules, the chairman ended debate on these nominations and \nconducted a roll call vote.\n  This reckless exercise of raw power by a chairman without regard to \nthe agreed-upon standards of conduct that members of the committee have \nagreed to is ominous.\n  Senate committees either have rules or they do not. It cannot be the \ncase that the rules of a committee will apply unless the chairman deems \nthem inconvenient or an obstacle to a goal he seeks at any given \nmoment.\n  This body has, for over 200 years, operated on the principle that \ncivil debate and resolution of competing philosophies require rules. If \nthe actions taken today indicate the new standard to which the majority \nplans to hold itself, then I propose that we simply repeal committee \nrules altogether and acknowledge that ``might makes right'' and there \nis no respect for minority interests.\n  How can we expect the Judiciary Committee to place on the bench \nindividuals who respect the rule of law if the very process that the \ncommittee uses to confirm those individuals violates the Senate rules \nthemselves?\n  I hope that upon reflection the chairman of the Judiciary Committee \nwill reconvene the committee and allow for the committee to report out \nthese nominations in a manner that is consistent with the committee \nrules.\n  If not, he must recognize that he is setting a terrible precedent \nregarding the operation of Senate committees in the future, regardless \nof which party may be in control.\n  Mr. President, I am very deeply troubled. This is a body of rules. \nThis is a\n\n[[Page S2904]]\n\ncountry of laws. I cannot imagine that there is ever a time that any \none of us--any one of us--ought to be in a position to say: The rules \nin this case are not going to apply, the law in this case will not \napply.\n  And how ironic--how ironic--that in the Judiciary Committee, the \ncommittee which passes judgment on those who will interpret the rule of \nlaw, that very committee violated the rule today.\n  So, Mr. President, we call attention to this extraordinary \ndevelopment with grave concern about its implications, about its \nprecedent, about the message it sends. And I must say, it will not be \ntolerated.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Homeland Security\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there have been a number of statements over \nthe past many months about the fact that we should have been spending \nmore money on homeland security.\n  For example, this week, I had a woman come to me from Las Vegas, who \nis in charge of the 9-1-1 center at the Metropolitan Police Department, \na very large police department, with hundreds and hundreds of police \nofficers representing that urban area of some 1.5 to 1.7 million \npeople.\n  She indicated to me there is a real problem. If you have a telephone \ncall coming from a standard telephone, that person can be identified. \nThey know the location of that telephone. Or if it is a pay phone, they \nknow the location of that pay phone. But today a lot of people are \ngetting rid of their standard telephones, as we know them, and are \nusing computers, and millions and millions of people are using cell \nphones.\n  She said that for virtually every place in the United States, \nincluding the Las Vegas area, if you call 9-1-1 from a cell phone, they \nhave no idea who is making the phone call or where it is coming from. \nAnd, of course, with the computer, that is absolutely the case also.\n  She was lamenting the fact that the technology is there. It is easy \nto do what needs to be done to make sure that 9-1-1 calls that come \nfrom cell phones can be located.\n  People have lost their lives and have been injured and harm caused to \nthem as a result of 9-1-1 not being able to identify when the emergency \ncall comes in. This is only one example of how technology could handle \nthe problem.\n\n  Why isn't it being done in Las Vegas and other places? There isn't \nenough money. With what happened on September 11, there is tremendous \nneed for more money to be spent for homeland security. This was \ncertainly the opinion of the Governors who were in town this week. They \nare having all kinds of problems.\n  So, Mr. President, I would like to refer again to the New York Times. \nI have talked about an editorial, as did my friend from Idaho, in the \nNew York Times. I want to refer to a news story from the New York \nTimes, dated today, February 27, 2003, written by one Philip Shenon, \nentitled ``White House Concedes That Counterterror Budget Is Meager.'' \nIn effect, what this news article says is the White House now \nrecognizes that there isn't enough money to take care of the problems \nof homeland security.\n  In this article, among other things, the President blames the \nleadership of the House and the Senate. And, of course, that does not \ninclude the Democratic leadership, because everyone knows, including \nthe President, that we have been crying for more money for more than a \nyear.\n  There are just a couple things from this news article I would like to \npoint out to the Senate:\n\n       . . . the long delayed Government spending plan for the \n     year does not provide enough money to protect against \n     terrorist attacks on American soil.\n\n  Mr. President, this is a statement from this administration. This is \nnot a statement from the Senator from West Virginia, the senior member \nof the Appropriations Committee, who has spoken for hours and hours on \nthe need for more money. This is not a statement from Senator Daschle, \nthe Democratic leader. This is coming from the administration: White \nHouse concedes that counterterror budget is meager.\n  The article goes on to say:\n\n       . . . because it had failed to provide adequate money for \n     local counterterrorism programs.\n\n  Mr. President, throughout America today you can't have police \nagencies talking with each other. In Las Vegas, as an example, you have \nthe Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, the city of Henderson, \nand Boulder City, and they can't talk to each other in an emergency. \nThe technology is there. They can do that. But these governments simply \ndon't have the money to do that. Fire departments can't talk to police \ndepartments all over America. It is not only a problem in Nevada.\n  We have been asking that the President help with these moneys, and he \nhas been unwilling to do so. He, in effect, vetoed a multibillion \ndollar proposal we had in a bill just a short time ago. In the bill we \nhad, the big omnibus bill, we asked for a small amount of money for all \nthe demands in here. We asked for $3.5 billion, but it contains only, \nas this article indicates, about $1.3 billion in counterterrorism money \nfor local governments.\n  Now, these remarks struck some of the audiences unusually sharp, \ngiven that ``both Houses of Congress are controlled by the President's \nparty,'' as the article indicates.\n  Now, there is more in this article, and the day is late, and the snow \nis falling, but I do want to read this to make sure the picture is \nplain.\n  This is a quote from Governor Gary Locke of Washington, which is in \nthe article:\n\n       We have a lot of police agencies in the state that were \n     assured by the administration, repeatedly, that this money \n     was on the way.\n\n  Still quoting from the article:\n\n       He said that many police and fire departments had bought \n     [for example] hazardous-materials protective suits and other \n     counterterrorism equipment in the expectation that they would \n     be reimbursed by the federal government.\n       ``And now,'' Governor Locke said, ``they're going to have \n     to scramble to terminate other programs in order to cover \n     those costs.''\n  It is not only Democratic Governors complaining. Republican Governors \nare complaining. Governor Bob Taft, a Republican, said lawmakers did \nnot appropriate the amount that was recommended and earmarked for what \nthey appropriated. So it is very clear there are things we need to do \non this Senate floor that deal with more than the employment of one \nman, Miguel Estrada, a man who today, I am sure, is billing big hours \ndown at his plush office here in Washington, a man who makes hundreds \nof thousands of dollars a year.\n  There have been statements made on this floor that it is extremely \nimportant that we shift from this man's employment, one man's \nemployment, to the millions of people who are unemployed, and millions \nwho are underemployed, people who have no health insurance and are \nunderinsured and the many other problems we face.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 466\n\n  Based upon the New York Times article and the fact that the President \nof the United States has now acknowledged that the counterterror budget \nis meager, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate return to \nlegislative session and then proceed to the immediate consideration of \nS. 466, a bill to provide $5 billion for first responders, introduced \ntoday by Senator Daschle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this is no surprise. I hope that people will \nunderstand the need to go to other legislation. When we have our own \nPresident who, for more than a year, has said we have enough money, \nthere is money in the pipeline, now agreeing that we have a problem, \nthat we don't have enough money. The State of Nevada, I spoke to the \nState legislature there a week ago last Tuesday, 10 days ago, 9 days \nago. I told the legislature there, which is like 45 other State \nlegislatures around America today, they have a State that is in red \nink. I told them there are a number of reasons they are\n\n[[Page S2905]]\n\nin red ink. One is we have passed a bill called Leave No Child Behind, \nand we are leaving lots of children behind because we passed on to the \nState of Nevada and other States unfunded mandates that create \nfinancial problems for the States.\n  I also told the State legislature that what we have done in passing \ndifferent measures dealing with terrorism, we have passed on to the \nState and local governments unfunded mandates, costing the State of \nNevada and local governments millions of dollars, causing their budgets \nto be in the red significantly.\n  The President is wrong. He must help us address the problem. Senator \nDaschle's bill for $5 billion for first responders is not enough, but \nit is a step in the right direction.\n\n  We are fighting. We have now here the former chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee, now ranking member. As we speak, American forces \nare in a war in Afghanistan. People every day are being wounded and \nkilled in Afghanistan. But that has been overwhelmed by what is going \non in Iraq, or what soon will go on in Iraq.\n  We have lots of problems. We have problems in North Korea, which is a \nreal serious one. They have started their second reactor there in the \nlast few days. I was present at a briefing the other day with somebody \nfrom the administration who should know about how much the war is going \nto cost, and they don't know. The war in Iraq, they don't know. But we \nknow we have a war going on here at home to fight terrorism, and we are \nnot spending enough money to protect American people.\n  We have interests in the Middle East. We have interests in \nAfghanistan. We have interests on the Korean peninsula. We have \ninterests here, and they are being neglected. The President \nacknowledges that. What are we doing here, spending 3 weeks dealing \nwith Miguel Estrada. It is wrong. I am not surprised this unanimous \nconsent request was objected to, but even though I am not surprised, it \ndoesn't take away from the significance and really how depressed I am \nas a result of not having the adequate resources we need to take care \nof the problems dealing with homeland security.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if the Senator will yield for one question?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield to my friend.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We have heard now with some regularity from the \nadministration that they have no idea, no estimate as to what the cost \nof the war with Iraq will be, nor what the aftermath would cost; in \nother words, assuming there is a war, assuming that we occupy Iraq with \nor without others. According to General Shinseki, that could actually \ninvolve up to 100,000 troops there for some unlimited period of time. \nBut even if they disagree with that, which apparently some members of \nthe Pentagon do, we have not been able to obtain--and they claim there \nis none--an estimate of the cost of the aftermath of a war with Iraq at \nthe same time that they are asking us to put in place an additional tax \ncut.\n  Does it not strike my good friend from Nevada as being irresponsible \nto put into place tax cuts with huge costs to the Treasury when we are \nlikely on the verge of a war which has no particular estimated cost, \nand then the aftermath of that war, which could last years, in turn \nalso has no estimated cost? Does it not strike the Senator from Nevada \nas simply not being the responsible thing to do to be imposing or \nputting into place tax reductions which means losses to the Treasury, \nwhen we are right on the verge of potential expenditures which could be \nliterally hundreds of billions of dollars over a reasonably short \nperiod of time?\n  Mr. REID. Even though I would disagree with what the administration \nwould do if they had the information and wouldn't give it to us, I \nwouldn't like that, but I would at least feel more comfortable that \nthey were on top of their game. But for them to come to us and say, we \ndon't know, that says it all. If they don't know and have no estimates \nas to the cost of what post-Iraq is going to be, we should all be \nconcerned. If the general is 50 percent wrong, and it is only 100,000 \ntroops, that is a lot of troops to keep there for a period of time. \nThey don't know whether it is 2 days, 2 years or 2 decades.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. And the answer we get is there is no way to know with \ncertainty. These specifics are simply not available. There are too many \nimponderables. That is true, there are clearly some uncertainties. But \nit seems obvious to me the planners at the Pentagon must have some \nrange of time or else there is no exit strategy, or else it is forever.\n  Previous administrations have been criticized for not having exit \nstrategies, not having estimates in time, for making their estimate too \nshort: They will be home by Christmas. But that is no excuse for not \nhaving some range--that we will be there from 1 to 3 years according to \nthe best estimate. The worst case scenario is X number of years, best \ncase scenario is such and such. The best case scenario is we won't have \nproblems with the Kurds or the Shia will not be attacking the Sunni. \nThe worst case scenario is we will have those kinds of civil wars. \nThere are best case and worst case scenarios which allow planners who \nare working actually on estimated costs and exit strategies to come up \nwith some kind of an estimate upon which we can base future resources \nand expenditures of this Nation.\n  Mr. REID. People in the administration who try to be candid with \nCongress get in trouble. Larry Lindsey, the chief economic adviser to \nthe President, told us the war would cost $100 billion. He lost his \njob. I don't know if that is the only reason, but the general, a couple \ndays ago, said: We will have to have 200,000 troops. There was a mad \nrush to that poor man to get him to change his opinion, and he changed \nhis opinion and said: Maybe I was wrong, maybe it will be--and he \nmumbled around a little bit, but he gave an honest answer.\n  Mr. LEVIN. He did.\n  Mr. REID. Let's hope he doesn't lose his job. Let me also say this. \nWe have all been impressed with this movie ``A Beautiful Mind,'' which \na year ago won the Academy Award. The principle of that movie and the \nbook that I read, written by a woman named Nasar, was that this \nbrilliant man, Nash, figured out what was called the game theory. This \ndoesn't necessarily mean playing checkers.\n  He was able to determine through this brilliant mind that he had what \nwould happen if more than two people were engaged in an activity and, \nas a result of the work he did, that is what much of the cold war \nplanning was based upon--his theory, his game theory.\n  Now, for me to be told that this mighty Nation, the United States of \nAmerica, with 260 million people, with the finest educational \ninstitutions in the world--there are about 121 great universities in \nthe world, and we have about 112 of them; basically they are all in \nAmerica. So for someone to tell me that we don't know what it is going \nto cost postwar, that simply is not being candid. They know. There are \ndifferent scenarios and they have them all in those computers, and they \nknow what the different costs are going to be.\n  I say to my friend from Michigan that, through mathematics, through \ncomputer modeling, you can figure about anything out. As most everybody \nknows, my last election was real close. I won election night by 401 \nvotes. By the time it was over, I picked up 27 more votes. But on \nelection night, I had a computer man who worked with me for many years. \nHe was a fine man. He had run a number of different models for the 17 \ncounties in Nevada and he told me after the vote was out of Clark \nCounty: You cannot lose. I have run every model there is and you cannot \nlose. It will be close, but you cannot lose. He figured out with \nmathematical certainty that I could not lose. Now, I didn't believe \nhim, but he knew because he believes math doesn't lie.\n  So without belaboring the point to the Senator from Michigan, \nsomebody knows in this administration, but they are not going to tell \nus because they are afraid the American people are going to lose more \nconfidence. As reported yesterday, the Wall Street Journal reports that \nsoaring energy costs, the threat of terrorism, and a stagnant job \nmarket has sent consumer spirits plunging to levels only seen in \nrecessions. That was from yesterday. That is why they are not telling \nus.\n  I have given the Senator a very long answer to a short question, but \nI believe the administration knows and\n\n[[Page S2906]]\n\nthey are afraid to fess up to the Congress and to the American people \nwhat this war is going to cost.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Just to add one further thought, it seems to me it would \nbe absolutely irresponsible not to have a range or an estimate of what \nthe cost of a war would be in the best and worst case scenarios.\n  Mr. REID. Or middle case.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Yes, or at least a range on what is the worst case \nscenario and what is the best case scenario. I cannot believe the \nplanners at the Pentagon and the OMB do not have a range. If they don't \nhave a range, it would be irresponsible because how in heaven's name \ncan the administration then say that we can afford a tax cut of the \nsize they are proposing, when we have an impending demand for resources \nin a war that could be lengthy, costly, and then the aftermath could be \nlengthy and costly? It borders on the reckless, in terms of an economy, \nto say we don't have an estimate, we don't know whether or not it is \ngoing to be $20 billion, $40 billion, $100 billion--we don't have a \nrange; yet they are trying to persuade a majority of the Congress that \nwe ought to shrink the resources coming into the Government at the same \ntime we are on the verge of war and the aftermath of a war, which \ndoesn't have any estimated length, any estimated cost, and no troop \nestimate. We were given about a 200,000 estimate. Well, that is too \nhigh. OK, what is the ceiling that is more realistic to the people \nwho say 200,000 is too high? We are completely devoid of that.\n\n  What we are not devoid of, though, is the effort to shrink resources \nto this Government through a tax cut, which has a number of problems to \nit. One of them is that when we are facing what we are in terms of \nexpenditures, it is not the responsible thing to do.\n  Mr. REID. I would like to respond, not in a very direct way, but to \npoint out problems the Senator has outlined in his statement to me. Is \nthe Senator aware that yesterday I talked about a Pew Research Center \npoll? It is a nonpartisan organization. They are not for Democrats or \nRepublicans. This was a real big poll, where 1,254 adults were \ncontacted between February 12 and 18. For the first time in this \nadministration, the American people do not approve of the way George W. \nBush is handling the economy; 48 percent of the people disapprove. Is \nthe Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wasn't aware of the Senator's remarks, but I was aware \nof the poll.\n  Mr. REID. And the Senator talked about tax policy. This same poll \nsays that 44 percent of the American people disagree of George W. \nBush's handling of tax policy. So the Senator said it all. I appreciate \nhis asking me a question.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am going to speak about the very budget \ndocument that the Senator from Nevada and I have been discussing, \nperhaps in an indirect way. I wish to share some thoughts with the \nSenate about the proposed budget for 2004, which the President has now \nsent to Congress.\n  As always, I wanted to see where the President's priorities were--not \nin sound bites, but the actual nitty-gritty numbers in the budget \ndocument. While every budget request is important, with the economy \nsputtering the way it is and with huge Federal deficits looming and \ncritical domestic and international issues unresolved, particularly \nwhen we are facing the potential of a war and a very lengthy and \ncomplicated, expensive aftermath to that war, this budget requires \nspecial attention.\n  I have been keenly disappointed by what this attention revealed. The \nPresident's budget would do exactly what he recently said he did not \nwant to do, which was to pass our problems along to the next \ngeneration. The President made a very eloquent statement in the State \nof the Union Address, saying that we are not going to pass our problems \nalong to the next generation. But when you look at the details of the \nbudget, that is precisely what this budget request does.\n  By the administration's own calculations, this budget would have us \nrun a deficit of over a trillion dollars for the next 5 years, \nincluding record-setting deficits of over $300 billion for this year \nand next.\n  Now, the contrast here between this projection of deficit and the \n$5.5 trillion 10-year surplus that was projected in January of 2001 is \nsimply stunning. That contrast between just what 2 years ago was \nprojected for our economy--a $5.5 trillion surplus--now there are \nprojections of deficits upon deficits upon deficits--a projected \ndeficit of over a trillion dollars over the next 5 years.\n  The administration's plan estimates a non-Social Security deficit \ntotaling over $2.5 trillion to the year 2008, which would leave us with \nan additional debt of $5 trillion in 2008, which is 150 times greater \nthan what was projected just in the year 2001.\n  Why such dire fiscal predictions? First, while the tax cut in the \nyear 2001 played a huge part in putting us into the current deficit \nditch, the President's call for an additional $1.5 trillion in new tax \ncuts--most of which disproportionately benefits upper income folks--\nwill help ensure that we not only stay in the deficit ditch, which we \nare back into, but that it will be a deep deficit ditch.\n  Even Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan recognized the danger of \nsuch cuts when he spoke of the importance of curbing the deficit, not \nincreasing it.\n  That perhaps came as a surprise to some people in the administration \nwho were looking to Alan Greenspan to give support to the tax cut \nproposal and minimize, they hoped, the impact of deficits on future \neconomies. That is not what Chairman Greenspan did. He \nstraightforwardly recognized the danger of the tax cuts when he spoke \nof the importance of reducing deficits and not increasing deficits.\n  Mr. President, I see the Democratic leader is in the Chamber. I \nwithhold the remainder of my comments at this time because he has a \nvery important message relative to North Korea, and I wish to \nparticipate with him in a colloquy and presentation. So I withhold the \nremainder of my comments relative to the President's budget at this \ntime.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n\n\n                              North Korea\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nMichigan for his courtesy and appreciate very much his comments with \nregard to the budget and his extraordinary leadership with regard to \nmany issues involving our military challenges and priorities abroad.\n  Three weeks ago, I came to the Senate floor to address the \nintensifying crisis in North Korea, a country and a situation that I \nbelieve poses a risk to our Nation every bit as serious as that posed \nby Saddam Hussein. At the time, I urged President Bush immediately and \ndirectly to engage the North Korean Government in discussions to bring \nabout a verifiable end to that country's nuclear weapons program.\n  Unfortunately, the administration so far has failed to act, and, in \nthe meantime, the crisis in North Korea continues to escalate. In \nrecent days, we have seen reports that North Korea test-fired a new \nmissile, evidently that regime's idea of an inauguration present for \nSouth Korea's incoming President. Just today, the newspapers contain \nreports that North Korea has restarted one of the reactors at its \nprimary nuclear complex, a reactor that produces spent plutonium which \ncan then be converted into weapons grade material.\n  Let's be clear about what this latest provocation means. It means \nNorth Korea could have a nuclear production line up and running and \nproducing weapons grade nuclear material in a matter of months. It \nmeans the world's worst proliferator could have enough nuclear material \nto produce six to eight nuclear weapons by summer.\n  According to Brent Scowcroft, President George Bush's National \nSecurity Adviser, if we fail to act, it means ``We will soon face a \nrampant plutonium production program that could spark a nuclear arms \nrace in Asia and provide deadly exports to America's most implacable \nenemies.''\n  Unfortunately, the administration continues to insist on downplaying \nthis threat. These latest developments should confirm for anyone \nwatching that this is a crisis that only grows with each day the \nadministration fails to act. I come to the floor today to join with my \ncolleague, the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, to urge \nthe administration to act now.\n\n[[Page S2907]]\n\n  The first step toward action is to acknowledge there is a problem. \nBased on a series of administration statements that play down the \nthreat posed by North Korea's actions, it appears many in the \nadministration are not even willing to take this step. For example, for \nquite some time now, the administration refused to call this situation \neven a crisis.\n  Last month, North Korea announced its intention to withdraw from the \nNuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the cornerstone of the world's \nnonproliferation efforts, and the response from Under Secretary of \nState John Bolton, ``Not at all expected,'' and on Monday after the \nmissile test, the administration is quoted as saying that this was \n``just a periodic event.'' Secretary Powell called the test ``not \nsurprising and fairly innocuous.''\n  So what do we do? I believe we must begin by making certain we are on \nthe same page as our allies. Failure to do so will only produce a \nfailed policy. Unfortunately, while the administration says the right \nthings about the importance of coalitions, it is unwilling or unable to \ndo the right things to build a coalition.\n  The administration continues to insist on multilateral discussions \nwith the North Koreans while our friends and others have consistently \nand repeatedly urged President Bush to engage in bilateral talks. \nTherefore, the administration must redouble its efforts with our allies \nin South Korea, Japan, with the Chinese, and the Russians.\n\n  Second, we must make it clear to the North Koreans that separating \nplutonium from the spent fuel rods at Yongbyon represents an \nunacceptable threat to our collective security. We should tell North \nKorea what we expect of them directly: That if it verifiably freezes \nall nuclear activities, we and our allies are prepared to discuss the \nfull range of security issues affecting the peninsula, as well as other \nsteps North Korea can take to reenter the international community.\n  This is not news to the administration. In fact, the President \nhimself has suggested he is prepared to have just these kinds of talks.\n  Yet, I must say, regrettably, the administration still delays. It \nallows the crisis to deepen and relations with our friends who are most \ndirectly threatened by North Korea to suffer. In fact, what would \nreward North Korea is to continue to stand by while it builds a nuclear \narsenal. The danger within North Korea is too urgent for the President \nto delay this any further.\n  Finally, let me also take advantage of having my colleague, Senator \nLevin, in the Chamber to discuss a recent exchange of letters with the \nadministration on this issue. Senators Levin, Biden, and I laid out our \nconcerns to the administration about its North Korean policies and \nprovided recommendations in a series of letters. I recently received a \nresponse from Dr. Rice, and I ask unanimous consent to print our \nJanuary 31 letter and Dr. Rice's February 10 response in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 31, 2003.\n     Dr. Condoleezza Rice,\n     National Security Adviser, The White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Dr. Rice: We wrote to you earlier this month about our \n     increased concern regarding the crises on the Korean \n     peninsula. Our concern has deepended significantly as a \n     result of a report in today's New York Times, which was \n     confirmed by the Administration, that the U.S. government has \n     evidence that North Korea is removing spent nuclear fuel rods \n     from storage. These rods, which had been securely stored \n     under IAEA monitoring from 1994 until recently, reportedly \n     contain enough plutonium to produce roughtly a half dozen \n     nuclear weapons.\n       As alarming as this report is, we are just as troubled by \n     the Administration's reported reaction to these developments. \n     Prior to this disclosure, the Administration said nothing \n     publicly or privately to Congress about these activities. \n     According to comments attributed to senior Administration \n     officials, the Administration has consciously decided to hold \n     this information in an effort to avoid creating a crisis \n     atmosphere and distracting international attention from Iraq.\n       This muted response to the world's worst proliferator \n     taking concrete steps that could permit it to build a nuclear \n     arsenal stands in stark contrast to the President's statement \n     on Tuesday evening that ``the gravest danger in the war on \n     terror . . . is outlaw regimes that seek and possess nuclear, \n     chemical, and biological weapons.'' It is also increasingly \n     difficult to square the Administration's rehtroic on Iraq and \n     decades of U.S. policy aimed at discouraging the emergence of \n     declared nuclear powers with its continued downplaying of the \n     threat posed by North Korea's blatant disregard for \n     international rules on proliferation.\n       As the crisis with North Korea continues to escalate, the \n     Administration's policy has not gotten any clearer. The \n     Administration's lack of a clear, consistent policy and our \n     failure to take concrete steps to address this growing crisis \n     has produced consternation and confusion. One result is that \n     our allies in the region appear to be taking a course \n     directly at odds with the Administration's latest \n     pronouncements.\n       Given the stakes of the situation and the ongoing confusion \n     about the Administration's policy, we request that you come \n     brief the Senate as early as is practical to discuss that we \n     know about North Korea['s latest actions and what the United \n     States is doing in response.\n       We look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible\n           Sincerely,\n     Tom Daschle.\n     Joseph R. Biden, Jr.\n     Carl Levin.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 10, 2003.\n     Hon. Thomas A. Daschle,\n     Democratic Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: Thank you for your letter regarding U.S. \n     policy on North Korea.\n       I agree with you about the need to take effective action in \n     light of North Korea's recent actions to restart its nuclear \n     facilities at Yongbyon. The United States is working closely \n     with friends and allies toward our objective of the \n     elimination of North Korea's nuclear weapons program in a \n     verifiable and irreversible manner.\n       However, I disagree with the assertion contained in your \n     letter that, prior to the New York Times article on January \n     31 on recent North Korean activities, ``the Administration \n     said nothing publicly or privately to Congress about these \n     activities.'' I also reject any suggestion that the \n     Administration consciously withheld information from Congress \n     to avoid distracting attention from Iraq.\n       The Administration has regularly briefed and consulted \n     Members of Congress regarding policy toward North Korea and \n     Iraq. For example, Deputy Secretary Armitage briefed Senators \n     on January 16 on recent intelligence on activities at North \n     Korean nuclear facilities and steps taken by the \n     Administration in response to these actions. He also \n     testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on \n     February 4.\n       In addition, the CIA has routinely provided briefings and \n     written reports to Members and its oversight Committees. CIA \n     briefed Senate Foreign Relations staff on three occasions in \n     December on North Korea WMD issues, and on January 29, \n     published an article on North Korean nuclear-related \n     activities in the Senior Executive Intelligence Brief (SEIB) \n     that addressed the issues discussed in the New York Times on \n     January 31. The January 29 article was one of nine such \n     articles published in the SEIB on North Korea in January \n     alone. The SEIB is delivered daily to the CIA's oversight \n     Committees and to the Office of Senate Security where it is \n     available to Senators and appropriately-cleared staff.\n       In the days and weeks ahead, it is my hope that we can work \n     together to address the challenges we face on a range of \n     critical national security issues, including North Korea and \n     Iraq.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Condoleezza Rice,\n\n                                        Assistant to the President\n                                    for National Security Affairs.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Unfortunately, little in Dr. Rice's letter addresses our \npolicy concerns. Rather, the bulk of her comments are dedicated to \nrebutting a claim in our letter that Congress has not been adequately \nconsulted about some explosive findings revealed in a January 31 New \nYork Times article.\n  The article stated that the U.S. Government has evidence North Korea \nhad begun moving spent fuel rods out of a secure storage area, a \ndevelopment that was subsequently confirmed by the administration. \nMovement of spent fuel rods would either suggest that North Korea was \ngetting ready to reprocess that fuel to build new weapons or was trying \nto hide the spent fuel from the international community. In either \ncase, this is a very significant finding that we believed then and \nstill believe deserves to be brought to the Congress's attention.\n  While Dr. Rice rightly points out that Congress has been briefed on \nNorth Korea issues generally, including a briefing by Deputy Secretary \nArmitage on January 16, we are not aware of any administration briefing \nthat provided us with information on this specific development prior to \nthe New York Times story. And in recent testimony before the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee, Deputy Secretary Armitage implicitly \nacknowledged that fact.\n\n[[Page S2908]]\n\n  The reason to bring this up is because we are facing a crisis on the \nKorean peninsula, a crisis with extremely high stakes, a crisis that \ndemands robust American response, a crisis that demands we be clear \nwith each other and with the American people. Given the stakes of the \nsituation and the ongoing confusion about the administration's policy, \nwe should expect no less.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, will the Democratic leader yield just for \nsome questions?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Before I yield the floor, I am happy to yield to the \ndistinguished Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is the Senator aware of a statement which was made before \nus--I do not know how he would be, but let me brief him on it. We had \nthe head of the Defense Intelligence Agency in front of the Armed \nServices Committee a couple of days ago, and we asked him whether or \nnot in his judgment there was a crisis on the Korean peninsula because \nof the actions of North Korea in removing these seals from the spent \nfuel, eliminating the cameras and kicking out the inspectors. Even \nthough the administration is unwilling to put the label ``crisis'' on \nwhat is going on on the Korean peninsula, Admiral Jacoby was more than \nwilling to say, yes, this is a crisis.\n  I am wondering if the Democratic leader would agree that part of the \nproblem that we have in dealing with the North Korean situation is the \nunwillingness to see it for what it is, which is a major proliferation \nthreat when there is a country that has been the world's greatest \nproliferator, including Libya and Iran, missiles and missile \ntechnology, when there is a country with a nuclear program that they \nacknowledge removes the inspectors from its country, whether or not \nthat would represent progress if we could just at least get the \nadministration to acknowledge what the head of the Defense Intelligence \nAgency says, which is that we have a crisis on the Korean peninsula?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I think the Senator asks a very good question. This is \nmore than just a semantical issue. Whether one calls it a crisis, an \nemergency, whatever volatile term one wishes to apply, clearly this \ndeserves more of a response than this administration has provided.\n  I wonder what would have happened if Iraq had been the country with \nthe evidence now to suggest that weapons of mass destruction, nuclear \nweapons, would be produced with the degree of certainty that we now see \nthem in North Korea, what would the administration have said to that? \nIf Iraq had fired a test missile within the last 2 weeks, what would \nthe administration have said of that? My hunch, is that they would have \nused the word ``crisis'' and then some.\n  They have already claimed, of course, that North Korea is a member of \nthe so-called axis of evil, an unfortunate term in my opinion. But to \navoid using the word ``crisis,'' I believe, lends a real serious \ncredibility question to the administration's foreign policy with regard \nto the region. This is a crisis. Every expert has acknowledged that it \nis a crisis. Unless we are willing to recognize the reality of the \nimplications of this crisis, I believe the crisis will only worsen.\n  The Senator from Michigan has made a very important point with his \nquestion.\n  Mr. LEVIN. In addition to looking a problem square in the eye and not \nsugarcoating it, if we are going to solve it, another part of the \nadministration's platform relative to Korea, or approach to the Korean \nproblem, is to say that the multilateral approach is the right \napproach. I am always glad to hear when the administration is willing \nto work multilaterally. I have been a critic of the administration \nbecause their unilateral rhetoric activities, it seems to me, have been \ncounterproductive in many parts of the world. So whenever the \nadministration talks about a multilateral approach or consulting with \nallies and friends, that is good news. But when they do the \nconsultation, when they talk to South Korea, both its former President \nand its new President, as well as when they talk to China, as well as \nwhen they talk to Japan, as well as when they talk to other allies in \nthe area, they are told the same thing. When they do use the \nmultilateral approach, they are told: Engage in direct discussions with \nNorth Korea. As a matter of fact, the representative of the new \nPresident of South Korea, the special envoy of new President Roh, \nvisited us. His name is Dr. Chyung, and he visited with us on February \n3.\n\n  That was, again, the open advice, he said, of the South Korean \nGovernment, is to have the United States talk directly with North Korea \nso that they can hear from us what our concerns are; so that both sides \ncan avoid any kind of miscalculations; so that we do not fuel the \nparanoia this isolated regime has. They are paranoid. They are \nisolated. They actually believe we might strike them with one of our \npreemptive strikes. They actually believe it.\n  So the advice we are getting when we talk to our allies and follow \nthis multilateral approach is engage with North Korea, and yet we \nrefuse to do so.\n  I am wondering whether the Senator would agree that it is not only \nimportant that we consult with allies, not necessarily follow the \nadvice but at least give serious consideration to the advice they give \nus when they talk to us about a direct engagement with North Korea to \navoid miscalculation, so that the North can hear directly from us what \nour major concerns are?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I appreciate the question posed by the Senator from \nMichigan. This whole experience has turned logic on its head. We have \n220,000 troops in the gulf. We are told that there is almost an \ninevitability of war. We are told that the reason for this near \ninevitability is because of weapons of mass destruction that we have \nyet to find in Iraq and because of an unstable leader in Iraq.\n  These assertions have required the administration to go to great \nlengths to try to prove that their findings are ones that could be \nrecognized by the world community. With all of their best effort, they \nhave yet to demonstrate to the satisfaction of some of our allies that \nthe threat exists to the extent the administration perceives it, and \nyet there is a clear set of circumstances that are undeniable in North \nKorea. There is a very questionable leader spurring development of \nnuclear weapons in the most rapid way, which we know could be sold \nquickly to terrorist organizations and used against us and the world \ncommunity. Yet this administration chooses to ignore it.\n  The Senator asks the question, why would we not engage the community \nand recognize the importance of confronting North Korea? The \nadministration says the answer to that is they do not want to reward \nbad behavior.\n  I argue that we are rewarding bad behavior by ignoring the \ncircumstances as this administration has chosen to do. What could be \nworse behavior than what is going on right now?\n  As I understand it, we began to reship food assistance to the North \nKorean people within the last few days. We have no real guarantee that \naid is going to get to the people, but it is a very unusual message \nthey are sending to both Iraq and North Korea. Of all those who would \nbe most confused it would be our allies. How do they explain all of \nthis? What credibility do we have with them as we attempt to \nrationalize this odd position we find ourselves in today?\n  I appreciate the question, and I would simply say to my colleague \nthat it begs further explanation by the administration which, again, \nbecause they refuse to call this a crisis, they have yet to provide.\n  Mr. LEVIN. This administration has blown hot and cold when it comes \nto policy relative to North Korea.\n  I just have one final question.\n  The Democratic leader points out just how confusing a policy it is, \nnot just for North Korea but for our own allies. Our ally with the most \nat stake on the Korean peninsula is South Korea. They could be \ndestroyed if there is a miscalculation. Their capital is within range \nof tens of thousands of artillery of North Korea.\n  On March 6, 2001, on the eve of a summit between then South Korean \nPresident Kim Jong-Il and President Bush, Secretary of State Powell \nsaid we plan to engage with North Korea and to pick up where President \nClinton and his administration left off.\n  Within 24 hours was the Secretary of State's statement that we were \ngoing to engage with North Korea and pick\n\n[[Page S2909]]\n\nup where the Clinton administration left off because the Clinton \nadministration obtained the framework agreement that resulted in the \ncanning of that very material which is so dangerous which contains \nplutonium. Within 24 hours, at the summit the next day, President Bush \nbasically said: We are not going to have any discussions with North \nKorea. We are not picking up where the Clinton administration left off. \nWe do not trust North Korea.\n  No kidding. That is a mild statement, that we do not trust North \nKorea. If we did not talk to people we did not trust, we would not be \ntalking to half of the world, including some of the most dangerous \npeople in the world.\n  Talking to people does not mean we are going to reward anything. It \nsimply means they will hear directly, eyeball to eyeball, from us as to \nwhat our concerns are, and also why we do not threaten them, and why, \nif they will terminate their nuclear program, they can rest assured \nthey will get an agreement from us that there is not going to be any \nactive aggression against them.\n  The blowing hot and cold, the erratic policy, the undermining not \njust of our own Secretary of State 24 hours after he said we would \ncontinue a policy, but undermining our South Korean allies with so much \nat stake, it seems to me has contributed to a very uncertain policy on \nthe Korean peninsula, has sowed the seeds of confusion, and fueled and \ncontributed to the paranoia that already existed in spades in North \nKorea.\n  I have been to Yongbyon, the place in North Korea where they were \ncanning those fuel rods, where they had sealed them. I don't know that \nany other Member of the Congress got there, but I got there a couple \nyears ago. I watched the International Atomic Energy Agency as they \nwere sealing those fuel rods. That was a very positive thing to watch, \nto actually see, under IAEA inspection and supervision, those \nincredibly dangerous nuclear materials being canned instead of \nthreatening to the rest of the world as potential proliferated \nmaterial, to actually see it put under the supervision of the IAEA.\n  That is now out the window. We are starting from scratch. I \nunderstate my feelings on the matter when I say the Senator, the \nDemocratic leader here, has so accurately stated the fact that we have \na problem. Step 1 is to recognize we indeed have a crisis. Step 2 is \nnot just to consult with allies but to seriously consider what they \nrecommend when they talk about having direct engagement with the North \nKoreans.\n  I thank the Democratic leader for his constant determination to keep \nthis Korean peninsula crisis in front of us. We cannot lose sight of \nit. It is a greater threat than Iraq because in North Korea you have a \nknown proliferator who has removed the inspectors and who has nuclear \nmaterial which could be so easily distributed, shipped, or sold to \npeople who could do great harm with it.\n\n  I thank my friend from South Dakota.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the distinguished Senator from Michigan.\n  We can learn a lot from history. History, for most of my lifetime, \ninvolved a cold war, a cold war with an archenemy--the Soviet Union--\nwhich had thousands of nuclear warheads pointed toward the United \nStates. They posed an imminent threat that could at any moment destroy \nall of civilization.\n  We made the choice, for good reason, Republican and Democratic \nadministrations made the choice, that rather than engage in conflict, \nwe would contain, negotiate, disarm, and ultimately wear down those \nleaders of the Soviet Union. That is ultimately what happened. The \nSoviet Union collapsed, negotiations for disarmament continued, and I \nrecognize the contribution of many Presidents, from Harry Truman on.\n  But it was Ronald Reagan who said: Trust but verify. He did not say: \nI don't trust the Soviet Union, so I'm not going to enter into dialog \nwith them. He was criticized at times, but he said: I'm going to engage \nin dialog. I'm going to continue the effort of my predecessors. I'm \ngoing to trust. But then I'm going to verify.\n  What the Senator from Michigan noted is that a couple of years ago \nthat verification process was underway. We trusted. And we verified. \nHis site visit was an indication of that verification.\n  I can only hope that those responsible for the day-to-day decisions \nmade with regard to U.S. foreign policy will recognize the importance \nof past precedent, that we engage our enemies, we engage those whom \nthere is ample reason to distrust, but we recognize that without some \ncommunication, without some engagement, the only other option is \nconflict.\n  The only other option is to see what is happening today. Nuclear \nweapons are being constructed. Nuclear weapons are being stockpiled. \nNuclear weapons could be shipped. Nuclear weapons could be used not \nonly in the region but against this country, as well. Every day we \ndelay, every day we lack the will to confront and communicate, every \nday we lack the desire to verify, every day we create a problem more \ncomplex for future leaders and for future American policy.\n  I hope this administration will very carefully reconsider their \nposition. I hope they will listen to our allies. I hope they will \nengage the North Koreans. I hope they can give us greater appreciation \nwith greater clarity of their intentions with regard to that part of \nthe world.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/27/senate-section/article/S2909-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2909]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BENNETT.

Mr. President, this morning's Washington Post has an \nespecially long editorial. Indeed, it takes up the entire length of the \neditorial page. It is entitled ``Drumbeat on Iraq, a Response to \nReaders.''\n  I have a dear friend in Utah who wrote me. She was distraught--is \ndistraught, I am sure--about the prospect of going to war and expressed \na great many concerns. I have been in the process of constructing what \nI hope is a responsible and thoughtful response to her concerns. As I \nread the editorial in this morning's Washington Post, I found that it \ndoes a better job than I could do of summarizing many, if not most, of \nthe issues about which she is concerned. I want to read from sections \nof the editorial and then ask unanimous consent that it be printed in \nthe Record at the end of my remarks.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BENNETT. In the editorial they say:\n\n       The right question, though, is not, ``Is war risky?'' but \n     ``Is inaction less so?'' No one can provide more than a \n     judgment in reply. But the world is already a dangerous \n     place. Anthrax has been wielded in Florida, New York and \n     Washington. Terrorists have struck repeatedly and with \n     increased strength over the past decade. Are the United \n     States and its allies ultimately safer if they back down \n     again and leave Saddam Hussein secure? Or does safety lie in \n     making clear that his kind of outlaw behavior will not be \n     tolerated and in helping Iraq become a peaceable nation that \n     offers no haven to terrorists? We would say the latter. . . .\n\n  As I say, I could not have put it better, which is why I have quoted \nit. I have raised the question on the floor before: What are the \nconsequences if we do not follow through in Iraq? Some have said let's \njust leave the troops in place. And that means Iraq remains contained.\n  Leaving the troops in place is not an option. We must understand that \nthe troops are where they are, poised to move into Iraq, because of the \nagreement of the governments in Qatar, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia, among \nothers. Those governments will not allow our troops to remain on their \nsoil indefinitely. They will not allow those troops to remain there \nwhile we contain Saddam Hussein for 6 months or 12 months or 12 years, \nwhich has been the period of ``containment'' that we have seen up until \nnow. We must either withdraw those troops and say we are\n\n[[Page S2910]]\n\nnot going to move ahead militarily or, if Saddam Hussein does not \ndisarm in accordance with the U.N. resolutions, those troops will move \nforward into his territory. We have no other choice: Move forward or \nwithdraw.\n  For those who say the inspectors should be allowed to do their job, \nwe must understand that the only reason the inspectors are there is \nbecause the troops are there. So we are coming down to the decision \npoint, that is very clear.\n  Again, back to the editorial:\n\n       Some argue now that, because Saddam Hussein has not in the \n     intervening half decade used his arsenal, Mr. Clinton was \n     wrong. . . .\n\n  I should say that the editorial quotes President Clinton as outlining \nthe case against Saddam Hussein in 1998.\n\n       Some would argue now that, because Saddam Hussein has not \n     in the intervening half decade used his arsenal, Mr. Clinton \n     was wrong and the world can rest assured that Iraq is \n     adequately ``contained.'' Given what we know about how \n     containment erodes over time; about Saddam Hussein's single-\n     mindedness compared with the inattention and divisions of \n     other nations; and about the ease with which deadly weapons \n     can move across borders, we do not trust such an assurance. \n     Mr. Clinton understood, as Mr. Bush understands, that no \n     president can bet his nation's safety on the hope that Iraq \n     is ``contained.'' We respect our readers who believe that war \n     is the worst option. But we believe that, in this case, long-\n     term peace will be better served by strength than by \n     concessions.\n\n  There is one other issue that was raised by my friend in Utah to \nwhich the editorial does not speak. This is the issue of first strike. \nMy friend says we cannot cross the line of having the United States be \ninvolved in a first strike against a nation that has not attacked us.\n  One of the arguments I have heard on this score is that if we do it, \nwe will set a precedent that will allow other nations to do it. Other \nnations that we do not want to do it will say we can do it because the \nUnited States did.\n  If I may, without being disrespectful to that argument, I would point \nout that Adolph Hitler did not need a precedent from the United States \nto attack Poland. He made up his own excuse. He pretended that Poland \nhad attacked him. He dressed prisoners in Polish military uniforms, \nmurdered them, and then had them found by German soldiers on German \nsoil who said they were shot as they tried to invade Germany.\n  The setting of a precedent by the United States or the not setting of \na precedent by the United States will have absolutely no effect on the \nactions of a brutal dictator who decides to attack his neighbors in a \nfirst strike fashion. Saddam Hussein didn't quote precedent when he \nattacked Kuwait in the early 1990s. He went ahead and did it, and would \nhave done it again whether he had precedent or not.\n  Having said that, however, I want to review a little bit of American \nhistory. It may not be history of which we are proud, for those who say \nwe have never committed a first strike, but it is history nonetheless \nof which we must be aware. I have not taken the time to research all \nexamples of this because my memory provides me with enough to make the \npoint.\n  I remember when Lyndon Johnson sent the Marines into the Dominican \nRepublic, for what purpose I cannot recall. But this was not a country \nthat had attacked us and we sent military forces in there on the \ngrounds that there was some American interest that had to be protected.\n  Ronald Reagan sent the Marines into Grenada. His reason was that the \nlegitimate Government of Grenada requested it.\n  In his book, ``The Rise and Fall of the Soviet Empire,'' Brian \nCrozier referred to the American military action in Grenada as one of \nthe key turning points in the cold war. He said if the United States \nhad not moved into Grenada and removed the Communist government there, \nthe cold war would have lasted considerably longer and been more \ndevastating.\n  There was no international clamor against President Reagan when he \ndid this. He believed it was in America's best interests, and at least \none historian has said it was not only in America's best interests, it \nwas in the world's best interests for Ronald Reagan to have done what \nhe did in Grenada.\n  In the waning days of his Presidency, the first President Bush sent \nAmerican troops into Somalia. Somalia had not attacked us and did not \nrepresent any threat. The troops were there presumably on a \nhumanitarian mission, but they were sent in to deal with a military \nsituation in that country that President Bush thought had to be dealt \nwith. Those troops were withdrawn by the Clinton administration. But, \nonce again, this was not a circumstance where America had been attacked \nbut one where an American President sent American troops and there was \nno international outcry, no international complaint.\n  Shortly after I came to the Senate, President Clinton invaded Haiti. \nOur former colleague, Sam Nunn, was in Haiti just prior to the time \nwhen the American military entered that country, and he debriefed a \nnumber of us after he came back. He pointed out that the only reason \nthere was not bloodshed when the American troops entered Haiti was \nbecause the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Colin Powell, \nwent with Senator Nunn and former President Jimmy Carter to Haiti and \nGeneral Powell was able to convince the Haitian general in charge of \ntheir military that it was not dishonorable for the Haitian general to \nsave the lives of his troops and allow the Americans to come in without \nmilitary opposition.\n  As I recall it from Senator Nunn, the Haitian general was determined \nthat it was his duty as a military man to resist any invasion of his \ncountry, no matter how hopeless that resistance might be. And he \ngathered his family around him, his wife and his children, hugged them \ntogether and said: This is our last night on Earth because tomorrow the \nAmericans are invading and I will be killed.\n  As I say, General Powell sat down with the Haitian general, convinced \nhim that his first duty as a military officer was to protect the lives \nof his troops, and that he was not doing a dishonorable thing if he did \nnot mount a hopeless resistance against the Americans.\n  Once again, there was no international outcry against the American \ndecision to send troops into Haiti. Looking back on it, it was not \nnecessarily a wise thing to have done. We replaced a brutal dictator \nmuch beloved by American conservatives with a brutal dictator much \nbeloved by American liberals. But the average Haitian has not seen any \nimprovement in his or her lifestyle. Indeed, those who have been to \nHaiti recently tell me things are worse now than they were before the \nAmericans invaded.\n  Then we have the former Yugoslavia, a country that represented no \nthreat to the United States and had not attacked the United States, but \nthe United States led a national coalition in war upon that nation.\n  Why did we do it? We did it because, under Milosevic, that nation had \nproduced enough casualties within its borders to begin to approach 20 \npercent of the size of the Holocaust. They killed that many of their \nown people, and the Americans felt that was a serious enough challenge \nto require us to go ahead.\n  Now we have just heard a speech by the Senator from Michigan with \nrespect to North Korea. We are being asked, Why are we not doing more \nwith respect to North Korea? I will not respond to the Senator from \nMichigan or the Democratic leader in that vein. But I will point out \nthat the attitude around the world and, indeed, here in the Senate is \nwhy the United States isn't taking care of this. If I might add one \nword to that question, Why isn't the United States taking care of this \nunilaterally? In other words, the United States should handle this all \nby themselves, according to speeches that are made here and in the \nworld community.\n  I run through this history simply to make this point: It is not \naccurate to say the proposed action in Iraq is either unprecedented in \nAmerican history or illegal under American or international law. The \naction that is proposed with respect to Iraq is in the tradition of \nthese humanitarian missions that I have described.\n  Some of them have gone wrong. Some of them have turned out not to \nproduce a humanitarian result. But in every case there was no prior \ncomplaint raised against the proposal that we do this on the ground \nthat this was an unacceptable first strike against a\n\n[[Page S2911]]\n\ndefenseless neighbor. In every circumstance, it went forward with full \napproval. I voted against the move into Haiti. But the President \nappropriately came to the Congress and got approval before he did it.\n  President Bush has come to the Congress, and by a 77-23 vote in this \nbody and an equally lopsided vote in the other body, has approval \nbefore he goes into Iraq. This is not a stealth attack like Pearl \nHarbor under the cover of night. This is something that has been \ndebated and laid before the United Nations. The United Nations, by a \n15-0 vote in the Security Council, announced to Iraq if she did not \ndisarm, she would face serious consequences, and serious consequences \nin United Nations speak means war. This is not something that is done \nhidden or in a corner or in the dark.\n  So we come back now to the fundamental question: Is it safer to go \nahead with an operation in Iraq than it is to pull down the American \ntroops and bring them home? I agree with the editorial writers of the \nWashington Post. This is an agonizing decision. This is not one to be \nmade lightly, and I am sure from conversations with him that the \nPresident is not going to make it lightly. He is going to weigh all of \nthe consequences. But I believe in the end he will come to the same \nconclusion that the Washington Post editorial writers have come to and \nthat I have come to. Whatever the unknowns on either side, the present \nevidence suggests that the most dangerous thing we could do with \nrespect to the situation in Iraq is to back down if Iraq does not \ncomply with the United Nations resolution. To pull our troops out of \nIraq does not comply with the demands that the world has made upon it. \nThe safest thing to do if Iraq does not comply is to carry through with \nthe resolution that was adopted on this floor by an overwhelming \nmargin, adopted in the Security Council of the United Nations \nunanimously, and not hold back.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 27, 2003]\n\n              ``Drumbeat'' on Iraq? A Response to Readers\n\n       ``I have been a faithful reader of The Washington Post for \n     almost 10 years,'' a recent e-mail to this page begins. \n     ``Recently, however, I have grown tired of your bias and \n     endless drumbeating for war in Iraq.'' He's not the only one. \n     The national and international debate over Saddam Hussein's \n     weapons of mass destruction, and our editorials in favor of \n     disarming the dictator, have prompted a torrent of letters, \n     many approving and many critical. They are for the most part \n     thoughtful and serious; the antiwar letters in particular are \n     often angry and anguished as well. ``It is truly depressing \n     to witness the depths Washington Post editors have reached in \n     their jingoistic rush to war,'' another reader writes. It's a \n     serious charge, and it deserves a serious response.\n       That answer, given the reference to ``Washington Post \n     editors,'' probably needs to begin with a restatement of the \n     separation at The Post between news and editorial opinion \n     functions. Those of us who write editorials have no influence \n     over editors and reporters who cover the news and who are \n     committed to offering the fairest and most complete \n     journalism possible about the standoff with Iraq. They in \n     turn have no influence over us.\n       For our part, we might begin with that phrase ``rush to \n     war.'' In fact there is nothing sudden or precipitous about \n     our view that Saddam Hussein poses a grave danger. In 1990 \n     and 1991 we supported many months of diplomacy and pressure \n     to persuade the Iraqi dictator to withdraw his troops from \n     Kuwait, the neighboring country he had invaded. When he \n     failed to do so, we supported the use of force to restore \n     Kuwait's independence. While many of the same Democrats who \n     oppose force now opposed it then also, we believe war was the \n     correct option--though it was certainly not, at the time, the \n     only choice. When the war ended, we supported--in hindsight \n     too unquestioningly--a cease-fire agreement that left Saddam \n     Hussein in power. But it was an agreement, imposed by the \n     U.N. Security Council, that demanded that he give up his \n     dangerous weapons.\n       In 1997 and 1998, we strongly backed President Clinton when \n     he vowed that Iraq must finally honor its commitments to the \n     United Nations to give up its nuclear, biological and \n     chemical weapons--and we strongly criticized him when he \n     retreated from those vows. Mr. Clinton understood the stakes. \n     Iraq, he said, was a ``rogue state with weapons of mass \n     destruction, ready to use them or provide them to terrorists, \n     drug traffickers or organized criminals who travel the world \n     among us unnoticed.''\n       When we cite Mr. Clinton's perceptive but ultimately empty \n     comments, it is in part to chide him and other Democrats who \n     take a different view now that a Republican is in charge. But \n     it has a more serious purpose too. Mr. Clinton could not \n     muster the will, or the domestic or international support, to \n     force Saddam Hussein to live up to the promises he had \n     made in 1991, though even then the danger was well \n     understood. Republicans who now line up behind President \n     Bush were in many cases particularly irresponsible; when \n     Mr. Clinton did bomb Iraqi weapons sites in 1998, some GOP \n     leaders accused him of seeking only to distract the nation \n     from his impeachment worries. Through the end of Mr. \n     Clinton's tenure and the first year of Mr. Bush's \n     presidency, Saddam Hussein built up his power, beat back \n     sanctions and found new space to rearm--all with the \n     support of France and Russia and the acquiescence of the \n     United States.\n       After Sept. 11, 2001, many people of both parties said--and \n     we certainly hoped--that the country had moved beyond such \n     failures of will and politicization of deadly foreign \n     threats. An outlaw dictator, in open defiance of U.N. \n     resolutions, unquestionably possessing and pursuing \n     biological and chemical weapons, expressing support for the \n     Sept. 11 attacks: Surely the nation would no longer dither in \n     the face of such a menace. Now it seems again an open \n     question. To us, risks that were clear before seem even \n     clearer now.\n       But what of our ``jingoism,'' our ``drumbeating''? Probably \n     no editorial page sin could be more grievous than whipping up \n     war fever for some political or trivial purpose. And we do \n     not take lightly the risks of war--to American and Iraqi \n     soldiers and civilians first of all. We believe that the Bush \n     administration has only begun to prepare the public for the \n     sacrifices that the nation and many young Americans might \n     bear during and after a war. And there is a long list of \n     terrible things that could go wrong: anthrax dispersed, \n     moderate regimes imperiled, Islamist recruiting spurred, oil \n     wells set afire.\n       The first question, though, is not ``Is war risky?'' but \n     ``Is inaction less so?'' No one can provide more than a \n     judgment in reply. But the world is already a dangerous \n     place, Anthrax has been wielded in Florida, New York and \n     Washington. Terrorists have struck repeatedly and with \n     increasing strength over the past decade. Are the United \n     States and its allies ultimately safer if they back down \n     again and leave Saddam Hussein secure? Or does safety lie in \n     making clear that his kind of outlaw behavior will not be \n     tolerated and in helping Iraq become a peaceable nation that \n     offers no haven to terrorists? We would say the latter while \n     acknowledging the magnitude of the challenge, both during and \n     especially after any war that may have to be fought. And we \n     would say also that not only terrible things are possible: To \n     free the Iraqi people from the sadistic repression of Saddam \n     Hussein, while not the primary goal of a war, would surely be \n     a blessing.\n       Nor is it useful merely to repeat that war ``should only be \n     a last resort,'' as the latest French-German-Russian \n     resolution states, or that, as French President Jacques \n     Chirac said Monday, Iraq must disarm ``because it represents \n     a danger for the region and maybe the world . . . But we \n     believe this disarmament must happen peacefully.'' Like \n     everyone else, we hope it does happen peacefully. But if it \n     does not--if Saddam Hussein refuses as he has for a dozen \n     years--should that refusal be accommodated?\n       War in fact has rarely been the last resort for the United \n     States. In very recent times, the nation could have allowed \n     Saddam Huss- sein to swallow Kuwait. It could have allowed \n     Slobodan Milosevic to expel 1 million refugees from \n     Kosovo. In each case, the nation and its allies fought \n     wars of choice. Even the 2001 campaign against Afghanistan \n     was not a ``last resort,'' though it is now remembered as \n     an inevitable war of self-defense. Many Americans argued \n     that the Taliban had not attacked the United States and \n     should not be attached; that what was needed was a police \n     action against Osama bin Laden. We believed they were \n     wrong and Mr. Bush was right, though he will be vindicated \n     in history only if the United States and its allies stay \n     focused on Afghanistan and its reconstruction.\n       So the real questions are whether every meaningful \n     alternative has been exhausted, and if so whether war is wise \n     as well as justified. The risks should be minimized. Everyone \n     agrees, for example, that the United States would be stronger \n     before and during a war if jointed by many allies, and even \n     better positioned if backed by the United Nations. If waiting \n     a month, or three months, would ensure such backing, the wait \n     would be worthwhile.\n       But the history is not encouraging. The Security Council \n     agreed unanimously in early November that Iraq was a danger; \n     that inspectors could do no more than verify a voluntary \n     disarmament; and that a failure to disarm would be considered \n     a ``material breach.'' Now all agree that Saddam Hussein has \n     not cooperated, and yet some countries balk at the \n     consequences--as they have, time and again, since 1991. We \n     have seen no evidence that an additional three months would \n     be helpful. Nor does it strike us as serious to argue that \n     the war should be fought if Mr. Chirac and German Chancellor \n     Gerhard Schroeder agree, but not if they do not. If the war \n     is that optional, it should not be fought, even if those \n     leaders do agree; if it is essential to U.S. national \n     security, their objections ultimately cannot be dispositive.\n       In 1998, Mr. Clinton explained to the nation why U.S. \n     national security was, in fact, in danger. ``What if he fails \n     to comply and we fail to act, or we take some ambiguous third \n     route, which gives him yet more opportunities to develop this \n     program of weapons of\n\n[[Page S2912]]\n\n     mass destruction?  . . . Well, he will conclude that the \n     international community has lost its will. He will then \n     conclude that he can go right on and do more to rebuild an \n     arsenal of devastating destruction. And some day, some way, I \n     guarantee you he'll use the arsenal.''\n       Some argue now that, because Saddam Hussein has not in the \n     intervening half-decade use his arsenal, Mr. Clinton was \n     wrong and the world can rest assured that Iraq is adequately \n     ``contained.'' Given what we know about how containment \n     erodes over time; about Saddam Hussein's single-mindedness \n     compared with the inattention and divisions of other nations; \n     and about the ease with which deadly weapons can move across \n     borders, we do not trust such an assurance. Mr. Clinton \n     understood, as Mr. Bush understands, that no president can \n     bet his nation's safety on the hope that Iraq is \n     ``contained.'' We respect our readers who believe that war is \n     the worst option. But we believe that, in this case, long-\n     term peace will be better served by strength than by \n     concessions.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM.

Mr. President, it is with great sadness that I rise \ntonight on the Senate floor to talk about the life of Fred Rogers from \nmy hometown of Pittsburgh, PA. Mr. Rogers died today of stomach cancer. \nIt is a very sad time for all of us--at least to my generation--who \nremembers Mr. Rogers from public television, and certainly from my \nexperience with him and the wonderful work that he did for children not \njust all over the country, frankly, but all over the world, certainly, \nand very importantly to the people of southwestern Pennsylvania.\n  In fact, I had the pleasure and the honor of having lunch with him in \nthe Senate dining room just a couple of months ago around Christmas \nbefore he found out that he was stricken with stomach cancer. He was \nhere to talk about, predictably, what we can and should be doing to \nhelp create a culture that is more nurturing to children in the United \nStates of America.\n  In times when just about every figure in public life has some \ncontroversy surrounding them, he is someone who throughout his life \nescaped that controversy and stood as a beacon of caring, compassion, \nand thoughtfulness to parents and children alike.\n  Mr. Rogers was born in Latrobe, PA, south side of Pittsburgh in 1928. \nHe married his wife 51 years ago, back in 1952. His wife Joanne \nsurvives him today.\n  Very early in his career he had a gift for the media and a heart for \ntrying to reach children and touch children and educate and nurture \nchildren through the media. He worked in a variety of different things. \nBut in 1966, he created and hosted ``Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood.'' Before \nthat, he worked on a series in Canada for the CBC. And he worked at \nWQED, which is one of the first public broadcasting stations in the \ncountry.\n  We are very honored that WQED is in Pittsburgh. We are also very \nproud of the fact that the first radio station in the country was KDKA \nin Pittsburgh.\n  We in Pittsburgh are very proud of WQED and the great work that Fred \nRogers did in putting together the first children's program there. Even \nbefore it was on the air he started producing programming for that \nstation. I think it was called ``The Children's Corner.'' It became \nknown almost 10 years later, in 1966, as ``Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood.'' \nIt was actually created back in 1955. There were characters such as \n``Daniel S. Striped Tiger,'' ``X the Owl,'' ``King Friday XIII,'' \n``Henrietta Pussycat,'' and ``Lady Elaine Fairchild.''\n\n  For many of these characters, we have puppets in my conference room \nto celebrate the contribution Fred Rogers has made not just to the \npeople of Pennsylvania but to the people of this country.\n  And that program, ``Mister Rogers' Neighborhood,'' had the very \nfamous song: ``Won't you be my neighbor?'' and Mr. Rogers coming in, \nand putting on that cardigan sweater and tennis shoes, inviting you \ninto his home, the ``Land of Make Believe,'' and the trolley. All of \nthose things are such wonderful memories for me and for generations, \nand which is continuing today. Even though the program has now been out \nof production for a couple of years, there are over 900 episodes of \n``Mister Rogers' Neighborhood'' that PBS has and distributes on a \nregular basis all over the country.\n  Mr. Rogers will continue to touch future generations of children, \nparticularly young children, in that nurturing and reassuring way he \nhad with the very young. In many cases, a lot of kids sit in front of \ntelevision; mom is busy; dad is at work; or mom and dad are both at \nwork. And there was always a reassuring and comforting voice, someone \nwho reassured them of their values as a person, their own self-worth, \ntheir ability to accomplish things, to dream great dreams.\n  Mr. Rogers--in a culture that is not always so positive, and \ncertainly not very reassuring--was just that. He was a positive example \nof what a good father, a good parent, can and should be, and what good \nadults and what adults generally can be to our children in his \nneighborhood--I would argue, in our neighborhood--and that we, too, can \nlearn from Fred Rogers, can learn from the kindness and the gentility \nand the wholesomeness he showed to America's children and to America's \nparents.\n  We will miss Fred Rogers. I can tell you, Pittsburgh is going to \ngreatly miss this legend in our town. All of those shows were filmed in \nPittsburgh, PA, at WQED. And his neighborhood, which is the Oakland, \nShadyside, and Squirrel Hill, which is where WQED is located, where \nmuch, I am sure, of his ideas came from, is a place that is lesser \ntoday than it was yesterday because of this great man passing.\n  But the joy in getting up and talking about Fred Rogers is what he \nhas left. Oh, that all of us could say we have touched so many and \ninfluenced, in such a positive way, literally millions of children in \nthis country and around the world and have made a positive contribution \nin serving this country.\n  Fred Rogers was a Presbyterian minister who found that God's calling \nto him was to serve children through the media. And I think God, this \nmorning, when he arrived in Heaven, said: Well done, my good and \nfaithful servant.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is absolutely right, Mr. Rogers is somebody we \nall knew, you in a little bit of a different reference than I because \nyou really did know him. But the fact that the Senator from \nPennsylvania actually knew him does not mean that the rest of us did \nnot really know him. He was a unique individual, as you said. He walked \nin, put on that sweater, with that very bad voice that we all remember.\n  The reason I wanted to interrupt the Senator before he went to the \nclosing script is this has been a contentious week in the Senate, and I \ncould not think of a more peaceful man to end the week than Fred \nRogers. So I appreciate very much the Senator coming to the floor as \nquickly as he did, upon the death of this wonderful man, and ending the \nSenate today with memories of a peacemaker.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator from Nevada.\n  I want to share another moment where I had a chance to be with Fred \nRogers. And it was--oh, I wish I could remember exactly how many years \nago it was. It was probably about a dozen or so years ago, give or take \na couple years.\n  Every year, in Pennsylvania, the business world and the political \nworld, right before Christmas, goes up to New York for the Pennsylvania \nSociety. It has been going on now for over 100 years.\n  There is a dinner on a Saturday night. The industrialists used to go \nup there to that with their families and friends. And it has turned \ninto a big event, a bipartisan political event as well as a business \nevent. We have a big dinner. I think we are the longest running annual \ndinner at the Waldorf Astoria. It has been for over a 100 years now.\n  I remember they give a gold medal to a famous Pennsylvanian. One of \nthe years I happened to be there, in the late 1980s, it was Fred Rogers \nwho received that award. He got up to speak.\n\n[[Page S2913]]\n\nAnd there were 3,000 people in the Waldorf Astoria Ballroom. I had \nbeen, and have been since, to many of these dinners. It is quite \nunusual that you can even hear the speaker usually by halfway through \nthe speech. We have all been at dinners like that.\n  I remember sitting there, and Fred Rogers was talking about how \nimportant it is to be a positive influence in one child's life. Now, we \nall talk about mentoring and the importance of mentoring. It is sort of \na new and current thing to talk about. Well, Fred was ahead of his \ntime. He talked about that.\n  He talked and gave the example of someone in his life who meant \nsomething to him. It was a rivetting and compelling speech. I remember \nhe stopped and said: I am going to stop for a minute. And I want you to \nall think about someone who made a difference in your life. I am going \nto stop for 1 minute, and I just want you to think about that person, \nwhat they have meant to you, and whether you can be that person for \nsomebody else.\n  And he stopped talking. And for a minute, in that ballroom, with \n3,000 people in it, you could have heard a pin drop. That was the power \nof someone who not only reached out to children, and spoke and preached \na good talk, but someone who lived it, and who was sincere, and acted \nit out in his life. Obviously, it had an impact on me because I \nremember it to this day. It inspired me to try to make that \ncontribution to someone.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I thank the Senator for bringing this great man to our \nattention. I was not aware, until the Senator spoke, about his passing.\n  I, like so many others, felt I knew this man indirectly, as the \nfather of two sons, who are now 19 and 22 years old. So I reckon it was \nabout for 20 years that I watched that show. And I think I looked \nforward to it as often as my sons did.\n  The Senator captured very eloquently and sensitively the spirit of a \nvery gentle soul, yet a very visionary man.\n  I recall going to the National Education Foundation dinner here just \nafter I arrived 2 years ago, and there were not as many people there as \nthe Senator described in the event he mentioned, but there were a good \n700, 800 people.\n\n  Mr. Rogers was receiving the honor, Award of the Year. The first \nthing I noticed was, when he came out, everybody knew the song, and \nthey all sang that song. As the Senator said, you could have heard a \npin drop when he spoke. And he spoke in the same general way to adults \nas he did to kids.\n  I say to the Senator, are there any other neighborhoods like that in \nPittsburgh you could send to the rest of the country? If so, we can use \na few.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. We have lots of wonderful neighborhoods. And like \nMinnesota, we have a lot of old, wonderful, ethnic neighborhoods. I \nthink Mr. Rogers reflected that spirit in a lot of those communities--\nthe close-knit, caring spirit, looking after your neighbor in those \ncommunities.\n  Some may suggest that ``Mister Rogers' Neighborhood'' was from a \nbygone era that does not exist anymore, that that neighborhood isn't \naround anymore. Well, I make the argument that the neighborhood is what \nthe neighbors make it, and that he sets a pretty good model for what \nneighbors should be, and neighborhoods can be, and, hopefully, again \nsomeday will be.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/27/senate-section/article/S2913-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2913]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n       IN HONOR OF PENNSYLVANIA'S HISTORICALLY BLACK UNIVERSITIES\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, in celebration of Black History \nMonth, I rise today to honor Lincoln University and Cheyney University \nof Pennsylvania for the contribution they have made in the education of \nAfrican-Americans over the past two centuries. These two institutions \nof higher learning are charter members of a group of schools known as \nHistorically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and they have had \na seminal role in our Nation's academic heritage.\n  The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is proud to be the birthplace of \nsecondary education for African-Americans in this country. Cheyney \nUniversity, originally named the Institute for Colored Youth in \nPennsylvania, was founded in 1837 as an elementary and high school for \nyoung blacks. The Institute was a successful, free school for young \nstudents and, after some years, became a teachers college. Cheyney's \ncharter mission was to instruct African descendants in mechanical arts \nand agricultural trades so that they might teach their peers to compete \nand be self-sufficient in the post-slavery economy. Today, Cheyney \neducates men and women in more than thirty disciplines and maintains \nits legacy of providing for minorities of various cultures and \nnationalities.\n  Lincoln University rivals Cheyney for the title of oldest \nhistorically black university. Initially founded as the Ashmun \nInstitute, the school opened in 1854 as the very first place of \n``higher education in the arts and sciences for male youth of African \ndescent.'' In addition to the important message of educational equality \nand opportunity through learning these universities continue to convey, \nthere are thousands of Lincoln and Cheyney alumni who illustrate the \ngreat gift these schools have given the African-American community in \nparticular and the academic community at large. Among these graduates \nare Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, author Langston Hughes, \nformer Nigerian President Nnamdi Azikiwe, journalist Ed Bradley, and \npublisher Robert Bogle, to name but a few.\n  HBCUs are an integral aspect of what has always been the American \ndream, an ideal that sees education and industry as the tools for \nsucceeding in life and pursuing one's talents and interests. The \nlivelihood of institutions such as Lincoln and Cheyney Universities is \ncentral to the preservation of this ideal and with it, our national \nheritage. Our Government has a responsibility to help sustain the \nlegacy of these schools, and I am proud to support legislation to this \nend. Bills that bring 21st Century technology to tomorrow's graduates \nand funds intended to keep quality, affordable higher education \navailable to all of our Nation's young students are part of the \nprocess. I encourage my Senate colleagues to join me in recognizing the \nimportance of our country's HBCUs. I hope that together we can \ncelebrate their history and ensure their future for the posterity of \nthe Nation's higher education system.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/27/senate-section/article/S2913-2", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2913-S2914]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                EMILY LANCE HAS A BLAST AT SPACE CENTER\n\n   Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, today I share with my colleagues \nthe thoughts of Emily Lance, an 8-year-old third grader at Calhoun \nElementary School, who had the privilege of watching the launch of the \nSpace Shuttle Columbia:\n\n       We left at 6 o'clock Tuesday morning, Jan. 14, to see the \n     Space Shuttle launch. But first we had to get there. It was a \n     10-hour drive. We were staying at the Hilton.\n       Before we could get to the hotel, we had to go through \n     security because the Israeli ambassador and the astronauts' \n     families were staying there. Finally, we got to the room. \n     Then we found our bathing suits and went out to the beach.\n       That's when we saw the horse patrol. They were very pretty \n     horses. We found a lot of shells at the beach. Then we went \n     back to our room, had dinner, and went to bed.\n       We woke up early and went to the Kennedy Space Center. We \n     checked in the protocol office and got our mission briefing \n     passes. Then we had to go through NASA security.\n       Going to the briefing wasn't all we did. First we checked \n     out the Rocket Garden. It was huge and had replicas of the \n     rockets that went into space.\n       Then it was time for the briefing. First we got our seats. \n     There were a lot of people. The briefing was very \n     interesting.\n       They announced that the shuttle was to go off at 10:39 \n     Thursday morning. I learned a lot at the briefing.\n       After the briefing we went to the Mad Mission to Mars. It \n     was 3-D and so cool. They called for volunteers, and I was \n     picked. I was chosen to be the planet Venus. Then we were \n     blasting off to Mars. Then it was the end of the show. After \n     that we went to eat.\n       Then we got to see a movie called ``The Dream Is Alive.'' I \n     liked it very much. Then it was time to go back to the hotel. \n     But before we did, I got to go get Space Dots. That is ice \n     cream in little balls, also known as Dipping Dots.\n       Then it was time to go home after a great day at the \n     Kennedy Space Center. I couldn't\n\n[[Page S2914]]\n\n     wait until tomorrow. It was going to be awesome.\n       After dinner I had to go to bed early. We had to get up at \n     5 in the morning. On the way to Kennedy Space Center, we \n     stopped at Waffle House to get some breakfast.\n       When we got there we went to the Protocol Office and got \n     our bus passes so we could get to the grandstand.\n       While we were standing in line, we met this man who works \n     at NASA in California. He was really excited, too. Then I \n     noticed he had a really cool necklace and on it was the word \n     NASA. It also had a blue flashing light.\n       I told him it was really cool. Then he asked me if I really \n     liked it. I said yes, then he gave it to me. I was so happy.\n       After that, he showed me his official NASA badge. Then we \n     got on the bus. It was a 10-minute ride to the grandstand.\n       When we got there we picked seats on the top row. You could \n     see the Launch Pad perfectly. It was a long time until the \n     shuttle went off so I went in the Saturn Building and watched \n     a movie.\n       It was about the Apollo 11 mission. Neil Armstrong walked \n     the first few steps on the moon in the Apollo mission. Then I \n     had to go sit down.\n       The shuttle was about to go off. At 9 minutes the countdown \n     stopped. Then it started again. At 1 minute until it \n     launched, I was so excited. When it got to 10 seconds, we all \n     went 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.\n       Then it happened. It was so awesome. It was like an \n     earthquake. The ground shook, and the noise sounded like an \n     explosion.\n       It lasted about two minutes, then it was gone. It was \n     already in space. It can go around the world in 90 minutes.\n       Then we got back on the bus. When we got back to the Space \n     Center, we went to see a 3-D movie called ``The Space \n     Station.'' The space station is a place where astronauts can \n     go and live.\n       Then we went home after our last day at the Kennedy Space \n     Center.

Today, we celebrate with Brenda and her family her remarkable 37 \nyears of exemplary and distinguished service to the Navy and the \nNation. It is a privilege for me to address the Chamber today in honor \nof Brenda.\n  ``Far and away the best prize that life offers,'' Teddy Roosevelt \nremarked, ``is the chance to work hard at work worth doing.'' When \nBrenda first began with the Navy Department at the Charleston Naval \nStation, she understood that supporting the men and women of the Sea \nService was indeed work worth doing. Brenda has remained true to this \nprinciple ever since.\n  From the small Navy office on the Cooper River to the many postings \naround the world that followed, Brenda quickly became recognized by all \nfor her acumen and accomplishments. Understandably, Brenda's talents \nwere ultimately sought by the Chief of Naval Operations and the \nSecretary of the Navy in Washington, D.C. In 1987, Brenda was selected \nto serve as the director of the Congressional Travel Division for the \nNavy Secretary's legislative affairs office. Past being prologue, \nBrenda's record of success continued unabated and has been nothing \nshort of outstanding.\n  For 15 years, Brenda has been a key advisor to a succession of eight \nadmirals. During her tenure, Brenda planned and coordinated travel \naround the world for more than 300 congressional delegations. A superb \nfinancial manager, Brenda also responsibly managed annual budgets of \nover $1.5 million--maintaining flawless documents and receiving the \nhighest possible praise at every audit. Every day, her work directly \nsupported the positive, productive interaction of senior Navy \nleadership and the Congress.\n  The Pentagon on the Potomac is a long way from the little Navy office \non the Cooper River. Brenda's heartfelt commitment to the Navy's \nofficers and sailors, her guiding compass over the years, never \nwavered.\n  Sharing this adventure with Brenda is Captain Gary Geist, U.S. Navy \nRet., her husband of 24 years, and their children, Jim, Stacey, Darcey, \nSam, and Curtis. With the loving support of her immediate Navy family, \nBrenda time and again, rose to the occasion for her larger extended \nNavy family.\n  Mr. President, I invite you and our Senate colleagues to join me and \noffer our sincere appreciation to Brenda Geist for her years of \ndedication and outstanding service. We wish her and her loving family \n``fair winds and following seas'' as they begin their next adventure \ntogether. They will be sorely missed, but most certainly never \nforgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/27/senate-section/article/S2914-2", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2914]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            HEALTH CARE HERO\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to salute a Health Care \nHero from my home State of Oregon, the N2K Nursing Shortage \nDemonstration Project.\n  Several of my colleagues and I have come to this chamber before to \ndiscuss the growing shortage of health care workers in this country. \nThis growing crisis has severe implications for quality patient care, \nretention of qualified nurses, and the future of health care delivery. \nLast year, Congress began to address this problem by passing the Nurse \nReinvestment Act, but there is much more work to be done.\n  Fortunately, an exciting new program in Oregon is working to find new \nways to recruit nurses. The N2K project offers paraprofessional staff \nfrom local hospitals and clinics the opportunity to secure a nursing \ndegree while continuing to receive their current salary and benefits. \nParticipants finish prerequisite classwork, participate in clinical \ntraining and complete an 18 month nursing degree program. Because they \nhave come from health care institutions, these workers are more likely \nto continue in the nursing profession and stay in the communities where \nthey were trained, solving some of the pressing issues creating the \nnursing crisis.\n  But the most unique and beneficial part of this program is that \nrecruits must be bilingual or be from a minority population. A major \nchallenge facing health care delivery today is the severe lack of \nbilingual health professionals. In Oregon, and in many other places, we \nhave large immigrant communities, primarily Spanish-speaking, and few \nnurses who can communicate with them easily. Many N2K participants \nwould not have the opportunity to pursue a professional nursing career \nwere this program not available. As nurses, they will bring a new level \nof comfort and care to non-English speaking patients.\n  Although the N2K demonstration project is still in its initial \nstages, it is already showing great success. Representatives from the \nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Minority Health \nvisited Oregon this week to meet with the participating institutions \nand 11 students completing the program. The visitors were deeply \nimpressed with the project, particularly after speaking with these \nexcellent students who look forward to a rewarding career in nursing.\n  Today I honor the N2K project as a Health Care Hero. N2K's vision and \ndedication to building a more diverse health care work force is helping \nOregon find the quality workers we need to meet tomorrow's health care \nchallenges. I look forward to the project's continuing success and wish \nthe partnership all the best as it moves forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/27/senate-section/article/S2914-3", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2914-S2915]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          TRIBUTE TO JOHNSON CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL ACADEMIC TEAM\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today in the Senate to pay \ntribute to the Johnson Central High School Academic Team. Recently, the \nmembers of this Academic Team won their fourth straight 15th Regional \nGovernor's Cup.\n  The Johnson Central Academic Team won the overall District 60 \nGovernor's Cup Championship and went on to claim the Regional title. \nAlong with winning the overall title, the team was awarded top honors \nin the Written Assessments section and the Future Problem Solving team \nalso won first place. Also, the Quick Recall team defended their title \nby placing first 2 years in a row. Individual members also placed first \nin Mathematics, Language Arts and English Composition, and Science and \nSocial Studies.\n  The citizens of Paintsville, KY are fortunate to have the 15th \nRegional champ's living and learning in their community. Their example \nof hard work and determination should be followed by all in the \nCommonwealth.\n  I congratulate the members of the Academic Team for their success. \nBut also, I want to congratulate their peers, coaches, teachers, \nadministrators, and parents for their support and sacrifices they've \nmade to help the\n\n[[Page S2915]]\n\nAcademic Team meet those achievements and dreams.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/27/senate-section/article/S2915-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2915]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             50th ANNIVERSARY OF WORLD MEDICAL RELIEF, INC.\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate World \nMedical Relief, Inc. for 50 years of distinguished service to needy \nindividuals in the United States and around the world. On March 8, \n2003, staff members, supporters, and beneficiaries of World Medical \nRelief, Inc. services will gather in my home state of Michigan for the \n``Miracles of Mercy Gala 2003.'' This event will commemorate the \ncommitment and dedication that World Medical Relief, Inc. has provided \nto the sick and needy.\n  For 50 years, World Medical Relief, Inc. has been a driving force for \nmedical support both in my home state of Michigan and internationally. \nIt is noteworthy that the success and accomplishments of this program \ntoday are in part the direct result of the unwavering devotion of \nfounder Irene M. Auberlin. The hard work and perseverance of Mrs. \nAuberlin is now reflected by the many individuals and groups that \ncontinue to provide assistance to those most in need.\n  Today, the program serves over 1,500 people in the metropolitan \nDetroit area and 125 nations worldwide. I would like to congratulate \nWilliam N. Genematas for receiving this year's Irene M. Auberlin \nService Above Self Award for his long-time dedication to World Medical \nRelief, Inc.

Mr. President, today it is my great \nhonor to recognize the valiant efforts of two volunteer firefighters \nfrom Ainsworth, NE.\n  Mr. Bill Carr and Mr. Jeff Keezer of the Ainsworth Volunteer \nFirefighter Department were instrumental in the April 22, 2002 rescue \nattempt of Timothy Culpepper, a digital communications worker who was \nstranded more than one thousand one hundred feet in the air when a \nfifteen hundred foot telecommunications tower he was working on \npartially collapsed near Bassett, NE.\n  When a wire snapped disabling and stranding Mr. Culpepper, several \nagencies, including the Nebraska Emergency Management Agency, were \ncalled upon for the dangerous rescue mission. However, upon arriving at \nthe scene, response teams realized they were ill-equipped to perform \nthe high-altitude rescue.\n  Bill Carr, a carpenter and married father of three, had spent many \nsummers during college painting tall communications towers. Jeff \nKeezer, a married father of one, works for a steel company that erects \nhundred-foot grain elevators. Though these experiences could not have \nadequately prepared them for this dangerous and technically challenging \nrescue. They quickly volunteered to help.\n  With no regard for their personal safety, Mr. Carr and Mr. Keezer, \narmed only with estimations of the exact height of the stranded worker, \nbegan to make the physically challenging two-hour ascent to rescue the \nman who was hanging only by a harness. Carrying bundles of rope and \nheavy rescue equipment, these brave firefighters, along with a handful \non colleagues from the Lincoln Fire Department, scaled the tower amid \n30-mph winds and with dwindling daylight. Upon reaching Mr. Culpepper \nit was discovered that tragically he did not survive the impact of \ntumbling debris.\n  Mr. Carr and two other firefighters managed to scale the total \ndistance to Mr. Culppeper in ninety minutes while Mr. Keezer, with \nheavy rescue equipment on his back, and two other firefighters scaled \nto the half-way point to manage the recovery effort and descent that \nlasted more than 3 hours.\n  Unfortunately these two brave and selfless first-responders were \nomitted from an award ceremony in Washington, D.C. on February 14. \nThough the Department of Justice didn't recognize their efforts, Mr. \nCarr and Mr. Keezer can forever hold their heads high knowing their \nbravery and the fabric of their character has made all Nebraskans, and \nespecially their neighbors in Ainsworth, proud of their actions.\n  Mr. President, heroism comes in many forms and the courage displayed \nby Mr. Carr and Mr. Keezer with danger present is a shining example. \nNebraskans like Mr. Carr and Mr. Keezer are selfless, honorable and \njust and they are what makes living in Nebraska living ``the good \nlife.''\n  I am proud to represent Nebraskans like Mr. Carr and Mr. Keezer who \nare committed public servants. Volunteer services are an essential part \nof small-town America. Without the brave and selfless efforts of \neveryday citizens like Mr. Keezer and Mr. Carr, many rural communities \nwould lack vital protection and security. The city of Ainsworth and the \nstate of Nebraska are fortunate to have courageous citizens like Jeff \nKeezer and Bill Carr. These men are true heroes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/27/senate-section/article/S2915-3", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2915-S2916]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NEW REVOLVER TOO BIG FOR ``DIRTY'' HARRY\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I want to bring to the attention of \nmy colleagues an article from the February 14, 2003, Los Angeles Times \nentitled ``New Revolver Too Big For 'Dirty' Harry.'' The article \ndiscusses a new .50 caliber handgun manufactured by the Smith and \nWesson Corporation. The 500 model, the biggest handgun currently in \nproduction, is 15 inches long, weighs 4.5 pounds, and uses a .50 \ncaliber Magnum Smith and Wesson bullet that packs a muzzle force of \n2,600 foot-pounds. The bullet is half an inch wide and is more powerful \nthan comparable ammunition because it is much longer and contains more \ngun powder.\n  According to a Violence Policy Center expert cited in the article, \nthe gun's cartridge has about twice the muzzle energy of most rounds \nfor common semiautomatic assault weapons, such as the AR-15, a civilian \nversion of the military's M-16. In fact, the new gun packs a punch \npowerful enough to stop a charging bear in its tracks.\n  A Smith and Wesson representative acknowledges that the company hopes \nthe gun will help Smith and Wesson win back market share lost when the \ncompany agreed to a number of steps to improve gun safety and keep guns \nout of the hands of criminals. Smith and Wesson's decision to produce \nthe .50 caliber handgun represents a step backward in the effort to \nimprove gun safety. Not only has the company apparently scrapped its \nplan to work with the federal government to take sensible steps to make \nguns safer and keep guns from getting into the wrong hands, but the \ncompany seems to be headed in the opposite direction by creating a \nhandgun that is reported to have double the power of most assault \nrifles.\n  Last year, I cosponsored the Military Sniper Weapon Regulation Act, a \nbill which would change the way .50 caliber sniper rifles are regulated \nby placing them under the requirements of the National Firearms Act. \nThis bill would subject the sniper rifles to the same regimen of \nregistration and background checks as other weapons of war, such as \nmachine guns.\n  Unfortunately, the new Smith and Wesson .50 caliber handgun would not \nbe affected by this legislation. However, both the .50 caliber handgun \nand sniper rifle are simply too powerful to be on the streets. Congress \nmust take a long, hard look at these potentially lethal weapons.\n\n                  [From the L.A. Times, Feb. 14, 2003]\n\n            A Powerful New Revolver Is Drawing Fire Already\n\n                 (By Ralph Frammolino and Steve Berry)\n\n       Even the most ardent firearm lovers acknowledge that Smith \n     & Wesson's new .50-caliber Magnum revolver is more gun than \n     anyone needs.\n       It has double the power of most assault rifles in America. \n     Its kick can send a grown man reeling; a single bullet can \n     drop a grizzly.; It is so heavy and long that police say no-\n     criminal would dare try to hide it in his waistband. It will \n     cost as much $989.\n       And gun buyers across the country can't wait to get their \n     hands on it.\n       ``The initial reaction has been even stronger than we had \n     anticipated, so we're ramping\n\n[[Page S2916]]\n\n     up production to meet the demand,'' Bob Scott, Smith & Wesson \n     Corp.'s chairman, said from the 2003 Shooting, Hunting, \n     Outdoor Trade Show in Orlando, Fla.\n       ``Certainly, in our booth it's the product that has created \n     the most buzz.''\n       The Springfield, Mass-based company, creator of the .44 \n     Magnum of ``Dirty Harry'' fame, unveiled its new offering \n     Thursday as the world most powerful commercially produced \n     revolver. Executives for the country's second-largest \n     firearms manufacturer said they hoped the gun would help \n     regain lost market share by generating excitement among an \n     important, albeit niche, market of big-game hunters, \n     collectors and recreational target shooters.\n       But even before the weapon's wide distribution, scheduled \n     for next month, forces on both sides of the firearms debate \n     are taking aim at its social effects.\n       Gun control groups condemned the Model 500 as an example of \n     the industry's ``deadlier-is-better'' mentality, predicting \n     that the new model would soon find its way to the streets.\n       ``A hunting weapon? that's a joke,'' said Luis Tolley, \n     director of state legislation for the Brady Campaign to \n     Prevent Gun Violence. ``What we have here is a weapon that's \n     designed to appeal to people who just want to make a bigger \n     hole in whatever they're shooting at. And, hopefully, they're \n     not living next door to me.''\n       Said Josh Sugarmann, executive director of the Violence \n     Policy Center: ``This gun is not being made for hunters in \n     Africa. It's being made for bored white gun owners in \n     America. Why are they putting so much firepower into people's \n     hands?''\n       The real question, say some gun experts, is: Why are people \n     demanding it?\n       Adam Firestone, editor of Cruffler.com, a Web site for gun \n     collectors, said he viewed demand for Smith & Wesson's new \n     product as more of an outgrowth of America's obsession with \n     size and status, rather than an indicator of growing paranoia \n     over crime or homeland security.\n       ``How many people do you know have Lincoln Navigators or \n     Hummer H2s?'' he said. ``We are phenomenal at buying beyond \n     our needs. And with regard to the firearm industry, if it is \n     bigger, if it is more expensive . . . we will line up around \n     the corner to buy the darned thing, regardless of the fact \n     that there may be six other guns that cost half as much and \n     do the job just as well.''\n       Smith & Wesson executives hope that the new offering, one \n     of nine new models introduced at the Florida gun show \n     Thursday, will put it back in the good graces of a gun-buying \n     constituency that remains sore over the company's decision in \n     2000 to sign agreements with the federal government that \n     promised to put locks on all firearms it sold.\n       That backlash served as a double whammy, taking away sales \n     from Smith & Wesson even as the entire industry was in \n     decline.\n       ``We're in the process of winning back market share or \n     business that was lost as a result of negative reaction by \n     consumers to the decisions by the previous ownership,'' said \n     Scott, the company chairman.\n       Smith & Wesson has built its reputation by building \n     bigger guns. The .357 Magnum, introduced in 1935, was \n     considered a breakthrough because of its muzzle energy \n     that delivered impact at 535 foot-pounds, said Roy G. \n     Jinks, the company's historian.\n       The weapon, developed at the behest of hunters, gained \n     favor with police during the mobster era because it could \n     shoot through a car's engine block, he said.\n       In 1956, Smith & Wesson introduced the even more powerful \n     .44 Magnum, the gun made famous years later by Clint Eastwood \n     in his crime-fighting movies as ``Dirty'' Harry Callahan, a \n     San Francisco cop.\n       With Thursday's unveiling the company now leapfrogs ahead \n     of its competitors, which had surpassed the .44 Magnum with \n     more potent weapons.\n       The Model 500 uses a bigger frame, takes a new .50 caliber \n     Magnum Smith & Wesson bullet and packs a muzzle force of \n     2,600 foot-pounds.\n       Though there are single-shot, custom pistols that use \n     larger ammunition, the new gun is the largest production \n     revolver or semiautomatic pistol.\n       At .50-caliber, the bullet is about half an inch wide but \n     is more powerful than other such ammunition because it is \n     longer and can pack more powder, said Garen Wintemute, a gun \n     expert and director of the Violence Prevention Research \n     Program at UC Davis.\n       He said the gun's cartridge has about twice the muzzle \n     energy of most rounds for common semiautomatic assault \n     weapons used in America, such as the AR-15, a civilian \n     version of the military's M-16.\n       Wintemute predicted that it would be a smash with gun \n     enthusiasts who can order one with a barrel as long as 10 \n     inches.\n       One such enthusiast is Marc Halcon, owner of American \n     Shooting Center in San Diego.\n       He said the allure of the weapon ``has something to do with \n     the artistry of creating a mechanism that will do something \n     that no other will do. It's another step in science and \n     engineering.''\n       On a personal level, Halcon said. ``I already own the most \n     powerful handgun on the market, and if they build a more \n     powerful one, then I want to buy it.''\n       Sam Paredes, executive director of the Gun Owners of \n     California feels much the same.\n       ``I can't wait to shoot one of these things,'' he said.\n       Paredes acknowledged that the Model 500 could be portrayed \n     as the ``boogeyman of all guns.''\n       He said its recoil would pack such a wallop that it would \n     be virtually impossible for criminals to rely on it--a \n     sentiment shared by Lt. Bruce Harris, the firing range master \n     for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.\n       ``It's a little tough to have one of those under your \n     shirt,'' Harris said, adding that he didn't believe it would \n     become the weapon of the street because ``gangbangers don't \n     have $900 to spend on a Smith & Wesson revolver.''\n       Proposed legislation regulating the sale of .50 caliber \n     rifles is scheduled for consideration in the state Assembly \n     and the Los Angeles City Council, said Tolley of the Brady \n     Campaign.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nadditional tax incentives to encourage economic growth; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, today I am sending to the desk a bill by \nmyself and Senator Miller to amend the IRS Code. It is a bill to \nprovide jobs and economic growth for our country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be received and appropriately \nreferred.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, this bill Senator Miller and I are \nintroducing is the President's economic and growth package. This is a \npackage the President has put together that would help American \nfamilies. This is a package that is profamilial and progrowth. It is a \nbill that will create jobs. It is a bill that will create an incentive \nto invest. It is a bill to eliminate unfair punitive taxes on corporate \nearnings that are distributed to the owners of the corporation. It is a \nbill that will help stimulate and grow our economy.\n  I compliment the President for his work in proposing this. I am happy \nto introduce it. Let me talk about a couple of the provisions of the \nbill.\n  This bill will expand the 10-percent bracket. This is to help people \nof all incomes. But the lowest income people will be the true \nbeneficiaries of this package. It will accelerate reductions in the \nindividual income tax rates that were passed in 2001. You might \nremember the 2001 tax bill that we passed which had individual rate \nreductions phased in over the years. There was a 1 percent reduction in \nmost of the rates in 2004, and another percent reduction in 2006. These \nare accelerated to 2003.\n  It means that the maximum personal income tax bracket would be 35 \npercent instead of the present 38.6 percent. It means that individuals \nwould not have to pay taxes at rates greater than corporations. The \nbulk of the benefit of this will come to individuals who are self-\nemployed, individuals who are sole proprietors, and individuals who own \nor operate their own business. They will receive the bulk of the \nbenefit of this rate reduction. Some people may want to demagog some of \nthe estimates that benefit primarily the wealthy. I disagree.\n  We also might keep in perspective that when President Clinton was \nelected, the maximum rate was 31 percent. He increased it to 39.4 \npercent. When we totally implement President Bush's tax reduction, the \nmaximum rate will be 35 percent, which is still significantly higher \nthan the 31 percent just 10 years ago.\n  The President's proposal that we are introducing today would also \naccelerate the reduction in the marriage penalty. This is a very big \nitem to help married couples reduce their taxes. The net impact of this \nis it would double the 15-percent bracket that individuals have for \ncouples.\n  To give you an example, individuals presently pay 15 percent, I \nbelieve, on income up to about $28,000. But couples have to start \npaying a 28-percent or 27-percent bracket when they have income above \n$47,000. We say that instead of paying 27 percent for taxable income \nabove $47,000, no, that should be double the individual amount. So \ncouples don't have to pay above the 15-percent bracket unless their \nincome exceeds $56,000.\n  It is not very complicated. Couples should have for the 15-percent \nbracket twice what individuals have. Individuals pay 15 percent up to \n$28,000. So we doubled that amount for couples. The net impact of that \nis you pay 15 percent instead of 27 percent for a total of about \n$9,000. It saves couples a total of $1,022. If the couples have two \nchildren, they would get additional child credit. We increase the child \ncredit, which is presently $600, to $1,000. That is an increase of $400 \nper child. If you have two children, that is $800 of tax credit--not \ndeductions, tax credit. It reduces your tax bill by $800.\n  If you have a taxable income of $56,000, you also get the $1,122 of \nmarriage penalty relief. You get $100 savings from the 10-percent \nbracket expansion. Total tax relief for a family that has taxable \nincome of $56,800 totals over $2,000. Actually, it is $2,022. That is \nabout a 22-percent tax cut for middle-income families. That will help \nthousands--millions--of families all across the country.\n\n  Also, this bill would eliminate the double taxation on corporate \nearnings. Presently, in the United States, unfortunately, unbelievably, \nwe tax corporate earnings that are distributed to the owners more than \nalmost any other country in the world. Only one country, Japan, taxes \ncorporate earnings distributed to the owners higher than the United \nStates.\n  Our combined tax rate of 35 percent corporate and the individual tax \npercentage, depending on the individual's income tax bracket--it could \nbe 15 percent, it could be 30 percent, it could be 38.6 percent--if you \nadd the 38.6 percent plus the 35 percent, it is over 70 percent. If it \nis 30 percent for the individual rate, and the corporation rate is 35, \nit is 65 percent. So for a corporation that makes $1,000 and wants to \ndistribute that to the owners, the Federal Government gets 65 percent; \nand the beneficiary, the owner of the company, gets 35 percent. That is \nabsurd. That is embarrassing. That is indefensible. And countless \npeople--economists, the President, candidates and others--said we \nshould eliminate this unfair double taxation of dividends.\n  The President has come up with a proposal to do that. I am happy to \nintroduce it for him. I urge my colleagues--before they demagog it, \nbefore they castigate it--to look at the facts.\n  Does it really make sense for us to be taxing corporate distributions \nto all owners--incidently, the majority of owners are senior citizens--\ndoes it really make sense for us to be taxing these proceeds higher \nthan any other country in the world but one? It makes no sense.\n  Does it really make sense to have the Tax Code skewed to where it \nreally is beneficial to go into debt because you can expense your \ninterest expense? But, oh, yes, if you go the equity route, you have to \npay taxes on anything that is generated in the company. And the \nindividual who receives the benefits pays taxes, so the Government gets \ntwo-thirds of the money, two-thirds of the distribution. That does not \nmake sense. It discourages investment. It encourages debt. Not a good \ncorporate policy.\n  Present law encourages a lot of corporate shenanigans and corporate \ngames trying to get around taxes when they realize that such a great \npercentage of the distribution to owners is going to be paid in taxes--\n``Let's figure out other ways.'' Maybe they do it through bonuses, but \nthey might do it through all kinds of schemes. And we have seen some of \nthose.\n  This would be great corporate reform, very positive, well-needed \nreform, and long overdue--long overdue.\n  In this package that the President has proposed, it also has \nsomething I am very much in favor of: expensing for small business. I \nused to have a small business. But it triples the amount a small \nbusinessperson can expense from $25,000 to $75,000. In other words, if \nthey write a check for that amount, they can expense it in the year \nthat the check is written. That\n\n[[Page S2923]]\n\nwill greatly encourage investment because they get to recoup the \ninvestment that is made in the same year the check is written--a very \npositive, progrowth proposal. Most jobs are created in small \nbusinesses, and this is a good, positive small business provision that \nwill create jobs.\n  So we reduce taxes on business owners, sole proprietors. They would \nnot have to pay taxes more than corporations. We would reduce taxes on \nmarried couples. We would discontinue the present policy of penalizing \nthem for being married and filing joint returns. We would allow them to \nkeep more of their own money. We would allow them to keep more of their \nown money if they have kids.\n\n  Certainly, if you have kids, it costs a lot of money to raise them. \nWe say you should have a $1,000 tax credit per child. So for every \nchild you have, you get to save $1,000 in taxes. I have four kids, so \nthat is $4,000 per year. A couple with four kids would get to save \n$4,000 per year. That is significant. That is profamily. That is \npositive. That allows people who really need the money raising families \nto keep it.\n  One, we eliminate the marriage penalty, and, two, we allow them to \nkeep more for their own kids. Very significant benefits. When you add \nall the benefits together, it really makes the income tax even more \nprogressive.\n  The upper income groups would still pay a greater percentage of \nincome tax, even after we pass this proposal. I can just envision \npeople saying: Well, this is class warfare. I hope they do not play \nthose arguments because this is very family friendly and also \ninvestment friendly and will create jobs.\n  We need to do some things. Revenues have been declining for the last \n2 years. We need to figure out ways to get revenues to grow. That means \na growing economy. It means the stock market needs to move up instead \nof down.\n  This proposal will do that. This proposal is investment friendly. And \nthe main beneficiaries will not be just the owners, it will be the \npeople who get a job because the investment was not going to be made \nwithout it.\n  So let's do some things that will create an incentive for investment, \nfor expensing, for people to go to work, and for people who are working \nto be able to keep more of their own money so they can take care of \ntheir families.\n  That is what the President's proposal is all about. So I am delighted \nto introduce this today with my colleague and friend, Senator Zell \nMiller of Georgia.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record two charts to \nfurther explain the breakout of this proposal.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                                                               PRESIDENT BUSH'S 2004 BUDGET TAX PROPOSALS\n                                                                                                          (Dollars in billions)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                                                               Fiscal years\n                                                                ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                     2003         2004         2005         2006         2007         2008         2009         2010         2011         2012         2013      2004-2008    2004-2013\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGrowth Package--Revenue Impact:\n  Accelerate 10% bracket expansion.............................       -0.978       -7.782       -6.112       -6.117       -6.495       -4.275       -3.227       -3.283       -3.326       -3.294       -3.283      -30.781      -47.194\n  Accelerate reduction in marginal rates.......................       -5.808      -35.693      -17.470       -4.939           --           --           --           --           --           --           --      -58.102      -58.102\n  Accelerate marriage penalty relief...........................       -2.776      -27.134      -14.680       -7.642       -3.595       -1.735       -0.424        0.000        0.000        0.000        0.000      -54,786      -55,210\n  Accelerate increase in child credit..........................      -13.527       -5.060      -10.735       -8.534       -8.532       -8.502       -7.746       -4.197        0.000        0.000        0.000      -41.363      -53.306\n  Eliminate double taxation of dividends.......................       -3.801      -24.874      -22.062      -28.218      -31.126      -33.952      -37.378      -40.842      -44.010      -47.246      -50.616     -140.232     -360.324\n  Increase the small business expensing limit..................       -1.023       -1.652       -1.776       -1.912       -1.601       -1.431       -1.256       -1.170       -1.235       -1.259       -1.291       -8.372      -14.583\n  AMT hold-harmless............................................       -3.141       -8.534      -10.353       -6.931           --           --           --           --           --           --           --      -25.818      -25.818\n                                                                ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Growth Package Revenue Impact..............................      -31.054     -110.729      -83.188      -64.293      -51.349      -49.895      -50.031      -49.492      -48.571      -51.799      -55.190     -359.454     -614.537\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  The Jobs and Growth Tax Act of 2003--Tax Relief for Working Families\n\nExample: Married couple with two children.                             \n  Taxable Income................................................$56,800\n  Total Tax Liability Under Current Law...........................9,042\nWith Enactment of The Jobs and Growth Tax Act of 2003:\n  Marriage Penalty Relief.........................................1,122\n  Relief from 10% Bracket Expansion.................................100\n  Relief From Child Credit Increase.................................800\n                                                             __________\n                                                             \n    Total Tax Relief in 2003......................................2,022\n       Tax savings of 22 percent.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify \nand expand the credit for electricity produced from renewable resources \nand waste products, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, faced with uncertainties in electricity \nenergy markets, turmoil in the Mideast, the need to cut back on the \nfossil fuel emissions linked to global warming, air pollution that \ncontributes to high rates of asthma and fills even our national parks \nwith smog, the United States must diversify its energy supply by \npromoting the growth of renewable energy.\n  Since 1999, Las Vegas electricity rates have increased by 60 percent. \nIn the same period, natural gas prices across Nevada have doubled. We \nneed to change the energy equation. We need to diversify the Nation's \nenergy supply to reduce volatility and ensure a stable supply of \nelectricity. We must harness the brilliance of the sun, the strength of \nthe wind, and the heat of the Earth to provide clean, renewable energy \nfor our nation.\n  I rise today to introduce a bill with Senators Smith, Snowe, \nCantwell, Harkin, Liberman, Feinstein, Jeffords, and Wyden expands the \nexisting Section 45 production tax credit for renewable energy \nresources to cover all renewable energy resources. Our legislation \naccomplishes this by adding geothermal, incremental geothermal, solar, \nopen-loop biomass, incremental hydropower, landfill gas, and animal \nwaste to the list of renewable energy resources that would quality for \na production tax credit.\n  Our legislation also makes the production tax credit permanent to \nsignal America's long-term commitment to renewable energy resources. \nThe existing production tax credit that covers wind energy, poultry \nwaste, and closed-look biomass will expire at the end of 2003! Since it \ninception in 1992, the production tax credit has expired and been \nrenewed twice; in 1999 and 2001. Development of wind energy has closely \nmirrored these renewal cycles. Clearly, the private investment \nnecessary to develop renewable energy resources requires the business \ncertainly afforded a long-term extension of the production tax credit.\n  Our bill allows for co-production credits to encourage blending of \nrenewable energy with traditional fuels and provides a credit for \nrenewable facilities on native American and native Alaskan lands. In \nnorthern Nevada, the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe is working with Advanced \nThermal Systems to develop geothermal resources on Indian lands that \nwill spur economic development by creating business opportunities and \njobs for tribal members.\n\n  This legislation also provides production incentives to not-for-\nprofit public power utilities and rural electric cooperatives, which \nserve 25 percent of the Nation's power customers, by allowing them to \ntransfer of their credits to taxable entities.\n  The good news is that the production tax credit for renewable energy \nresources really works to promote the growth of renewable energy. In \n1990, the cost of wind energy was 22.5 cents per kilowatt hour and, \ntoday, with new technology and the help of a modest\n\n[[Page S2924]]\n\nproduction tax credit, wind is a competitive energy source at 3 to 4 \ncents per kilowatt hour. In the last 5 years, wind energy has \nexperience a 30 percent growth rate. This year, Nevada utilities have \nsigned contracts for more then 130 MW of wind energy.\n  The production tax credit provides 1.8 cents for every kilowatt-hour \nof electricity produced. Similar to wind energy, this credit will allow \ngeothermal energy, incremental hydropower, and landfill gas to \nimmediately compete with fossil fuels, while biomass will follow \nclosely behind. The Department of Energy estimates that we would \nincrease our geothermal energy production almost ten fold, supplying \nten percent of the energy needs of the West. As fantastic as it sounds, \nenough sunlight falls on a 100 mile by 100 miles of southern Nevada \nthat--if covered with solar panels--could power the entire Nation.\n  Let's never lose sight of the fact that renewable energy resources \nare domestic sources of energy, and using them instead of foreign \nsources contributes to our energy security. Renewables provide fuel \ndiversify and price stability. After all, the fuel--the wind, the sun, \nheat from the core of the earth--costs nothing. And they provide jobs, \nespecially in rural areas that have been largely left out of American \nrecent economic growth.\n  The production tax credit for renewable energy resources is a \npowerful, fast acting stimulus to the economy. According to the Western \nGovernment Association, the Department of Energy's Initiative to deploy \n1,000 MWs of concentrated solar power in the Southwestern area of the \nUnited States by the year 2006 would create approximately 10,0000 jobs \nand estimated expenditures of more than 3.7 billion over 14 \nyears. Nevada has already developed 200 Megawatts of geothermal power, \nwith a longer-term potential of more than 2,500 Megawatts. This \ndevelopment will provide billions of private investment and create \nthousands of jobs. Our production tax credit means immediate economic \ndevelopment and jobs!\n\n  In the U.S. today, we get less than 3 percent of our electricity from \nrenewable energy sources like wind, solar, geothermal, and biomass. But \nthe potential for much greater supply is here. For example, Nevada is \nconsidered the Saudi Arabia of geothermal. My state could use \ngeothermal energy to meet one-third of its electricity needs, but today \nthis source of energy only supplies 2.3 percent. I'm proud to say that \nNevada has adopted one of the most aggressive Renewable Portfolio \nStandard in the Nation, requiring that 5 percent of the State's \nelectricity needs be met by renewable energy resources in 2003, which \nthen grows to 15 percent by 2013.\n  After pouring billions of dollars into oil and gas, we need to invest \nin a clean energy future. Fossil fuel plants pump over 11 million tons \nof pollutants into our air each year. Federal energy policy must \npromote reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. By including landfill \ngas in this legislation, we systematically reduce the largest single \nhuman source of methane emissions in the United States, effectively \neliminating the greenhouse gas equivalent of 223 million tons of carbon \ndioxide.\n  An article in The Journal of the American Medical Association \nrevealed an alarming link between soot particles from power plants and \nmotor vehicles and lung cancer and heart disease. The adverse health \neffects of power plant and vehicle emissions cost Americans billions of \ndollars in medical care, and our cost in human suffering is \nimmeasurable. Simply put, the human cost of dirty air is staggering. If \nwe factor in environmental and health effects, the real cost of energy \nbecomes apparent, and renewable energy become the fuel of choice.\n  America's abundant and untapped renewable resources can fuel our \njourney into a more prosperous and safer tomorrow without compromising \nair and water quality.\n  Renewable energy is the cornerstone of a successful, forward looking, \nand secure energy policy for the 21st Century.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON (for herself, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Frist, Mr. \n        Cornyn, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Thomas, and Mr. Alexander):\n  S. 467. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ndeduction for State and local sales taxes in lieu of State and local \nincome taxes and to allow the State and local income tax deduction \nagainst the alternative minimum tax; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a bill to \ncorrect an injustice in the tax code that harms citizens in every state \nof this great Nation.\n  State and local governments have various alternatives for raising \nrevenue. Some levy income taxes, some use sales taxes, and others use a \ncombination of the two. The citizens who pay State and local income \ntaxes are able to offset some of what they pay by receiving a deduction \non their Federal taxes. Before 1986, taxpayers also had the ability to \ndeduct their sales taxes.\n  The philosophy behind these deductions is simple: people should not \nhave to pay taxes on their taxes. The money that people must give to \none level of government should not also be taxed by another level of \ngovernment.\n  Unfortunately, these common sense deductions have slowly been eroded \nover the years. First, the deduction for State and local sales tax was \neliminated in the 1986 tax reform legislation. Second, the alternative \nminimum tax has reduced the benefit of the income tax deduction for \nmany.\n  The elimination of the sales tax deduction discriminates against \nthose living in states, such as my home State of Texas, with no income \ntaxes. It is important to remember the lack of an income tax does not \nmean citizens in these States do not pay State taxes; revenues are \nsimply collected differently.\n  It is unfair to give citizens from some States a deduction for the \nrevenue they provide their State and local governments, while not doing \nthe same for citizens from other States. Federal tax law should not \ntreat people differently on the basis of State residence and differing \ntax collection methods.\n  This discrepancy has a significant impact on Texas. According to the \nTexas Comptroller, if taxpayers could deduct their sales taxes, more \nthan $700 million would stay in the hands of Texans. This could lead to \nthe creation of more than 16,000 new jobs and add almost $900 million \nin economic activity. The impact of this growth would be particularly \nbeneficial during this period when many States are facing record-\nbreaking deficits. At the same time, such a tax change would cost the \nFederal Government less than one percent of what the current State and \nlocal income tax deduction costs.\n  For those in states with income taxes, their tax deduction benefit \nhas been diminished by the alternative minimum tax, AMT. People can \ndeduct their state and local income taxes when calculating their \nregular taxes, but not when determining the AMT. The difference often \nis the reason people must pay the higher alternative tax.\n  In fact, state and local taxes account for 54 percent of the \ndifference between the AMT and the regular tax calculation. This \nparticularly hurts the 60 percent of AMT payers who are from states \nwith higher income tax rates. Eliminating this discrepancy would go a \nlong way toward reducing the number of people affected by the AMT.\n  The legislation I am offering today will fix these problems. First, \nit will provide all taxpayers with the option of deducting State and \nlocal sales taxes, instead of income taxes, when calculating their \nFederal tax. This will end the discrimination suffered by my fellow \nTexans and citizens of other states who do not have the option of an \nincome tax deduction. It will also allow people from states with both a \nsales and an income tax to choose the most advantageous deduction.\n  My bill will also provide for a State and local income and sales tax \ndeduction in the AMT. This is an important step in reducing the \nballooning growth of the AMT, which will impact almost a third of all \ntaxpayers by 2010.\n  The legislation I am introducing today is about reestablishing equity \nto the tax code and defending the important principle of eliminating \ntaxes on taxes.

A bill to amend chapter 44 of title 18, United States Code, \nto require ballistics testing of all firearms manufactured and all \nfirearms in custody of Federal agencies; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues Senator \nDeWine, Senator Feinstein, Senator Schumer, Senator Reed, Senator \nMikulski, Senator Corzine, and Senator Levin to reintroduce the \n``Technological Resource to Assist Criminal Enforcement'' ``TRACE'' \nAct, a bill to require ballistics testing of all firearms manufactured \nor imported in the United States.\n  The science of ballistics testing has given police the ability to \nsolve multiple crimes simply by comparing bullets and shell casings \nfound at the scene of a crime to a gun seized in a seemingly unrelated \nincident. This comparison is possible because every gun has a unique \n``fingerprint'' it leaves on spent shell casings and bullets after it \nis fired. Just as human fingerprints can be grouped into general \nclassifications such as loops and whorls, but still possess individual \ncharacteristics and then analyzed for its unique characteristics, \nfirearms evidence can be similarly grouped and then analyzed by trained \ntechnicians for unique identifying characteristics.\n  Let me explain more specifically how this technology works. Today, \nballistics technology equipment allows firearms technicians to acquire \ndigital images of the images of the markings made by a firearm on \nbullets and cartridge casings; the images then undergo an automated \ninitial comparison. If a high confidence match emerges, experts compare \nthe original evidence to confirm a match. Once a match is found, law \nenforcement can begin tracing that weapon from its original sale to the \nperson who used it to commit the crime.\n  Microscopic comparison of bullets and shell casings has been in \npractice for many years, even before formal databases were established. \nHowever, in the past 15 years, through the use of computer databases, \nballistics technology described above has developed into a systematic \ntool for law enforcement to solve gun crimes. Since the early 1990's, \nmore than 250 crime labs and law enforcement agencies in more than 40 \nStates have been operating independent ballistics systems maintained by \neither the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives \n``ATFE'', or the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Together, ATFE's \nIntegrated Ballistics Identification System, ``IBIS'', and the FBI's \nDRUGFIRE system have been responsible for linking 5,700 guns to two or \nmore crimes where corroborating evidence was otherwise lacking. These \nlinks have helped law enforcement and prosecutors bring thousands of \ndangerous criminals to justice.\n  Never before have the tremendous law enforcement benefits of \nballistics testing been so apparent. I would like to take the \nopportunity to describe a few instances where ballistics technology \nhelped solve otherwise unsolvable crimes.\n  Last fall, law enforcement officials used ballistics testing to match \nthe bullets and shell casings found at the scenes of the sniper \nshootings in the Nation's Capital region, and later to other deadly \nshootings across the country. The bullets and casings were also linked \nto the gun that the accused assailants had in their possession when \nthey were arrested. This ballistics information has provided vital \nevidence to prosecutors and will help keep the snipers behind bars.\n  In another example, the only evidence at the scene of a brutal \nhomicide in Milwaukee was 9 millimeter cartridge casings--there were no \nother clues. But 4 months later, when a teenage male was arrested on an \nunrelated charge, he was found to be in possession of the firearm that \nhad discharged those casings. Ballistics linked the two cases. \nProsecutors successfully prosecuted three adult suspects for the \nhomicide and convicted the teen in juvenile court.\n  On September 9, 2000, several suspects were arrested in Boston for \nthe illegal possession of three handguns. Each of the guns was test \nfired, and the ballistics information was compared to evidence found at \nother crime scenes. The police quickly found that the three guns were \nused in the commission of 15 felonies in Massachusetts and Rhode \nIsland. This routine arrest for illegal possession of firearms provided \npolice with new leads in the investigation of 15 unsolved crimes. \nWithout the ballistics testing, these crimes would not have been linked \nand might have never been solved.\n  As you can see, ballistics technology helps law enforcement \nexponentially in their efforts to solve gun crimes. But while success \nstories are increasingly frequent, the full potential of ballistics\n\n[[Page S2926]]\n\ntesting is still untapped. One way that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, \nFirearms and Explosives is making ballistics testing more accessible to \nstate and local law enforcement is through the installation of a new \nnetwork of ballistics imaging machines. The final introduction of the \nmachines across the country is almost complete and, once it is, the \ncomputers will be able to access each other and search for a greater \nnumber of images. The National Integrated Ballistics Information \nNetwork, better know as ``NIBIN,'' will be a regional network of \ndatabases that will permit law enforcement in one locality access to \ninformation stored in other gun crime databases around the entire \ncountry. According to the ATFE, ``the NIBIN program is a key element to \nATFE's efforts [to remove violent offenders from America's streets].''\n  But ballistics testing is only as useful as the number of images in \nthe database. Today, almost all jurisdictions are limited to images of \nbullets and cartridge casings that come from guns used in crimes. The \nTRACE Act would dramatically expand the scope of that database by \nmandating that all guns manufactured or imported be test fired before \nbeing placed into the stream of commerce. The images collected from the \ntest firing would then be collected and accessible to law enforcement--\nand law enforcement only--for the purpose of investigating and \nprosecuting gun crimes.\n  Recently, studies done about ballistics testing and ballistics \ndatabases have been in the news. Concern has been expressed by some \nabout the size and practicality of a large database. However, it is \nimportant to point out that this bill would merely expand upon the \nexisting network of 16 multi-state regional databases, rather than \ncreate a single large national database. In addition, accusations that \nsystems would be log-jammed with too many entries has been refuted by \nATFE ballistics experts. Since its inception, the speed and efficiency \nof ballistics databases has substantially increased. For example, from \n1994 to 1999 the IBIS correlation speed for cartridge casings dropped \nfrom 35 seconds to 1.7 seconds, and correlation speed for bullets \ndropped from 4 seconds to 0.3 seconds. The conversion to NIBIN is \nexpected to yield an even faster return of correlation results, \nregardless of an increase in entries.\n  Of course no investigative tool is perfect or effective in every \nsingle situation, not even fingerprints. However, ATFE maintains that \nthe availability of an open-case file of many thousands of exhibits, \nsearchable within minutes, provides invaluable information to law \nenforcement authorities. TRACE would enhance the current ballistics \ndatabases by giving federal, state, and local law enforcement access to \neven more evidence that will help them solve more gun crimes and make \nour communities safer.\n  Today, police can find out more about a human being than they can \nabout a gun used in a crime. Law enforcement can use DNA testing, take \nfingerprints and blood samples, search a person's health records, \nperuse bank records and credit card statements, obtain phone records \nand get a list of book purchases to link a suspect to a crime. Yet, the \nbullets found at the scene of a crime often cannot be traced back to \nthe gun used because our ballistics images database is not \ncomprehensive. Many of those on the front lines of the fight against \ncrime are in favor of ballistics testing. In fact, in my home state of \nWisconsin, over 75 percent of police chiefs surveyed are supportive of \nthe use of ballistics technology.\n  The burden on manufacturers is minimal--we authorize funds to \nunderwrite the cost of testing--and the assistance to law enforcement \nis considerable. And don't take our word for it, ask the gun \nmanufacturers and the police. Listen to what Paul Januzzo, the vice-\npresident of the gun manufacturer Glock, said in reference to \nballistics testing, ``Our mantra has been that the issue is crime \ncontrol, not gun control . . . it would be two-faced of us not to want \nthis.'' In their agreement with the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, Smith & Wesson agreed to perform ballistics testing on all \nnew handguns. And Ben Wilson, the chief of the firearms section at \nATFE, emphasized the importance of ballistics testing as a \ninvestigative device, ``This [ballistics] allows you literally to find \na needle in a haystack.''\n  To be sure, we are sensitive to the notion that law abiding hunters \nand sportsmen need to be protected from any misuse of the ballistics \ndatabase by government. The TRACE Act explicitly prohibits ballistics \ninformation from being used for any purpose unless it is necessary for \nthe investigation of a gun crime.\n  The TRACE Act will enhance a revolutionary new technology that helps \nsolve crime. The technology is becoming more and more advanced to \naccommodate high volume-usage, and it is expected to continue to get \nbetter and better. Ballistics testing will help solve more gun crimes, \nprosecute more criminals, and ensure that more communities are \nprotected from violence. TRACE is a worthwhile piece of crime control \nlegislation and I hope that the Senate will move quickly to pass it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 469\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to extend the authority for the construction of a \nmemorial to Martin Luther King, Jr; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to join today with Senators \nWarner, Lugar, Mikulski and Durbin in introducing legislation that \nwould extend the legislative authority for the Martin Luther King, Jr. \nMemorial for an additional three years. The monument to Martin Luther \nKing, Jr., which will be built on the Mall, will honor one of this \nNation's most treasured citizens. Dr. King challenged us to live by the \nprinciples set forth at this Nation's inception, and forever changed \nthe fabric of this country.\n  Despite the enormous dedication of the Martin Luther King, Jr. \nNational Memorial Project Foundation, Inc., additional time is \nnecessary for the Foundation to erect a fitting tribute to Dr. King. \nThe Commemorative Works Act currently requires that construction of the \nMemorial begin by November 2003. However, meeting the administrative \nprocedures and fundraising requirements of the Act has been a very slow \nprocess.\n  On November 12, 1996, legislation was enacted authorizing \nconstruction of the Memorial within a seven-year period. It then took \nCongress another two years to pass legislation authorizing placement of \nthe Memorial in Area I of the Capital. Then the Foundation worked with \nthe National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission for Fine \nArts for over a year to locate an appropriate site for the Memorial \nwithin Area I. As a result, the Foundation was unable to select a \ndesign for the Memorial until September 2000.\n  This consultative process has been challenging, but it has resulted \nin a design for a Memorial on the Tidal Basin that will fittingly \nreflect the legacy of the greatest civil rights leader of our time. \nInitial estimates indicate that the construction costs of the Memorial \nalone could be as much as $60 million, and the Foundation is actively \nengaged in fundraising for the Memorial. However, it does not expect to \nhave the necessary funds to receive the construction permit by the \ndeadline of November 2003 as dictated by the Commemorative Works Act. \nOne hundred percent of the funding must be privately financed, and the \ntotal cost of the project could near $100 million. Our legislation \nwould give the Foundation an additional three years to raise the \nnecessary funds to obtain the construction permit, and would ensure \nthat work on the Memorial is completed. This extension of legislative \nauthority has been done before for other memorials, given the length of \ntime it usually takes to embark on a project of this magnitude, and it \nshould be done for the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial.\n  Dr. King serves as a reminder that change is brought about most \npowerfully when it is done by non-violent means. This country owes much \nto Dr. King, most notably his legacy of non-violent protest that has \ninformed and influenced subsequent rights campaigns in our nation. \nVisitors will come to the Memorial from every part of this country and \nindeed the world, to be inspired anew by Dr. King's words and deeds, \nand the extraordinary story of his life. Mr. President, I ask my \ncolleagues to support this important legislation and grant the \nFoundation the additional time it needs to complete this significant \nmonument.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 470\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. MEMORIAL TO MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.\n\n       Section 508(b) of the Omnibus Parks and Public Lands \n     Management Act of 1996 (110 Stat. 4157) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``The establishment'' and all that follows \n     through the period at the end and inserting the following:\n       ``(1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), the \n     establishment of the memorial shall be in accordance with \n     chapter 89 of title 40, United States Code.''; and\n       (2) by inserting after paragraph (1) (as designated by \n     paragraph (1)) the following:\n       ``(2) Exception.--Notwithstanding section 8903(e) of title \n     40, United States Code, the authority provided by this \n     section terminates on November 12, 2006.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Jeffords, and Mr. \n        Lieberman):\n  S. 473. A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \nclarify the jurisdiction of the United States over waters of the United \nStates; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am introducing important \nlegislation to affirm Federal jurisdiction over the waters of the \nUnited States. I am pleased to have three members of the Environment \nand Public Works Committee, the Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer, \nthe Senator from Vermont, Mr. Jeffords, and the Senator from \nConnecticut, Mr. Lieberman, as original cosponsors of this bill.\n  In the U.S. Supreme Court's January 2001 decision, Solid Waste Agency \nof Northern Cook County versus the Army Corps of Engineers, a 5 to 4 \nmajority limited the authority of Federal agencies to use the so-called \nmigratory bird rule as the basis for asserting Clean Water Act \njurisdiction over non-navigable, intrastate, isolated wetlands, \nstreams, ponds, and other bodies of water.\n  This decision, known as the SWANCC decision, means that the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency and Army Corps of Engineers can no \nlonger enforce Federal Clean Water Act protection mechanisms to protect \na waterway solely on the basis that it is used as habitat for migratory \nbirds.\n  In its discussion of the case, the Court went beyond the issue of the \nmigratory bird rule and questioned whether Congress intended the Clean \nWater Act to provide protection for isolated ponds, streams, wetlands \nand other waters, as it had been interpreted to provide for most of the \nlast 30 years. While not the legal holding of the case, the Court's \ndiscussion has resulted in a wide variety of interpretations by EPA and \nCorps officials that jeopardize protection for wetlands, and other \nwaters.\n\n[[Page S2928]]\n\nThe wetlands at risk include prairie potholes and bogs, familiar to \nmany in Wisconsin, and many other types of wetlands.\n  In effect, the Court's decision removed much of the Clean Water Act \nprotection for between 30 percent to 60 percent of the Nation's \nwetlands. An estimate from my home state of Wisconsin suggested that \nmore than 60 percent of the wetlands in my state lost federal \nprotection. Wisconsin is not alone. The National Association of State \nWetland Managers has been collecting data from states across the \ncountry. For example, Nebraska estimates that it will lose protection \nfor more than 40 percent of its wetlands. Indiana estimates they will \nlose 31 percent of total wetland acreage and 74 percent of the total \nnumber of wetlands. Delaware estimates the loss of protection for 33 \npercent or more of their freshwater wetlands.\n  These wetlands absorb floodwaters, prevent pollution from reaching \nour rivers and streams, and provide crucial habitat for most of the \nnations ducks and other waterfowl, as well as hundreds of other bird, \nfish, shellfish and amphibian species. Loss of these waters would have \na devastating effect on our environment.\n  In addition, by narrowing the water and wetland areas subject to \nFederal regulation, the decision also shifts more of the economic \nburden for regulating wetlands to State and local governments. My home \nState of Wisconsin has passed legislation to assume the regulation of \nisolated waters, but many other States have not. This patchwork of \nregulation means that the standards for protection of wetlands \nnationwide is unclear, confusing, and jeopardizes the migratory birds \nand other wildlife that depend on these wetlands.\n  Since 2001, the confusion over the interpretation of the SWANCC \ndecision is growing. On January 15, 2003, the EPA and Army Corps of \nEngineers published in the Federal Register an Advanced Notice of \nProposed Rulemaking raising questions about the jurisdiction of the \nClean Water Act. Simultaneously, they released a guidance memo to their \nfield staff regarding Clean Water Act jurisdiction.\n  The agencies claim these actions are necessary because of the SWANCC \ncase. But both the guidance memo and the proposed rulemaking go far \nbeyond the holding in SWANCC. The guidance took effect right away and \nhas had an immediate impact. It tells the Corps and EPA staff to stop \nasserting jurisdiction over isolated waters without first obtaining \npermission from headquarters. Based on this guidance, waters that the \nEPA and Corps judge to be outside the Clean Water Act can be filled, \ndredged, and polluted without a permit or any other long-standing Clean \nWater Act safeguard.\n  The rulemaking announces the Administration's intention to consider \neven broader changes to Clean Water Act coverage for our waters. \nSpecifically, the agencies are questioning whether there is any basis \nfor asserting Clean Water Act jurisdiction over additional waters, like \nintermittent streams. The possibility for a redefinition of our waters \nis troubling because there is only one definition of the term ``water'' \nin the Clean Water Act. The wetlands program, the point source program \nwhich stops the dumping of pollution, and the non-point program \ngoverning polluted runoff all depend on this definition.\n  If we don't protect a category of waters from being filled under the \nwetlands program, we also fail to protect them from having trash or raw \nsewage dumped in them, or having other activities that violate the \nClean Water Act conducted in them as well.\n  Congress needs to re-establish the common understanding of the Clean \nWater Act's jurisdiction to protect all waters of the U.S.--the \nunderstanding that Congress held when the Act was adopted in 1972--as \nreflected in the law, legislative history, and longstanding \nregulations, practice, and judicial interpretations prior to the SWANCC \ndecision.\n  The proposed legislation does three things, and it is a very simple \nbill. It adopts a statutory definition of ``waters of the United \nStates'' based on a longstanding definition of waters in the EPA and \nCorps of Engineers' regulations. Second, it deletes the term navigable \nfrom the Act to clarify that Congress's primary concern in 1972 was to \nprotect the nation's waters from pollution, rather than just sustain \nthe navigability of waterways, and to reinforce that original intent. \nFinally, it includes a set of findings that explain the factual basis \nfor Congress to assert its constitutional authority over waters and \nwetlands on all relevant Constitutional grounds, including the Commerce \nClause, the Property Clause, the Treaty Clause, and Necessary and \nProper Clause.\n  In conclusion, I am very pleased to have the support of so many \nenvironmental and conservation groups, and well as organizations that \nrepresent those who regulate and manage our country's wetlands, such \nas: the Natural Resources Defense Council, Earthjustice, the National \nWildlife Federation, Sierra Club, American Rivers, the National Audubon \nSociety, U.S. Public Interest Research Group, Defenders of Wildlife, \nthe Ocean Conservancy, Trout Unlimited, the Izaac Walton League, and \nthe Association of State Floodplain Managers. They know, as I do, that \nwe need to re-affirm the federal government's role in protecting our \nwater. This legislation is a first step in doing just that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 473\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Clean Water Authority \n     Restoration Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n       (1) To reaffirm the original intent of Congress in enacting \n     the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 \n     (86 Stat. 816) to restore and maintain the chemical, \n     physical, and biological integrity of the waters of the \n     United States.\n       (2) To clearly define the waters of the United States that \n     are subject to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act.\n       (3) To provide protection to the waters of the United \n     States to the fullest extent of the legislative authority of \n     Congress under the Constitution.\n\n     SEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Water is a unique and precious resource that is \n     necessary to sustain human life and the life of animals and \n     plants.\n       (2) Water is used not only for human, animal, and plant \n     consumption, but is also important for agriculture, \n     transportation, flood control, energy production, recreation, \n     fishing and shellfishing, and municipal and commercial uses.\n       (3) In enacting amendments to the Federal Water Pollution \n     Control Act in 1972 and through subsequent amendment, \n     including the Clean Water Act of 1977 (91 Stat. 1566) and the \n     Water Quality Act of 1987 (101 Stat. 7), Congress established \n     the national objective of restoring and maintaining the \n     chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the waters of \n     the United States and recognized that achieving this \n     objective requires uniform, minimum national water quality \n     and aquatic ecosystem protection standards to restore and \n     maintain the natural structures and functions of the aquatic \n     ecosystems of the United States.\n       (4) Water is transported through interconnected hydrologic \n     cycles, and the pollution, impairment, or destruction of any \n     part of an aquatic system may affect the chemical, physical, \n     and biological integrity of other parts of the aquatic \n     system.\n       (5) Protection of intrastate waters, along with other \n     waters of the United States, is necessary to restore and \n     maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of \n     all waters in the United States.\n       (6) The regulation of discharges of pollutants into \n     interstate and intrastate waters is an integral part of the \n     comprehensive clean water regulatory program of the United \n     States.\n       (7) Small and periodically-flowing streams comprise the \n     majority of all stream channels in the United States and \n     serve critical biological and hydrological functions that \n     affect entire watersheds, including reducing the introduction \n     of pollutants to large streams and rivers, and especially \n     affecting the life cycles of aquatic organisms and the flow \n     of higher order streams during floods.\n       (8) The pollution or other degradation of waters of the \n     United States, individually and in the aggregate, has a \n     substantial relation to and effect on interstate commerce.\n       (9) Protection of the waters of the United States, \n     including intrastate waters, is necessary to prevent \n     significant harm to interstate commerce and sustain a robust \n     system of interstate commerce in the future.\n       (10) Waters, including wetlands, provide protection from \n     flooding, and draining or filling wetlands and channelizing \n     or filling streams, including intrastate wetlands and \n     streams, can cause or exacerbate flooding,\n\n[[Page S2929]]\n\n     placing a significant burden on interstate commerce.\n       (11) Millions of people in the United States depend on \n     wetlands and other waters of the United States to filter \n     water and recharge surface and subsurface drinking water \n     supplies, protect human health, and create economic \n     opportunity.\n       (12) Millions of people in the United States enjoy \n     recreational activities that depend on intrastate waters, \n     such as waterfowl hunting, bird watching, fishing, and \n     photography and other graphic arts, and those activities and \n     associated travel generate billions of dollars of income each \n     year for the travel, tourism, recreation, and sporting \n     sectors of the economy of the United States.\n       (13) Activities that result in the discharge of pollutants \n     into waters of the United States are commercial or economic \n     in nature.\n       (14) States have the responsibility and right to prevent, \n     reduce, and eliminate pollution of waters, and the Federal \n     Water Pollution Control Act respects the rights and \n     responsibilities of States by preserving for States the \n     ability to manage permitting, grant, and research programs to \n     prevent, reduce, and eliminate pollution, and to establish \n     standards and programs more protective of a State's waters \n     than is provided under Federal standards and programs.\n       (15) Protecting the quality of and regulating activities \n     affecting the waters of the United States is a necessary and \n     proper means of implementing treaties to which the United \n     States is a party, including treaties protecting species of \n     fish, birds, and wildlife.\n       (16) Protecting the quality of and regulating activities \n     affecting the waters of the United States is a necessary and \n     proper means of protecting Federal land, including hundreds \n     of millions of acres of parkland, refuge land, and other land \n     under Federal ownership and the wide array of waters \n     encompassed by that land.\n       (17) Protecting the quality of and regulating activities \n     affecting the waters of the United States is necessary to \n     protect Federal land and waters from discharges of pollutants \n     and other forms of degradation.\n\n     SEC. 4. DEFINITION OF WATERS OF THE UNITED STATES.\n\n       Section 502 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 \n     U.S.C. 1362) is amended--\n       (1) by striking paragraph (7);\n       (2) by redesignating paragraphs (8) through (23) as \n     paragraphs (7) through (22), respectively; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(23) Waters of the united states.--The term `waters of \n     the United States' means all waters subject to the ebb and \n     flow of the tide, the territorial seas, and all interstate \n     and intrastate waters and their tributaries, including lakes, \n     rivers, streams (including intermittent streams), mudflats, \n     sandflats, wetlands, sloughs, prairie potholes, wet meadows, \n     playa lakes, natural ponds, and all impoundments of the \n     foregoing, to the fullest extent that these waters, or \n     activities affecting these waters, are subject to the \n     legislative power of Congress under the Constitution.''.\n\n     SEC. 5. CONFORMING AMENDMENTS.\n\n       The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et \n     seq.) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``navigable waters of the United States'' \n     each place it appears and inserting ``waters of the United \n     States'';\n       (2) in section 304(l)(1) by striking ``navigable waters'' \n     in the heading and inserting ``waters of the united states''; \n     and\n       (3) by striking ``navigable waters'' each place it appears \n     and inserting ``waters of the United States''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THOMAS:\n  S. 475. A bill to reform the nation's outdated laws relating to the \nelectric industry, improve the operation of our transmission system, \nenhance reliability of our electric grid, increase consumer benefits \nfrom whole electric competition and restore investor confidence in the \nelectric industry; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I come to the floor to talk about one of \nthe things that is so important. Obviously, items connected with \nterrorism, the war in Iraq have to be dealt with. We have to deal with \nheightened homeland security and related issues. Health care is an area \nwe need to talk about. Prescription drugs is in the process of this.\n  One issue that is particularly important is an energy policy. I don't \nthink there has ever been a time when it has been more apparent and \nmore important to deal with energy policy. We have an economy, prices \nwith gas and energy that are high. We have uncertainty, certainly, in \nthe Middle East. We have had a Venezuelan problem. We had a very cold \nwinter. We cannot seem to come together to put together a policy that \nwill allow us to move forward, an aggressive energy policy. I would \nlike to talk briefly about a component of that which I think is very \nimportant, and that is an electric component.\n  I rise today to introduce the Electric Transmission Reliability and \nEnhancement Act of 2003. It is my intention to build on a changing \nwholesale, competitive, open access market and to suggest that we build \nthat into a policy. Things have changed in the way energy is generated, \nthe way energy is transmitted, the way energy is sold. We need to \nchange our policy, as well.\n  Very simply, what we have is: In years past, there was a generator \nthat generated for their own distribution area. That was pretty simple. \nPrices were controlled. It was a simple technique. Now we have more and \nmore merchant generators, people who do not have a constituency or \ndistribution system of their own but they sell into the marketplace. \nThis is good. There is competition. And we will see more and more of \nthat. But to do that, we have to update our laws and we have to update \nthe regulations that go with that. My legislation would extend and \nimprove open nondiscriminatory access policies. Access to transmission \nwould remove antiquated Federal barriers that stand in the way of \ncompetitive wholesale markets. Wholesale markets that are competitive \nare new. We have to change to meet those needs. We have to encourage \nincreased investments in our transmission system and establish \nreliability standards.\n  We saw what happened in California 2 years ago. If there is no \nreliability, we cannot depend upon getting that energy to people's \nhomes, to businesses, and then we have a very difficult situation.\n  Particularly what has changed now is it is interstate. For years we \ngrew up with the fact that in your State the State controlled both the \ngeneration and the distribution, and that worked well. Now we go across \ninterstate lines and there needs to be something different.\n  Legislatively we have to pare down our wish list so we get to the \nbare essentials and keep those things that are necessary.\n  It seems clear, if we are going to have a truly wholesale market, we \nneed to ensure that all the industry participants play by the same \nrules. Only Congress can give FERC, the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission, the tools it needs to ensure that all participants get \ntreated fairly in a competitive marketplace. Under the Federal law, \ncurrently FERC has no jurisdiction or authority over transmission owned \nby public power agencies, municipals, cooperatives, yet they want to \nparticipate and need to participate and should participate. Many of \nthem--most--are willing to participate.\n  These nonregulated utilities represent 52 percent of the total, so we \ndo not want to move forward with FERC's so-called market plan. I think \nit goes too far getting into the authority of the States. But there are \nsome changes that need to be made, and we would like to do that.\n  We also need to protect those cooperatives. I grew up in a area of \ncooperatives and spent much of my life working with cooperatives. So we \nhave given that break. Those that sell less than 4 million megawatt \nhours per year are entirely exempt. We think that is as it should be.\n  We would repeal the Public Utility Holding Company Act, PUHCA, \nbecause it needs to be restructured and the deployment of capital in \nthis industry needs to go where it is desperately needed. We need to do \nthat. There is ample regulation over those investments now in the \nexisting business. We want to make it easier for people to be able to \ninvest, produce competitively, and go into the marketplace.\n  The Department of Justice, Federal Trade Commission, and the State \ncommissions would still be able to monitor rates and prevent cross-\nsubsidies. So my legislation would prospectively eliminate mandatory \npurchase and sales obligations of PURPA, one that was put in a very \nlong time ago. Despite the State administering it, it causes favoritism \nto many utilities and changes things.\n  Over the years the grid has been protected through voluntary \nstandards and that is exactly right. But what we are now faced with is \nto have RTOs, regional transportation organizations, where they can \nmake those decisions within the RTO. There would be a Western one, a \nMidwestern one, a New England one, and so on. But then connecting with \nthose will be an interstate, like an interstate highway. That has to, \nof course, be organized and controlled by a national group because it \nserves all these different ones.\n\n[[Page S2930]]\n\n  So what we need is to modernize our system so we can accommodate \nthings that have changed. Reliability organizations must be run by \nmarket participants and be overseen by FERC. Reliability organizations \nmust be made up of representatives of everyone who is affected: \nresidential, commercial, industrial. That can be done, and this \nprovides an opportunity to do that.\n  During our discussions last year, we were made to address some of the \nmore egregious behavior and found a great deal of issues that needed to \nbe dealt with--market manipulation, those kinds of things. This is very \ncomplex. I believe we can address these issues with regulatory \nagencies, things that truly can exist.\n\n  So my legislation would provide a greater price in the transmission \nof availability of information and outlaw the practice of roundtrip \ntrading. In the past we found some trading where they went around, got \nit back, made a profit on the sale, and served no one.\n  We prohibit the reporting of false information for the purpose of \nmanipulating price indices. Again, we go back a little bit to the \nCalifornia situation, where there obviously is a great need to do some \nopening up so there is visibility of what is happening. That is what we \nare seeking to do. It would increase civil and criminal penalties for \nthe violation of the Federal Power Act and would accelerate the \neffective dates of refunds and so on.\n  In the end, it is about consumers, it is about serving consumers, it \nis about competition, it is about reliability, it is about keeping the \nlights on--the part of energy that probably affects more people and \nmore businesses than any other. It is my hope that the Electric \nTransmission Reliability Enhancement Act of 2003 will produce a more \nreliable, efficient transmission system, a more dependable and more \naffordable product for the end user, and perhaps more than anything \nelse, bring our system and our oversight into the modern time of \nelectric generation and transmission.\n  Things change. We need to change. Now is the time. We will have an \nenergy bill. It needs to have an energy component.\n  Mr. President, any comprehensive energy bill must contain an electric \ncomponent. That is why, today, I rise to introduce the ``Electric \nTransmission and Reliability Enhancement Act of 2003.'' It is my \nintention to build on the competitive wholesale open access policies \nadopted by the Congress in the 1992 Energy Policy Act. My legislation \nwould extend and improve these open, non-discriminatory access \npolicies; remove antiquated federal statutory barriers that stand in \nthe way of competitive wholesale markets; encourage increased \ninvestment in our transmission system and establish enforceable \nreliability standards to help ensure the continued reliability of the \ninterstate transmission system.\n  The state of the industry is far weaker financially than it has been \nin years. Billions of dollars of shareholder value has evaporated. \nAccess to capital is becoming an important issue for large segments of \nthe industry that are fighting for survival. In addition, the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission, FERC, policy regarding wholesale markets \nseems to be in a state of constant change. The Standard Market Design, \nSMD, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, NOPR, has divided regulators and \nindustry participants in a way that may be unprecedented, threatening \nmore years of rulemakings, litigation and regulatory uncertainty.\n  If we are to legislate successfully, we will have to par down our \nwish list to the bare essentials, plus those issues necessary for the \nelectric industry to attract the capital it needs to keep our lights \non. Last year, the Enron fallout dominated the debate. By being on the \ndefensive most of last year, it was not possible to successfully \nadvance those issues most important to consumers and the industry that \nserves them.\n  It seems clear that if truly competitive wholesale markets are to \nexist, there is a need to ensure that all industry participants play by \nthe same rules. While FERC has tried to ensure this, the Commission's \ntools are limited. Only Congress can give FERC the tools it needs to \nensure that all industry participants in competitive wholesale markets \nplay by the same rules.\n  The Wyoming State commissioners wrote that ``under present Federal \nlaw the FERC has no jurisdiction or authority over transmission \nfacilities owned by public power agencies, municipalities and \ncooperatives. In the West these types of entities own a substantial \nportion, perhaps as much as half of the interstate electric \ntransmission system.'' As a matter of fact, in the Western Electric \nCoordinating Council, an area that encompasses all or part of 11 \nWestern States and parts of Canada, non-FERC jurisdictional facilities \naccount for 52 percent of transmission miles.\n  The Wyoming commissioners claim that, ``without the full \nparticipation of all of those who own transmission in the West, the \nFERC's wholesale market initiative will fail to provide the full \nspectrum of benefits Congress expected when it created wholesale \nelectricity markets. System optimization requires that bulk power be \nable to move freely throughout the interconnected system without regard \nto who owns the facilities over which the power travels. Removing the \ninstitutional impediments to the free movement of bulk power is also \nrequisite to identifying the physical constraints that exist in the \nwestern system. Proper planning for the relief of such constraints \ndepends on properly identifying and quantifying them, absent other \neconomic and institutional constraints.''\n\n  They go on to say that such a vision for the future of wholesale \npower markets makes a compelling case for the inclusion of all \nfacilities which can be used to move bulk power across the West, \nregardless of ownership. Anything less than 100 percent participation \nby transmission owning entities will simply perpetuate some level of \ninefficiency in the system and will continue to afford those who do not \nparticipate the ability to favor their own generation resources.\n  My legislation would permit FERC to require certain nonregulated \nutilities to offer transmission serviced at comparable rates to those \nthey charge themselves, and on terms and conditions comparable to those \napplicable to jurisdictional public utilities. Currently nonregulated \ntransmitting utilities would not be subject to the full panoply of FERC \nregulation under this provision. Instead, a ``light handed'' form of \nregulation would apply and small nonregulated entities, such as those \nthat sell less than 4,000,000 MW/h per year, would be entirely exempt \nfrom these nondiscrimination requirements.\n  It also seems clear that the Public Utility Holding Company Act \nPUHCA, is hindering necessary restructuring of the industry and the \ndeployment of capital into an industry that desperately needs it. \nInvestors are deterred simply because they do not want to deal with the \nPUHCA rules and restrictions. If repealed, utility securities will \ncontinue to be regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, \nSEC, FERC and most state commissions. Mergers and acquisitions of \njurisdictional assets would still require FERC and state commission \napproval and review by Department of Justice, DOJ, and the Federal \nTrade Commission, FTC. FERC and State commissions would still be able \nto monitor rates and prevent cross-subsidies.\n  Despite State progress in administering the Public Utility Regulatory \nPolicies Act of 1978, PURPA, more in-tune with markets, it is clear \nthat PURPA continues to provide special privileges to certain favored \ngenerators at the expense of utilities and their customers. Like PUHCA, \nPURPA is no longer needed in today's competitive wholesale markets. My \nlegislation prospectively eliminates the mandatory purchase and sell \nobligations of PURPA.\n  Over the years the grid has been well protected through voluntary \nstandards established by the North American Electric Reliability \nCouncil, NERC, NERC's voluntary reliability standards--which are not \nenforceable--have generally been complied with by the electric power \nindustry. But with the opening of the wholesale power market to \ncompetition, our transmission grid is being used in ways for which it \nwas not designed. New system strains are also being created by the \nbreakup of vertically integrated utilities and by the emergence of new \nmarket structures and participants. The results of these changes have \nbeen an increase in the number and severity of violations of NERC's \nvoluntary rules.\n\n[[Page S2931]]\n\n  My legislation converts the existing NERC voluntary reliability \nsystem into a mandatory reliability system. A nation-wide organization \nwould have the authority to establish and enforce reliability \nstandards, and take into account regional differences. The new \nreliability organization will be run by market participants, and will \nbe overseen by the FERC in the U.S. The reliability organization will \nbe made up of representatives of everyone who is affected--residential, \ncommercial and industrial consumers; state public utility commissions; \nindependent power producers; electric utilities and others. There is no \nquestion that we need a new system to safeguard the integrity of our \nelectric grid. My legislation would do this, using language that was \neffectively agreed upon last fall by House and Senate conferees for the \nenergy bill.\n  During discussions last year, efforts were made to address some of \nthe more egregious behavior and attempted market manipulation through \nlegislation. While this area is obviously very complex, I believe that \nwe need to address this issue if regulatory gaps truly do exist. I \nrealize my attempt might not be perfect, but I wanted to intimate \ndiscussion on this very important topic if, in fact, regulatory \nagencies do need additional authority to police and monitor the \nindustry.\n  My legislation will provide greater price and transmission \navailability information, outlaw the practice of round trip trading and \nprohibit reporting of false information for the purpose of manipulating \nprice indices. In addition, I've included authority the FERC has \nrequested and that would increase civil and criminal penalties for \nviolation of the Federal Power Act and accelerate the refund effective \ndate to the date of filing of a complaint.\n  In the end it's about the consumer. It is my hope and vision that the \n``Electric Transmission and Reliability and Enhancement Act of 2003'' I \nam introducing today will produce a more reliable and efficient \ntransmission system and that these improvements will result in a more \ndependable and affordable product for the end user. This legislation is \nthe best solution to move forward with a better product for all classes \nof consumers and the industry as a whole.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 475\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to disallow \ndeductions and credits for companies who discriminate against Canadian \npharmacies that pass along discounts to consumers living in the United \nStates; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation on \nbehalf of Wisconsin's seniors and taxpayers whose wallets are being \ngauged by certain pharmaceutical companies. My legislation is in \nresponse to certain pharmaceutical companies' decision to target \nseniors who are crossing into Canada to get more affordable \nprescription drugs for their own use.\n  If these pharmaceutical companies are going to price gauge seniors's \nwallets, they don't deserve the taxpayers' support.\n  A growing number of American seniors are obtaining their prescription \ndrugs from Canada for personal use.\n  Unfortunately, many of these seniors who are crossing the boarder to \naccess more affordable prescription drugs for their personal use are \nbeing targeted by the very pharmaceutical companies that receive \nmillions in tax breaks.\n  I recently received a call from seniors in my state that Glaxo Smith \nKlein had decided to stop supplying Canadian pharmacies that resell its \ndrugs to Americans, thereby preventing them from receiving the same \nbenefits these pharmacies provide to Canadians.\n  The Seniors in my State were not the only ones who took notice of \nthis action. On February 21st of this month, Seniors groups from 12 \nStates, including Wisconsin, sent Glaxo a message by launching a \nboycott of nonprescription products of Glaxo-Smith-Kline.\n  Congress should also send all pharmaceutical companies a message that \nthis practice simply is unacceptable.\n  I think the single most important step we can take is to modernize \nMedicare and make it better is to eliminate the current inequities in \nthe Medicare system and provide the prescription drug coverage senior \ncitizens need.\n  At the same time Congress should pass legislation, that Senators \nSchumer, McCain, and I introduced that would bring lower-cost generic \ndrugs to the market faster and lower the cost of prescription drugs by \n$60 billion.\n  Until we pass a comprehensive prescription drug benefit, we must \nensure that seniors are not targeted by pharmaceutical companies. If \nthese drug companies actively discriminate against American seniors, we \nshould not provide them tax breaks.\n  That's why my legislation would deny tax breaks to drug companies who \ndiscriminate against Canadian pharmacies that provide Americans the \nsame discount that they provide to Canadians.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SARBANES (for himself, Mr. Warner, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \n        Campbell, Mrs. Hutchison, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Sessions, and Mr. \n        Miller):\n  S. 478. A bill to grant a Federal charter Korean War Veterans \nAssociation, Incorporated, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am once again introducing \nlegislation together with Senators Warner, Campbell, Murray, Clinton, \nSessions, Hutchison and Miller which would grant a Federal Charter to \nthe Korean War Veterans Association, Incorporated. This legislation, \nwhich has passed the Senate in the past two Congresses, recognizes and \nhonors the 5.7 million Americans who fought and served during the \nKorean War for their struggles and sacrifices on behalf of freedom and \nthe principles and ideals of our nation.\n  For the past three years, under the direction of Public Law 105-85, \nwe have been marking the 50th Anniversary of the events of the Korean \nWar--beginning with the events of June 1950 when the North Korea \nPeople's Army swept across the 38th Parallel to occupy Seoul, South \nKorea. Members of our Armed Forces--including many from the State of \nMaryland--immediately answered the call of the U.N. to repel this \nforceful invasion. Without hesitation, these soldiers traveled to an \nunfamiliar corner of the world to join an unprecedented multi-national \nforce comprised of 22 countries and risked their lives to protect \nfreedom. The Americans who led this international effort were true \npatriots who fought with remarkable courage.\n  In battles such as Pork Chop Hill, the Inchon Landing and the frozen \nChosin Reservoir, which was fought in temperatures as low as fifty-\nseven degrees below zero, they faced some of the most brutal combat in \nhistory. This year, on July 27, we will commemorate the 50th \nAnniversary of the signing of the Military Armistice Agreement which \nofficially ended armed hostilities. By the time the fighting had ended, \n8,177 Americans were listed as missing or prisoners of war--some of \nwhom are still missing--and over 36,000 Americans had died. One hundred \nand thirty-one Korean War Veterans were awarded the nation's highest \ncommendation for combat bravery, the Medal of Honor. Ninety-four of \nthese soldiers gave their lives in the process.\n  There is an engraving on the Korean War Veterans Memorial which \nreflects these losses and how brutal a war this was. It reads, \n``Freedom is not Free.'' Yet, as a Nation, we have done little more \nthan establish this memorial to publicly acknowledge the bravery of \nthose who fought in the Korean War. The Korean War has been termed by \nmany as the ``Forgotten War.'' Freedom is not free. We owe our Korean \nWar Veterans a debt of gratitude. Granting this Federal charter--at no \ncost to the government--is a small expression of appreciation that we \nas a Nation can offer to these men and women, one which will enable \nthem to work as a unified front to ensure that the ``Forgotten War'' is \nforgotten no more.\n  The Korean War Veterans Association was originally incorporated on \nJune 25, 1985. Since its first annual reunion and memorial service in \nArlington, Virginia, where its members decided to develop a national \nfocus and strong commitment to service, the association has grown \nsubstantially to a membership of approximately 19,000. A Federal \ncharter would allow the Association to continue and grow its mission \nand further its charitable and benevolent causes. Specifically, it will \nafford the Korean War Veterans' Association the same status as other \nmajor veterans organizations and allow it to participate as part of \nselect committees with other congressionally chartered veterans and \nmilitary groups. A Federal charter will also accelerate the \nAssociation's ``accreditation'' with the Department of Veterans Affairs \nwhich will enable its members to assist in processing veterans' claims.\n  The Korean War Veterans have asked for very little in return for \ntheir service and sacrifice. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this legislation and ask that the text of the measure be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 478\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Korean War Veterans Association, Incorporated.....120101''.....\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. EDWARDS:\n  S. 479. A bill to amend title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 \nto provide grants for homeland security scholarships; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Protect \nAmerica Scholarships Act of 2003. The Act will draw talented young \npeople into professions that are vital to America's security and that \nare critically short of expertise. It offers college students a simple \ndeal: If you'll serve for five years, we'll pay for your college.\n  The reason for this law is simple. Our country continues to have \ntremendous homeland security needs. We have thousands of important jobs \nthat we aren't filling because we don't have the qualified people. And \nwe have thousands of young people who are looking to serve their \ncountry, and who are also looking for ways to pay for college.\n  So this bill puts together the needs of our country and the idealism \nof our young people. It says that young people who commit to meeting \npriority homeland security needs will get money for college in return.\n  Let me give three examples of professions where this bill can make a \nreal difference.\n  First, our public health system suffers from a shortage of trained \nprofessionals who can contribute to the fight against terrorism. Too \nfew medical professionals are trained to diagnose and treat diseases \ncaused by biological agents. Public health laboratories don't have the \ncapacity to test all the specimens suspected of being biological \nagents. Local governments need as many as 15,000 new public health \npreparedness employees. And despite the central role of nurses in \nresponding should terrorists attack with chemical or biological \nweapons, there are more than 126,000 unfilled nursing positions today. \nThere are special roles in all of these professions that trained young \npeople could fill in important ways.\n  Second, the federal government faces a critical shortage of \npolicymakers and intelligence analysts with expertise in foreign \nlanguages and cultures. The General Accounting Office has reported that \nthe FBI's efforts to combat terrorism have been impeded by a lack of \nqualified translators. Thousands of hours of audiotapes and pages of \nwritten material have not been reviewed or translated. Similarly, the \nU.S. Department of State reports that lack of language fluency has \nweakened its fight against international terrorism and drug \ntrafficking.\n  A third area where we need more people is fighting cyberterrorism. We \nnow live in a world where a terrorist can do as much damage with a \nkeyboard and a modem as with a gun or a bomb. By exploiting computer \nvulnerabilities, terrorists might be able to shut down power for entire \ncities for extended periods; disrupt our phones; poison our water; \nerase financial records; paralyze our police, firefighters, and \nambulances; and stop all traffic on the Internet. Yet our workforce \nspecializing in cybersecurity remains inadequate. The federal \ngovernment has especially serious shortages. These vulnerabilities \nleave our Federal agencies exposed to hackers, system shutdowns, and \ncyberterrorists.\n  By offering up to $10,000 in college tuition, the Protect America \nScholarships Act will harness the patriotism and determination of a new \ngeneration of Americans to urgent national priorities. The federal \ngovernment and a growing number of states, including North Carolina, \nuse similar programs to recruit teachers successfully. The recent Hart-\nRudman report identified student loan debt burdens as a particular \nobstacle to attracting young adults into public service.\n  The safety of the American people depends on the millions of people \nworking to protect them. Today's bill will help recruit more talented \nAmericans to professions needed to defend our nation. I hope it will \nearn the support of my colleagues.\n  I request unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n\n[[Page S2937]]\n\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 479\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide competitive grants for training court \nreporters and closed captioners to meet requirements for realtime \nwriters under the Telecommunications Act of 1996, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, the \nTraining for Realtime Writers Act of 2003, on behalf of myself and my \ncolleagues, Senators Grassley, Kennedy, Cochran, Lincoln, Kerry, \nBingaman, Dodd, and Baucus. The 1996 Telecom Act required that all \ntelevision broadcasts were to be captioned by 2006. This was a much \nneeded reform that has helped millions of deaf and hard-of-hearing \nAmericans to be able to take full advantage of television programing. \nAs of today, it is estimated that 3,000 captioners will be needed to \nfulfill this requirement, and that number continues to increase as more \nand more broadband stations come online. Unfortunately, the United \nStates only has 300 captioners. If our country expects to have media \nfully captioned by 2006, something must be done.\n  This is an issue that I feel very strongly about because my late \nbrother, Frank, was deaf. I know personally that access to culture, \nnews, and other media was important to him and to others in achieving a \nbetter quality of life. More than 28 million Americans, or 8 percent of \nthe population, are considered deaf or hard of hearing and many \nrequires captioning services to participate in mainstream activities. \nIn 1990, I authored legislation that required all television sets to be \nequipped with a computer chip to decode closed captioning. This bill \ncompletes the promise of that technology, affording deaf and hard of \nhearing Americans the same equality and access that captioning \nprovides.\n  Though we don't necessarily think about it, on the morning of \nSeptember 11 was a perfect example of the need for captioners. Holli \nMiller of Ankeny, IA, was captioning for Fox News. She was supposed to \ndo her three and a half hour shift ending at 8:00 a.m. but as we all \nknow, disaster struck. Despite the fact that she had already worked \nmost of her shift and had two small children to care for, Holli Miller \nstayed right where she was and for nearly five more hours and continued \nto caption. Without even the ability to take bathroom breaks, Holli \nMiller made sure that deaf and hard of hearing people got the same news \nthe rest of us got on September 11. I want to personnally say thank you \nto Holli Miller and all the many captioners and other people across the \ncountry that made sure all Americans were alert and informed on that \ntragic day.\n  But let me emphasize that the deaf and hard of hearing population is \nonly one of a number of groups that will benefit from the legislation. \nThe audience for captioning also includes individuals seeking to \nacquire or improve literacy skills, including approximately 27 million \nfunctionally illiterate adults, 3 to 4 million immigrants learning \nEnglish as a second language, and 18 million children learning to read \nin grades kindergarten through 3. In addition, I see people using \nclosed captioning to stay informed everywhere--from the gym to the \nairport. Captioning helps people educate themselves and helps all of us \nstay informed and entertained when audio isn't the most appropriate \nmedium.\n  Although we have a few years to go until the deadline given by the \n1996 Telecom Act, our nation is facing a serious shortage of \ncaptioners. Over the past five years, student enrollment in programs \nthat train court reporters to become realtime writers has decreased \nsignificantly, causing such programs to close on many campuses. Yet the \nneed for these skills continues to rise. That is why my colleagues and \nI are introducing this vital piece of legislation. The Training for \nRealtime Writers Act of 2003 would establish competitive grants to be \nused toward training real time captioners. This is necessary to ensure \nthat we meet our goal set by the 1996 Telecom Act.\n  I urge my colleagues to review this legislation and I hope they will \njoin us in support and join us in our effort to win its passage. I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 480\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out this \n     Act, amounts as follows:\n       (1) $20,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2004, 2005, and \n     2006.\n       (2) Such sums as may be necessary for fiscal year 2007.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to once again be the lead \nRepublican cosponsor of the ``Training for Realtime Writers Act''. This \nlegislation that Senator Harkin and I are introducing today will \nprovide grants for the training of realtime reporters and captioners. \nWhile we ran out of time to address this matter in the 107th Congress, \nI would remind Senators of the looming problem related to a shortage of \nwhat are called ``realtime writers''. Realtime writers are essentially \ntrained court reporters, much like the Official Reporters of Debates \nhere in the Senate, who use a combination of additional specialized \ntraining and technology to transform words into text as they are \nspoken. This can allow deaf and hard of hearing individuals to \nunderstand live television as well as follow proceedings at a civic \nfunction or in a classroom.\n  In the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Congress mandated that most \ntelevision programming be fully captioned by 2006 in order to allow the \n28 million Americans who are deaf or had of hearing to have access to \nthe same news and information that many of us take for granted. \nInformation provides a vital link to the outside world. Americans \nreceive a large amount of their information about what is happening in \nthe world and right in their communities from television. Whether it is \nan international crisis or a weather warning, information is necessary \nto fully participate in our society. In order for those who are deaf \nand hard of hearing to receive the same information as it is broadcast \non live television, groups of captions must work around the clock \ntranscribing words as they are spoken.\n  Currently, video-programming distributers must provide an average of \nat least 900 hours of captioned programming. Starting in 2005, this \nwill increase to 1350 hours. By 2006, 100 percent of new nonexempt \nprogramming must be provided with captions. At the same time, student \nenrollment in programs that provide essential training in captioning \nhas decreased significantly, with programs closing on many campuses. In \norder to meet the growing demand for realtime writers caused by this \nmandate, we must do everything we can to increase the number of \nindividuals receiving this very specialized training.\n  Our bill will help address the shortage of individuals trained as \nrealtime writers by providing grants to accredited court reporting \nprograms to promote the training and placement of individuals as \nrealtime writers. Specifically, court reporting programs could use \nthese grants for item like recruitment of students for realtime writing \nprograms, need-based scholarships, distance learning, education and \ntraining, job placement assistance, the encouragement of individuals \nwith disabilities to pursue a career as a realtime writer, and \npersonnel costs.\n\n[[Page S2940]]\n\n  The expansion of distance learning opportunities in particular will \nhave an enormous impact by making training accessible to individuals \nwho want to become realtime writers but do not live in metropolitan \nareas. Also, need based scholarships offered using these grants funds \nwould be subject to an agreement with the National Telecommunications \nand Information Administration to provide realtime writing services for \na period of time.\n  We must act quickly because the shortage of individuals trained as \nrealtime writers will only grow more severe as the captioning mandate \nin the 1996 Telecommunications Act continues to take effect. Failure to \nact could leave the 28 million deaf or hard of hearing Americans \nwithout the ability to fully participate in many of the professional, \neducational, and civic activities that other Americans enjoy. Congress \nwas not able to complete work on this urgent matter before the end of \nthe 107th Congress, so we must redouble our efforts. I would urge all \nsenators to support the swift passage of this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLEN (for himself and Mr. Warner):\n  S. 481. A bill to amend chapter 84 of title 5, United States Code, to \nprovide that certain Federal annuity computations are adjusted by 1 \npercentage point relating to periods of receiving disability payments, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to fairly \nassist injured Federal employees. This legislation will adjust Federal \nemployees retirement computations to offset reductions in their \nretirement arising from on-the-job injuries covered by the Workers \nCompensation program. I introduced similar legislation last session \nthat was passed by the Senate. I would like to thank my colleague \nSenator Warner the senior Senator from Virginia, for his valuable \nsupport in cosponsoring this important effort.\n  This bill addresses a problem in the retirement program for Federal \nemployees that has been recognized but unresolved since 1986 when the \ncurrent retirement system was established. Unfortunately, complications \narising from the Tax Code and the Workers Rehabilitation Act of 1973 \nhave blocked any solution.\n  My resolve to address this problem was inspired by Ms. Louise Kurtz, \na Federal employee from Virginia who was severely injured in the \nSeptember 11 attack on the pentagon. She suffered burns over 70 percent \nof her body and lost all of her fingers. She has had many painful \nsurgeries and faces additional surgeries in the future. She continues \nto endure rehabilitation over a year after suffering her injuries, yet \nstill hopes to return to work some day. Current law, however, does not \nallow Mrs. Kurtz to contribute to her retirement program while she is \nrecuperating and receiving Workers' Compensation disability payments. \nAs a result, after returning to work and eventually retiring, she will \nfind herself inadequately prepared and unable to afford to retire \nbecause of the lack of contributions during her recuperation.\n  As Ms. Kurt's situation reveals, Federal employee under the Federal \nEmployees Retirement System who have sustained an on-the-job injury and \nare receiving disability compensation from the Department of Labor's \nOffice of Worker's Compensation Programs are unable to make \ncontributions or payments into Social Security or the Thrift Savings \nPlan. Therefore, the future retirement benefits from both sources are \nreduced.\n  This legislation offsets the reductions in Social Security and Thrift \nsavings Plan retirement benefits by increasing the Federal Employees \nRetirement System Direct Benefit calculation by one percentage point \nfor extended periods of disability.\n  The passage of this bill ensures that the pensions of our hard-\nworking federal employees will be kept whole during a period of injury \nand recuperations, especially now that many of them are on the \nfrontlines of protecting our homeland security in this new war on \nterror. By protecting the retirement security of injured Federal \nemployee, we have provided an incentive for them to return to work and \nincreased our ability to retain our most dedicated and experienced \nFederal workers. This is a reasonable and fair approach in which the \nwhole Senate acted in a logical and compassionate manner last fall. Let \nus do so again.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 481\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ANNUITY COMPUTATION ADJUSTMENT FOR PERIODS OF \n                   DISABILITY.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 8415 of title 5, United States \n     Code, is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating the second subsection (i) as \n     subsection (k); and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(l) In the case of any annuity computation under this \n     section that includes, in the aggregate, at least 2 months of \n     credit under section 8411(d) for any period while receiving \n     benefits under subchapter I of chapter 81, the percentage \n     otherwise applicable under this section for that period so \n     credited shall be increased by 1 percentage point.''\n       (b) Conforming Amendment.--Section 8422(d)(2) of title 5, \n     United States Code (as added by section 122(b)(2) of Public \n     Law 107-135), is amended by striking ``8415(i)'' and \n     inserting ``8415(k)''.\n       (c) Applicability.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply with respect to any annuity entitlement which is \n     based on a separation from service occurring on or after the \n     date of enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS:\n  S. 482. A bill to reauthorize and amend the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery \nConservation and Management Act, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Ms. SNOWE):\n  S. 483. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Army to carry out a \nproject for the mitigation of shore damages attributable to the project \nfor navigation, Saco River, Maine; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce two pieces of \nlegislation that will improve the lives of our Nation's fishermen who \nare struggling to make a living on the sea.\n  Fishing is more than just a profession in New England. Fishing is a \nculture and a way of life. This way of life is being threatened, \nhowever, by excessive regulation and unnecessary litigation. Despite \nscientific evidence of a rebound in fish stocks, New England's \nfishermen are suffering under ever more burdensome restrictions. \nEveryday, I hear from fishermen who struggle to support their families \nbecause they have been deprived of their right to make an honest living \non the seas. The ``working waterfronts'' of our communities are in \ndanger if disappearing, likely to be replaced by development. When that \nhappens, a part of Maine's heritage is lost forever.\n  Today, I am introducing a package of amendments to the Magnuson-\nStevens Act that will deliver a resource management strategy that is \nbalanced, responsive, and sensible. It recognizes the fishermen's \nstrong commitment to conserving the stocks, and acknowledges fishermen \nas partners in fisheries management.\n  The Fisheries Science and Management Improvement Act of 2003 will \naddress much needed improvements in the science and regulatory \nstandards of fisheries management. The Nation's fisheries management \nsystem, as it is currently designed, is broken. If anyone doubts this \nis the case, I want to point out that more than 100 lawsuits are \ncurrently pending against the Department of Commerce involving \nfisheries management plans.\n  Litigation is no way to manage one of our Nation's most important \necological and economic resources. The fact is, the courts are simply \nnot well-suited to making biological and regulatory decisions. \nFisheries management is best left to those who know the subject best: \nthe fishermen, scientists, and regulators working together \ncooperatively.\n\n  No one in the country knows this better than New England \ngroundfishermen. Over the last two years, a court case has thrown New \nEngland's groundfishing industry into a crisis. The case ended when a \nFederal judge ordered severe restrictions on groundfishing, including a \n20-percent\n\n[[Page S2941]]\n\ncut in Days-at-Sea. The effect of this court order has been simply \ncatastrophic for New England's groundfishing industry--an industry made \nup of small, independently-owned, and often family-owned, businesses.\n  These severe restrictions were ordered despite the fact that the \nscience clearly demonstrates that the biomass for New England \ngroundfish has increased every year since 1996. If the biomass is \nincreasing, and the stock is clearly rebuilding, it makes no sense to \nenforce an arbitrarily structured and unscientifically based timeframe \non the rebuilding process. This is especially true when the survival of \na culture is at stake.\n  My legislation would inject consistency and common-sense standards \ninto the fisheries management process: it addresses the importance of \nsolid and reliable science in fisheries management. It strengthens the \ndefinition of ``best scientific information available'' and requires \nscientific data, including all stock assessments, to be peer-reviewed \nand to include the consideration of anecdotal information gathered from \nthe people who know fishing best--the fishermen themselves. My bill \nensures that the process of rebuilding stocks is based on rational and \ncomprehensive science. Under current law, when fisheries are classified \nas overfished, the Councils are required to implement rebuilding plans \nto attain a historic high level of abundance within ten years, \nregardless of whether or not the current state of the marine \nenvironment can sustain such an abundance level. My bill redefines the \nconcept of ``overfishing'' to take into consideration natural \nfluctuations in the marine environment. It also eliminates the ten-year \nrebuilding requirement--a requirement that has no foundation in \nscience--and requires rebuilding periods to take into consideration the \nbiology of the fish stock and the economic impact on fishing \ncommunities.\n  The legislation also addresses problems with the current conception \nof Essential Fish Habitat. Currently, the entire Exclusive Economic \nZone has been defined as Essential Fish Habitat instead of more \ndiscrete units of habitat as originally conceived. Further, current law \nallows the Councils to regulate the impacts of fishing activity on \nEssential Fish Habitat, while the Councils cannot regulate other \ncommercial activities--such as mining and coastal development and the \nlaying of telecommunications cables--that affect these areas. My bill \nfocuses the management of these areas on ``Habitat Areas of Particular \nConcern''--more discrete units of fish habitat that are more consistent \nwith the congressional intent behind the Essential Fish Habitat \nconcept.\n\n  My proposal treats the fishing industry as a legitimate interest in \nfisheries management by acknowledging the important role that \ncommercial fishing plays in food security and healthy food consumption. \nMy bill also ensures that the cumulative economic and social impacts of \nfisheries management decisions are considered, rather than assessed in \nisolation from one another.\n  Finally, the legislation would reduce the litigation burden on the \nfisheries management system. My proposal ensures that fishery \nmanagement plans are pre-determined to be compliant with NEPA \nrequirements, thereby preventing NEPA law from being used in an \nincorrect way to regulate fisheries. It would still require fishery \nmanagement plans to meet all the other conservation provisions, \nincluding those governing rebuilding of overfished stocks, set out in \nthe law. The Nation's Councils have asked for this protection from \nlawsuits so they may resume their proper role as a regulatory body.\n  I want to acknowledge the important role that my colleagues Senators \nSnowe and Kerry, Chair and Ranking Member of the Oceans and Fisheries \nSubcommittee, are playing in addressing the problems of Magnuson-\nStevens. My hope is that my proposal will help propel a discussion in \nthe upcoming months as their committee moves forward with their own \nideas.\n  The second piece of legislation I am offering is the Commercial \nFishermen Safety Act of 2003, a bill to help fishermen purchase the \nlife-saving safety equipment they need to survive when disaster \nstrikes. I am pleased to be joined by my good friend from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kerry, in introducing this legislation. Senator \nKerry has been a leader in the effort to sustain our fisheries and to \nmaintain the proud fishing tradition that exists in his state and \nthroughout the country.\n  The release of the movie The Perfect Storm provided millions of \nAmericans with a glimpse of the challenges and dangers associated with \nearning a living in the fishing industry. While based on a true story, \nthe movie merely scratches the surface of what it is like to be a \nmodern-day fisherman. Everyday, members of our fishing communities \nstruggle to cope with the pressures of running a small business, \ncomplying with extensive regulations, and maintaining their vessels and \nequipment. Added to these challenges are the dangers associated with \nfishing, where disaster can strike in conditions that are far less \nextreme than those depicted by the movie.\n  Year-in and year-out, commercial fishing is among the nation's most \ndangerous occupations. According to data compiled by the Coast Guard \nand the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 536 fishermen have lost their lives \nat sea since 1994. In fact, with an annual fatality rate of about 150 \ndeaths per 100,000 workers, fishing is 30 times more dangerous than the \naverage occupation.\n  The year 2000 will always be remembered in Maine's fishing \ncommunities as a year marked by tragedy. All told, nine commercial \nfishermen lost their lives off the coast of Maine in the year 2000, \nexceeding the combined casualties of the three previous years.\n  Yet as tragic as the year was, it could have been worse. Heroic acts \nby the Coast Guard and other fishermen resulted in the rescue of 13 \ncommercial fishermen off the coast of Maine in the year 2000. In most \nof these circumstances, these fishermen were returned to their families \nbecause they had access to safety equipment that made the difference \nbetween life and death.\n  Coast Guard regulations require all fishing vessels to carry safety \nequipment. The requirements vary depending on factors such as the size \nof the vessel, the temperature of the water, and the distance the \nvessel travels from shore to fish.\n  When an emergency arises, safety equipment is priceless. At all other \ntimes, the cost of purchasing or maintaining this equipment must \ncompete with other expenses such as loan payments, fuel, wages, \nmaintenance, and insurance. Meeting all of these obligations is made \nmore difficult by a regulatory framework that uses measures such as \ntrip limits, days at sea, and gear alterations to manage our marine \nresources.\n  The Commercial Fishermen Safety Act of 2003 lends a hand to fishermen \nattempting to prepare in case disaster strikes. My bill provides a tax \ncredit equal to 75 percent of the amount paid by fishermen to purchase \nor maintain required safety equipment. The tax credit is capped at \n$1500. Items such as EPIRBs and immersion suits cost hundreds of \ndollars, while life rafts can reach into the thousands. The tax credit \nwill make life-saving equipment more affordable for more fishermen, who \ncurrently face limited options under the federal tax code.\n  I believe these two bills will assist our Nation's fishermen as they \nstruggle to make their living on the seas. Fishing is a legitimate \nprofession that deserves to be treated with the common-sense and \nconsistency that we treat other professions. The legislation I am \nintroducing gives these communities the tools they need to safely make \ntheir living in a way that still protects the resource.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 484. A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to establish requirements \nconcerning the operation of fossil fuel-fired electric utility stem \ngenerating units, commercial and industrial boiler units, solid waste \nincineration units, medical waste incinerators, hazardous waste \ncombustors, chlor-alkali plants, and Portland cement plants to reduce \nemissions of mercury to the environment, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Environmental and Public Works.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the risks and health effects of mercury \ncontamination continue to be serious and immediate. We have known about \nmercury pollution for many years. It remains one of, if not the last \nof, the\n\n[[Page S2942]]\n\nmajor toxic pollutants without a comprehensive plan to control its \nspread. We know where the sources contributing to mercury contamination \nare, we have a pretty good idea where it goes, and we definitely know \nwhat harm it causes to people and to wildlife. Yet, serious \ncontamination continues. That is why I am reintroducing important \nlegislation today to confront this problem directly.\n  The most serious threat of mercury pollution is to our children. Just \nthis week, the Environmental Protection Agency finally released their \nreport, ``American's Children and the Environment: Measures of \nContaminants, Body Burdens and Illnesses.'' The report should alarm all \nof us. It highlights the neurological harm that can come to children \nexposed to elevated mercury levels while in the womb and during the \nfirst years of their lives. As more mercury is dumped into our \nenvironment, more children will be at risk. Today, according to the \nCenters for Disease Control, 1 in 12 women of childbearing age has \nmercury levels above the safe health threshold established by EPA.\n  Although the report comes nine months late, it does highlight a \nserious gap between the Administration's ``Clear Skies'' proposal and \nthe Leahy/Snowe bill when it comes to reducing mercury levels. The only \nthing clear about the Administration's proposal is that it won't \nprotect Vermont's children from the pollution spewing out of power \nplants in the Midwest. The Administration's Clear Skies proposal will \nactually relax current mercury emissions law.\n  Our bill will reduce mercury emission from coal-fired power plants by \n90 percent. The Clear Skies proposal would only reduce emissions by 50 \npercent in the near future and 70 percent over the next 15 years. Not \nonly does this fall far short of our proposal, but it also falls short \nof current law and the Administration's previous position. In 2001, EPA \nAdministrator Christie Todd Whitman said the EPA had initiated strict \n``maximum achievable control technology'' MACT, standards for oil- and \ncoal-fired electric utility units as required under section 112 of the \nClean Air Act. At that time, Whitman said that mercury reductions are \n``necessary now, not decades from now.''\n  Administrator Whitman was right then and wrong now. With industry's \nvigorous opposition to tighter mercury controls and the Bush \nadministration's record to date rolling back environmental legislation \nregulation, especially the Clean Air Act, I worry that more children \nwill be put at risk as the Administration continues to delay the MACT \nstandards and other policies. The delays and rollbacks make you ask \nwhose interests the Administration is putting first--children, or the \nbig powerplant companies?\n  I ask for unanimous consent that a summary of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the summary of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n     Summary of the Omnibus Mercury Emissions Reduction Act of 2003\n\n\n   What will the Omnibus Mercury Emissions Reduction Act of 2003 do?\n\n       The Omnibus Mercury Emissions Reduction Act of 2003 \n     mandates substantial reductions in mercury emissions from all \n     major sources in the United States. It is the only \n     comprehensive legislation to control mercury emissions from \n     all major sources. It directs EPA to issue new standards for \n     unregulated sources and to monitor and report on the progress \n     of currently regulated sources. It sets an aggressive \n     timetable for these reductions so that mercury emissions are \n     reduced as soon as possible.\n       With these emissions reductions, the bill requires the safe \n     disposal of mercury recovered from pollution control systems, \n     so that the hazards of mercury are not merely transferred \n     from one environmental medium to another. It requires annual \n     public reporting--in both paper and electronic form--of \n     facility-specific mercury emissions. It phases out mercury \n     use in consumer products, requires product labeling, and \n     mandates international cooperation. It supports research into \n     the retirement of excess mercury, the handling of mercury \n     waste, the effectiveness of fish consumption advisories, and \n     the magnitude of previously uninventoried sources.\n\n\n Section 3. Mercury emission standards for fossil fuel-fired electric \n                     utility steam generating units\n\n       The EPA's ``Mercury Study Report to Congress'' estimated 52 \n     tons of mercury emissions per year from coal- and oil-fired \n     electric utility steam generating units. More recently, an \n     EPA inventory estimated 43 tons of mercury from coal-fired \n     power plants. Collectively, these power plants constitute the \n     largest source of mercury emissions in the United States. In \n     December 2000, the EPA issued a positive determination to \n     regulate these mercury emissions. But these rules will take \n     years to write and implement, and there is already vigorous \n     industry opposition. It is uncertain what form these rules \n     will take or how long they may be delayed. This section \n     requires EPA to set a ``maximum achievable control \n     technology'' (MACT) standard for these emissions, such that \n     nationwide emissions decrease by at least 90 percent.\n\n\n     Section 4. Mercury emission standards for coal- and oil-fired \n                 commercial and industrial boiler units\n\n       The EPA's report on its study estimates that 29 tons of \n     mercury emissions are released per year from coal- and oil-\n     fired commercial and industrial boiler units. The EPA has not \n     yet decided to regulate these emissions. This section \n     requires EPA to set a MACT standard for these mercury \n     emissions, such that nationwide emissions decrease by at \n     least 90 percent.\n\n\nsection 5. reduction of mercury emissions from solid waste incineration \n                                 units\n\n       The EPA study estimates that 30 tons of mercury emissions \n     are released each year from municipal waste combustors. These \n     emissions result from the presence of mercury-containing \n     items such as fluorescent lamps, fever thermometers, \n     thermostats and switches, in municipal solid waste streams. \n     In 1995 EPA promulgated final rules for these emissions, and \n     these rules took effect in 2000. This section reaffirms those \n     rules and requires stricter rules for units that do not \n     comply. The most effective way to reduce mercury emissions \n     from incinerators is to reduce the volume of mercury-\n     containing items before they reach the incinerator. That is \n     why this section also requires the separation of mercury-\n     containing items from the waste stream, the labeling of \n     mercury-containing items to facilitate this separation, and \n     the phaseout of mercury in consumer products within three \n     years, allowing for the possibility of exceptions for \n     essential uses.\n\n\n     section 6. mercury emission standards for chlor-alkali plants\n\n       The EPA study estimates that 7 tons of mercury emissions \n     are released per year from chlor-alkali plants that use the \n     mercury cell process to produce chlorine. EPA has not issued \n     rules to regulate these emissions. This section requires each \n     chlor-alkali plant that uses the mercury cell process to \n     reduce its mercury emissions by 95 percent. The most \n     effective way to meet this standard would be to switch to the \n     more energy efficient membrane cell process, which many \n     plants already use.\n\n\n    section 7. mercury emission standards for portland cement plants\n\n       The EPA study estimates that 5 tons of mercury emissions \n     are released each year from Portland cement plants. In 1999 \n     EPA promulgated final rules for emissions from cement plants, \n     but these rules did not include mercury. This section \n     requires each Portland cement plant to reduce its mercury \n     emissions by 95 percent.\n\n\n section 8. report on implementation of mercury emission standards for \n                       medical waste incinerators\n\n       The EPA study estimates that 16 tons of mercury emissions \n     are released per year from medical waste incinerators. In \n     1997 EPA issued final rules for emissions from hospital/\n     medical/infectious waste incinerators. This section requires \n     EPA to report on the success of these rules in reducing these \n     mercury emissions.\n\n\n section 9. report on implementation of mercury emission standards for \n                       hazardous waste combustors\n\n       The EPA study estimates that 7 tons of mercury emissions \n     are released each year form hazardous waste incinerators. In \n     1999 EPA promulgated final rules for these emissions. This \n     section requires EPA to report on the success of these rules \n     in reducing these mercury emissions.\n\n\n                     section 10. defense activities\n\n       This section requires the Department of Defense to report \n     on its use of mercury, including the steps it is taking to \n     reduce mercury emissions and to stabilize and recycle \n     discarded mercury. This section also prohibits the Department \n     of Defense from returning the nearly 5,000 tons of mercury in \n     the National Defense Stockpile to the global market.\n\n\n                  section 11. international activities\n\n       This section directs EPA to work with Canada and Mexico to \n     study mercury pollution in North America, including the \n     sources of mercury pollution, the pathways of the pollution, \n     and options for reducing the pollution.\n\n\n                      section 12. mercury research\n\n       This section supports a variety of mercury research \n     projects. First, it promotes accountability by mandating an \n     interagency report on the effectiveness of this act in \n     reducing mercury pollution. Second, it mandates an EPA study \n     on mercury sedimentation trends in major bodies of water. \n     Third, it directs EPA to evaluate and improve state-level \n     mercury data and fish consumption advisories. Fourth, it \n     mandates a National Academy of Sciences report on the \n     reatirement of excess mercury, such as\n\n[[Page S2943]]\n\n     stockpiled industrial mercury that is no longer needed due to \n     plant closures or process changes. Fifth, it mandates an EPA \n     study of mercury emissions from electric arc furnaces, a \n     source not studied in the EPA's study report. Finally, it \n     authorizes $2,000,000 for modernization and expansion of the \n     Mercury Deposition Network, plus $10,000,000 over ten years \n     for operational support of that network.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today as the lead cosponsor of \nSenator Leahy's Omnibus Mercury Reduction Act of 2003 to ask support \nfor our continued efforts to dramatically reduce mercury pollution that \nhas been shown to pose serious health risks, especially for pregnant \nwomen, and can cause irreversible nerve damage in young children.\n  This legislation responds to the Environmental Protection Agency's \njust released report on ``America's Children and the Environment: \nMeasures of Contaminants, Body Burdens, and Illnesses'', which states \nthat EPA remains concerned about children potentially exposed to \nmercury in the womb.\n  Mercury is among the least-controlled and most dangerous toxins \nthreatening pregnant women and children from mercury exposure through \nthe air and water in America today, and we need to continue the fight \nto pass a national approach to better control its use. Because mercury \npollution knows no State borders, a national initiative is necessary to \ncontrol it and better understand its health effects.\n  The Omnibus Mercury Emissions Reduction Act of 2003 would require the \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, to impose new restrictions \non mercury emissions by utility power plants, coal and oil-fired \ncommercial boilers, solid waste incinerators, and other sources of \nemissions. According to the EPA, an estimated 30 tons of mercury \nemissions per year come from municipal waste combustors because of the \npresence of mercury-containing items such as fluorescent lamps, fever \nthermometers, thermostats, and switches.\n  Our bill requires utility power plants and commercial boilers to \nreduce mercury emissions by 95 percent in five years, and requires the \nEPA to publish a list of mercury-containing items that need to be \nseparated and removed from the waste streams that feed solid waste \nmanagement facilities. The most effective way to reduce mercury \nemissions from incinerators is to reduce the volume of mercury-\ncontaining items before they reach the incinerator.\n  The bill would also expand research on the effects of mercury on \nsensitive subpopulations such as pregnant women and children, and it \ndirects the EPA to work with the States to improve the quality and \ndissemination of State fish consumption advisories.\n  Even in Maine, where great efforts have been made to preserve clean \nair and water, mercury arrives as an unseen threat, carried in the air \nfrom hundreds of miles away and deposited in our lakes, rivers and \ncoastal regions through rain and snowfall. This bill complements the \nsteps Maine has taken to reduce mercury emissions, and by addressing \nwhat happens outside our borders, it also can ensure that Maine's \nactions will not be in vain.\n  Mercury is a dangerous toxin present in coal, which is burned to \nproduce 65 percent of the nation's electricity, other fossil fuels, and \nvarious household and industrial products. When mercury is burned, fine \nparticles are released and carried by precipitation back to earth, \ncontaminating water bodies, fish, and wildlife, and ultimately posing a \nthreat to humans. Nationwide, 39 States have issued warnings about \neating certain fish in more than 50,000 bodies of water, up from 27 \nStates in 1993.\n  While Maine ranks 49th among the least-polluting States in terms of \nmercury emissions, nearly all of its lakes are under health advisories \ndue to airborne mercury pollution transported in air currents from \nother States. Because mercury is an element and cannot be destroyed, it \ncycles endlessly through the environment, necessitating control of the \ntoxin at the source.\n  With the technology and resources available, we can and must find \ncreative ways to substantially reduce mercury pollution, and this bill \nkicks that process into gear and will go a very long way toward \nremoving this harmful toxin as a threat to human health and the \nenvironment.\n  In partnership with the Omnibus mercury bill, I am also a cosponsor \nof Senator Jeffords' Clean Power Act that calls for a 90 percent \nreduction of mercury from coal burning power plants by 2008. By 2009, \nthe Jeffords bill also dramatically cuts aggregate power plant \nemissions of the three other major power plant pollutants: nitrogen \noxides, NOx, the primary cause of smog, by 71 percent from \n2000 levels; sulfur dioxide, SO2, that causes acid rain and \nrespiratory disease, by 81 percent from 2000 levels; and carbon \ndioxide, CO2, the greenhouse gas most directly linked to \nglobal climate variabilities, by 21 percent from 2000 levels. Of note, \nthe NOx, SO2, and mercury reductions are set at \nlevels that are known to be cost effective with available technology.\n  I hope to work with my colleagues in the 108th Congress to see that \nprovisions in these two bills are fully debated and policy is passed to \nprotect our environment and our population from the ravages of these \nmajor air pollutants. We must move forward for the health of the \nunborn, the American public and the entire planet.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE (for himself and Mr. Voinovich) (by request):\n  S. 485. A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to reduce air pollution \nthrough expansion of cap and trade programs, to provide an alternative \nregulatory classification for units subject to the cap and trade \nprogram, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I hereby introduce, by request, the Clear \nSkies Initiative to reduce harmful air pollutants.\n  I am pleased that Senator Voinovich and I and our counterparts in the \nHouse have the opportunity to work with the President on one of his top \nlegislative priorities. Clear Skies demonstrates the President's \nserious commitment to providing strong environmental protections for \nthe American people. It is the most aggressive presidential initiative \nin history to reduce power plant emissions.\n  Clear Skies will build upon the remarkable environmental progress \nwe've made over the last 30 years. Since passage of the Clean Air Act \nin 1970 the nation's gross domestic product has increased 160 percent, \nenergy consumption has increased 45 percent, and population has \nincreased 38 percent. At the same time we've reduced emissions by 29 \npercent.\n  President Bush understands that achieving positive environmental \nresults and promoting economic growth are not incompatible goals. \nMoving beyond the confusing, command-and-control mandates of the past, \nClear Skies cap-and-trade system harnesses the power of technology and \ninnovation to bring about significant reductions in harmful pollutants.\n  I look forward to working with the Administration on crafting a sound \nbill. I believe Clear Skies represents a good starting point for moving \nforward with the legislative process.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 485\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for equal coverage of mental health \nbenefits with respect to health insurance coverage unless comparable \nlimitations are imposed on medical and surgical benefits; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend Senator \nKennedy to introduce the ``Senator Paul Wellstone Mental Health \nEquitable Treatment Act of 2003.''\n  I have mixed emotions today, because, while we are once again \nfighting for parity, my long time partner, Paul Wellstone is not \nstanding across the aisle from me. Unfortunately, my colleagues are to \naware of Senator Wellstone's tragic passing last year. So, while I feel \na profound sense of sadness, I also have a renewed determination to win \na parity victory for the millions of Americans affected by these \ndreaded diseases.\n  The time has come to end this blatant pattern of discrimination \nagainst people merely because they suffer from a mental illness. The \nhuman brain is the organ of the mind and just like the other organs of \nour body, it is subject to illness. And just as we must treat illnesses \nto our other organs, we must also treat illnesses of the brain.\n  Building upon that, I would ask the following question: what if forty \nyears ago our Nation had decided to exclude heart disease from health \ninsurance coverage? Think about some of the wonderful things we would \nnot be doing today like angioplasty, bypasses, and valve replacements \nand the millions of people helped because insurance covers these \nprocedures.\n  I would submit these medical advances have occurred because insurance \ndollars have followed the patient through the health care system. The \npresence of insurance dollars has provided an enticing incentive to \ntreat those individuals suffering from heart disease. But sadly, those \nsuffering from a mental illness do not enjoy those same benefits of \ntreatment and medical advances because all too often insurance \ndiscriminates against illnesses of the brain.\n  Individuals suffering from a mental illness face this discrimination \neven though medical science is in an era where we can accurately \ndiagnosis mental illnesses and treat those afflicted so they can be \nproductive. I simply do not understand, why with this evidence would we \nnot cover these individuals and treat their illnesses like any other \ndisease? There simply should not be a difference in the coverage \nprovided by insurance companies for mental health benefits and medical \nbenefits, merely because an individual suffers from a mental illness.\n  The introduction of our Bill marks a historic opportunity for us to \ntake the next step towards mental health parity. The timing of our Bill \nis even more important because the second consecutive one year \nextension of the landmark Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 will sunset \nlater this year.\n  As my colleagues know, this is an issue I have a long involvement \nwith\n\n[[Page S2972]]\n\nand I would like to begin with a few observations.\n  I believe that we have made great strides in providing parity for the \ncoverage of mental illness. However, mental illness continues to exact \na heavy toll on many, many lives.\n  Even though we know so much more about mental illness, it can still \nbring devastating consequences to those it touches; their families, \ntheir friends, and their loved ones. These individuals and families not \nonly deal with the societal prejudices and suspicions hanging on from \nthe past, but they also must contend with unequal insurance coverage.\n  I would submit the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 is a good first \nstart, but the Act is also not working. While there may adherence to \nthe letter of the law, there are certainly violations of the spirit of \nthe law. For instance, ways are being found around the law by placing \nlimits on the number of covered hospital days and outpatient visits.\n  That is why I believe it is time for a change.\n  Some will immediately say we cannot afford it or that inclusion of \nthis treatment will cost too much. But, the facts simply do not support \nthat conclusion. First, I would direct them to the Congressional Budget \nOffice's, CBO, score of the bill. CBO scored the cost of the bill as \n0.9 percent or less than one percent. Second, I would point out the \nMental Health Parity Act of 1996 contains a provision allowing \ncompanies to no longer comply with the law if their costs increase by \nmore than one percent. And do you know how many companies have opted \nout because their costs have increased by more than one percent? Less \nthan ten companies throughout our entire country.\n  With that in mind I would like to share a couple of facts about \nmental illness with my colleagues: within the developed world, \nincluding the United States, 4 of the 10 leading causes of disability \nfor individuals over the age of five are mental disorders; in the order \nof prevalence the disorders are major depression, schizophrenia, \nbipolar disorder, and obsessive compulsive disorder; one in every five \npeople--more than 40 million adults--in this Nation will be afflicted \nby some type of mental illness; and schizophrenia alone is 50 times \nmore common than cystic fibrosis, 60 times more common than muscular \ndystrophy and will strike between 2 and 3 million Americans.\n  Let us also look at the efficacy of treatment for individuals \nsuffering from certain mental illnesses, especially when compared with \nthe success rates of treatments for other physical ailments. For a long \ntime, many who are in this field--especially on the insurance side--\nhave behaved as if you get far better results for angioplasty than you \ndo for treatments for bipolar illness.\n  Treatment for bipolar disorders--that is, those disorders \ncharacterized by extreme lows and extreme highs--have an 80 percent \nsuccess rate if you get treatment, both medicine and care. \nSchizophrenia, the most dreaded of mental illnesses, has a 60-percent \nsuccess rate in the United States today if treated properly. Major \ndepression has a 65 percent success rate.\n  Let's compare those success rates to several important surgical \nprocedures that everybody thinks we ought to be doing: Angioplasty has \na 41-percent success rate and Atherectomy has a 52-percent success \nrate.\n  I would now like to take a minute to discuss the Senator Paul \nWellstone Mental Health Equitable Treatment Act of 2003. The Bill seeks \na very simple goal: provide the same mental health benefits already \nenjoyed by Federal employees.\n  The Bill is modeled after the mental health benefits provided through \nthe Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, FEHBP, and expands the \nMental Health Parity Act of 1996 to prohibit a group health plan from \nimposing treatment limitations or financial requirements on the \ncoverage of mental health benefits unless comparable limitations are \nimposed on medical and surgical benefits.\n  Our Bill provides full parity for all categories of mental health \nconditions listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental \nDisorders, Fourth Edition, DSM IV, with coverage being contingent on \nthe mental health condition being included in an authorized treatment \nplan, the treatment plan is in accordance with standard protocols, and \nthe treatment plan meets medical necessity determination criteria.\n  Like the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996, the Bill does not require \na health plan to provide coverage for alcohol and substance abuse \nbenefits. Moreover, the Bill does not mandate the coverage of mental \nhealth benefits, but rather the Bill only applies if the plan already \nprovides coverage for mental health benefits.\n  In conclusion, the Bill provides mental heath benefits on par with \nthose already enjoyed by Federal employees and members of Congress and \nI would urge my colleagues to support this important piece of \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 486\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, it is an honor to be here today with \nSenator Domenici to renew the battle in the Senate to end one of the \nmost shameful forms of discrimination in our society discrimination \nagainst mental illness. We renew the battle in the name of our friend \nand colleague Paul Wellstone who did so much to advance this cause we \nshare and whom we miss so dearly now.\n  Senator Pete Domenici and Senator Paul Wellstone led us with great \nskill in the Senate in this bipartisan battle in the past, and I'm \nproud to join Senator Domenici today to carry on this very important \neffort in the Senate.\n  This bill brings first class medicine to millions of Americans who \nhave been second class patients for too long.\n  We know that millions of Americans across the country with mental \nillness faced stigma and misunderstanding. Even worse, they have been \ndenied treatment that can cure or ease their cruel afflictions. Too \noften, they are the victims of discrimination by health insurance \ncompanies. It is unacceptable that the nation continues to tolerate \nactions by insurers that deny medical care for mental illnesses even \nthough the very same insurers fully cover the treatment of physical \nillnesses that are often more costly, less debilitating and less \ncurable. Mental illnesses are treatable and curable, and\n\n[[Page S2974]]\n\nit's high time to bring relief to those who experience them.\n  Equal treatment of the mentally ill is not just an insurance issue, \nit is a civil rights issue. At its heart, mental health parity is a \nquestion of simple justice.\n  The need is clear. One in five Americans will suffer some form of \nmental illness this year--but only one-third of them will receive \ntreatment. According to a report of the Surgeon General, at least 4 \nmillion children suffer from a major mental illness that results in \nsignificant impairments at home, at school, and with their peers. \nFamilies must often make painful choices about how to pay for the care \ntheir child needs to live a normal life.\n  The cost is low. As we have seen in state after state and in the \nFederal Employees Health Benefits Program, insurance parity does not \ncause soaring insurance premiums. When parity for both mental health \ncoverage and substance abuse coverage was provided for federal \nemployees, they paid only $1 a month more for individual coverage and \n$2 for family coverage. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated \nthat this bill will raise insurance rates by less than one percent a \nsmall cost that will bring health care and financial security to many \nfamilies.\n  It is tragic when a child is diagnosed with any illness. It is heart \nwrenching for parents to watch their children suffer. The tragedy is \neven greater when an insurance company denies treatment for a child \nsolely because the illness is a mental illness. It's wrong for \ninsurance companies to promote modern medicine for physical diseases, \nbut leave mental health in the dark ages.\n  It is wrong to force parents to choose between the care their child \nneeds and the other financial needs of the family. I have heard \ncountless stories from mothers and fathers whose children desperately \nneeded the care that their insurance companies refused to provide.\n  There is hope for the future. Today we were presented with 30,000 \npetitions signed by young people asking Congress to provide affordable \ncoverage for mental health services. The petitions were signed in \nconcerts held across the country to raise awareness for suicide \nprevention. Pete Domenici and I are here today to bring hope to these \nparents and to these young people. It is long past time to end \ninsurance discrimination, and guarantee all people with mental \nillnesses the coverage they deserve.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Leahy, \n        Mr. Harkin, and Mr. Johnson):\n  S. 488. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na 5-year extension of the credit for electricity produced from wind; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today, I am joined by Senators Breaux, \nDurbin, Leahy, Harkin and Johnson in introducing legislation to extend \nthe current federal wind energy production tax credit, PTC, for an \nadditional five years. This tax credit is scheduled to expire at the \nend of the year. A long-term extension of the credit will give wind \nenergy developers the certainty they need to grow this important \ndomestic industry with its seemingly limitless energy potential.\n  One of the most promising alternative energy sources on this \ncountry's horizon comes from one of nature's most abundant assets: the \nwind. Over 2,000 megawatts of new wind energy capacity has been added \nto the nation's electricity grid in just the last 2 years. This new \nwind generation has pumped over $2 billion into the struggling economy.\n  Congress has helped promote wind energy by making significant \nfinancial investments in Federal research and private-sector \ndevelopment over the last decade. Among other things, Congress has \nprovided a Federal income tax credit for facilities that produce \nelectricity from wind, which allows them to bring state-of-the-art wind \nturbines to the marketplace at a competitive rate.\n  More and more utilities that have produced electricity from \ntraditional fossil fuels are now looking to wind energy and other \nalternative energy sources to meet a larger share of this country's \nfuture energy demands. Soaring oil and natural gas prices also remind \nus of the importance of reducing our reliance on foreign energy sources \nand keeping a diverse energy supply here at home.\n  However, despite broad bipartisan congressional support for the wind \nenergy production tax credit, its fate remains cloudy. As I mentioned, \nthe wind energy tax credit is scheduled to expire at the end of the \nyear. Congress will surely extend the credit. But we can't wait until \nthe last day of the session--or even later--to do so.\n  Unfortunately, this is not merely polemics. Congress has twice \nallowed the PTC to expire. First, Congress allowed it to expire in July \n1999 and failed to reinstate it until December 1999. As a result, wind \nenergy investments plummeted from 661 megawatts installed in 1999 to \nonly 53 megawatts in 2000. Inexplicably, the Congress let the PTC \nexpire a second time--at the end of 2001--and did not reinstate the \ncredit until March of the following year. This failure contributed to \nanother major drop in wind investments dropping from 1696 megawatts \ninstalled in 2001 to just 410 megawatts in 2002.\n  Today, wind energy industry officials tell me that if we do not \nextend the production tax credit by mid-year, thousands of jobs and \nbillions of dollars in economic activity would be lost. And this \nshouldn't come as a surprise to my Senate colleagues. For many years, \nwind energy developers have told us that one of the major stumbling \nblocks to greater deployment of new wind technologies is the continued \nuncertainty surrounding the availability of the wind energy production \ntax credit. Even so, we still provided for just another short-term \nextension of the tax credit last March. A few short months from now, \nfinancial lenders will stop providing needed capital to new wind \ninitiatives. As a result, projects already underway will quickly come \nto a halt, while new projects will be shelved. Many developers will \nsimply be unable to build and purchase equipment and secure the \nfinancing that is needed to bring wind turbine generators on-line by \nyear's end.\n  When the tax credit last expired, I heard from manufacturers in my \nstate and across the nation about impending layoffs, because of the \nlack of certainty at that time. A tower developer in my state of North \nDakota has again laid off 17 workers, because of the uncertainty this \nindustry still faces, due to the soon-to-expire tax credit. We can help \neliminate this uncertainty by extending the production tax credit for a \nlonger term.\n  If we fail to act promptly to extend the tax credit this time around, \nNorth Dakota's wind energy industry would suffer another serious \neconomic blow. I am told that DMI Industries, a major producer of wind \nturbine towers in North Dakota, would experience a 40-percent drop in \nbusiness activity, resulting in some $15 million in lost revenue. The \ncompany's plan to expand its operation by 75 employees in 2004 would \nalso be derailed. Delay in extending the production tax credit would \nmean that 100-125 new jobs would not be created in the coming year by \nLM Glasfiber, which is a major blade manufacturer in Grand Forks.\n  There is a great deal of discussion in Washington, D.C. about passing \na stimulus package to provide a needed boost to our ailing economy. \nThis very effort would be needlessly undermined if we fail to extend \nthe wind energy production tax credit in a timely manner and make it \navailable over the long term.\n  In North Dakota, we put up several wind turbines last year and \nlaunched an 80-megawatt project for North Dakota and South Dakota. At a \ntime when this industry is just beginning to ramp up in the Great \nPlains, it would be foolish to thwart these efforts by failing to \nextend this wind energy production tax credit for sufficient time to \nget substantial new projects off the design boards and up and running.\n  Again, the bill I'm introducing today would extend the current \nproduction tax credit for qualifying wind facilities that are placed in \nservice on or before December 31, 2008. The wind energy production tax \ncredit has enjoyed strong bipartisan support in both the Senate and the \nHouse of Representatives in previous years, so we should be able to \npass this legislation quickly this year.\n  I urge my Senate colleagues to cosponsor this legislation and work \nwith me to get it enacted into law as soon as\n\n[[Page S2975]]\n\npossible. If we fail to act promptly, many new wind energy initiatives \nwill come to a halt at a time when this country can least afford it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DEWINE (for himself, Mr. Graham of Florida, Mr. Lugar, Mr. \n        Durbin, Mr. Chafee, and Mr. Nelson of Florida):\n  S. 489.

Mr. President, I returned this week from my 12th trip to \nHaiti. As my colleagues are aware, I have many long-standing concerns \nabout the dire political, economic, and humanitarian situation in \nHaiti.\n  In a nation just over an hour's flight from Miami, there is abject \npoverty, suffering, and disease. We absolutely must pay closer \nattention to what is happening to our neighbors in our hemisphere. We \nmust be engaged.\n  That is why I am so pleased to be joining several of my Senate and \nHouse colleagues in introducing the ``Haiti Economic Recovery \nOpportunity Act of 2003.'' I'd like to thank our Senate Co-sponsors, \nwho include Senators Graham of Florida, Lugar, Durbin, Nelson of \nFlorida, and Representatives Congressmen Shaw and Conyers for their \nleadership in getting support for this bill, as well as our other House \nCo-sponsors, Representatives Crane, Rangel, Watson, Lee of California, \nLee of Texas, Meek, Goss, Foley, Waters, and Delegate Christensen of \nthe Virgin Islands.\n  Our bill would take a major step in improving the economic and \npolitical situation in Haiti through an important tool of our foreign \npolicy--and that is trade.\n  As my colleagues, Senators Durbin, Nelson, and Chafee, and \nRepresentative Meek--all of whom traveled with me to Haiti over the \ncourse of this last month--the situation in Haiti is bleak. Haiti is \nthe poorest country in our Hemisphere, with approximately 70 percent of \nits population out of work and 80 percent living in abject poverty. \nLess than one-half of Haiti's 7 million people can read or write. \nHaiti's infant mortality rate is the highest in our hemisphere. And one \nin four children under the age of five are malnourished.\n  roughly one in 12 Haitians has HIV/AIDS and, according to the Centers \nfor Disease Control projections, Haiti will experience up to 44,000 new \nHIV/AIDS cases this year--that's 4,000 more than the number expected \nhere in the United States, where our population is 35 times that of \nHaiti's. AIDS already has orphaned over 200,000 children, and this \nnumber is expected to skyrocket to between 323,000 and 393,000 over the \nnext ten years.\n  The violence, corruption, and instability caused by the flow of drugs \nthrough Haiti cannot be overstated. An estimated 15 percent of all \ncocaine entering the United States passes through Haiti, the Dominican \nRepublic, or both.\n  All of this creates an environment where the logical course of action \nfor many Haitians is simply to flee. We have seen this in the past, and \nwe may see it again. So far this fiscal year, the Coast Guard has \ninterdicted and rescued over 813 Haitian migrants at sea--compared to \n1,113 during the entire fiscal year 2000. And, according to the State \nDepartment, migrants recently interdicted and repatriated to Haiti have \ncited economic conditions as their reason for attempting to migrate by \nsea. I do not think that a mass exodus is imminent, but we cannot \nignore any increase in migrant departures from Haiti. In addition to \nbeing an immigration issue for the United States, these migrant \ndepartures frequently result in the loss of life at sea.\n\n  When I visited Haiti last month, we toured a textile assembly factor. \nWhat we saw was that this operation was providing about 800 Haitian \nlaborers with jobs and giving them an income to help support their \nfamilies. This is in a country that went from having 100,000 assembly \njobs to only 30,000 today. There is no reason we can't reverse that \ntrend.\n  The bill we are introducing today attempts to change the economic \nsituation by granting limited duty-free treatment on certain Haitian \napparel articles if--and only if--the President is able to certify that \nthe Haitian government is making serious market, political, and social \nreforms. The bill would correct a glitch or oversight in U.S. trade law \nthat recognized the special economic needs of least developed countries \nin Africa, but did not recognize those needs for the least developed \ncountry in the Western Hemisphere--Haiti.\n  Specifically, the bill would allow duty-free entry of Haitian apparel \narticles assembled from fabrics from countries with which the U.S. has \na free trade or a regional trade agreement. It also would grant duty-\nfree status on articles, regardless of the origin of the fabrics and \nyarns, if the fabrics and yarns were not commercially available in the \nUnited States.\n  The bill would cap duty-free apparel imports made of fabrics and \nyarns from the designated countries at 1.5 percent of total U.S. \napparel imports. This limit grows modestly over time to 3.5 percent.\n  The enactment of this legislation would promote employment in Haitian \nindustry by allowing the country to become a garment production center. \nWhile the benefits of bill would be modest by U.S. standards, in Haiti \nthey are substantial. It is estimated that the bill could create \nthousands of jobs, thereby reducing the unemployment rate and breaking \nthe shackles of poverty. Before the 1991 coup, Haiti was one of the \nlargest apparel suppliers in the Caribbean. Today, Haitian apparel \naccounts for less than one percent of all apparel imports into the \nUnited States.\n  The type of assembly carried out in Haiti would have minimal impact \non employment in the United States. Actually, it would encourage the \nemigration of jobs from the Far East back to our hemisphere, including \nthe United States, because most Haitian foreign exchange earnings, \nunlike in the Far East, are utilized to purchase American products. \nAnd, the ``Trade and Development Act'' already includes strong \nsafeguards against transshipment.\n\n  In order for Haiti to be eligible for the trade benefits under the \nbill, the President must certify that Haiti is making progress on \nmatters like the rule of law. This will not be an easy task for the \nHaitian government. However, I believe that because of the incentives \nprovided in the bill, it would be more and more apparent to them that \nit is in their interest to reform.\n  Adopting the Haiti Economic Recovery Opportunity Act of 2002 would be \na powerful demonstration of our commitment to helping reverse the \ndownward spiral in Haiti. I encourage my colleagues to join in support \nof this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself and Mr. Ensign):\n  S. 490. A bill to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to convey \ncertain land in the Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit, Nevada, to the \nSecretary of the Interior, in trust for the Washoe Indian Tribe of \nNevada and California; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce the Washoe Tribe \nLand Conveyance Act.\n  I introduced this bill in both the 106th and 107th Congress, and it \npassed the Senate unanimously in 2000 and 2002. The bill has also been \nfavorably received in the House: in the 106h Congress, it passed the \nHouse with unrelated amendments. Unfortunately, due to a shortage of \ntime, the two versions of the bill were never reconciled and neither \nversion became law.\n  In 1997, I helped convene the Lake Tahoe Presidential Forum to \ndiscuss the future of the Lake Tahoe Basin. At that Forum a diverse \ngroup of federal, state, and local government leaders considered the \nchallenges facing the extraordinary natural, recreational, and \necological resources of the Lake Tahoe region. I am pleased to note \nthat the Forum provided the basis for the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act \nthat Senator Feinstein and I introduced and President Clinton signed \ninto law. This law authorizes $300 million of federal investment to \nprotect and rehabilitate the Lake over a ten-year period. In addition, \nI have been able to steadily increase the federal investment in the \nBasin. We are well on our way to fulfilling the promises of the Forum.\n  During the Forum a commitment was made to support the traditional\n\n[[Page S2976]]\n\nand customary sues of the Lake Tahoe Basin by the Washoe Tribe, most \nimportantly, to provide the Tribe access to the shore of Lake Tahoe for \ncultural purposes. In short, this is not a controversial bill. It is a \ngood bill, and it is the right thing to do.\n  The ancestral homeland of the Washoe Tribe of Nevada and California \nincluded an area of over 5,000 square miles in and around the Lake \nTahoe Basin. My bill ensures that members of the Tribe will have the \nopportunity to engage in their traditional and customary cultural \npractices at the Lake in the future as they have done in the past. This \nwill help the tribe meet the needs of spiritual renewal, land \nstewardship and general reunification of the Tribe with its aboriginal \nlands--forever. The participants in the Lake Tahoe Presidential Forum \nendorsed the concept of this bill, and nearly five years later that \nconcept continues to enjoy broad support. The land conveyed by this \nbill to the Washoe Tribe would be managed in accordance with the Lake \nTahoe Regional Plan, would not be commercially developed, and would not \npreclude or hinder public access around the Lake.\n\n  This Act will convey 24.3 acres from the Secretary of Agriculture to \nthe Secretary of the Interior to be held in trust for the Washoe. This \nis not an expansive tract of land, but it is of profound significance \nto the Washoe people. I would like to point out a particular provision \nof the bill and explain the history behind it. Subsection (e) prohibits \nany type of development on the land. This provision was added at the \nrequest of the Washoe Tribe to guarantee that this land remains in its \npresent unspoiled state for traditional and customary cultural uses. \nTribal elders have indicated to me that these purposes could not be \naccomplished if the land were commercially developed, so I am pleased \nto include a provision ensuring that this land will remain in its \nnatural state. I think this provision serves as a testimonial to the \ntribe's integrity and to how important the return of this land is to \nthe Washoe people.\n  Finally, I would like to note that Senator Ensign joins me today to \nintroduce this important bill. I know that Senator Ensign values and \nworks to protect the wonders of Lake Tahoe. His support for this bill \nwill help ensure that the third time is the charm and that we make good \non this important promise to the Washoe Tribe.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 490\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. WASHOE TRIBE LAND CONVEYANCE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the ancestral homeland of the Washoe Tribe of Nevada \n     and California (referred to in this Act as the ``Tribe'') \n     included an area of approximately 5,000 square miles in and \n     around Lake Tahoe, California and Nevada, and Lake Tahoe was \n     the heart of the territory;\n       (2) in 1997, Federal, State, and local governments, \n     together with many private landholders, recognized the Washoe \n     people as indigenous people of Lake Tahoe Basin through a \n     series of meetings convened by those governments at 2 \n     locations in Lake Tahoe;\n       (3) the meetings were held to address protection of the \n     extraordinary natural, recreational, and ecological resources \n     in the Lake Tahoe region;\n       (4) the resulting multiagency agreement includes objectives \n     that support the traditional and customary uses of National \n     Forest System land by the Tribe; and\n       (5) those objectives include the provision of access by \n     members of the Tribe to the shore of Lake Tahoe in order to \n     reestablish traditional and customary cultural practices.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to implement the joint local, State, tribal, and \n     Federal objective of returning the Tribe to Lake Tahoe; and\n       (2) to ensure that members of the Tribe have the \n     opportunity to engage in traditional and customary cultural \n     practices on the shore of Lake Tahoe to meet the needs of \n     spiritual renewal, land stewardship, Washoe horticulture and \n     ethnobotany, subsistence gathering, traditional learning, and \n     reunification of tribal and family bonds.\n       (c) Conveyance on Condition Subsequent.--Subject to valid \n     existing rights, the easement reserved under subsection (d), \n     and the condition stated in subsection (e), the Secretary of \n     Agriculture shall convey to the Secretary of the Interior, in \n     trust for the Tribe, for no consideration, all right, title, \n     and interest in the parcel of land comprising approximately \n     24.3 acres, located within the Lake Tahoe Basin Management \n     Unit north of Skunk Harbor, Nevada, and more particularly \n     described as Mount Diablo Meridian, T15N, R18E, section 27, \n     lot 3.\n       (d) Easement.--\n       (1) In general.--The conveyance under subsection (c) shall \n     be made subject to reservation to the United States of a \n     nonexclusive easement for public and administrative access \n     over Forest Development Road #15N67 to National Forest System \n     land, to be administered by the Secretary of Agriculture.\n       (2) Access by individuals with disabilities.--The Secretary \n     of Agriculture shall provide a reciprocal easement to the \n     Tribe permitting vehicular access to the parcel over Forest \n     Development Road #15N67 to--\n       (A) members of the Tribe for administrative and safety \n     purposes; and\n       (B) members of the Tribe who, due to age, infirmity, or \n     disability, would have difficulty accessing the conveyed \n     parcel on foot.\n       (e) Condition on Use of Land.--\n       (1) In general.--In using the parcel conveyed under \n     subsection (c), the Tribe and members of the Tribe--\n       (A) shall limit the use of the parcel to traditional and \n     customary uses and stewardship conservation for the benefit \n     of the Tribe;\n       (B) shall not permit any permanent residential or \n     recreational development on, or commercial use of, the parcel \n     (including commercial development, tourist accommodations, \n     gaming, sale of timber, or mineral extraction); and\n       (C) shall comply with environmental requirements that are \n     no less protective than environmental requirements that apply \n     under the Regional Plan of the Tahoe Regional Planning \n     Agency.\n       (2) Termination and reversion.--If the Secretary of the \n     Interior, after notice to the Tribe and an opportunity for a \n     hearing, based on monitoring of use of the parcel by the \n     Tribe, makes a finding that the Tribe has used or permitted \n     the use of the parcel in violation of paragraph (1) and the \n     Tribe fails to take corrective or remedial action directed by \n     the Secretary of the Interior--\n       (A) title to the parcel in the Secretary of the Interior, \n     in trust for the Tribe, shall terminate; and\n       (B) title to the parcel shall revert to the Secretary of \n     Agriculture.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Inouye, Ms. \n        Landrieu, Mr. Lott, and Mr. Miller):\n  S. 491. A bill to expand research regarding inflammatory bowel \ndisease, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today for myself, Mr. Cochran, and \nour other cosponsors to re-introduce the Inflammatory Bowel Disease \nAct, which will advance our knowledge of this serious health condition \nand our ability to treat people suffering from it.\n  Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are chronic disorders of the \ngastrointestinal tract which represent the major causes of morbidity \nfrom digestive illness. Because they behave similarly, these disorders \nare collectively known as Inflammatory Bowel Disease. This devastating, \nyet seldom discussed illness can cause severe abdominal pain, diarrhea, \nfever, and bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract. Moreover, \ncomplications related to the disease can include arthritis, \nosteoporosis, anemia, eczema, liver disease, and even colon cancer.\n  We do not know the cause of Inflammatory Bowel Disease. There is no \nmedical cure. An estimated 1 million Americans, including many children \nand young adults, suffer from it. In 1990, the total annual medical \ncosts for patients suffering from Crohns Disease and ulcerative colitis \namounted to over 1.6 billion dollars.\n  Recent medical breakthroughs, however, are opening up exciting new \npathways for research to understand underlying disease mechanisms and \nto improve therapies for those who suffer from Inflammatory Bowel \nDisease. The gene for Crohn's Disease was recently discovered, and \nother research demonstrates that strong linkages exist between \nInflammatory Bowel Disease and functions of the immune system.\n  Our legislation enhances research on Inflammatory Bowel Disease \nwithin the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney \nDiseases at the National Institutes of Health. Among the promising \nareas to be advanced are studies that translate findings from basic \ngenetic and animal model research. The bill will also establish an \nInflammatory Bowel Disease prevention and epidemiology program at the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention. This program is needed to \ngenerate an accurate analysis of the make-\n\n[[Page S2977]]\n\nup of the IBD population in the United States, thereby obtaining \ninvaluable clues to the potential causes and risks associated with the \ndisease.\n  The bill also will inform public and private health coverage policy \nproviders by providing for a study of the coverage standards of \nMedicare, Medicaid, and private health insurance for therapies for \nInflammatory Bowel Disease. It will be conducted by the Institute of \nMedicine of the National Academies of Science. In addition, the bill \ncalls for a General Accounting Office study of the problems patients \nwith Inflammatory Bowel Disease encounter when applying for disability \ninsurance benefits.\n  This bill will benefit millions of Americans who suffer from or who \nare at risk of developing Inflammatory Bowel Disease. It promises to \nalleviate much suffering, to assist patients in accessing sound and \neffective medical treatment, and to benefit those who are debilitated \nby Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 491\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n        This Act may be cited as the ``Inflammatory Bowel Disease \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n        Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are serious \n     inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. Crohn's \n     disease may occur in any section of the gastrointestinal \n     tract but is predominately found in the lower part of the \n     small intestine and the large intestine. Ulcerative colitis \n     is characterized by inflammation and ulceration of the \n     innermost lining of the colon. Because Crohn's disease and \n     ulcerative colitis behave similarly, they are collectively \n     known as inflammatory bowel disease. Both diseases present a \n     variety of symptoms, including severe diarrhea, crampy \n     abdominal pain, fever, and rectal bleeding. There is no known \n     cause of inflammatory bowel disease, or medical cure.\n       (2) It is estimated that up to 1,000,000 people in the \n     United States suffer from inflammatory bowel disease.\n       (3) In 1990, the total annual medical costs for Crohn's \n     disease patients was estimated at $1,000,000,000 to \n     $1,200,000,000.\n       (4) In 1990, the total annual medical costs for ulcerative \n     colitis patients was estimated at $400,000,000 to \n     $600,000,000.\n       (5) Inflammatory bowel disease patients are at high-risk \n     for developing colorectal cancer.\n\n     SEC. 3. INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE RESEARCH EXPANSION.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Director of the National Institute of \n     Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases shall expand, \n     intensify, and coordinate the activities of the Institute \n     with respect to research on inflammatory bowel disease with \n     particular emphasis on the following areas:\n       (1) Genetic research on susceptibility for inflammatory \n     bowel disease, including the interaction of genetic and \n     environmental factors in the development of the disease.\n       (2) Animal model research on inflammatory bowel disease, \n     including genetics in animals.\n       (3) Clinical inflammatory bowel disease research, including \n     clinical studies and treatment trials.\n       (4) Other research initiatives identified by the scientific \n     document entitled ``Challenges in Inflammatory Bowel \n     Disease''.\n       (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--\n       (1) In general.--For the purpose of carrying out this \n     section, there are authorized to be appropriated $75,000,000 \n     in fiscal year 2004, $100,000,000 in fiscal year 2005, and \n     such sums as may be necessary for fiscal years 2006 and 2007.\n       (2) Reservation.--Of the funds authorized to be \n     appropriated under paragraph (1), not more than 20 percent of \n     such funds shall be reserved to fund the training of \n     qualified health professionals in biomedical research focused \n     on inflammatory bowel disease and related disorders.\n\n     SEC. 4. INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE PREVENTION AND \n                   EPIDEMIOLOGY.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Director of the Centers for Disease \n     Control and Prevention shall establish a national program of \n     prevention and epidemiology to determine the prevalence of \n     inflammatory bowel disease in the United States, and conduct \n     public and professional awareness activities on inflammatory \n     bowel disease.\n       (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--For the purpose of \n     carrying out this section, there are authorized to be \n     appropriated $5,000,000 in fiscal year 2004, and such sums as \n     may be necessary for fiscal years 2005 through 2007.\n\n     SEC. 5. STUDY OF INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE RELATED SERVICES.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Institute of Medicine of the National \n     Academics of Science shall conduct a study on the coverage \n     standards of medicare, medicaid, and the private insurance \n     market for the following therapies:\n       (1) Parenteral nutrition.\n       (2) Enteral nutrition formula.\n       (3) Medically necessary food products.\n       (4) Ostomy supplies.\n       (5) Therapies approved by the Food and Drug Administration \n     for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.\n       (b) Content.--The study shall also take into account the \n     appropriate outpatient or home health care delivery settings.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 6 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Institute of Medicine shall submit \n     a report to Congress describing the findings of the study.\n       (d) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated to carry out this section, such sums as \n     may be necessary.\n\n     SEC. 6. SOCIAL SECURITY DISABILITY FOR INFLAMMATORY BOWEL \n                   DISEASE PATIENTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The General Accounting Office shall \n     conduct a study of the problems patients encounter when \n     applying for disability insurance benefits under title II of \n     the Social Security Act. The study will also include \n     recommendations for improving the application process for \n     inflammatory bowel disease patients.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 6 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the General Accounting Office shall \n     submit a report to Congress describing the findings of the \n     study.\n       (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated to carry out this section, such sums as \n     may be necessary.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. LINCOLN (for herself, Mr. Specter, Mr. Ensign, and Ms. \n        Landrieu):\n  S. 493. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nauthorize physical therapists to evaluate and treat medicare \nbeneficiaries without a requirement for a physician referral, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Medicare \nPatient Access to Physical Therapists Act of 2003, which allows \nMedicare beneficiaries direct access to qualified physical therapists \nwithout a physician referral, as allowed by State law. I am proud to be \njoined in this effort today by my friends Senators Specter, Landrieu, \nand Ensign.\n  Currently, 35 States, including my home State of Arkansas, allow for \ndirect access to physical therapists without the added cost of a \nphysician referral. Direct access is an important change that physical \ntherapists and their patients are seeking to the Medicare program. The \nNational Rural Health Association, Easter Seals, and the Brain Injury \nAssociation of America join with us today in expressing their support \nfor this important legislation.\n  Currently, seniors and disabled Medicare beneficiaries must first \nvisit a physician before being allowed to visit a physical therapist. \nThis burdensome requirement in Medicare is simply no longer necessary \nand limits access to timely and medically necessary physical \ntherapists' services. Providing Medicare beneficiaries with direct \naccess to physical therapists should be a critical component of any \nMedicare reform.\n  Congress must consistently balance patient safety, accessibility of \nservices from qualified providers, and costs to the Medicare program \nwhen evaluating services. State boards that regulate physical therapy \nconfirm that patient safety is not compromised by the elimination of \nthe referral requirement because malpractice incidents and costs are \nnot markedly higher in States that allow direct access.\n  Second, direct access to physical therapists would allow for improved \naccess to quality health care services, particularly in rural and urban \nunderserved communities. It is a burden for elderly and disabled \npatients with chronic conditions to drive back and forth to a \nphysician's office simply to obtain another referral for physical \ntherapy. This not only disrupts patient access to timely therapy \ntreatment but creates a needless administrative expense for the \nMedicare program.\n  Finally, a study of BlueCross/BlueShield insurance claims in Maryland \nindicates that services are not over-utilized when a patient has direct \naccess to physical therapists. In fact, the study indicates \nsignificantly lower costs when care is initiated without a physician \nreferral. With this in mind, a policy that improves access to physical\n\n[[Page S2978]]\n\ntherapists is a positive reform for the Medicare program and its \nbeneficiaries.\n  The Medicare program should not impose arbitrary administrative \nbarriers to patients who need physical therapy services, especially \nwhen States have an entirely different standard for access. I encourage \nmy colleagues to support this Medicare modernization plan to ensure the \nbest access to physical therapy for America's most vulnerable \npopulation--senior and disabled patients.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAPO:\n  S. 494. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to include \nagricultural and animal waste sources as a renewable energy resource; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that will \nencourage the expansion of an often overlooked domestic energy resource \nthat offers a source of revenue for our rural communities and an avenue \nfor cleanup of agricultural waste.\n  It has been well-publicized that our country faces mounting \nuncertainty in meeting our energy demands. After years of getting \nlittle attention, we are now in a period where the development of \ndomestic energy resources has reached a crucial point. I support our \nefforts to diversify our energy supply resources to ensure our nation's \nenergy security, support our business and agricultural economies, and \nprotect our individual consumers. This time of challenge also offers \ngreat opportunities. One of those is the opportunity to encourage a \nlargely untapped resource to provide domestic energy, while also \npromoting the protection of the environment and rural development. I am \nspeaking about energy derived from agricultural and animal waste \nsources.\n  Electricity from biomass and waste sources using modern technology is \na renewable resource that can add to our domestic energy supply. The \nprocess uses manure and waste products that are heated and converted \ninto biogas that is burned to generate electricity, which is sold into \nthe power grid. This technology is widely accepted in Europe where over \n600 systems are in operation today. In this country, the technology is \ngaining acceptance following numerous successful case studies. This \nprocess offers farmers an option for cleaning agricultural waste that \nis a known source of groundwater contamination and air pollution. The \nrevenue generated from the sale of electricity provides a source of \nincome to offset the cleanup costs, while providing important kilowatts \nto the power grid.\n  The bill I am introducing today would extend the 1.5 cent per \nkilowatt hour production tax credit that is currently available to \nwind, closed-loop biomass, and poultry waste by making it available to \nall agricultural and animal waste sources.\n  There have been other bills introduced that would extend the tax \ncredit to additional renewable sources such as solar energy. I \nencourage these efforts to broaden the definition of renewable sources.\n  The use of modern technology to generate electricity from waste \nshould not be overlooked.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce this resolution \non behalf of myself and Senator George Allen from Virginia. This \nresolution underscores a very serious and ongoing problem relating to \nthe illegal subsidies being provided by the Korean Government to Hynix \nSemiconductor, one of the companies operating in South Korea. With this \nresolution, my\n\n[[Page S2980]]\n\ncolleagues and I urge Secretary Evans, our Secretary of the Department \nof Commerce, and Ambassador Zoellick, U.S. Trade Representative, to use \nall means at their disposal to combat these illegal subsidies in the \nstrongest ways possible under our trade laws.\n  Since October 2000, the Government of Korea, acting through the banks \nthat it owns and controls, has provided an astounding $16 billion in \nsubsidies to Hynix, a Korean producer of DRAM semiconductors. Hynix is \na company with massive debt resulting from the easy lending practices \nof the Korean banks during the late 1990s. With these preferential \nloans, Hynix built substantial new capacity and became the third \nlargest DRAM producer in the world.\n  Starting in late 2000, Hynix's overdevelopment began to catch up with \nthem and Hynix became unable to repay the principal and interest on \nthese massive loans and bonds. Rather than letting Hynix undergo formal \nbankruptcy and deal with the financial situation it faced, the Korean \nGovernment orchestrated no less than five separate bailouts of Hynix. \nHad it not done so, Hynix would have had to face a restructuring with \nsubstantial asset sales, and would have been simply another competitor \nin the marketplace in a more balanced and fair playing field.\n  However, these subsidies have permitted Hynix to stay in business \nwith its unrealistic business practices. Hynix, a company that cannot \ncompete in the market on a balanced playing field, in a fair market \nenvironment, continues to run its inefficient DRAM plants at full \nspeed, flooding world markets with subsidized products. Despite the \nsubsidies, Hynix continues to lose money--$8 billion over the last 3 \nyears. Yet the Korean Government continues to pour money into this \ncompany.\n  Just 2 months ago there was yet another bailout, amounting to $4.1 \nbillion. This is almost twice Hynix's revenues in all of the year 2002, \nwhich amounted to $2.4 billion.\n  The Korean Government must not be allowed to continue to underwrite \nthe horrendous operating losses of this company as it has done for the \npast 3 years. It is time for the Korean Government to stop its illegal \nsubsidies. In the highly competitive DRAM market, subsidies of this \nsort completely distort production and trade.\n  Every other DRAM company in the world is being crippled by the \nsubsidized DRAM products that Hynix floods the markets with. This has \nresulted in the worst and longest downturn in the DRAM sector that has \never been experienced by this sector. Nobody can make money in this \nbusiness if one of the biggest players is being underwritten by the \nSouth Korean government treasury. Subsidies of Hynix have had a huge \nimpact on Micron Technology, the last remaining U.S.-based producer of \nDRAMs. Just last week, Micron announced it was laying off 10 percent of \nits worldwide workforce. This translates into 1,100 lost jobs in Idaho \nalone, and 560 lost jobs in the State of Virginia, which is why my \ncolleague, Senator Allen, is joining in this resolution.\n  This is the first time Micron has had to have layoffs since 1985, and \nit was only done by the company as a last resort. Hynix subsidies have \nhad a real impact on Micron's bottom line as well. The subsidies have \nimpacted pricing to such an extent that even Micron, one of the most \nefficient DRAM producers in the world, has lost $2 billion over the \npast 2 years. We cannot afford to see an important technology like \nDRAMs lost in the United States because of illegal, predatory foreign \ngovernment subsidies.\n  The South Korean government is clearly responsible for the bailouts \nthat have occurred. The creditor bank now owns 67 percent of Hynix, and \nthe government owns the vast majority of the creditor bank. To argue \nthat the government plays no role in this bailout is the height of \nabsurdity.\n  The Secretary of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative \nhave the power to remedy this situation and put a stop to more \nbailouts. We need to use the trade laws we have to the fullest extent \npossible and countervailing duty should be imposed that offsets the \nfull amount of these subsidies. These sorts of subsidies have \nabsolutely no place in today's global economy, particularly as we are \nengaged in a round of new trade talks aimed at further liberalizing \ntrade regimes around the world. The injurious and anachronistic \npolicies of the government of South Korea must stop.\n  In this context, already the European Union and the United States \nGovernment are engaged in investigations under our trade laws of the \npredator conduct of the South Korean government in DRAM markets. We \nexpect decisions on these cases sometime in the next couple of months, \nand hopefully these cases will establish the necessary groundwork for \nus to be able to deal as we should in the global community with this \nkind of unacceptable government subsidy.\n  The U.S. International Trade Commission has already issued its ruling \nthat Micron Technology has been injured by these illegal activities of \nthe South Korean government. We must now move on to determine the \nextent of these activities and assure that countervailing duties are \nidentified and applied to the DRAMs that Hynix continues to flood the \nworld markets with.\n  I want to read a part of the resolution to establish what it is we \nare asking our Congress to do.\n  After the whereas clauses, it states:\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives \n     concurring, That, No. 1, it is the sense of the Congress that \n     the actions of the Republic of Korea with respect to the \n     bailouts of Hynix Semiconductor, Inc. are severely \n     detrimental to the bilateral friendship and economic \n     relationships between the United States and Korea; and, No. \n     2, Congress calls on the Republic of Korea to immediately \n     cease any further bailouts of Hynix and to immediately comply \n     with all of its obligations as a member of the World Trade \n     Organization, including its obligations regarding \n     subsidies. The Secretary of Commerce and the U.S. Trade \n     Representative are called on to immediately take such \n     actions as are necessary to end any further bailouts of \n     Hynix, including the self-initiation of further trade \n     cases, the initiation of a further government \n     investigation of the financial impact of these bailouts, \n     and the calling of a special subsidies code meeting to \n     raise legal concerns with this issue and to begin \n     consultations with Congress regarding appropriate \n     legislative action to fully deal with the impact of \n     bailout of Hynix; and, the President is called on to \n     consult with the European Union regarding joint action \n     with respect to the unlawful subsidies to Hynix that are \n     harming the international DRAM semiconductor and \n     electronics markets.\n\n  As I have indicated, we face incredibly difficult times in the DRAM \nand semiconductor industry as a result of one nation's desire to \ncontinually prop up its competitors against all other world \ncompetitors--a competitor that has shown it cannot effectively compete \nwithout continuous government subsidies.\n  This is one of the core reasons why we are engaged worldwide in \nnegotiations to reduce government subsidies to inefficient competitors, \nto stop nations from trying to flood the market with their company's \nproducts so that they can drive other, more efficient and more \neffective competitors out of the market and take those markets from \nother countries where they properly reside.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to strongly support this resolution \nand send a strong message to the government of South Korea that the \nbailouts of Hynix must stop.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I was present as the debate took place with \nregard to the editorial issues that have been raised relating to the \nMiguel Estrada nomination. The Senator from Nevada raised this issue. \nIn the debate over the Estrada nomination, there are many issues that \nflow back and forth.

Con. Res. 11\n\n       Whereas the government of the Republic of Korea has \n     continually, and in violation of its international trade \n     commitments, supplied financial aid to Hynix Semiconductor \n     Inc. (``Hynix''), a failing semiconductor company;\n       Whereas the United States has strongly and repeatedly \n     requested that the Republic of Korea refrain from these \n     wrongful trade activities;\n       Whereas these bailouts have resulted in severe distortion \n     of the world DRAM, semiconductor, and electronics markets to \n     the detriment of major United States and other non-Korean \n     producers;\n       Whereas the United States has continually provided \n     military, national security, and financial aid to the \n     Republic of Korea, including significant contributions to the \n     International Monetary Fund financial package to prevent the \n     Korean economy from going into bankruptcy;\n       Whereas Hynix exports the vast majority of its \n     semiconductor production to nations outside of Korea, \n     including to the United States and European nations;\n       Whereas, it was recently announced that Hynix would receive \n     an additional $4,000,000,000 in debt restructuring, \n     eliminating Hynix's existing debt, an additional \n     $1,550,000,000 in a debt-for-equity swap, and an extension of \n     $2,500,000,000 with respect to other outstanding Hynix loans;\n       Whereas Hynix's creditor banks are providing another \n     subsidy to Hynix in the form of $188,000,000 in financing to \n     a Chinese company to purchase Hynix's flat computer screen \n     business;\n       Whereas the largest creditors of Hynix are institutions \n     such as the Korea Development Bank and the Woori Bank, both \n     of which are 100 percent owned by the government of the \n     Republic of Korea; and\n       Whereas United States and Europe have been forced to \n     initiate anti-subsidy investigations against the Republic of \n     Korea: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That--\n       (1) it is the sense of Congress that the actions of the \n     Republic of Korea with respect to the bailouts of Hynix \n     Semiconductor Inc. (``Hynix'') are severely detrimental to \n     the bilateral friendship and economic relationships between \n     the United States and Korea; and\n       (2) Congress calls on--\n       (A) the Republic of Korea to--\n       (i) immediately cease any further bailouts of Hynix; and\n       (ii) immediately comply with all of its obligations as a \n     member of the World Trade Organization, including its \n     obligations regarding subsidies;\n       (B) the Secretary of Commerce and the United States Trade \n     Representative to--\n       (i) immediately take such actions as are necessary to end \n     any further bailouts of Hynix, including the self-initiation \n     of further trade cases, the initiation of a further \n     government investigation of the financial impact of these \n     bailouts, and the calling of a special subsidies code meeting \n     to raise the legal concerns with this issue; and\n       (ii) begin consultations with Congress regarding \n     appropriate legislative action to fully deal with the impact \n     of the bailouts of Hynix; and\n       (C) the President to consult with the European Union \n     regarding joint action with respect to the unlawful subsidies \n     to Hynix that are harming the international DRAM, \n     semiconductor, and electronics markets.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce this resolution \non behalf of myself and Senator George Allen from Virginia. This \nresolution underscores a very serious and ongoing problem relating to \nthe illegal subsidies being provided by the Korean Government to Hynix \nSemiconductor, one of the companies operating in South Korea. With this \nresolution, my\n\n[[Page S2980]]\n\ncolleagues and I urge Secretary Evans, our Secretary of the Department \nof Commerce, and Ambassador Zoellick, U.S. Trade Representative, to use \nall means at their disposal to combat these illegal subsidies in the \nstrongest ways possible under our trade laws.\n  Since October 2000, the Government of Korea, acting through the banks \nthat it owns and controls, has provided an astounding $16 billion in \nsubsidies to Hynix, a Korean producer of DRAM semiconductors. Hynix is \na company with massive debt resulting from the easy lending practices \nof the Korean banks during the late 1990s. With these preferential \nloans, Hynix built substantial new capacity and became the third \nlargest DRAM producer in the world.\n  Starting in late 2000, Hynix's overdevelopment began to catch up with \nthem and Hynix became unable to repay the principal and interest on \nthese massive loans and bonds. Rather than letting Hynix undergo formal \nbankruptcy and deal with the financial situation it faced, the Korean \nGovernment orchestrated no less than five separate bailouts of Hynix. \nHad it not done so, Hynix would have had to face a restructuring with \nsubstantial asset sales, and would have been simply another competitor \nin the marketplace in a more balanced and fair playing field.\n  However, these subsidies have permitted Hynix to stay in business \nwith its unrealistic business practices. Hynix, a company that cannot \ncompete in the market on a balanced playing field, in a fair market \nenvironment, continues to run its inefficient DRAM plants at full \nspeed, flooding world markets with subsidized products. Despite the \nsubsidies, Hynix continues to lose money--$8 billion over the last 3 \nyears. Yet the Korean Government continues to pour money into this \ncompany.\n  Just 2 months ago there was yet another bailout, amounting to $4.1 \nbillion. This is almost twice Hynix's revenues in all of the year 2002, \nwhich amounted to $2.4 billion.\n  The Korean Government must not be allowed to continue to underwrite \nthe horrendous operating losses of this company as it has done for the \npast 3 years. It is time for the Korean Government to stop its illegal \nsubsidies. In the highly competitive DRAM market, subsidies of this \nsort completely distort production and trade.\n  Every other DRAM company in the world is being crippled by the \nsubsidized DRAM products that Hynix floods the markets with. This has \nresulted in the worst and longest downturn in the DRAM sector that has \never been experienced by this sector. Nobody can make money in this \nbusiness if one of the biggest players is being underwritten by the \nSouth Korean government treasury. Subsidies of Hynix have had a huge \nimpact on Micron Technology, the last remaining U.S.-based producer of \nDRAMs. Just last week, Micron announced it was laying off 10 percent of \nits worldwide workforce. This translates into 1,100 lost jobs in Idaho \nalone, and 560 lost jobs in the State of Virginia, which is why my \ncolleague, Senator Allen, is joining in this resolution.\n  This is the first time Micron has had to have layoffs since 1985, and \nit was only done by the company as a last resort. Hynix subsidies have \nhad a real impact on Micron's bottom line as well. The subsidies have \nimpacted pricing to such an extent that even Micron, one of the most \nefficient DRAM producers in the world, has lost $2 billion over the \npast 2 years. We cannot afford to see an important technology like \nDRAMs lost in the United States because of illegal, predatory foreign \ngovernment subsidies.\n  The South Korean government is clearly responsible for the bailouts \nthat have occurred. The creditor bank now owns 67 percent of Hynix, and \nthe government owns the vast majority of the creditor bank. To argue \nthat the government plays no role in this bailout is the height of \nabsurdity.\n  The Secretary of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative \nhave the power to remedy this situation and put a stop to more \nbailouts. We need to use the trade laws we have to the fullest extent \npossible and countervailing duty should be imposed that offsets the \nfull amount of these subsidies. These sorts of subsidies have \nabsolutely no place in today's global economy, particularly as we are \nengaged in a round of new trade talks aimed at further liberalizing \ntrade regimes around the world. The injurious and anachronistic \npolicies of the government of South Korea must stop.\n  In this context, already the European Union and the United States \nGovernment are engaged in investigations under our trade laws of the \npredator conduct of the South Korean government in DRAM markets. We \nexpect decisions on these cases sometime in the next couple of months, \nand hopefully these cases will establish the necessary groundwork for \nus to be able to deal as we should in the global community with this \nkind of unacceptable government subsidy.\n  The U.S. International Trade Commission has already issued its ruling \nthat Micron Technology has been injured by these illegal activities of \nthe South Korean government. We must now move on to determine the \nextent of these activities and assure that countervailing duties are \nidentified and applied to the DRAMs that Hynix continues to flood the \nworld markets with.\n  I want to read a part of the resolution to establish what it is we \nare asking our Congress to do.\n  After the whereas clauses, it states:\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives \n     concurring, That, No. 1, it is the sense of the Congress that \n     the actions of the Republic of Korea with respect to the \n     bailouts of Hynix Semiconductor, Inc. are severely \n     detrimental to the bilateral friendship and economic \n     relationships between the United States and Korea; and, No. \n     2, Congress calls on the Republic of Korea to immediately \n     cease any further bailouts of Hynix and to immediately comply \n     with all of its obligations as a member of the World Trade \n     Organization, including its obligations regarding \n     subsidies. The Secretary of Commerce and the U.S. Trade \n     Representative are called on to immediately take such \n     actions as are necessary to end any further bailouts of \n     Hynix, including the self-initiation of further trade \n     cases, the initiation of a further government \n     investigation of the financial impact of these bailouts, \n     and the calling of a special subsidies code meeting to \n     raise legal concerns with this issue and to begin \n     consultations with Congress regarding appropriate \n     legislative action to fully deal with the impact of \n     bailout of Hynix; and, the President is called on to \n     consult with the European Union regarding joint action \n     with respect to the unlawful subsidies to Hynix that are \n     harming the international DRAM semiconductor and \n     electronics markets.\n\n  As I have indicated, we face incredibly difficult times in the DRAM \nand semiconductor industry as a result of one nation's desire to \ncontinually prop up its competitors against all other world \ncompetitors--a competitor that has shown it cannot effectively compete \nwithout continuous government subsidies.\n  This is one of the core reasons why we are engaged worldwide in \nnegotiations to reduce government subsidies to inefficient competitors, \nto stop nations from trying to flood the market with their company's \nproducts so that they can drive other, more efficient and more \neffective competitors out of the market and take those markets from \nother countries where they properly reside.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to strongly support this resolution \nand send a strong message to the government of South Korea that the \nbailouts of Hynix must stop.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I was present as the debate took place with \nregard to the editorial issues that have been raised relating to the \nMiguel Estrada nomination. The Senator from Nevada raised this issue. \nIn the debate over the Estrada nomination, there are many issues that \nflow back and forth. One of them is the question of what the public \nbelieves, and what the editorial boards across this Nation believe.\n  The editorial from the New York Times was discussed earlier. I point \nout that this editorial in the New York Times was one of only a few \neditorials in the country that supports the position that the Senate \nshould continue with a filibuster of this nomination. In fact, only \neight of the editorial boards across this Nation have taken the \nposition of supporting the filibuster of Miguel Estrada's nomination, \nwhile fully 51 editorial boards across the Nation support ending the \nobstruction of this nomination and conclusion of the filibuster and \nresulting in an up-or-down vote in the Senate on the Estrada \nnomination, including the Los Angeles Review Journal which on two \nseparate occasions supported Mr. Estrada.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an issue that is \nimportant to many people throughout the State of Arkansas and indeed \nthroughout this country. I rise to express my disappointment with the \nbudget as it pertains to law enforcement programs and, in particular, \ncommunity policing.\n  I believe the budget shortchanges smaller communities and grossly \nunderfunds programs that have put more police officers on the street, \nreduced crime in rural areas, curbed drug abuse, and put at-risk youth \nback on the right track.\n  Mr. President, this budget cuts funding to the Community Oriented \nPolicing Services--known by its acronym COPS--by 85 percent. That is 85 \npercent. This program was funded at $1.1 billion in fiscal year 2002. \nPresident Bush proposes only $164 million for the COPS program in \nfiscal year 2004. The administration's budget request for COPS \nrepresents a 100 percent cut to the COPS universal hiring program, and \na 100 percent cut to the ``COPS in school'' program. In fact, the only \nprogram that is funded under this budget is the COPS technology \nprogram, and even that has been cut by 66 percent.\n  From its inception, COPS has awarded just over $8 billion to local \nand State law enforcement agencies across the country. With grant \nmoney, departments have hired over 110,000 community police officers, \nin addition to purchasing technological upgrades and equipment.\n  The COPS Program was established to focus on crime prevention and \ncommunity engagement. This breaks with traditional notions of law \nenforcement by moving from reactive responses to proactive problem \nsolving, focusing on the causes of crime and disorder. Community-\noriented policing requires much more interaction on the neighborhood \nand community level than previous policing efforts.\n  In Arkansas, we have been able to hire over 1,300 additional officers \nwith the $83 million we have received. We have also used that money to \ncombat methamphetamine use and to implement the COPS Program in \nschools.\n  A February 3 article in the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, my State's \nlargest newspaper, stated the reason given by this administration for \ncutting funding is that COPS has ``not produced conclusive results in \nlowering crime.''\n  I speak today not only as a Senator, but also as the former chief law \nenforcement officer of Arkansas, and I wholeheartedly disagree with \nthis administration's assessment of these very important programs.\n  I have worked closely with law enforcement officers of my State to \nmake Arkansas a safer place and a better place to raise a family. They \nare strong leaders in their communities and demonstrate the character \nand the courage that define us as a nation. Together, we are able to \nkeep over 1,000 criminals off the street due to their work on the front \nlines.\n\n  Oftentimes, these police officers work in smaller rural communities. \nThey operate under tighter budgets with smaller staffs than most of \ntheir urban counterparts. Nonetheless, they put their lives on the line \nevery single day. They make real differences in people's lives, and \nthey do it with professionalism and an attitude of public service. They \ndo it because it is the right thing to do. They do not do it because it \nis easy or because it is pleasant, and, Lord knows, they do not do it \nfor the money. They are not asking for much in return.\n  I wish to take this time to thank all law enforcement officials for \nthe work they do. I especially thank Sheriff Marty Montgomery of \nFaulkner County, Sheriff Ron Ball of Hot Spring County, and Sheriff \nChuck Lange of the Arkansas Sheriffs' Association. They are in \nWashington today as part of their national association's meeting. I \nthank them not only for their commitment to public service and to \nkeeping our communities safer--combined they have 87 years of law \nenforcement experience--but I also thank them for sharing with me their \ninsights into the COPS Program and helping to demonstrate just how \nimportant the program is to them and other local law enforcement.\n  You see, Mr. President, to them, this funding could mean the \ndifference between life and death. This past Saturday at 7:30 p.m., \nFaulkner County sheriff's deputy, Brad Brocker, was called to \ninvestigate a suspicious person call in a high drug-use area. When \nDeputy Brocker arrived on the scene, he was met with three bullets to \nthe heart in the upper chest. Luckily, he was wearing his bulletproof \nvest, but he risked his life to make his community and, yes, even his \nNation, safer and better. But there is more to the story.\n  The Kevlar vest he was wearing was paid for by Federal grant money, \nand Deputy Brocker was originally hired as a deputy under the COPS \nProgram. Putting this Federal money back into our communities works. In \nfact, Faulkner County, with its 90,000 citizens and spanning 700 square \nmiles, has used COPS funding to hire 12 officers in the past few years. \nTwelve may not sound like a lot, but it constitutes half of the \nFaulkner County sheriff's police force. It has made a difference.\n  In the last 7 years, the arrest rates for burglary, robbery, and \nmethamphetamine production have all gone up. Any one of my colleagues \nwho lives in a rural State can surely tell you about their problems \nwith the use and the production of methamphetamine. It has become an \nepidemic throughout rural America.\n  Last year alone, the Faulkner County Sheriff's Office seized 44 labs \nand shut them down for good. Sheriff Montgomery is proud of that \naccomplishment, as he should be, but he warns that by cutting law \nenforcement programs, such as COPS, the steps they have taken forward \nwill be lost, and they cannot sustain the manpower and law enforcement \npresence in their county.\n  I believe we have a duty to support legislation, programs, and \nbudgets to address the challenges facing law enforcement agencies in \nrural areas in Arkansas and all across the country, in communities such \nas Malvern, a small city in southwest Arkansas. Richard Taft is the \npolice chief of the Malvern Police Department. Mr. Taft has 32 years of \nexperience in law enforcement and 10 years as Malvern's police chief. \nWhen Chief Taft took over in 1993, the Malvern police force consisted \nof 14 people responsible for protecting a city of over 10,000 citizens. \nAs Chief Taft put it to me one day: I didn't have enough officers to \nprotect my officers, much less the citizens of Malvern.\n\n  In 1993, according to Chief Taft, crime was rampant. Robberies, \ndrive-by shootings, and burglaries occurred on a weekly basis. Since \ninstituting the COPS Program and utilizing its grant funding, crime is \ndown. The Malvern police force today is 22 people strong. With the \nadditional manpower, Malvern has assembled a special crime team with \nthe ability to respond to critical incidents, including chemical spills \nand missing persons. They did not have that ability before. COPS \nfunding has allowed the Malvern Police Department to free up some of \ntheir money for other necessities, such as computers and radios.\n  Chief Taft says:\n\n       Without the COPS Program, I wouldn't have a police force.\n\n  Yet this administration says there is no conclusive evidence that the \nCOPS Program works? I disagree with that. More importantly, there are \nscores of law enforcement officials who would also stand up to dispute \nthat claim.\n  In 1993, Little Rock, AR, had the highest violent crime rate per \ncapita in the country. By working with the Federal Government, using \nthe COPS Program, and their own additional hires, the Little Rock \nPolice Department bolstered their force and violent crime has dropped \nby 60 percent.\n  Chuck Lange, the head of the Arkansas Sheriffs' Association, knows \nthe significant impact the COPS Program has had statewide--and I am \nsure sheriffs in other States can tell you the same thing--by putting \nmore police officers on the street. He knows that more officers have \nhelped shorten response time. That is especially important in sprawling \nrural communities. He knows that time is not a luxury afforded to crime \nvictims. I know it as\n\n[[Page S2983]]\n\nwell. It may be because my grandfather, my great-grandfather, and my \ngreat-great-grandfather were all sheriffs of Ouachita County.\n  Hot Spring Sheriff Ron Ball told me that in his county the COPS \nProgram has enabled him to direct more time and resources to curbing \ndomestic violence.\n  He knows that if his department doesn't do a better job of protecting \nthe abused, they have nowhere else to turn.\n  And these law enforcement officers all know and have all told me that \nif we let these drastic COPS funding cuts stand, rural America will \nsuffer.\n  The list of law enforcement officials opposed to these cuts is long, \nbut the opposition is not only limited to law enforcement. There are \nmany mayors, community activists, and school administrators who also \nrealize the importance of this program; school administrators like Dr. \nBenny Gooden.\n  Dr. Gooden is the superintendent of schools in Fort Smith, AR. He \noversees 26 schools with 12,500 students. Dr. Gooden knows how \nsuccessful the COPS in Schools program has been. He knows that COPS is \nan asset to this community and to his schools. The presence of \nfriendly, approachable police officers, known as School Resource \nOfficers, on their campuses and in their neighborhoods has had a \ncalming effect on Fort Smith schools.\n  Since the implementation of the COPS program in Fort Smith schools, \nDr. Gooden has witnessed a decline in violent incidents. Over the past \nfew years suspensions have decreased by 65 percent. Expulsions have \nbeen reduced by 80 percent. The drop-out rate has been cut in half.\n  When talking about the positive effect of the COPS in Schools \nprogram, Dr. Gooden calls it a powerful relationship; a win-win for \nboth the schools and the community. Because the police officers are in \nthe community and in the schools and are connected to the students and \ntheir families, officers can better identify and proactively defuse any \npotential problems there may be.\n  Often times problems that are found in schools begin in the \nneighborhood and in the home. Police officers in Fort Smith recognize \nthis and are in a better position to resolve such problems.\n  Dr. Gooden has also witnessed, first-hand, the affirmative impact of \nthis program on a child's educational experience. The officers interact \nwith students. Some officers have offices in the schools. They are \ninvited to school activities. These officers do not just show up when \nthere is trouble, they are positive role models for Fort Smith's \nchildren and are involved in their lives. They spend time with students \nand in the community when there is no trouble and that presence, can \nmake all the difference.\n  These positive results are not limited to Fort Smith nor are they \nonly appreciated by the administrators. As Arkansas Attorney General, I \nspent a lot of time in schools talking to our young people, and move \nimportantly listening. Over and over the students told me how much they \nliked having School Resource Officers on campus. It made them feel \nsafer, it provided a needed role model and it oftentimes provided an \nadult they could talk to. It showed our children that their community \ncared about them and gave them a much better perspective on law \nenforcement.\n  We must also not forget the importance of these police officers as an \nintegral part of our homeland defense and as first responders in the \ncase of terrorist attacks. September 11 changed a lot of things for our \ncountry. It woke us to the need of genuine partnerships that involve \nall segments of our communities, and all levels of government. We all \nhave a role in keeping our community safe, and overall when we talk \nabout homeland security, we need to give serious thought to our law \nenforcement needs.\n  Unfortunately, we saw how September 11 strained the resources, and \nthe budgets, of many towns and cities. The administration's law \nenforcement budget does not help that problem. Our civilian authorities \nmust be able to respond to whatever may confront them in the future, \nbut how can they properly respond, when they are given a budget that \ncuts deep into their existence? The irony is that I have heard \nSecretary Ridge speak many times about how important local law \nenforcement agencies are to homeland security, but at the very moment \nwhen our Nation needs them most, we are drastically cutting assistance \nto them.\n  The Federal Government must ensure that local governments are given \nthe resources to complete their task and that we share the \nresponsibilities for homeland security wisely and fairly. I know that \nDemocrats and Republicans alike agree with this. I know Secretary Ridge \nagrees with this. I know that President Bush agrees with this.\n  President Bush said on February 20 regarding the 2003 omnibus \nappropriations that he was concerned that the Congress had failed to \nprovide over $1 billion in funds for State and local law enforcement \nand emergency personnel. He went on to lament that the shortfall for \nhomeland security first responder programs was more than $2.2 billion.\n  For the record, I share President Bush's concern, but shortchanging \nour local law enforcement efforts by under funding the critical, \npopular and effective COPS program is not the answer. I take a line \nfrom Chief Taft of the Malvern Police Department put it best when he \nsaid: ``Doing away with the COPS Program, when we are so concerned with \nhomeland security is the wrong thing to do.'' I could not agree more.\n  Much is made of the word ``hero.'' Before September 11, to pick up a \nmagazine or to put on the television, hero was synonymous with \nprofessional athletes, movie stars, or musicians. But September 11 \nreminded us that real heroes are right in our own backyard. While \neveryone was rushing out of the World Trade Center, EMT, firefighters \nand police officers were rushing in. That is the definition of \n``hero.''\n  Local law enforcement officers protect our communities, our homes and \nour families from the threat of violent crime. Simply put, they stand \nup for justice. I believe we must do more to stand up for them. They \nneed funding to do their jobs properly and deliver the same quality \nservice that our citizens expect and deserve, whether they live in New \nYork City, or Des Arc, AR.\n  During the upcoming budget debate, I will support increasing funding \nfor the COPS program and other law enforcement programs. I would urge \nmy colleagues to do the same. I also plan to be a proud co-sponsor of \nSenator Joe Biden's legislation to reauthorize the COPS program.\n  We need to build on what we know works and develop initiatives that \nrespond to the law enforcement needs of our communities. The COPS \nprogram works and deserves adequate funding. These communities who \nbenefit from this program deserve it as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). The Senator \nfrom Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate the Senator from \nArkansas on what I believe is his first speech on the floor of the \nSenate since his election. It is a privilege to serve with him, the \nSenator from South Carolina, and the Senator from New Hampshire in the \nnew class of Senators in the 108th Congress.\n  It is appropriate that the Senator would choose for his subject law \nenforcement because of his distinguished career as the chief law \nenforcement officer of Arkansas and having had members of the law \nenforcement community in his family for many years. He comes to the \nfloor with a record of distinguished service from a distinguished \nfamily whose father is a close friend of many who have served in the \nSenate with distinction for many years.\n  My colleagues and I congratulate him on his first speech. We look \nforward to many years of service with him.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nTennessee for his kind words and express to him once again, as I have \ndone privately and personally, I look forward to working with him on \nthe issues that are so important to him, whether they be education or \nwhatever they may be. It is an honor to serve with him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/27/senate-section/article/S2983-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2983-S2984]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate\n\n[[Page S2984]]\n\ncrimes legislation. In the last Congress Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred July 6, 2001 \nin Grand Junction, CO. Eric Valdez, 19, was stabbed to death by Sjon \nElmgreen, 19, after leaving a grocery store. The incident began when \nElmgreen's fiancee called him to say that two Hispanic teens had just \nbeen flirting with her at the grocery store. She later told police that \nthe teens had not been rude or threatening in the store. Nonetheless, \nElmgreen and his roommate walked from their home to confront the teens. \nElmgreen's fiancee told police that the confrontation turned into a \nfist fight, during which Elmgreen yelled racial epithets. After the \nfight, Elmgreen stabbed Valdez.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/27/senate-section/article/S2984-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2984-S2987]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              DISCHARGE OF GAY LINGUISTS FROM THE MILITARY\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I wish to speak on the military's recent \ndischarge of several linguists who are critically needed in our \nNation's fight against terrorism but who, in the military's eyes, are \nunfit for the job because of their sexual orientation. The military's \ntreatment of these individuals is not only a grave injustice to these \ntalented men and women who have bravely volunteered to defend our \nNation, but it poses a serious threat to our Nation's preparedness.\n  After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, our Nation's \nsecurity agencies and all branches of the military recognized that they \nmust increase the recruitment and training of linguists who can speak \nand interpret languages such as Arabic, Farsi, Korean, Mandarin \nChinese, and Russian. Understanding these languages is critical to \nensuring our Nation's security. Those who are able to communicate in \nthese languages can translate communications that may be made by \nterrorists or others intent on doing us harm. In fact, a large portion \nof the intelligence information retrieved by the U.S. security agencies \ncurrently cannot be translated, hindering the ability of the Federal \nGovernment to protect our country.\n  According to a study released by the U.S. General Accounting Office \nin January 2002, the Army is facing a serious shortfall of linguists in \nfive of the six languages it categorizes as most critical--Arabic, \nKorean, Mandarin Chinese, Farsi, and Russian. The Army has met only 50 \npercent of its need for linguists who speak Arabic, 63 percent of its \nneed for Korean speakers, 62 percent of its need for Mandarin Chinese \nspeakers, 32 percent of its need for Farsi speakers, and 63 percent of \nits need for Russian speakers. This leads to a 44 percent total \nshortfall in translators and interpreters for 5 of the 6 critical \nlanguages. Furthermore, the Army only has 75 percent of the cryptology \nlinguists needed who speak Korean and Mandarin Chinese, and has a 13 \npercent shortfall of Army Human Intelligence Collectors in five of the \nlanguages found to be of critical importance. Spanish is the only \nlanguage for which the Army has met its linguist needs.\n  Although the military faces a crisis in the linguistics field, \nlinguists with a high level of proficiency in languages determined \ncritical by the military and security agencies have continued to be \ndischarged from the Armed Forces simply because they are gay, lesbian, \nor bisexual.\n  In 1993, the military instituted a plan known as ``Don't Ask, Don't \nTell, Don't Pursue, Don't Harass,'' known more commonly as the ``Don't \nAsk, Don't Tell'' policy. The basic premise of the ``Don't Ask, Don't \nTell'' policy is that, while military leaders know that gays, lesbians, \nand bisexuals have always played an important part in America's \nmilitary, homosexual members of the military are not allowed to be \nasked about or to tell anyone about their sexual orientation. \nFurthermore, the Department of Defense generally cannot conduct \ninvestigations regarding the sexual orientation of service members, and \nthe Armed Forces has a policy that does not tolerate harassment of \nanyone based on perceived or actual homosexuality.\n  The ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' policy has been, by most accounts, a \nfailure. Homosexual military personnel continue to be harassed within \nall the branches of the Armed Forces. In fact, according to the \nServicemembers Legal Defense Network, SDLN, an advocacy organization \ndedicated to aiding gay, lesbian, and bisexual service members who face \ndiscrimination in the armed services, in 2001 the armed services fired \nmore than 1,250 gay, lesbian, and bisexual Americans B more than any \nother year since 1987. Furthermore, since the initiation of the ``Don't \nAsk, Don't Tell'' policy, more than 7,800 American service members have \nlost their jobs because of anti-gay sentiment.\n  Not only does the ``Don't Ask Don't Tell'' policy needlessly \ndiscriminate against courageous Americans, it also wastes millions in \ntaxpayer dollars. For example, according to SLDN, the government spent \n$36 million to replace gays, lesbians, and bisexuals who were \ndischarged from the military in 2001. Even more staggering is the fact \nthat the government has spent over $234 million to train replacements \nfor homosexual service members since the ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' \npolicy was enacted in 1993. Thus, instead of using those millions of \ndollars on fighting terrorism, the military is spending it to replace \nlinguists that they already have in their ranks.\n  Not only does the ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' policy waste time, money \nand linguistic skill, it also initiates discrimination against those \nwho simply want to serve their country. One of these Americans is \nAlastair Gamble. He had been in training in Arabic for only a few \nmonths at the Defense Language Institute when the terrorist attacks of \nSeptember 11 occurred. After the attacks, he decided that his skills \nwere needed more than ever. He continued his studies and soon was able \nto converse about military operations, economics, and politics in \nArabic. He, however, would not be able to serve his country. Why? \nBecause he was caught one night in his partner's room after hours. \nThough Gamble admits that he broke the military's policy, he states \nthat many heterosexual couples also broke this same rule on that same \nnight. The heterosexual couples, however, were only reprimanded. In \nstark contrast, Gamble's infraction led to a search of his room where \nmilitary officials found evidence that led to the discovery of a \nrelationship with another officer who was studying Korean at the time. \nSoon both Gamble and his partner were dismissed from the Army, and the \nAmerican people were denied the service of two young men who were \nlearning badly needed language skills.\n  Gamble and his partner are not alone. From October 2001 through \nDecember 2002, seven other linguists specializing in critical languages \nwere also discharged after telling superiors that they were gay.\n  Gamble and the eight other linguists should not be treated this way. \nIt is past time for the U.S. military to modernize its attitudes toward \nsoldiers' sexual orientation. It is time for the U.S. military to \nrecognize the contributions of gay, lesbian, and bisexual military \nofficers and enlisted personnel by allowing them to serve in the Armed \nForces without fear and prejudice. Currently, security organizations \nwithin the United States allow for open service--most notably, the \nCentral Intelligence Agency and the National Security Agency. These \nopenly gay men and women serve our country well. In fact, they \nsometimes serve along-side military men and women who cannot discuss \ntheir sexual orientation.\n  Not only do United States intelligence agencies allow for open \nservice, but many other nations allow open service as well. Some of our \nclosest allies--Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Australia, the \nCzech Republic, Sweden, Canada, Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain, \nDenmark, Norway, Luxembourg, Iceland and Italy--allow open service in \ntheir military. In fact, the United States and Turkey are the only two \nNATO countries that do not allow open military service for gay men.\n\n[[Page S2985]]\n\n  Nations that allow for open military service have not reported any \nchange in the way the military is run because of their policies. \nAccording to a study by Aaron Belkin, the Director of the Center for \nthe Study of Sexual Minorities at the University of California, Santa \nBarbara, and Jason McNichol, senior officials, commanders, and military \nscholars within the Australian Defense Forces consistently praise the \nlifting of the gay ban, which occurred in 1992. The report states that \nthere has been no overall pattern of disruption to the military, \nrecruitment and retention have not suffered, and military performance \nwas not affected because of the ban.\n  In January 2000, Britain too lifted its ban on gays in the military. \nAccording to PlanetOut News, a review of the policy by the British \nmilitary, released in late 2000, found that there was no discernable \nimpact on the military after it lifted the ban.\n  If some of our closest allies have been successful in allowing open \nservice in the military, why not the United States?\n  Our military has been fighting terrorism and may soon go to war \nagainst Iraq. We desperately need the specialized language skills of \nour fellow Americans as resources. Our military should cease the \ndiscriminatory and counter-productive policy of discharging competent \nmilitary personnel simply because of their sexual orientation. I hope \nthat this administration will consider the consequences of the decision \nto discharge the linguists I have spoken about today and will give gay, \nlesbian, and bisexual Americans the chance to serve openly in the \nUnited States military.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to contribute to the public \ndiscourse and national debate we are witnessing with regard to a \npotential conflict--if diplomacy fails--with Saddam Hussein's brutal \nregime in Iraq. All of our offices have been inundated with calls, e-\nmails, and letters from concerned constituents about the consequences \nof war with Iraq. It is a timely debate of utmost gravity and \nimportance. It is the essence of our democracy.\n  I, for one, have been supportive of our President's policies and \nintentions with regard to Iraq. I am firmly convinced that--should our \nefforts at the United Nations fail to convince Saddam Hussein to \ndisarm--we must decisively end the menace that he represents to the \nworld and to his own people. He has tyrannized his nation, the region \nand, indeed, the entire world for over two decades. I am proud that our \nPresident has shown the courage to bring this present and growing \ndanger to the world's attention. It is not easy to muster the courage, \nin the face of widespread apprehension, to confront the truly evil \nelements of our global community. It is easier and more popular to \nprocrastinate and defer decisions.\n  Our President is a man of principle however, who will not shrink from \nthe dangers that threaten our Nation. He has carefully laid out a case \nagainst Saddam Hussein and has brought to the attention of the world \nthe terrible threat this man and his regime represent to our national \nand global security. I am proud to stand with him and with my \ncolleagues who have given the President the authority he needs to \neffectively confront Saddam Hussein, with military force, if necessary.\n  This morning's Washington Post contained a thoughtful editorial on \nthis important subject: ``Drumbeat on Iraq? A Response to Readers.'' It \nis an editorial that captures, in a balanced manner, the essence of the \ndebate and is, in fact, responsive to the diverse readership of the \nPost.\n  I commend this editorial to my colleagues and my constituents. I \nfurther thank the Washington Post for this thoughtful contribution to \nthe national debate on this subject. The prospect of conflict is never \na pleasant option. The consequences of inaction in this case are \nunacceptable. Our President has enhanced the security and safety of our \nNation by forcefully confronting those who would bring harm to our \nshores. We can no longer stand idly by. In the case of Saddam Hussein, \nI fully agree with the conclusion of this Washington Post editorial \nthat, ``. . . a long term peace will be better served by strength than \nby concessions.'' We must find the strength, as a nation--hopefully as \nan international community--to act if this last chance for diplomacy \nfails.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the editorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 27, 2003]\n\n              ``Drumbeat'' On Iraq? A Response To Readers\n\n       ``I have been a faithful reader of the Washington Post for \n     almost 10 years,'' a recent e-mail to this page begins, \n     ``Recently, however, I have grown tired of your bias and \n     endless drumbeating for war in Iraq.'' He's not the only one. \n     The national and international debate over Saddam Hussein's \n     weapons of mass destruction, and our editorials in favor of \n     disarming the dictator, have prompted a torrent of letters, \n     many approving and many critical. They are for the most part \n     thoughtful and serious; the antiwar letters in particular are \n     often angry and anguished as well. ``It is truly depressing \n     to witness the depths Washington Post editors have reached in \n     their jingoistic rush to war,'' another reader writes. It's a \n     serious charge, and it deserves a serious response.\n       That answer, given the reference to ``Washington Post \n     editors,'' probably needs to begin with a restatement of the \n     separation at The Post news and editorial opinion functions. \n     Those of us who write editorials have no influence over \n     editors and reporters who cover the news and who are \n     committed to offering the wariest and most complete \n     journalism possible about the standoff with Iraq. They in \n     turn have no influence over us.\n       For our part, we might begin with that phrase ``rush to \n     war.'' In fact there is nothing sudden or precipitous about \n     our view that Saddam Hussein poses a grave danger. In 1990 \n     and 1991 we supported many months of diplomacy and pressure \n     to persuade the Iraqi dictator to withdraw his troops from \n     Kuwait, the neighboring country he had invaded. When he \n     failed to do so, we supported the use of force to restore \n     Kuwait's independence. While many of the same Democrats who \n     oppose force now opposed it then also, we believe war was the \n     correct option--though it was certainly not, at the time, the \n     only choice. When the war ended, we supported--in hindsight \n     too unquestiongly--a cease-fire agreement that left Saddam \n     Hussein in power. But it was an agreement, imposed by the \n     U.N. Security Council, that demanded that he give up his \n     dangerous weapons.\n       In 1997 and 1998, we strongly backed President Clinton when \n     he vowed that Iraq must finally honor its commitments to the \n     United Nations to give up its nuclear, biological and \n     chemical weapons--and we strongly criticized him when he \n     retreated from those vows. Mr. Clinton understood the stakes. \n     Iraq, he said, was a ``rogue state with weapons of mass \n     destruction, ready to use them or provide them to terrorists, \n     drug traffickers or organized criminals who travel the world \n     among us unnoticed.''\n       When we cite Mr. Clinton's perceptive but ultimately empty \n     comments, it is in part to chide him and other Democrats who \n     take a different view now that a Republic is in charge. But \n     it has a more serious purpose too. Mr. Clinton could not \n     muster the will, or the domestic or international support, to \n     force Saddam Hussein to live up to the promises he had made \n     in 1991, though even then the danger was well understood. \n     Republicans who now line up behind President Bush were in \n     many cases particularly irresponsible; when Mr. Clinton did \n     bomb Iraqi weapons sites in 1998, some GOP leaders accused \n     him of seeking only to distract the nation from his \n     impeachment worries. Through the end of Mr. Clinton's tenure \n     and the first year of Mr. Bush's presidency, Saddam Hussein \n     built up his power, beat back sanctions and found new space \n     to rearm--all with the support of France and Russia and the \n     acquiescence of the United States.\n       After Sept. 11, 2001, many people of both parties said--and \n     we certainly hoped--that the country had moved beyond such \n     failures of will and politicization of deadly foreign \n     threats. An outlaw dictator, in open definance of U.N. \n     resolutions, unquestionably possessing and pursuing \n     biological and chemical weapons, expressing support for \n     the Sept. 11 attacks: Surely the nation would no longer \n     dither in the face of such a menace. Now it seems again an \n     open question. To us, risks that were clear before seem \n     even clearer now.\n       But what of our ``jingoism,'' our ``drumbeating''? Probably \n     no editorial page sin could be more grievous than whipping up \n     war fever for some political or trivial purpose. And we do \n     not take lightly the risks of war--to American and Iraqi \n     soldiers and civilians first of all. We believe that the Bush \n     administration has only begun to prepare the public for the \n     sacrifices that the nation and many young Americans might \n     bear during and after a war. And there is a long list of \n     terrible things that could go wrong: anthrax dispersed, \n     moderate regimes imperiled, Islamist recruiting spurred, oil \n     wells set afire.\n       The right question though, is not ``Is war risky?'' but \n     ``Is inaction less so?'' No one can provide more than a \n     judgment in reply. But the world is already a dangerous \n     place. Anthrax has been wielded in Florida, New York and \n     Washington. Terrorists have struck repeatedly and with \n     increasing strength over the past decade. Are the United \n     States and\n\n[[Page S2986]]\n\n     its allies ultimately safer if they back down again and leave \n     Saddam Hussein secure? Or does safety lie in making clear \n     that his kind of outlaw behavior will not be tolerated and in \n     helping Iraq become a peaceable nation that offers no haven \n     to terrorists? We would say the latter, while acknowledging \n     the magnitude of the challenge, both during and especially \n     after any war that may have to be fought. And we would say \n     also that not only terrible things are possible: To free the \n     Iraqi people from the sadistic repression of Saddam Hussein, \n     while not the primary goal of a war, would surely be a \n     blessing.\n       Nor is it useful merely to repeat that war ``should only be \n     a last resort,'' as the latest French-German-Russian \n     resolution states, or that, as French President Jacques \n     Chirac said Monday, Iraq must disarm ``because it represents \n     a danger for the region and maybe the world . . . but we \n     believe this disarmament must happen peacefully.'' Like \n     everyone else, we hope it does happen peacefully. But if it \n     does not--if Saddam Hussein refuses as he has for a dozen \n     years--should that refusal be accommodated?\n       War in fact has rarely been the last resort for the United \n     States. In very recent times, the nation could have allowed \n     Saddam Hussein to swallow Kuwait. It could have allowed \n     Slobodan Milosevic to expel 1 million refugees from Kosovo. \n     In each case, the nation and its allies fought wars of \n     choice. Even the 2001 campaign against Afghanistan was not a \n     ``last resort,'' though it is now remembered as an inevitable \n     war of self-defense. Many Americans argued that the Taliban \n     had not attacked the United States and should not be \n     attacked; that what was needed was police action against \n     Osama bin Laden. We believed they were wrong and Mr. Bush was \n     right, though he will be vindicated in history only if the \n     United States and its allies stay focused on Afghanistan and \n     its reconstruction.\n       So the real questions are whether every meaningful \n     alternative has been exhausted, and if so whether war is wise \n     as well as justified. The risks should not be minimized. \n     Everyone agrees, for example, that the United States would be \n     stronger before and during a war if joined by many allies, \n     and even better positioned if backed by the United Nations. \n     If waiting a month, or three months, would ensure such \n     backing, the wait would be worthwhile.\n       But the history is not encouraging. The Security Council \n     agreed unanimously in early November that Iraq was a danger; \n     that inspectors could do no more than verify a voluntary \n     disarmament; and that a failure to disarm would be considered \n     a ``material breach.'' Now all agree that Saddam Hussein has \n     not cooperated, and yet some countries balk at the \n     consequences--as they have, time and again, since 1991. We \n     have seen no evidence that an additional three months would \n     be helpful. Nor does it strike us as serious to argue that \n     the war should be fought if Mr. Chirac and German Chancellor \n     Gerhard Schroeder agree, but not if they do not. If the war \n     is that optional, it should not be fought, even if those \n     leaders do agree; if it is essential to U.S. national \n     security, their objections ultimately cannot be \n     dispositive.\n       In 1998 Mr. Clinton explained to the nation why U.S. \n     national security was, in fact, in danger. ``What if he fails \n     to comply and we fail to act, or we take some ambiguous third \n     route, which gives him yet more opportunities to develop this \n     program of weapons of mass destruction? . . . Well, he will \n     conclude that the international community has lost its will. \n     He will then conclude that he can go right on and do more to \n     rebuild an arsenal of devastating destruction. And some day, \n     some way, I guarantee you he'll use the arsenal.''\n       Some argue now that, because Saddam Hussein has not in the \n     intervening half-decade used his arsenal, Mr. Clinton was \n     wrong and the world can rest assured that Iraq is adequately \n     ``contained.'' Given what we know about how containment \n     erodes over time; about Saddam Hussein's single-mindedness \n     compared with the inattention and divisions of other nations; \n     and about the ease with which deadly weapons can move across \n     borders, we do not trust such an assurance. Mr. Clinton \n     understood, as Mr. Bush understands, that no president can \n     bet his nation's safety on the hope that Iraq is \n     ``contained.'' We respect our readers who believe that war is \n     the worst option. But we believe that, in this case, long-\n     term peace will be better served by strength than by \n     concessions.\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, for thousands of mothers across the \nU.S., having a child is a momentous occasion filled with happiness and \nexcitement. However, for a smaller percentage of women, childbirth \nbrings about feelings of sadness, fear, and anxiety so overwhelming \nthat they can no longer function normally. Postpartum depression, a \nmood disorder that is the culprit of these sentiments, severely affects \nthe mental health of new mothers and places a strain on families. This \nis why I am proud to join my colleagues, Senator Durbin and Senator \nFitzgerald, in introducing the ``Melanie Stokes Postpartum Depression \nResearch and Care Act.''\n  I firmly believe that postpartum depression is a national problem; it \nstrikes women regardless of age, race, or economic status. Nearly 80 \npercent of new mothers experience baby blues, a very common, mild form \nof depression occurring in the first days or weeks after birth, but 10 \nto 20 percent suffer from the more severe postpartum depression. This \nis accompanied by irritability, despair, and anger, which can continue \nwithout treatment. The most acute form of depression, postpartum \npsychosis, can be accompanied by anxiety and fear, but also delusions \nand hallucinations. It strikes 1 in 1000 women. These two forms of \npostpartum depression contribute to a mother's sense of worth, inhibits \na women's ability to complete her every day activities or enjoy the \nprecious new moments with her child.\n  Despite these serious effects, there is alarmingly little research on \npostpartum depression. Additionally, while drops in hormone levels such \nas progesterone and estrogen have been linked to postpartum mood \nswings, there is no definite known cause for this disorder. This bill \nseeks to fill a glaring void in the understanding of this illness and \nprovide treatment and care options for new moms. It establishes \nresearch programs to explore the causes, prevention, and prevalence of \npostpartum depression and psychosis. I also believe that women need \nreal support in terms of comprehensive services at the community level. \nThis legislation provides grants to help moms manage postpartum \nconditions at hospitals, community health centers, and shelters so they \ncan access home based care, screening services, and other comprehensive \ntreatments.\n  Motherhood should be a blessing, not a nightmare. Organizations and \nhealth professionals all urge families and friends to inundate at risk \nor new moms with support as she takes on the complex task of raising a \nchild. This bill is our way of supporting these moms. We hope to \nprovide research results and necessary help to ensure a brighter future \nfor new mothers caught in the fearful grip of postpartum depression. I \nwill continue to support efforts to diminish the anguish of postpartum \ndepression and improve efforts to safeguard the mental well-being for \nnew mothers.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, last night I introduced the ``State \nCriminal Alien Assistance Program Reauthorization Act of 2003,'' \nbipartisan legislation to authorize funds to relieve State and county \ngovernments of the some of the fiscal burdens associated with the \nincarceration of undocumented criminal aliens.\n  I am pleased that Senators McCain, Kyl, Schumer, Boxer, Hutchison, \nBingaman and Domenici have joined me in introducing this important \nmeasure.\n  The broad principle on which this bill is based is simple: the \ncontrol of illegal immigration is a Federal responsibility. When the \nFederal Government falls short in its efforts to control illegal \nimmigration, it must bear the responsibility for the financial and \nhuman consequences of this failure.\n  More and more, however, the fiscal consequences of illegal \nimmigration are being borne by the States and local counties.\n  The State Criminal Alien Assistant Program, SCAAP, Reauthorization \nAct of 2003 would properly vest the fiscal burden of incarcerating \nillegal immigrants, who are convicted of felonies or multiple \nmisdemeanors, with the Federal Government.\n  The legislation would do so by authorizing up to $750 million in \nFiscal Year 2004 for Federal reimbursement to the States and county \ngovernments for the direct costs associated with incarcerating \nundocumented criminal aliens. It would authorize an additional $850 \nmillion in Fiscal Year 2005, and $950 million for the program in Fiscal \nYears 2006 through 2010.\n  The number of State and local governments seeking SCAAP funding has \njumped 25 percent from the previous year. The combination of the \nincrease, and the fact that all 50 States and the District of Columbia \nreceive some funding from the program, suggests that no State is immune \nfrom the fiscal costs associated with crimes committed by illegal \naliens.\n  Therefore, I urge all of my colleagues to work with me to not only \nensure that the SCAAP program survives, but also that it is adequately \nfunded.\n  At a time when the administration is asking State and local \ngovernments to do even more with their local funds to enforce the \nnation's immigration laws, it is at the same time recommending the \nelimination of a vital source of funding that already falls far short \nof what states spend to incarcerate criminal illegal aliens.\n\n[[Page S2987]]\n\n  High impact States, like California, continue to shoulder \nextraordinary costs for housing illegal aliens in its criminal justice \nsystem. The State prisons had an estimated 22,565 criminal aliens it \nits system out of a total population of 160,728.\n  In just a 3-month period last year, the State's county jails housed \njust under 10,000 criminal aliens. Overall, California taxpayers paid \nmore than $2.28 billion in 2001 to cover these costs.\n  In 2002, California received a SCAAP payment of $220 million--less \nthan 10 percent of the total costs to the State. This year, California \ntaxpayers can expect to spend even more.\n  The SCAAP reauthorization bill would help California and all other \nStates that are experiencing increasing costs from incarcerating \nundocumented felons--both low-impact and high-impact states.\n  Last year, the State of Wisconsin and its counties, for example, \nreceived more than $3.5 million in funding; Massachusetts received over \n$13 million; Pennsylvania received lose over $2.6 million; Virginia \nreceived more than $6.4 million; North Carolina received $5.2 million; \nMichigan received $2.9 million; Minnesota received $1.8 million.\n  Thus, even states that have not traditionally had to confront the \ngrowth in illegal immigration are now bearing the costs of this Federal \nresponsibility.\n  The administration's opposition to this program is puzzling.\n  I am particularly disappointed that an Administration headed by a \nformer governor of a State highly impacted by the Federal Government's \ninability to control illegal immigration, would recommend the \nelimination of this important program.\n  Who pays when these costs go uncovered?\n  In California, the burden will fall on our law enforcement agencies--\nincluding sheriffs, officers on the beat, anti-gang violence units, \ndistrict attorneys offices. At a time when the nation is focused on \nenhancing security within our borders, within our States and within our \nlocal communities, a vital program like SCAAP should not be vulnerable \nto being short-changed or eliminated.\n  I note that when the current president was governor of Texas, he was \na strong supporter of Federal funding for SCAAP he, too, recognized \nthat controlling illegal immigration was a federal responsibility and \nthat States cannot and should not be expected to handle the national \nburden on their own.\n  Certainly, the problems that were faced by Texas then with respect to \nthe incarceration of criminal aliens have grown since then-Governor \nBush wrote that letter. In 1997, the year in which the letter was \nwritten, the State of Texas incurred more than $129 million in \nincarceration costs. In fiscal year 2002, those costs soared to more \nthan $1.17 billion.\n  It is inexplicable to me that this administration would now call for \nthe elimination for the program. I will include the letter then-\nGovernor Bush wrote to Representative Hal Rogers, chairman of the House \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State, the Judiciary \nand Related Agencies, for the Record.\n  After years of strongly supporting funding for the SCAAP program, \nPresident Bush's recent opposition to the program prompted Congress to \ncut the program by 56 percent this year, from $565 million to $250 \nmillion.\n  I urge my colleagues to reverse that course in Fiscal Year 2004 and \nconsider restoring the cuts that were made when Congress considers the \nFY2003 supplemental appropriations request the administration is likely \nto submit in the next several weeks.\n  I thank my colleagues who joined me yesterday for their tireless \nefforts in ensuring that States and local counties receive some \ncompensation for they do their part in securing their communities from \ncriminal aliens who are in the country illegally.\n  I join them in introducing the SCAAP reauthorization legislation in \nhopes that it will go further to alleviate some of the fiscal hardships \nStates and local governments incur when they must take on this Federal \nresponsibility.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the letter to which I referred in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                    State of Texas\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                                    July 10, 1997.\n     Hon. Hal Rogers,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State, the \n         Judiciary and Related Agencies, Committee on \n         Appropriations, Washington, D.C. 20515.\n       Dear Chairman Rogers: The cost of processing and housing \n     criminal aliens in our state criminal justice system \n     continues to grow. I am writing to ask you to support funding \n     the $650 million authorization to reimburse state and local \n     governments for the costs of incarcerating undocumented \n     criminal aliens. We are thankful for Congress' recognition of \n     this problem in Texas and appreciate the funding we have \n     already received.\n       The Immigration and Naturalization Service estimates that \n     Texas incarcerates more than 8,000 undocumented aliens each \n     year. At this current rate of incarceration, the annual cost \n     to Texas exceeds $129 million. During fiscal year 1996, Texas \n     received $51.9 million in reimbursement under the State \n     Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP). Any additional \n     funds dedicated to assist Texas in recapturing the costs of \n     housing these criminal aliens would be greatly appreciated.\n       Thank you for your time and attention to this matter of \n     importance to Texas. I will appreciate any action you can \n     take on this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   George W.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Victor \nBaird, who is retiring from his position as acting staff director and \nchief counsel to the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Ethics after more \nthan 15 years of service.\n  For the last 2 years, I have had the privilege to serve on the U.S. \nSenate Select Committee on Ethics, an assignment that has provided me \nvaluable insights into the workings and the ethical guidelines of this \nbody. When I joined the committee, I was a relatively junior member, \nhaving served only 2 years in the Senate. I consider myself extremely \nfortunate that during this time, I have been able to draw on the wisdom \nand expertise of Victor Baird.\n  Following a distinguished legal career in Georgia, Victor came to \nWashington in 1987 to serve as counsel to the Ethics Committee. Over \nthe ensuing 15 years, Victor has brought to the committee a sense of \nnonpartisan balance, careful legal judgment, historical perspective, \nand good humor--a collection of qualities that have served the \ncommittee well during some challenging times. His advice to committee \nmembers and his leadership of the committee staff have been invaluable \nduring the last 15 years, and we owe him a debt of gratitude for his \nservice.\n  I should note that, although the committee is losing a valuable asset \nin Victor Baird, we are fortunate in the choice of his successor--Rob \nWalker. Mr. Walker has served the past 4 years as chief counsel and \nstaff director of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on \nStandards of Official Conduct. But prior to that, he served as counsel \nto the Senate Ethics Committee, where he worked closely with Victor \nBaird. The Senate Ethics Committee is fortunate to have Rob back. I \nlook forward to working with him, as I am sure that he will continue \nthe tradition of fairness and excellence that his predecessor has \nestablished.\n  So as we say goodbye to Victor Baird, let's also thank him for his \nsteady and dependable service in the committee for these last 15 years, \nand let's wish him well in his ventures in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/27/senate-section/article/S2987-2", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2987-S2989]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                WAR ON TERROR AND HUMAN RIGHTS IN CHINA\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, attention is understandably on Iraq this \nweek as we move ever closer to a decision on use of military force \nthere to disarm the regime of Saddam Hussein. But as we contemplate \nwhether such action makes sense in terms of protecting our people from \nthe threat of global terrorism, it is important that we not lose sight \nof important developments in other parts of the world.\n  Earlier this week, Secretary of State Powell visited Beijing, \nreportedly to seek the support of China's leaders in dealing with Iraq \nand North Korea. This makes sense, since China has the power to veto \nany U.N. resolution on Iraq and is reputed to have influence\n\n[[Page S2988]]\n\nwith Kim Jong-Il. Our relations with China have warmed since September \n11, as its support was deemed important to the success of the ``war on \nterrorism,'' both in Afghanistan and beyond. Unfortunately, China's \nleaders appear to have a very different agenda for this war. As the \nChinese would say, we are sleeping in the same bed but having different \ndreams.\n  Earlier this month, Wang Bingzhang, a Chinese democracy activist who \nhas lived most of the past 20 years in New York as a U.S. legal \npermanent resident, was sentenced to life in prison following a secret \ntrial on charges of espionage and ``leading a violent terrorist \norganization.'' Chinese authorities had had him in custody, unbeknownst \nto his family, since last July, when he was apparently abducted while \nvisiting Vietnam and brought across the border into China. The Chinese \nauthorities have presented no public evidence linking Wang to any \nviolent activities. Since being exiled to Canada in 1979, however, he \nhas advocated peaceful democratic change in China, founding the \nmagazine China Spring in New York in 1982 and serving as an adviser to \nthe outlawed China Democracy Party. He sneaked across the border into \nChina in 1998, when the China Democracy Party was attempting to \norganize and register itself within the boundaries of Chinese law, and \nwas detained and deported. The Chinese Communists clearly see him as a \nnuisance, and the ``war on terrorism'' provided a convenient excuse to \nsilence him.\n  Last month, Chinese authorities executed a former Tibetan monk, \nLobsang Dhondrup, who was accused of carrying out a series of bombings \nin Sichuan Province. Lobsang was detained near the scene of one of the \nbombings last April. But the only evidence made public against him was \nhis confession, which was very likely extracted through torture. He was \nkilled immediately after the Intermediate Court for the Ganzi Tibetan \nPrefecture upheld his death sentence. The same day, the Sichuan \nProvincial High Court in Chengdu rejected the appeal of Tenzin Delek \nRipoche, a senior Tibetan Buddhist monk and social and environmental \nactivist, and reaffirmed his suspended death sentence in connection \nwith the same case. Chinese authorities have provided no public \nevidence linking Tenzin to the bombings, according to Human Rights \nWatch.\n  A third man, Tsereng Dhondrup, was given 5 years for merely \ncirculating petitions in defense of Lobsang and Tenzin. Authorities are \nthought to be holding 10 other ethnic Tibetans in connection with the \nbombings but will not release their names or locations.\n  Mr. President, I do not dispute for a moment that Chinese authorities \nhave the right--indeed the duty--to take firm measures against \nterrorism within their borders, just as we are doing here. The bombings \nin Sichuan, which took innocent life, were without question terrorist \nacts, as were the bombings this week on Beijing university campuses, \nand they should be condemned. The imperative to combat terrorism does \nnot absolve any nation, however, of its obligation to respect basic \nhuman rights, including the right to due process. Whether Lobsang was \ninvolved in the bombings in Sichuan we may never know. But Assistant \nSecretary of State Lorne Craner has expressed ``deep concern'' as to \nwhether Lobsong received a fair trial, according to the Washington \nPost. Neither Lobsang nor Tenzin was allowed to choose his own defense \nattorney. Tenzin was held incommunicado for 8 months, up to the day of \nhis trial, and appeal hearings were closed to the public on the grounds \nthat ``state secrets'' were involved.\n  These cases illustrate a deeply cynical misappropriation of the anti-\nterrorist struggle by a repressive regime to suppress legitimate \ndissent, persecute restive minority groups, and literally get away with \nmurder. Administration officials maintain that, while seeking China's \ncooperation in combatting international terrorism, they have at the \nsame time made clear that China should not interpret that as a license \nto violate basic human rights. But violate them they have, and \napparently with increasing frequency.\n  In the Northeast Chinese Rustbelt city Liaoyang, two labor leaders--\nYao Fuxin and Xiao Yunliang--are awaiting sentencing following their \nJanuary 15 trial for ``inciting the subversion of the political \nauthority of the state.'' The prosecution said they conspired to \n``overthrow the socialist system.'' In fact, what they did was organize \nprotest marches last spring for workers laid off from a state-owned \nplant that went bankrupt in 2001, owing them several months of back \nwages, as well as pension and other benefits and severance allowances. \nWorkers suspected the plant's management had embezzled funds that \nshould have been used to pay those benefits. The authorities declared \nthe protests illegal and arrested Yao, Xiao, and two other organizers.\n  According to labor activists in Hong Kong who have been monitoring \nthe case, Yao and Xiao were held for several months without formal \ncharges and were denied access to their lawyer on the grounds that the \ncase involved ``state secrets.'' The initial indication was that they \nhad been arrested for illegal assembly. But when the workers of \nLiaoyang continued to rally behind their leaders and the case attracted \ninternational attention, Chinese authorities asserted that the men had \ncarried out ``destructive activities,'' including car-bombings and \ndestroying public property.\n\n  This was something not even the Liaoyang police and prosecutors had \nalleged. Even the local representative of the official Communist Party \nlabor organization called the allegations ``a complete fabrication.'' \nNonetheless, when formal charges were finally announced against the men \nlast month, they were charged not just with illegal assembly but with \nthe much more serious offense of subversion. At their four-hour trial \nJanuary 15, the prosecution made no attempt to tie Yao and Xiao to any \nviolent activities. Instead, they argued, Yao and Xiao had subverted \nthe authority of the Chinese state by attending preparatory meetings of \nthe then not-yet-banned China Democracy Party back in 1998 and \ncommunicating with ``hostile foreign elements,'' such as Agence France \nPresse and the Wall Street Journal.\n  Here again, China's rulers have appropriated the language of \nantiterrorism to persecute people who have done nothing more than \nchallenge the authority of the Communist Party through peaceful means.\n  Meanwhile, throughout China, the brutal suppression of the Falungong \nspiritual movement, which President Jiang Zemin has branded an ``evil \ncult,'' continues. Charles Li, a U.S. citizen Falungong practitioner, \nis about to enter his sixth week of detention in Jiangsu Province, \nwhere he returned to spend Chinese New Year with his parents.\n  Authorities have not charged him, and he has been allowed only one \nhalf-hour meeting with U.S. consular officials. Initial reports \nindicated he was accused of hijacking television broadcasts to spread \nthe banned Falungong message. But his friends and associates maintain \nhe was not even in China when those incidents occurred. His actual sin \nappears to be having had the temerity to serve a subpoena on the Mayor \nof Beijing, when he visited San Francisco last year, under the Alien \nTort Claims Act and Torture Victim Protection Act, as was his right as \na U.S. citizen on U.S. territory under U.S. law.\n  Why is it that we are seeing so many egregious violations of basic \nhuman rights in China in such a short span of time? Could it be that \nthe senior leadership in Beijing knows that the world's attention is \ncurrently focused elsewhere? Could it be they think U.S. criticism of \ntheir actions will be muted, since the administration needs their \nsupport, or at least their acquiescence, on Iraq and North Korea? Or \ncould it be that President Jiang and his cohorts, who will step down \nnext month, want to clear the dockets so that Hu Jintao and the new \ncrew can begin with a clean slate? Remember that Jiang rode to power on \nthe tide of blood from Tiananmen Square, and he has snuffed out \nanything that even smelled of political reform ever since.\n  I hope China's incoming leaders, by virtue of their shared \ngenerational experience, will adopt a more enlightened view toward \npolitical modernization than their predecessors did. They are less \nlikely to do so if they infer that the rest of the world is not paying \nattention or doesn't care. We must keep the disinfectant of sunlight \nfocused on them, and anyone else who would deny people their basic \nfreedoms and\n\n[[Page S2989]]\n\ndignities in the name of ``stability,'' ``security'' or the ``war on \nterror.''\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/27/senate-section/article/S2989-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2989]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               DESIGNATING HUMAN GENOME MONTH AND DNA DAY\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM.
