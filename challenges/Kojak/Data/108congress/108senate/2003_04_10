Are we going to be able to work \non the budget before we leave here, either today or tomorrow? Members \nare concerned some will leave. This is the most important vote we have, \nit and the supplemental. We have a pretty good idea what is happening \nin the supplemental but less of an idea of what is happening on the \nbudget. Does the acting majority leader have any information for this \nside of the aisle?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I am not in a position to give any \ndefinitive answer to the Senator from Nevada. It is my understanding, \nhowever, that intense negotiations are going on with the chairman of \nthe Budget Committee and other Senators who have an interest about the \nconference report. It is my understanding that an agreement has been \nreached and that a conference report will, in fact, be available to be \nvoted on, if not late tonight, sometime tomorrow. But in the absence of \nany absolute word about that, I will simply put that in the category of \nrumors. They may be true rumors, but rumors nonetheless, that I can \npass on as my best understanding.\n  I will, as a courtesy to the Senator from Nevada, and to the Senate, \nask the majority leader to come forward with that information as \nquickly as it has been firmed up. But it is my expectation that there \nwill be resolution of the budget situation before we go out for recess.\n  Understand, again, that is my personal expectation. That is not an \nofficial statement on behalf of the majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/10/senate-section/article/S5103-7", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I want to open today by noting what \nwe saw live from Iraq yesterday starting in the midmorning. It was \ntruly uplifting to see what we hoped would be the end: The fall of \nSaddam Hussein, the cheering in the streets by the Iraqi people, the \nflowers for the American and British soldiers being thrown at the tanks \nby the Iraqi people.\n  We are admonished by the President and by the Pentagon that this is \nnot over. There are still areas--in fact, there was a firefight last \nnight that was unexpected. There was one yesterday at the University of \nBaghdad. So it is not over.\n  But we know the end is very near, and we know the people of Iraq now \nunderstand that they are going to have the taste of freedom.\n  You could see it in their faces. You could see it in the tears coming \ndown their cheeks. You could see it in the children reacting against \nthe statue of the fallen Saddam Hussein.\n  I think we are at the beginning of the end or at the end of the \nbeginning. We are seeing the light at the end of the tunnel, which is \nfreedom for the Iraqi people and doing away with the many weapons that \nhave been used in Iraq against its own people and that we feared would \nbe used against ours.\n  I open by saying thank you to the American troops, the young men and \nwomen on the ground, who have fought so valiantly to make this happen. \nI could not be more proud today, after seeing what is happening in \nBaghdad and the reaction of the people and the message left by the U.S. \ntroops on one of Saddam Hussein's palaces: ``USA was here.''\n  I hope in the days to come we will see more Iraqi people beginning to \nsee what it is to be able to form a government and take control of \ntheir own country; to start creating jobs again and an economy that \nwill allow them to have a democracy, free enterprise, and know what so \nmany of us have grown up with and appreciated.\n  I thank the troops this morning. I want to turn over the management \nof our time to the Senator from Minnesota for the rest of this morning. \nHe will also work with the Senator from Arkansas on the Democratic side \nto fill this time talking about the heroic and touching deeds that our \ntroops have been doing in the field.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Madam President, what a glorious day yesterday was. I am \nprivileged to follow my distinguished colleague from Texas who, as she \nreflects upon the joy that we all felt, expressed a real sense of pride \nin the incredible work done by our fighting men and women, knowing that \nmany of those who have lost their lives and those who have been \nprisoners of war came out of Texas bases.\n  For all of us there is always this mixed sense. We are filled with \njoy, pride and joy for the Iraqi people to be able to taste liberation \nand freedom in Iraq. But part of my tradition in the Jewish faith is \nthat at the time of a wedding ceremony--a glorious day--we wrap a glass \nin a cloth. Then, at the end of the service, at this moment of the \ngreatest of joy such as the great joy we experienced yesterday, the \ngroom steps on the glass and breaks it.\n  Part of the sense of tradition is, in this time of joy and \ncelebration, let us not forget that life has mixed blessings, and there \nare tragedies that have occurred and will occur. So as we celebrate the \nincredible joy of the liberation of Baghdad, let us not ever--and we \nwill not certainly in these hallowed Chambers, certainly not in this \ncountry--forget the sacrifices that have been made by those who have \ngiven their last ounce of courage and the sacrifice of their lives for \nthe freedom we witnessed yesterday.\n  Let us also understand that much work remains to be done. There will \nbe more death. We will suffer more casualties. The liberation of \nBaghdad is, as my distinguished colleague from Texas said, perhaps the \nbeginning of the end, but it is not the end.\n  While we eagerly anticipate the day when all of Iraq will be freed \nfrom Saddam's iron fist--and Tikrit, his enclave, is still not \nliberated, so there will be fighting ahead--it is important for us, in \nwhat we have done over the last few weeks, not to forget the sacrifice \nand bravery of the coalition forces still fighting to free northern \nIraq.\n  I note that many are special operations soldiers, such as the skilled \nand fearless unnamed Minnesota man who was profiled so powerfully in an \nedition of the Star Tribune. And being a Senator from Minnesota, \nobviously, I have great pride in this unnamed Minnesotan. It is a story \nof a Minnesota combat air controller who had already spent more than 30 \nhours on the ridge line, directing close bomb attacks, with little \nsleep.\n  In the briefings we get in the morning, just the other day we had one \nof those soldiers come in, one of those operatives who talked about the \n150 pounds of gear that they have, who talked about being on that line \nand directing in, with precision guidance, the airstrikes, to focus on \nthe target, to minimize any harm to civilians who are right there.\n  This story chronicled the efforts, the skill, and the courage of one \nman--one unnamed man--a Minnesotan, but it drove home the devastating \nprecision and prowess of our forces, a dramatic example of the \nremaining front line, of how the coalition has swept across Iraq in \nrecord time through the fearless teamwork and efforts of men such as \nthis.\n  I do not know whether, in the chronicles of warfare, any army has \nmoved so quickly and moved so decisively, moved so precisely, as have \nour troops in what they have accomplished in a few weeks in Iraq.\n  I cannot share the name and the family of this brave Minnesota \nsoldier at this time because the embedded reporter was not allowed to \nidentify him, other than to mention that the 34-year-old air controller \nhails from near Park Rapids, MN, and loves fishing and snowmobiling \nback home, as many of us Minnesotans love fishing and snowmobiling. But \nthe description of what this dedicated Minnesotan is doing so far from \nhome serves as an inspiring, yet sobering, reminder of the dangers and \nchallenges that still confront our forces.\n  A few passages from the story underscore the perilous conditions our \nSpecial Forces still operate under as they coordinate and choreograph \nthe pinpoint air attacks that will ultimately lead to complete \nsurrender, that will ultimately lead to the liberation of all of Iraq, \nthat will ultimately lead to more stability in the Middle East, that \nwill ultimately lead to a safer world for us here at home in America.\n  Let me talk a little about what is in that story:\n\n       Part cowboy, part choreographer, the Minnesotan stood in a \n     bunker rife with scorpions early Tuesday morning and searched \n     the sky. A U.S. fighter jet roared overhead for the third \n     time in less than a half-hour. His casual tone masked his \n     dangerous task of directing the aircraft to bomb Iraqi \n     Republican Guard positions just a few thousand meters \n     away.\n\n  The reporter continues:\n\n       As a combat air controller, he owned a 3-to-4 mile stretch \n     of horizon that is the leading edge of a northern front only \n     an hour from Baghdad--and moving closer.\n       If his team's position was not locked in by a pilot before \n     the start of a bombing run, the five American operatives and \n     three Kurdish reconnaissance scouts risked being the victims \n     of friendly fire.\n       Their mission this night was to pound Hill 323, an 800-foot \n     mound amid rolling hills where reinforced concrete bunkers \n     protected Republican Guard troops and supplies.\n\n  The story goes on to vividly detail the rest of the operation, the \nextraordinary coordination between pilots providing air support and the \nSpecial Forces on the ground.\n  The unnamed Minnesotan is using the finest battlefield technology \never developed--infrared lasers that allow pilots to lock on to the \nposition of friendly troops and target the location of enemy forces to \na devastating and precise effect.\n  But that mission and unnamed Minnesotan also exhibited another \nremarkable trait that has been displayed to the entire world throughout \nthis campaign; namely, patience and concern--the patience to make sure \nhe got it right, that no civilians were unintentionally injured, and \nthat his fellow soldiers were safe.\n\n[[Page S5105]]\n\n  The controller lined up two warplanes to drop their payloads, but \ncalled them off because he was not certain they were locked in on the \ntarget. The third jet, an F-15 Strike Eagle, took three checks of the \ncoordinates before the air controller was confident the pilot \nunderstood his directions. The cluster bomb then hit its mark.\n  I submit that all of us should display similar patience and concern \nto that of that unnamed Minnesota combat air controller as we enter the \nfinal phase of Operation Iraqi Freedom--patience to let our coalition \ntroops finish the job they went halfway around the world to do, and \nconcern for the Iraqi people as they prepare for liberation and \nreconstruction of their country and society.\n  At the end of that operation, the nameless Minnesota soldier was \nasked if he wanted something to drink, and he requested a Guinness. I \ncertainly hope to find out exactly who he is, so I can buy him one upon \nhis safe return.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have this newspaper story \nfrom the Star Tribune printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the Minneapolis Star Tribune, Apr. 9, 2003]\n\n Minnesotan With Special Forces Has Key Role in Strikes on Republican \n                                 Guard\n\n                           (By Paul McEnroe)\n\n       Kansi-Masi, Iraq.--Part cowboy, part choreographer, the \n     Minnesotan stood in a bunker rife with scorpions early \n     Tuesday morning and searched the sky.\n       A U.S. fighter jet roared overhead for the third time in \n     less than a half-hour. ``Let's rope that bird,'' he said in a \n     casual tone that masked his dangerous task of directing the \n     aircraft to bomb Iraqi Republican Guard positions just a few \n     thousand meters away.\n       As a combat air controller, he owned a 3- to 4-mile stretch \n     of horizon that is the leading edge of a northern front only \n     an hour from Baghdad--and moving closer. Any pilot flying \n     through his quadrants--a fighter jock in an F-15 Strike Eagle \n     or a plodder in a B-52--had to check in with him and the U.S. \n     Special Forces team he's working with in the hills north of \n     the Iraqi-controlled city of Khanaqin.\n       If his team's position was not locked in by a pilot before \n     the start of a bombing run, the five American operatives and \n     three Kurdish Peshmerga reconnaissance scouts risked being \n     the victims of friendly fire. All it took was a garbled radio \n     transmission or a misunderstanding of map coordinates.\n       And after the friendly fire airstrike on a convoy near \n     Mosul on Sunday, when at least 18 Kurdish fighters were \n     killed and three U.S. special operations soldiers were \n     injured, the Minnesotan was not about to let his team be the \n     latest victims.\n       ``Sparkle him now,'' he said to the burly man at his side. \n     The Special Forces' team sergeant commanding the night \n     mission pointed his M-4 rifle into the sky and beamed up an \n     infrared laser line. The pilot would use that to mark the \n     unit's forward position in the jet's navigational computer \n     and thus eliminate the chance of a friendly fire episode.\n       The pilot locked on, but in a radio check the controller \n     was concerned that the pilot did not have the accurate \n     coordinates of the Iraqi target. What seemed minor could \n     easily become a disaster.\n       The controller already had spent more than 30 hours up on \n     the ridge line, directing close bomb attacks with little \n     sleep. He wanted to double-check himself again. So he \n     burrowed into a dark nylon bag at the bottom of the bunker, \n     where he could turn on a light without alerting any Iraqis to \n     the team's position.\n       Like a boy reading beneath the bedcovers at night, he \n     scrutinized his Global Positioning System card, checking off \n     degrees and meters while circling planes waited on his word.\n\n\n                              Air attacks\n\n       Two weeks ago, Special Forces unit members helped Kurdish \n     fighters rout hundreds of Islamic militants from the area \n     around Halabja. Now they're focusing on the Iraqi troops, and \n     they allowed a Star Tribune reporter and photographer, and a \n     two-man team from Knight-Ridder Newspapers, to accompany them \n     on a combat air-support mission. The only conditions were \n     that their identities and certain strategic information not \n     be published for the sake of their security.\n       Since the war began, the northern front has been \n     characterized by air attacks in the Kirkuk, Mosul and \n     Khanaqin areas--and little else. U.S. soldiers, frustrated at \n     the lack of action in the region, speak of ``being Turked,'' \n     a reference to Turkey's refusal to allow U.S. ground troops \n     to cross its border into Iraqi Kurdistan to attack Iraqi \n     forces from the north.\n       That has led to increased pressure on Special Forces \n     charged with combat air-support missions--such as this one, \n     based in a western state and specializing in mountain \n     warfare.\n\n\n                          They all see the end\n\n       The Special Forces team moved out of their small base near \n     Khanaqin outfitted with electronic gear, Kevlar vests, night-\n     vision goggles, 9-millimeter pistols strapped to their thighs \n     and M-4 assault rifles slung over their shoulders. They were \n     in for a 12-hour night mission along a newly taken line that \n     moves south by the day.\n       ``This is the farthest south the Pesh have been since \n     1991,'' the team sergeant said.\n       They all can see the end, and the push is on. The sergeant \n     spoke of the 34-year-old Minnesota air controller this way: \n     ``He's our workhorse. We can't get him off the mountain.''\n       The air controller joined the Air Force at 19 and has made \n     it a career. Mention Fifth Crow Wing Lake near Park Rapids, \n     Minn., and he brightens about the years of good fishing he's \n     had in that area. He's also a snowmobile enthusiast.\n       He works beside people who are considered among the U.S. \n     military's elite. In this Special Forces unit's last class, \n     only 17 of 90 men survived the cut, the sergeant said.\n       Besides the team sergeant, the squad has a weapons sergeant \n     who patrols the perimeter, an assistant team leader \n     responsible for intelligence gathering and reconnaissance, a \n     communications man and the air controller.\n       They are models of reserve around strangers, but hints of \n     their wild side seep out while they make small talk and \n     prepare to do their job.\n       Some speak of parachute jumps at nearly 30,000 feet and not \n     opening their chutes until they're 3,500 feet from the \n     ground. Others trade mountain climbing tales.\n       There's laughter over who got arrested--and who should've \n     been--at a Texas bar called the Broken Spoke. They argue over \n     what's worse to find in a sleeping bag--snakes or spiders. \n     When a man talks of his children's birthdays or anniversaries \n     missed while off on a mission, the rest turn quiet.\n       Their mission this night was to pound Hill 323, an 800-foot \n     mound amid rolling hills where reinforced concrete bunkers \n     protect Republican Guard troops and supplies.\n       ``We see headlights,'' a soldier said. Then they counted up \n     to 48 Iraqi vehicles on the move--lights on--a suspected \n     armor movement that got everyone juiced because it meant that \n     strikes could fill the night.\n       ``B-52s in 15 minutes,'' the air controller said. He wasn't \n     responsible for directing strikes against these targets, \n     because the column was 6 kilometers away and a closer Special \n     Forces unit was taking over.\n       ``Hopefully they waste that column so we get some stuff \n     over here and blow some ... up,'' the radio man said.\n       The sergeant ordered the weapons man to work the perimeter, \n     fearing that Iraqis might be probing the hills to see whether \n     their old bunkers were occupied. He studied the ridge line \n     where the column's headlights briefly popped up. ``They're \n     being sent to be cannon fodder, '' he said.\n       Simultaneously, a car started a slow, meandering drive \n     toward the two trucks used by the Special Forces team. It \n     moved slowly enough for the sergeant to order the men into \n     defensive positions, and an anti-tank weapon was readied. \n     After 10 minutes, a Peshmerga was sent down for a look. It \n     turned out that another Peshmerga had strayed into the \n     area.\n       ``If we'd lit him up, they [the Iaqis] could have fixed \n     their positions to fire on us,'' the sergeant said.\n       Soon, orange bursts lit up the sky, as a B-52 struck the \n     column. Then came a jolting rumble of sound that shook the \n     ground. Secondary explosions around a command bunker were \n     seen.\n       Around 1 a.m. Tuesday, it was time to finally call in the \n     strikes on Hill 323. First, a reconnaissance plane scoured \n     the area. The news was good.\n       ``He has hot spots in the buildings,'' the controller said, \n     referring to the detection of heat and a sign that troops \n     were hiding in one of the bunkers.\n       A jet was called in, but the pilot had to divert after the \n     controller spent 10 minutes lining him up for an attack run. \n     The coordination has to be both precise and quick, and this \n     one wasn't.\n       ``By the time they get here, they only have 10 minutes of \n     fuel left,'' he said, expressing mild frustration that this \n     pilot wasn't able to line up his target before the window \n     closed. ``Some planes are loaded with extra weapons instead \n     of more fuel--it's a choice the air commanders make.''\n       The visibility was so bad that another pilot--whose craft \n     was not equipped with an optic scanning pod--couldn't see the \n     controller's laser. He also departed with his payload intact.\n       The third jet, an F-15 Strike Eagle, was on its way but it \n     took three checks of the coordinates before the air \n     controller was confident the pilot understood his directions.\n       ``I don't like all this sparkle,'' he said, referring to \n     having to repeatedly signal the pilots.\n       ``Neither do I. It causes too much confusion,'' the \n     sergeant said. Then he raised his M-4's laser beam to the \n     sky, and the pilot locked on.\n       Next, the sergeant painted the bunker 2,700 meters away \n     with his laser. The pilot now had the distance marked between \n     his air controller and his target.\n       ``I have you in sight,'' the air controller said. ``Roger, \n     you are clear and hot.''\n       That was the final go-ahead for the airstrike.\n       The cluster bomb--not the usual weapon used on bunkers--set \n     off a brilliant white flash and exploded in the air over the \n     target,\n\n[[Page S5106]]\n\n     spewing mini-bombs in a wide apron on top of the hill. Two \n     more strikes followed.\n       ``Thanks for the good work, and have a good night,'' the \n     controller said to the departing pilot.\n       More strikes came in from another air support team down the \n     line. About 2 a.m., an errant bomb from a B-52 landed a \n     couple of miles to the north of this unit. Once again, \n     everyone was reminded why the controller burrowed into his \n     nylon bag and checked the grid coordinates as if his life \n     depended on it.\n       Somebody popped open a can of soda, and the muffled sound \n     of the hiss didn't escape the controller's ear. He was \n     starting to relax.\n       ``That's a Guinness for me, right?''\n       He finally left the bunker at 7 a.m., looking ragged.\n\n\n                      Supplemental Appropriations\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Madam President, on a final note, as the conferees to \nthe emergency supplemental appropriations bill do their work, I hope \nthey will include the unemployment benefits to laid-off airline workers \nthat Senator Murray, I, and others worked so hard with Chairman Stevens \nto include in the Senate bill.\n  Some of those laid-off workers from Northwest Airlines in Minnesota \nare now on military duty in the Persian Gulf, called up as part of \nOperation Iraqi Freedom. One of them, a mechanic named Todd Stock, \nkeeps our C-130 military planes airworthy to take crucial supplies to \nground troops in Iraq.\n  While on duty in the Middle East, Todd learned he is one of the 4,900 \nNorthwest workers who will lose their jobs because of the downturn in \nthe airline industry. When he is serving his country so nobly, Todd \nStock should not have to worry about whether he can take care of his \nfamily when he gets back home. His wife Sheila has told him just to get \nhome safely and that they will get through it somehow.\n  Our thoughts and prayers are with Todd Stock. Our thoughts and \nprayers are with that unnamed Minnesotan. Our thoughts and prayers are \nwith those men and women on the front line. Our thoughts and prayers \nare with the families of those who have lost loved ones in a great \nsacrifice, a worthy sacrifice, but the pain being so deep. They need to \nknow that our love surrounds them at this moment.\n  So I hope the conferees will keep in mind Todd Stock and the other \nmobilized mechanics serving our country when they make their final \nrecommendations.\n  I hope Americans will have the patience to understand that though \nyesterday was a great day, more remains to be done and our support, our \ncommitment, our love, and our prayers will never waiver from being with \nthose who are on the front line doing their duty, doing the job we need \nthem to do, doing it so bravely and so proudly.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, my good friend, the senior Senator \nfrom Texas, Mrs. Hutchison, has been so steadfast in coming to the \nfloor each day to salute our troops. I thank her for her leadership and \nfor her diligence. I think she has done a tremendous job. I am honored \nand pleased to have been working with her. She has just done a fabulous \njob and I think has really elevated the recognition of the service of \nour men and women in combat. She has done an excellent job. I thank her \nvery much.\n  As Senator Hutchison has said on numerous occasions, and as she began \ntoday, we are so very proud of our troops, the men and women who are \nserving our great country, with their brave service and their \ntremendous courage, and also their humane treatment of Iraqi civilians \nand Iraqi prisoners of war.\n  The United States has complied with the Geneva Convention and \ninternational laws concerning the treatment of prisoners, and we call \non the followers of Saddam Hussein to do the same.\n  The incredible vision we saw yesterday, as Senator Hutchison \nmentioned. We saw on the television the cheers of the Iraqi people over \nthe freedom they had begun to feel in their blood and their bones, the \nidea that they no longer would have to fear expressing themselves, \ntheir ideas, their goals, their dreams for their families and for their \ncountry. What a wonderful feeling for all of us. As Senator Coleman \nmentioned, we don't want to think that everything has been \naccomplished. We know there is still much to be done. But again, what a \nvision to keep in our eyes and in our hearts of a people who have \nreached something we have long had in our grasp in this wonderful \ncountry.\n  Earlier this week I learned just how well the United States is \ntreating our Iraqi POWs, how well we are working with our service men \nand women and our armed services to make sure we are doing right by the \nGeneva Convention.\n  In earlier remarks on the Senate floor some of my colleagues may \nrecall I reported that a member of my staff, my congressional staff, \nMarine Reservist LCpl Jason Smedley had been injured in battle. Jason \nreturned to the United States this week on a brief medical leave, and \nhe stopped by my office on Monday. My entire staff sat in rapt \nattention for some time as Jason shared his experiences in the war on \nIraq. Jason said while he was being treated for his injuries in a \nKuwaiti hospital, Iraqi soldiers lay across the room from him, \nreceiving the identical quality of medical care. Think of that--\nAmerican soldiers recovering from battle wounds alongside Iraqi \nprisoners of war.\n  I remember the words from Jason. He said: We have definitely kept \nwith the Geneva Convention.\n  Contrast that with what we have heard and seen of the Iraqi regime's \ncriminal treatment of American POWs, including Jessica Lynch, not to \nmention the ghastly exhibitions of bodies of American soldiers in \nshallow graves in which our soldiers found their fallen brothers and \nsisters.\n  Jason reported to us many Iraqi citizens are, to quote him, \n``definitely glad we are here.'' He told of seeing Iraqi mothers \nbringing children who had been ill for years to U.S. soldiers for \nmedical care. One mother's child had had problems with her eyesight \nsince birth, and that mother was full of hope as she carried her child \nto a U.S. soldier. Imagine that--Iraqi children receiving better \nmedical care from our soldiers in the field than they got for years \nunder a brutal dictator who built opulent palaces for himself.\n  We have seen news reports of the guerrilla tactics employed by Iraqi \ntroops posing as civilians and then ambushing our soldiers. Jason said \nsoldiers of the Iraqi regime stood out even when they were wearing \ncivilian clothing because they appeared to be strong and healthy, and \nit was such a stark contrast to the malnourished, despondent Iraqi \ncivilians Jason had encountered.\n  Jason said he had many opportunities to talk to Iraqi civilians, and \nhe made it his mission to seek their opinions of Saddam Hussein. \nWithout exception, he said, they all wanted Saddam Hussein to be \nremoved from power.\n  An Arab-speaking man who had accompanied Jason's unit as an \ninterpreter had a very personal reason for volunteering to serve with \nthe U.S. forces. He himself had been abducted and tortured by the Iraqi \nregime after they had invaded Kuwait. Jason had been assigned to a unit \nthat was to rebuild Iraq. He was not in a combat unit. When he was \ninjured during an enemy attack, he was bedding down after helping \nevacuate about 500 Iraqi civilians who had been caught in the firefight \nfrom an Nasiriyah. This Sunday at National Naval Medical Center in \nBethesda, MD, the Commandant of the Marine Corps awarded Jason a Purple \nHeart.\n\n  Since Jason has been back in the United States, he has burned up the \nphone lines calling to check on family members of fellow marines. He \nsaid several men had missed the birth of their children, and he \nrecalled one marine listening intently on a ship-to-shore phone as his \nwife tried to describe their newborn son to him.\n  That same marine was delighted when mail arrived with a CD-ROM video \nof his new baby as the ship steamed toward the Middle East. Jason had \nchecked up on the marine's wife and many others because he said he and \nhis fellow marines were so concerned about how their families were \nweathering the stress of the war.\n  As I e-mailed Jason on his trip over on the ship, I was amazed at the \nresponse in the e-mail I got back. It wasn't about him. It was about \nme.\n  He said: Senator, I want to lift up a prayer for you. He said: I am \nheading out to do what I am supposed to do. I want to lift up a prayer \nfor you and all\n\n[[Page S5107]]\n\nAmericans because we are getting ready to enter into something so \nimportant, sharing something with the rest of the world, particularly a \npeople who have not and do not understand what freedom feels like.\n  How incredible of a young man that age, leaving to defend his country \nand, more importantly, what his country means to him.\n  He has asked me to encourage all Americans who know families of our \nArmed Forces to check in on those family members regularly because that \nshow of support is the best way we can help our troops.\n  Senator Hutchison and I have come on different occasions to talk \nabout this. We have lifted up one another's personal stories we have \nhad from the war. It is important that the American families of our \nservice men and women and that our service men and women who are there \nin harm's way understand as we lift up these tributes to our troops, we \nare not just talking about those we know the best and most intimately, \nthose who are a part of our family, we as a body are lifting up our \npride, our prayers, the honor we feel for each and every service man \nand woman who is there putting themselves in harm's way on our behalf.\n  It is so critical to take to heart Jason's words that those of us out \nthere living in different communities know one of the best things we \ncan do for our troops is to reach out to their families--families who \nare frightened, nervous, who may not be hearing as much as they want \nfrom their loved ones serving this great land.\n  I hope we all, both as Senators, as Congress in general, and more \nimportantly, as Americans reach out to those very important families.\n  While Jason's mother and I shared a sigh of relief that Jason is \ntemporarily back in the United States out of harm's way, this dedicated \nyoung man says he hopes to return to his unit until the job is done, \nthe job of sharing those incredible treasures we, as the American \npeople, hold so dear, to help share with the Iraqi people what freedom \nmeans, to be able to speak out your ideas, your thoughts, your prayers, \nand ideals, how you believe your country can be stronger and should be \nrun--things that oftentimes, as we move about our busy lives, whether \nit is to the grocery store or to drop children off at school, we take \nfor granted.\n\n  I am proud of Jason Smedley, whose courage and character exemplifies \nour U.S. soldiers; a young man who spent nearly 1 month on a ship en \nroute to Kuwait; a young man who had the chance to take a shower just \nonce a week in Kuwait and not once after entering Iraq; a young man who \nhelped dig out his unit's camp in a former trash dump where even the \nroaches were dead; a young man who endured hot days and cold nights in \nstinging sandstorms; a young man who has been in five hospitals in the \nlast 2 weeks, but always reaching out to the patient next to him; a \nyoung man wounded in battle who saw his fellow soldiers lose their \nlimbs; a young man whose wish is that he might get to go back and be \nwith his unit to help rebuild Iraq for the oppressed people of that \ncountry.\n  I am so very proud of all of our brave and selfless young men and \nwomen serving in harm's way in Iraq and throughout the world, just as \nJason Smedley has been--going with the spirit of America to share what \neach and every one of them holds so near and dear to their hearts: the \nfreedoms and the treasures of being an American.\n  Madam President, may God bless them and bless our Nation as we \ncontinue to bring what democracy and freedom can share with the entire \nworld. I thank you for this opportunity.\n  Again, I compliment my colleague from Texas, Senator Hutchison.\n  At this point, I will yield the floor to my colleague from Delaware, \nSenator Carper, and thank him so much for taking the time to be here \nwith us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Senator from Delaware is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I express my appreciation to Senator \nLincoln and Senator Hutchison for making sure we had this opportunity \nagain today to remember those who are serving and their families who \nare here supporting them and pulling for them and praying for them.\n  The video from the other side of the world--the visual images from \nthe other side of the world over the last 24 hours are extraordinary to \nus all and, for the most part, they are encouraging. While many of us \nare troubled by the scenes of looting that occurred in parts of Baghdad \nyesterday, we will remember for many years the scene of the jubilation \nwhere people were realizing a time of oppression in their lives was \ncoming to an end when the prospect for greater personal freedoms and \nliberties was denied. I know not everybody in this country and in this \nbody supported the notion of our engaging in an armed conflict with \nIraq at this time. We all, regardless of how we felt as we approached \nthe day of decision, celebrate how well and effectively our men and \nwomen have served in that conflict. We regret the loss of life in that \nconflict.\n  I want to talk about two young men from my State for whom the last \nrespects will be paid this Saturday as we lay them to rest. Before I do \nthat, I was privileged to be Governor of Delaware for 8 years. One of \nthe things I liked most about being Governor was, as an old Navy \nofficer, they let me be chief of the Delaware Army National Guard. In \nthe last several months, we have had the opportunity to send off unit \nafter unit within the Delaware National Guard, to be mobilized and, in \nmany cases, deployed and, in some cases, closer to home and, in other \ncases, to be sent to the other side of the world. I want to mention \nsome of the work those men and women are doing. Some of them fly C-130 \naircraft, which are part of the air bridge between America and the \nMiddle East. The beginning of the air bridge, in many cases, is a C-5--\nwe fly those out of Dover Air Force Base--which is the largest cargo \naircraft in the world. They are being flown today by active-duty \npersonnel and by the Reservists, and they fly very much as one team, \none unit, literally as a wonderful, coordinated, combined team.\n\n  At the very end of the air bridge is, in many cases, the C-130s. They \nare flown by members of the Air National Guard out of Delaware, Alaska, \nArkansas, Texas, and other States. Those men and women who are flying \nthose, or maintaining those aircraft, or serving as military police, \nwhether in this country or in the Middle East, and those people who are \nusing heavy equipment, those who are providing health care--a number of \nthose people come from my State of Delaware. They are male, female, \nofficers, and enlisted. In many cases, they have left behind a spouse, \nchildren, their families, in order to serve us and, in some cases, they \nare doing so at great economic disadvantage to their families and, in \nsome cases, at considerable danger to themselves.\n  We are grateful for their service. We are proud of each one of them. \nI say today to their family members--those who are tending the home \nfires and making sure the families stay together and the kids are going \nto school and are getting fed and clothed and all--a real special thank \nyou for your willingness to share with us at a challenging time in our \nNation your sons, daughters, husbands, wives, moms, and dads.\n  At the Dover Air Force Base, we traditionally carry a lot of the \nmateriel and men and women who need to go around the world in support \nof our military actions. During the Afghanistan war, roughly 30 percent \nof the equipment that moved into Afghanistan in support of that \nconflict came through Dover Air Force Base and flew out on C-5s from \nthere. We are continuing to carry a large part of the strategic airlift \nburden from Dover and places like Travis and other Air Force bases \naround the country.\n  There is another unit stationed at the Dover Air Force Base that gets \nprobably even more attention these days than do the C-5 aircraft, and \nthat unit is the mortuary. We hear almost every day of the remains of \nAmerican soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, that are being returned to \nAmerica and to their loved ones. En route to their loved ones, those \nremains come through the Dover Air Force Base and the mortuary there. I \nvisited there last month and also in the past. While the people who \nwork there get precious little recognition for the work they do, they \ndo some of the toughest work of anybody in this country--military or \ncivilian.\n  I stand here today and take my hat off to those men and women. Some \nare\n\n[[Page S5108]]\n\nactive duty, some Reservists, and others have volunteered for the \nservice. But there is no more emotionally demanding and draining work \nthat you or I could do for our service men and women and their \nfamilies. I really want to express my gratitude--and, I know, that of \nevery Member of this body--for the work going on there at this moment.\n  Among the bodies that have been returned to their loved ones through \nthat Air Force base in Dover through the mortuary are two young men, \none 21 years of age from Seaford, DE, Army Ranger SP Ryan Long. Another \nis a young marine sergeant from New Castle, DE, who grew up in New \nJersey and came to Delaware when he went to high school and married his \nhigh school sweetheart. He perished last week at the age of 23 on the \nother side of the world. His name is Brian McGinnis. As our Presiding \nOfficer knows, one of the toughest tasks we do as Senators is to call \nfamilies of those who have died and try to convey to them our anguish, \ngrief, and our sympathy, and offer whatever we can to be supportive and \nencouraging in this tough time. As a father of two young boys myself, \n13 and 14, I cannot imagine the difficulty of living with the loss of \nyour child. Life prepares us to know that some day our grandparents \nwill pass away, and eventually our parents, and maybe our siblings, and \nmaybe even a spouse; but there is little in this life to prepare us to \nknow that we are going to lose a child.\n  In this case, the Long family and the McGinnis family have lost their \nsons. They will be laid to rest this Saturday in the First State, \nDelaware.\n  I wish to mention the service of each of them. Ryan Long comes from a \nfamily that has served in our military for generations. He is fourth \ngeneration. While at Seaford High School, he was vice commander of the \njunior Navy ROTC unit. He ended up joining the Army and became a \nranger.\n  He was at a checkpoint barely a week ago in an area northwest of \nBaghdad. A car driven by a woman went through that checkpoint. Out of \nthat car emerged another woman who appeared to be pregnant. She came \nout of the car screaming, and three Army personnel approached the car. \nThe car exploded, and the driver, the woman who had fled from the car, \nand our three Army personnel, including Ryan Long, were killed. The \nsoldiers approached that car believing there was a problem and \nattempted to extend a helping hand. For that, they lost their lives.\n  I am sorry to say that the Ryan family has lost their son. To Rudy \nand Donna Long--I had the privilege of speaking with the dad who is a \nretired major--we extend our heartfelt sympathy.\n  Seaford is the home of the first nylon plant ever built. It is the \nfirst ever built in the world. Ryan used to play golf at the Seaford \nNylon DuPont Country Club. He played on the golf team at school and did \na lot of other activities in the community before he enlisted in the \nArmy.\n  In the northern part of our State, there is a beautiful little town \ncalled New Castle. It has the largest high school in our State, the \nWilliam Penn High School. Brian McGinnis went to William Penn High \nSchool, having grown up in New Jersey earlier in his life. At that \nschool, Brian met a gal named Megan. He did not just meet her, he \nmarried her after school. He leaves behind a widow, a dad who lives in \nNew Jersey, Bill Mcginnis, and a mom, Mildred Williams, who now lives \nin Port Charlotte, FL.\n  Brian was flying a helicopter. The helicopter, as we have seen too \noften in this war--any aircraft, whether fixed wing or rotary--crashed. \nHe was aboard the helicopter, a Huey, and his life was lost. He will be \nburied this Saturday in New Castle, DE.\n  I send to his dad with whom I have spoken, to his mom, and to Megan, \nhis bride, our sympathies. My office, my staff is doing whatever we can \nto be of help and support to them. We remember them today. We feel \ntheir anguish. Our hope is time will heal some of that pain. Again, we \nstand ready to provide whatever assistance and comfort we can \nthroughout our State of Delaware to help the two families who have lost \ntheir loved ones.\n  I close with a comment on the war itself. Many of us have said the \ntoughest part of the war lies ahead. There is still fighting to take \nplace in other parts of the country that are not under allied control. \nThe tough part of the war does lie ahead. It is not just keeping the \npeace and restoring order in places such as Baghdad and to stop the \nlooting, but it is helping to build a democratic institution within a \ncountry where there are disparate groups--Shiites, Sunnis, and the \nKurds in the North.\n  There is a history of distrust and hatred. We need to help put to bed \nthose generations of mistrust. That is not going to be an easy job. It \nis not a job we and the Brits should assume. This is a job which others \nshould join in fulfilling, tackling, and also paying. We should welcome \ntheir involvement.\n  Mr. President, I yield back whatever time I have not consumed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, it is fitting that we reserve time each morning to pay \ntribute to the troops. I, too, mourn the loss of so many of our young \nmen and women who went over to Iraq and will not be coming home. Our \nhearts go out to their families and friends and for these brave men and \nwomen who put their lives on the line for our freedoms.\n  To listen to the stories this morning, to hear the accounts of the \ntwo young men from Delaware who will not be returning home to their \nfamilies, to sit in this Chamber and listen to Senators from the \nvarious States talk about those who will not be coming home, as a \ncountry we mourn for them, but we also have cause to celebrate and be \njoyous with those who will be coming home.\n  I stand before you with a great sense of pride for a young man from \nAlaska who we just learned, quite honestly by way of a photograph that \nappeared on Monday, was pinned by General Franks with a Bronze Star for \nbattle. It is one of those success stories; it is one of those tributes \nthat is important to mention as we speak about those who have not only \ngiven their lives but those who have gone into battle and are coming \nback to celebrate the victories.\n  The young man from Alaska about whom I would like to speak this \nmorning is SGT Lucas Goddard. He has been in the military for just 3 \nyears. He is 21 years old. He is part of the Army's 327th 1st Brigade \nof the 101st Airborne Division. It was on Monday in Najaf that General \nFranks pinned the Bronze Star on Sergeant Goddard.\n  Imagine yourself, Mr. President, as a parent, as we both are, your \nson or your daughter is overseas. They are in a conflict and you have \nnot heard from them in several months, not knowing their situation, not \nknowing whether they are safe, really not knowing where they are. Your \neyes are glued to the coverage of the war to glimpse anything.\n  The parents of Sergeant Goddard received a phone call on Monday from \na reporter who had seen the picture, saw that the young man had been \nidentified as being from Alaska, and contacted Mrs. Goddard. The \nreporter said: So what do you think? Mrs. Goddard was speechless. She \nwas so happy, she was so joyous, not necessarily that her son had \nreceived this incredible recognition, but that her son was alive.\n  The headline in the hometown newspaper that day was: ``Medal and \nMedia Images Mean Army Son is Alive in Iraq.'' Think about yourself as \na parent wanting to know, waiting to know, getting a call from a \nreporter saying: What do you think? But the good news is that your son \nis alive and, on top of that, to be given a medal such as the Bronze \nStar.\n  I had an opportunity last evening to speak with Sergeant Goddard's \nmother, Kathy Goddard. She lives in Juneau. It was heartwarming to \nspeak with her about the pride she has for her son and the sense of \ngiving that she has as a parent. She said to me: It's not just Lucas; \nit is not just Lucas who is out there. There are other young men and \nwomen from Sitka, who are in Iraq, who are serving our country, and we \nare concerned for all of them.\n\n  Sitka is a very small community in southeast Alaska. It is an island \nof about 8,000 people. In that community in the grocery store, I \nunderstand from Mrs. Goddard that what they have done is put a list in \nthe grocery store of the individuals who are serving our country right \nnow so that people can get a\n\n[[Page S5109]]\n\nsense of who is out there serving, the men and women we honor.\n  I asked Mrs. Goddard: Can you tell us what it was that your son did \nto receive the Bronze Star? In the picture that we saw, there was no \nreal recognition. It was just an acknowledgment that this young man had \nreceived the honor.\n  She does not know. Her comment to me was: It really does not matter \nwhat he was recognized for, but whatever it is, we are exceptionally \nproud. We cannot wait until he gets home and he can sit around the \ndinner table and tell us all that he has gone through.\n  She said he is a very humble young man and does not like to tout his \naccomplishments. She says he is probably going to be embarrassed over \nall of the hoopla that is going on right now, but there is good reason \nfor hoopla. It is still very sketchy right now, but in referencing \nseveral of the newspaper accounts, we understand that General Franks \nawarded the Bronze Star for valor to two soldiers who had fought in the \nbattle for Najaf. SGT James Ward led the team that stormed the military \ncompound on the south side of the city, and SGT Lucas Goddard \nspearheaded the assault on the local airfield, taking direct enemy \nfire.\n  In further newspaper accounts, as best we have been able to tell, we \nunderstand they had captured a compound of weapons while under fire by \nAK-47s, grenade launchers, and rocket-propelled grenades. So our brave \nyoung man from Sitka did what he was trained to do and was recognized \nfor it. He will be going home to Sitka to celebrate with his family.\n  I need to share a mother's intuition with the Chair and my \ncolleagues. Mrs. Goddard said she woke up on Monday sensing that she \nwas going to hear from her son that day.\n  She said: You know, you just sometimes get that intuition; I just \nfelt something.\n  She had not heard from her son for upward of a month prior to this. \nThat afternoon she received a phone call from a reporter asking: What \ndo you think? We have seen the newspaper account.\n  Well, that was not a direct contact from her son necessarily, but she \nsaid: You follow that mother's instinct. I knew that I was going to \nhear from him today. And that is what she heard.\n  So to all of the men and women from Sitka, from all over my State, \nfrom all over the country, our hearts go out to you. We are extremely \nproud of all of you at this moment, like Sergeant Goddard, who so \nbravely is defending our freedom and our democracy. We must acknowledge \nall of our men and women for the sacrifices they are making for \nAmerica's freedom, our freedom, the freedom of this Chamber, and the \nfreedom of millions of people all over the world as we are protected by \nthose who are serving in our Armed Forces.\n  Sergeant Goddard is an example to all of us. It is this rock solid \ncourage that we think about. This is what our military is all about, \nunfaltering bravery. So the recognition Sergeant Goddard received is \none that we look to, we say thank you, and God bless.\n  I am going to share one last communication from Sergeant Goddard. \nThis was in an e-mail message he sent to his family some months ago. It \nis a testament of his good will, and I believe his honorable service to \nour country. In his message, he stated:\n\n       I will be thinking of you all while over there. It is \n     because of people like you that we fight the tyrants who \n     stand in the way of freedom and peace.\n\n  So to Sergeant Goddard and all of those men and women who are serving \nus for our freedom, we thank you.\n  I yield the floor, and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I take a moment to talk about at least \none of the pending matters. Certainly our focus is, and should be, on \nwhat is happening in Iraq, supporting our troops, so we can support \nwhatever needs to be done now as this war, hopefully, comes to a \nsuccessful conclusion. In the meantime, of course, while we are aware \nwe are not yet at that point, we have to continue with strong support \nand praise of our men and women.\n  In addition, business goes on. Despite our interest in terrorism, \ndespite our concern and support for Iraq, our lives continue. An \nimportant issue is energy. We have been through this a number of times \nbefore, and the unrest in the Middle East has something to do with it, \nalthough it is not the exclusive reason. We need to find ways, as we \nlook forward, to supply ourselves with our electricity needs.\n  Energy is at times taken for granted. We do not pay attention to it. \nLights, automobiles, food--everything has to do with energy. As we all \nknow, we depend on imports for 60 percent of our energy. Availability \nis threatened, from time to time, but economically we are better off \nproducing here.\n  We are in the process of working on an energy policy. Last year, \nMembers may recall, we began with no energy policy. For various \nreasons--organizations, committees did not get to the work--we had no \npolicy. When we talk policy, we are talking broader than the details; \nwe are talking about a vision, where we need to be and the best way to \nget there over a period of time. I know how difficult it is because we \ndeal with issues before the Senate on a daily basis. However, the most \nimportant function of the Congress and the Senate is to make policy. \nOthers do the details and the implementation. Our emphasis ought to be \non where we want to go, where we want to be over a period of time and, \nin broad terms, how we get there.\n  We are now in the process, I am pleased to say, of coming up with an \nenergy policy. Hopefully, it will be a broad policy that will include \nwhat we think our needs will be and then talk about how we get there. \nThe policy will include, certainly, research. There will be new ways of \ngenerating energy for ourselves. We will be using different kinds of \nenergy over time, including hydrogen. Certainly we will be looking at \nconservation. There is no question there are many ways we can save in \nthe amount of energy we each use; we can reduce our demands on energy. \nThere will be emphasis on alternative means, including hydrogen cars, \nand perhaps hydrogen for other purposes as well.\n  Most importantly, in the short term, we will look at increasing \ndomestic production of energy. We have the resources in our country to \nhave considerably more energy made available than we do now. When we do \nit, for instance, in the case of coal, one of the largest resources of \nenergy we have, we have to continue to look for ways to produce it in a \nclean fashion so we can have good climate, clean skies.\n  I am hopeful we can continue to emphasize the future, where we need \nto be, how we are going to get there. We are going to have to recognize \nthings have changed, for instance, in the area of electricity. Years \nago, certainly, generators were also distributes of what they generated \nin their own retail markets. Now we have changed that and 40 percent of \nthe generation is done by so-called marketing generators that do not \ndistribute but sell it wholesale around the country. Obviously, to make \nthat work, we have to have transmission and transportation. That\n\n[[Page S5110]]\n\nwill be something we need as a national grid to be able to move \nelectricity from the source to the area of consumption. That has \nchanged. That is different than in the past. We will find ways to have \ncars and trucks that are more conservative in their use of gasoline.\n\n  I am pleased we are moving forward. I just left a hearing where we \ndiscussed working on that after our recess, that hopefully we can come \ntogether with a sensible policy. I hope we do not get tangled up in \nevery detail but, again, have this oriented toward looking out over a \nperiod of time as to how we will provide the necessary energy resources \nand use them in a clean manner. I look forward to that.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The people of California, and I \nknow the people of the whole country, mourn their loss and all the \nother losses we\n\n[[Page S5111]]\n\nhave had. May these beautiful young Americans rest in peace, may all \nthe fighting end soon, and may we pray for the souls of those we have \nlost.\n  I cannot help but note that Cpl Mark Evnin, age 21, wrote to his \nmother and said he wanted to study international relations. I hope and \npray, in his memory, that we can forge relations in this world such \nthat war is not a necessary tool; that we can forge relations in this \nworld such that the power of democracy and our ideals will be shared by \nthe people of the world, and that the power of those ideals will lead \nthe whole world to peace.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today my heart is heavy. Though our \nNation's forces continue to make dramatic gains to rid the world of a \ntyrant who cares not for basic human dignities, three sons of Utah have \nmade the ultimate sacrifice so that a nation may be reborn in freedom. \nThere names are SSG James W. Cawley, United States Marine Corps \nReserve, SSG Nino D. Livaudais, of the Army's Ranger Regiment, and \nRandall S. Rehm, of the Army's 3rd Infantry Division.\n  To their families, I know that no words that I say here today will \nalleviate the sense of loss that you feel. You see, I too, lost a \nbrother during the Second World War. But their families should know \nthis, that our communities are with you and will stand behind you, that \nour State of Utah is praying for you and keeping you in our thoughts, \nand that our Nation will remember and honor your loss.\n  The death of these three men shows once again that it is our Nation's \nfinest who answer the call of the colors.\n  Sergeant Cawley of Layton had dedicated his whole life to the \nprotection of others. He was a Marine Reservist, who in civilian life \nwas a Salt Lake City police officer. He was a member of that \ndepartment's SWAT team and gang unit. Before joining the department he \nserved for 12 years on active duty with the Marines, traveling the \nworld. During one of his deployments to Okinawa he met his wife Miyuki, \nand they have two children, Cecil and Keiko. I join the entire Senate \nin telling those children that their father was someone to be proud of.\n  Sergeant Livaudais grew up around Ogden. He might have only been 23 \nyears old, but he was already a combat veteran twice serving in \nAfghanistan. He truly died a hero's death, racing to protect a pregnant \nwoman who was being used as a human shield. He fell victim to an \nexplosion caused by a homicide bomber. His selfless act only reaffirms \nhis unit's motto: ``Rangers Lead The Way.'' He leaves behind a wife, \ntwo children, and a third child on the way. To his children who, in the \ncoming years, might look back on these events in order to get a better \nunderstanding of who their father was and what he stood for, they \nshould know this: Your father represents the very best that our Nation \nhas to offer.\n  Sergeant Rehm was not a native of Utah, but we were honored to have \nhim and his family in Utah for 3 years when the Sergeant ran the Army's \nSalt Lake City recruiting office. He helped so many young people make \nthe important decision to enter Government service. He died in the \nfighting near Baghdad International Airport, but his memory and spirit \nwill live on in all of the young soldiers that he introduced to the \nArmy. They will now carry on his traditions of honor and service.\n  After all wars monuments are built and ceremonies are held. However, \nfor me the greatest memorial that can be erected to theses fine men is \nto remember their names--James Cawley, Nino Livaudais, and Randall \nRehm--and to learn from their example, that even now, in these \nchallenging times, all people deserve to be free. It is our \nresponsibility to these heros that we realize a better world for which \nthey fought.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, the military campaign to disarm Iraq \nand free the Iraqi people has been a display of America's technology, \npower, and compassion. Our fine men and women in uniform have \ndemonstrated that they are not only fully capable of defeating anything \nthat comes their way, but also that they are dedicated professionals \neven when confronted with the worst sort of cowardice and terrorism. \nAmidst fake surrenders and using innocent women and children as \ndefensive shields, our troops have stayed on target and have kept \ncivilian casualties to a remarkable minimum.\n  We now have word that our troops have found what may be chemical \nweapons on warheads. If proven, this will indeed be the answer to those \nwho claimed that Saddam was not an imminent threat. It is unfortunate \nthat some of our so-called allies, namely France, could not see this \ndanger. But it is a reminder to every American--of just how important \nit is for the U.S. to act in preserving our security--and not to defer \nour defense to countries that refuse to face today's new threats.\n  When completed, military action is only half the battle. In order to \nsecure a long-term peace in the region, and consequently, security for \nour Nation; we need to ensure a strong and vibrant democracy thrives in \na new post-Saddam Iraq.\n  There have been numerous questions raised about the likelihood of \nsuch a transition. But based on my long experience in working with the \nIraqi opposition, I strongly believe a better day is around the corner \nfor Iraq. It will not be easy, but it is very likely. Allow me to \nexplain a few reasons why this is not mere optimism.\n  Iraq is not Afghanistan--the problems we have seen in reconstructing \nAfghanistan will largely not be present when it comes to Iraq for many \nreasons. First, Iraq is a resource-rich nation and can afford to pay \nfor its own reconstruction. Second, Iraq is not filled with religious \nradicals that plagued Afghanistan. And third, Iraq does not have armed \nwarlords to settle with. In fact, Iraq has a history of having an \neducated and sophisticated population with a unique focus in the fields \nof technology and medicine. This will be a huge asset which will make a \ntransformation to democracy more plausible.\n  There will need to be an extensive ``de-Bath'ification'' of the \nnation--just as in Germany it was necessary to ``de-Nazify'' much of \nthat country's leaders following WWII. Even after this process, there \nwill remain numerous ethnic, tribal and religious factions within the \ncountry that will likely have strong differences of opinion. But that \nis true of nearly every society and hardly a reason to believe there \ncould be no democratic government. In fact, it makes it more likely \nthat those differences will finally be recognized and worked out \nthrough a more productive manner than the use of brute force.\n  Iraq has a historical model for a federated democratic system--Much \nlike Britain, Iraq used to have two parliamentary bodies. Opposition \ngroups are working to reconstruct that model now to replace the \nexisting regime. This is important because it shows that democracy as a \nconcept, is not something that is being imposed on the Iraqi people, \nbut rather, something that is being brought back to them from their own \npeople. The U.S. should continue to work with all the Iraqi opposition \ngroups in order to assist in this noble goal.\n  Iraqi opposition leaders have already held elections to replace \nSaddam--Just last month, members of numerous Iraqi opposition groups \nmet inside northern Iraq and elected six leaders to help in the \ntransition to a democratic government once Saddam Hussein is gone. \nThese opposition members come from very diverse religious and \nethnic backgrounds. But they agree on the basic principles--that Iraq \nshould be a federated democracy which respects the freedoms of \nreligion, speech, and respects human rights.\n\n  These Iraqi exiles have returned to fight for their homeland side by \nside with American forces. They have been flown into southern Iraq and \nare working with the local people there, as we speak, to help unify and \nembrace a peaceful transition to democracy.\n  I had an opportunity to meet with many of these now elected Iraqi \nleaders in a meeting with them in London this past December. I saw \nthen, and I see now, the unity that they are creating. It is not always \npicture perfect. Democracy never is. But too often, there has been a \ntendency to write off the important work and success of these leaders. \nWe should not underestimate them. We should instead, use our energies \nto help make their dreams for a peaceful and prosperous Iraq, into a \nreality.\n  Iraq's ultimate success will have to come from the Iraqi people--and \nit will! This is also why I believe we will see a strong, democratic \nIraq in the near future. The people of this country\n\n[[Page S5112]]\n\nhave suffered under the rule of a tyrant. They have watched as their \nneighbors in Iran increasingly rise up to protest against the tyranny \nof the Islamic regime. They see the destitution that years of terrorism \nhas brought to the Palestinian people. Democracy is the only way \nforward--and the people of Iraq know it. We don't have to convince them \nof it, but we do have to help them implement this dream. That will be \nthe role for reconstruction in the months to come.\n  If there is a danger that we face in looking at reconstruction policy \nin Iraq, it comes from holding on to the old belief system that the \nMiddle East just can not handle democracy. Sadly, there are many in \nvarious government agencies who strongly cling to this view. We must \nmake sure that those who hand out the funds to rebuild Iraq are on \ntarget with the President's vision. We will only get one chance to do \nthis right. We must not revert back to the lobbying of dying regimes in \nthe region. We must stay true to the bold vision that democracy in Iraq \nis coming.\n  I thank the Chair.

The bill we \nare taking up today is nearly identical to the bill that passed the \nHouse of Representatives on April 8, 2003, by a vote of 419 to 2. \nToday, with the passage of this bill, the Senate is taking a step \ntoward bringing our Nation into compliance with our responsibilities as \na participating Nation in the Kimberly Process Certification Scheme.\n  Passage of this legislation is a true bipartisan success and a \nsignificant step forward in stopping trade in conflict diamonds. I \nwould like to thank my colleagues for helping to develop the compromise \nlegislation in this act. I would especially like to recognize the hard \nwork of Senators Gregg, DeWine, Durbin, Bingaman, and Feingold, whose \ndevotion and dedication to stopping trade in conflict diamonds is \nunsurpassed.\n  The Clean Diamond Trade Act will implement the Kimberley Process \nCertification Scheme. This is an international agreement establishing \nminimal acceptable international standards for national certification \nschemes relating to cross-border trade in rough diamonds. It represents \nover 2 years of negotiations among more than 50 countries, human rights \nadvocacy groups, the diamond industry and nongovernment organizations. \nThe Kimberley Process Certification Scheme will help end the trade in \nconflict diamonds, which has been fueling conflicts in some African \ncountries for many years, leading to human rights atrocities that are \nbeyond anything we in America have ever experienced. I am pleased that \nwe can help put an end to these atrocities with this legislation.\n  The next plenary session of the Kimberley Process is scheduled to \nconvene in Johannesburg, South Africa, from April 28 to 30, 2003. The \nU.S. played a leadership role in crafting the Kimberley Process \nCertification Scheme, and it is critical that we implement the \ncertification process before April 28 if we are to retain this \nleadership. We also need to do this to ensure that the flow of \nlegitimate diamonds into and out of the United States will continue \nwithout interruption. Most important, we need to do everything we can \nto stop trade in conflict diamonds as soon as possible.\n  This is a trade issue, a consumer issue, and most of all, a human \nrights issue. Legitimate trade can elevate the standard of living for \npeople all over. This bill sends a strong message that the benefits of \ntrade in valuable natural resources like diamonds should accrue to the \nlegitimate governments and their people in Africa.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to thank the members of my \nstaff whose hard work helped to get us to this point. First and \nforemost, my Finance Committee staff led by Kolan Davis, my Chief Trade \nCounsel Everett Eissenstat, along with Carrie Clark, Zach Paulsen and \nNova Daly. And I would like to acknowledge Senator Baucus's staff Tim \nPunke and Shara Aranoff for their help in getting this\n\n[[Page S5113]]\n\nbill through the Finance Committee and to the Senate floor. I hope this \nbill will receive wide support.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today the Senate has taken up and will \nunanimously pass the Clean Diamonds Trade Act, H.R. 1584, the House \ncompanion to S. 760, which I have cosponsored. The bill implements U.S. \nparticipation in the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme, an \ninternational arrangement to respond to the scourge of conflict \ndiamonds.\n  In war-torn areas of Africa, rebels and human rights abusers, with \nthe complicity of some governments, have exploited the diamond trade, \nparticularly alluvial diamond fields, to fund their guerrilla wars, to \nmurder, rape, and mutilate innocent civilians, and kidnap children for \ntheir forces. Al-Qaida terrorists and members of Hezbollah have also \ntraded in conflict diamonds.\n  While the conflict diamond trade comprises anywhere from an estimated \n3 to 15 percent of the legitimate diamond trade, it threatened to \ndamage an entire industry that is important to the economies of many \ncountries, and critical to a number of developing countries in Africa.\n  Governments, the international diamond industry, and non-governmental \nand religious organizations worked hard to address this complex issue, \nwhile setting an impressive example of public-private cooperation. For \nthe last several years, the Kimberley Process participants have been \nworking to design a new regimen to govern the trade in rough diamonds.\n  I introduced several bills on this subject over the last several \nyears, along with Senator Mike DeWine and Senator Russ Feingold, to \nreflect the consensus that had developed between the religious and \nhuman rights community and the diamond industry on the U.S. response to \nthis issue. Senator Judd Gregg, who had introduced his own amendments \nand legislation dealing with this issue in the past, joined in \ncosponsoring our bill, as did a bipartisan group of 11 additional \nSenators.\n  In the House of Representatives over the last several years, former \nRepresentative Tony Hall and Representative Frank Wolf were leaders on \nthis issue, as is Representative Amo Houghton, who took the lead in \nintroducing the House version of the bill this year.\n  In the bills I had sponsored in the past, my aim had been to push for \nthe strongest possible international agreement--showing leadership in \nthe United States and strong support in Congress for a meaningful \ncertification and monitoring agreement. Now that an international \nagreement has been reached, many of my concerns have been addressed.\n  We have learned about the horror that has resulted when illicit \ndiamonds fueled conflicts in Africa. Rebels from the Revolutionary \nUnited Front, RUF, funded by illegal diamonds and supported by Liberia \nterrorized the people of Sierra Leone--raping, murdering, and \nmutilating civilians, including children.\n  If the fragile peace in Sierra Leone is to be maintained, profits \nfrom that country's diamonds must not fall into the hands of such \nbrutal rebels again. Anti-government rebels in Angola and the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo continue to fight and are also \nsupported by the sale of illicit diamonds.\n  We have learned that members of the Al-Qaida network may have bought \nlarge quantities of these illegal conflict diamonds from rebels in \nSierra Leone in advance of September 11, anticipating that the United \nStates would seek to cut off its sources of funds. An article in the \nWashington Post by Douglas Farah, on November 2, 2001, outlined the Al-\nQaida connection and showed that Al-Qaida terrorists on the FBI's \n``Most Wanted'' list bought conflict diamonds at below-market prices \nand sold them in Europe.\n  We have learned that the Lebanese terrorist group, Hezbollah, has \nparticipated in the conflict diamond trade and that it has been a \nsource of funding and a way to launder funds for drug dealers and other \ncriminals.\n\n  It is now clear that ending the trade in conflict diamonds is not \nonly the just, right, and moral thing to do, it is also in our \nimmediate national interest in our fight against terror.\n  If the crisis in Afghanistan has taught us anything, it must be that \nwe ignore failed, lawless states at our peril.\n  American consumers who purchase diamonds for some happy milestone in \ntheir lives, such as an engagement, wedding, or anniversary, must be \nassured that they are buying a diamond from a legitimate, legal, and \nresponsible source.\n  The Kimberley system will allow American consumers to have some \nconfidence that they are buying ``clean'' diamonds, and will also serve \nour local jewelers and diamond retailers. The jewelers in our local \nmalls and downtown shops do not want to support rebels and terrorists \nin Africa any more than consumers do.\n  I heard from a jeweler in my hometown of Springfield, IL, Bruce \nLauer, president of the Illinois Jewelers Association, who wrote:\n\n       The use of diamond profits to fund warfare and atrocities \n     in parts of Africa is abhorrent to all of us. . . . As the \n     owner of Stout & Lauer Jewelers in Springfield, I know first-\n     hand the importance of diamonds to my customers. A diamond is \n     a very special purchase symbolizing love, commitment and joy. \n     It should not be tarnished with doubt. . . . We want to be \n     able to assure our customers unequivocally that the diamonds \n     in our stores come from legitimate sources.\n\n  There are not many issues that can bring together Senators and \nCongressmen across the political spectrum; that can bring together the \nhuman rights community and the diamond industry; and that can unite \nleaders of every religious denomination.\n  The horror of what has happened to the people of Sierra Leone and \nespecially to its children has brought us together to fight this evil \nby cutting off the rebel's source of support--the illicit diamond \ntrade. Now it brings us together to fight the terrorists who have \nmurdered our own citizens, in our own country.\n  The world was shocked and horrified by the murder, mutilation, and \nterror imposed on the people of Sierra Leone by rebels funded with \nconflict diamonds. The moral outcry by religious and human rights \ngroups galvanized governments and the diamond industry to address the \nproblem. Now is the time to close the deal and to implement the \nKimberley Process Certification Scheme.\n  I want to say how pleased I am that the Senate came to a consensus on \nthis bill. I am especially grateful to Senator Grassley and his trade \ncounsel, Everett Eissenstat, and to Senator Baucus and his trade \ncounsel, Shara Aranoff, for their careful work in being sure that my \nconcerns and those of other Senators and the Clean Diamonds Coalition \nwere addressed in the bill.\n  I am pleased that my concerns were addressed about the possibility \nthat the Kimberley system could be circumvented by cutting rough \ndiamonds, by calling for a report that would flag such actions if it \nbecomes a problem, so action can be taken.\n  It is very important that the United States move quickly to fulfill \nits promise to implement the Kimberley agreement, and this consensus \nbill will allow this country to do so in a timely way.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 529\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that the Grassley substitute be \nagreed to, that the bill, as amended, be read a third time and passed, \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any \nstatements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text \nof Amendments.'')\n  The amendment (No. 529) was agreed to.\n  The bill (H.R. 1584), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/10/senate-section/article/S5113-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5113-S5135]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   PROSECUTORIAL REMEDIES AND OTHER TOOLS TO END THE EXPLOITATION OF \n        CHILDREN TODAY (PROTECT) ACT OF 2003--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of the conference report to accompany S. \n151, the PROTECT Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the conference report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendments of the House to the bill (S. \n     151), to prevent child abduction and the sexual exploitation \n     of children, and for other purposes, having met, have agreed \n     that the Senate recede from its disagreement to the\n\n[[Page S5114]]\n\n     amendment of the House, and agree to the same with an \n     amendment, signed by a majority of the conferees on the part \n     of both Houses.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of April 9, 2003.)\n  Mr. HATCH. I rise in support of the conference report on S. 151, the \nProsecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to end the Exploitation of \nChildren Today Act of 2003, which truly represents landmark bipartisan \nlegislation to protect our children.\n  On Tuesday of this week, the House and Senate conferees met and \nreached agreement on this important piece of bipartisan legislation. \nEarlier this morning, the House of Representatives passed the \nlegislation by an overwhelming vote of 400 to 25.\n  I was hoping I could come to the floor to make a statement commending \nthe Senate for working together as we had on so many other occasions on \nmany important issues like this important piece of legislation which is \nneeded to protect our children.\n  Unfortunately, this is not a proud day for the Senate, and unless we \nget this bill passed, it will be a sad day.\n  The spirit of bipartisanship appears to me to be fading, as my \nDemocratic colleagues seek to obstruct and delay rather than working \ntogether to solve our Nation's problems and pass this important piece \nof legislation. Having listened to the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts, I have hope that there will not be obstruction or delay \non this bill, and perhaps there won't be as he seeks his point of \norder. The spirit of obstructionism that I have been worried about, \nwhich we have experienced all year long, has now reached a difficult \npoint here. If there is a desire to stop this bill in the Senate \nthrough a point of order, or otherwise, then I think it would exhibit a \nwillingness to sacrifice the protection of our own children for \npolitical advantages. I hope that is not the case.\n  If it is, I will be deeply saddened by this turn of events, and I \nurge my colleagues on the other side to rethink their strategy and \napproach to so many issues.\n  In particular, when it comes to this issue of protecting our \nchildren, I think we ought to get this bill done. We need to cast aside \npartisan disputes and quickly pass this measure and send it to the \nPresident for signature as soon as possible.\n  Let me take a moment to commend the House of Representatives, and \nJudiciary Committee Chairman Sensenbrenner in particular, for their \ntireless dedication to this legislation. Chairman Sensenbrenner has \ndemonstrated his commitment time and time again to passing this measure \nquickly during this new session of Congress. Thanks to our House \ncolleagues, we in the Senate now have an opportunity to pass not only \nan AMBER alert bill, but a truly comprehensive package of measures that \nwill protect our children from vicious criminals, pornographers, sexual \nabusers, and kidnappers. These types of individuals who prey on our \nNation's youth are nothing less than the scum of the earth who deserve \nevery ounce of punishment which we as a nation can fairly and justly \nmete out.\n  The problem of child abuse and child exploitation is simply mind-\nboggling. The recent wave of child abductions across the Nation, \nincluding the kidnapping of Elizabeth Smart in my own State of Utah, \nhas highlighted the need for legislation to enhance our ability to \nprotect our Nation's children against predators of all types.\n  I have a letter addressed to the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives, signed by Ed and Lois Smart, Elizabeth's mother and \nfather, as well as Elizabeth Smart, dated April 9, 2003. I ask \nunanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    April 9, 2003.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     U.S. House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n\n        An Open Letter To The United States Senate and House of \n                            Representatives:\n\n       We wish to express our sincerest appreciation to all of you \n     who have played such a key role in moving forward legislation \n     that includes the National Amber Alert. We applaud those \n     members of the conference committee who exhibited the \n     foremost cooperation in working out a compromise that will \n     greatly benefit every child in America.\n       Today, we are writing to encourage you to quickly pass this \n     legislation so that it can be signed into law. The Amber \n     Alert as well as other preventative measures will make an \n     immediate difference in safely rescuing those who are \n     abducted and in preventing crimes against children.\n       We can't begin to express our joy and gratitude in having \n     Elizabeth back home. It is our hope and prayer that immediate \n     passage will save countless families from the trauma and \n     sorrow caused by the senseless acts of those who prey on \n     children.\n           Sincerely,\n     Edward Smart.\n     Lois Smart.\n     Elizabeth Smart.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I will take a moment to address some of the \nsignificant components of this measure. First, the PROTECT Act of 2003, \nwhich I and Senator Leahy introduced following the Supreme Court's \ndecision in Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, has been my top \nlegislative priority since last year. Congress has long recognized that \nchild pornography produces three distinct, disturbing, and lasting \nharms to our children. First, child pornography whets the appetites of \npedophiles and prompts them to act out their perverse sexual fantasies \non real children. Second, it is a tool used by pedophiles to break down \nthe inhibitions of children. Third, child pornography creates an \nimmeasurable and indelible harm on the children who are abused to \nmanufacture it.\n  It goes without saying that we have a compelling interest in \nprotecting our children from harm. The PROTECT Act strikes a necessary \nbalance between this goal and the first amendment. The PROTECT Act has \nbeen carefully drafted to avoid constitutional concerns. The end result \nof all of our hard work is a bill of which we can be proud, one that is \ntough on pedophiles and child pornographers in a measured and \nconstitutional way.\n  The legislation also addresses AMBER alert, America's Missing \nBroadcast Emergency Response. The bill will extend the AMBER alert \nsystem across our Nation. Our entire Nation recently rejoiced with the \nSmart family after Elizabeth was found alive and reunited with her \nloved ones. Her discovery, facilitated by everyday citizens who \nfollowed this case, demonstrates the importance of getting information \nabout these disappearances out to the public quickly.\n  When a child is abducted, time is of the essence. All too often, it \nis only a matter of hours before a kidnapper commits an act of violence \nagainst the child. Alert systems, such as the AMBER alert system, \ngalvanize entire communities to assist law enforcement in the timely \nsearch for and safe return of child victims.\n  This legislation will enhance our ability to recover abducted \nchildren by establishing a coordinator within the Department of Justice \nto assist States in developing and coordinating alert plans nationwide. \nThe act also provides for a matching grant program through the \nDepartment of Justice and the Department of Transportation for highway \nsigns, education and training programs, and the equipment necessary to \nfacilitate AMBER alert systems. I support the national AMBER Alert \nNetwork Act because it will improve our ability on a national level to \ncombat crimes against our children.\n  Also, I want to take a moment to highlight another very important \nmeasure. The legislation includes the Code Adam Act, which would \nrequire Federal buildings to establish procedures for locating a child \nthat is missing in the building. The provision is named after the son \nof John Walsh, the host of America's Most Wanted and the John Walsh \nShow. As everybody knows, John Walsh's son, Adam, was kidnapped from a \nmall in Florida and murdered in 1981. Retail stores around the country, \nincluding Wal-Mart, have initiated Code Adam systems in memory of Adam, \nand they have successfully recovered many missing children. This would \nimplement the same system for building alerts in all Federal buildings. \nIt is a measure I am proud to support in memory of John Walsh's son, \nAdam, and in honor of John Walsh's commitment and vigilance to fighting \nfor crime victims and our children throughout the country.\n  On Tuesday, John Walsh attended the meeting of the conferees to \ndiscuss this legislation. Yesterday, John Walsh issued the following \nstatement:\n\n\n[[Page S5115]]\n\n\n\n       This incredible bill may be one of the most important \n     pieces of child protection legislation passed in the last 20 \n     years. I commend Senator Hatch's leadership on the Judiciary \n     Committee and Chairman Sensenbrenner's leadership on the \n     House Judiciary. Pushing this bipartisan legislation through \n     is very appropriate during ``National Crime Victims' Rights \n     Week.'' This bill, which is a loud voice for the smallest \n     victims--children--has sent a loud message to those who would \n     prey upon our most vulnerable segment of society.\n\n  I also want to highlight other important measures contained in the \nconference report that will enhance existing laws, investigative tools, \ncriminal penalties, and child crime resources in a variety of ways.\n  As the chart shows--the print is small--in addition to the PROTECT \nAct, AMBER Act, and the Code Adam Act, the legislation would, No. 1, \nprovide a judge with the discretion to extend the term for supervision \nof released sex offenders up to a maximum of life; No. 2, extend the \nstatute of limitations for child abductions and sex crimes to the life \nof a child; No. 3, denies pretrial release for child rapists and child \nabductors; No. 4, require a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment for \ntwice-convicted serious child sex offenders; No. 5, increase penalties \nfor kidnapping of under 18-year-old victims by nonfamily members; No. \n6, add new wiretap predicates that relate to sexual exploitation crimes \nagainst children; No. 7, increase penalties and provide prosecutors \nwith enhanced tools to prosecute those who lure children to porn Web \nsites using misleading domain names; No. 8, reauthorize and double the \nannual grant to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children \nto $20 million each year through 2005; No. 9, authorize funding for the \nSex Offender Apprehension Program to allow money to be used by local \nlaw enforcement to track sex offenders who violate terms of their \nrelease; No. 10, create a national Internet site for information \nregarding registered sex offenders; No. 11, establish a pilot program \nfor national criminal history background checks and a feasibility study \nin order to provide a background check process for volunteers working \nfor organizations, such as the Boys and Girls Clubs of America, \nNational Mentoring Partnership, and the National Council of Youth \nSports; No. 12, reauthorize grant programs to provide funding of child \nadvocacy centers; No. 13, reforms sentencing for criminals convicted of \ncrimes against children and sex crimes.\n  All of that is done in this particular bill. It is a very important \nbill, as you can see.\n  The bill also institutes sentencing reforms so that criminals \nconvicted of crimes against children receive the stiff sentences they \ndeserve. This provision, which was adopted at the conference, \nrepresents a significant compromise from the original House bill \ncontaining the so-called Feeney amendment which passed the House by a \nvote of 357 to 58. Indeed, the overall House bill passed the House by \nan overwhelming vote of 410 to 14.\n  In response to concerns raised about the Feeney amendment, I worked \nwith Chairman Sensenbrenner, Senator Graham, and my colleagues to \ndevelop a bipartisan compromise which was ultimately supported by not \nonly all of the Republican conferees, but by Democratic conferees as \nwell--Senator Biden, as well as Congressmen Frost, Matheson, and \nHinojosa.\n  The compromise proposal would:\n  No. 1, limit, but not prevent, downward departures only to enumerated \nfactors for crimes against children and sex offenses;\n  No. 2, change the standard for review of sentencing matters for \nappellate courts to a de novo review, while factual determinations \nwould continue to be subject to a ``clearly erroneous'' standard;\n  No. 3, require courts to give specific and written reasons for any \ndeparture from the guidelines of the Sentencing Commission; and\n  No. 4, require judges to report sentencing decisions to the \nSentencing Commission.\n  It is important to note that the compromise restricts downward \ndepartures in serious crimes against children and sex crimes and does \nnot broadly apply to other crimes, but because the problem of downward \ndepartures is acute across the board, the compromise proposal would \ndirect the Sentencing Commission to conduct a thorough study of these \nissues, develop concrete measures to prevent this abuse, and report \nthese matters back to Congress.\n  For those who want to oppose these needed sentencing reforms, I \nremind them that the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 was designed ``to \nprovide certainty and fairness in meeting the purposes of sentencing, \navoiding unwarranted sentencing disparities among defendants with \nsimilar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.''\n  While the U.S. Sentencing Commission promulgated sentencing \nguidelines to meet this laudable goal, courts, unfortunately, have \nstrayed further and further from this system of fair and consistent \nsentencing over the past decade.\n  Let me refer to this chart. As the chart shows, during the period \n1991, in the left part of the chart, to the year 2001, the number of \ndownward departures--in other words, soft-on-crime departures, \nexcluding those requested by the Government for substantial assistance \nand immigration cases along the Southwest border--has steadily climbed.\n  In 1991, the number of downward departures was 1,241 and rose by 2001 \nto a staggering total of 4,098. This chart shows the rate of downward \ndepartures has increased over 100 percent during this period--in fact, \nalmost four times--and nearly 50 percent over the last 5 years alone.\n  This problem is perhaps most glaring in the area of sexual crimes and \nkidnapping crimes.\n  This chart of downward departures from sentencing guidelines for sex \ncrimes shows that during the last 5 years, trial courts granted \ndownward departures below the mandated sentencing in 19.20 percent of \nsexual abuse cases, 21.36 percent of pornography and prostitution \ncases, and 12.8 percent of kidnapping and hostage-taking cases. Think \nabout it: Downward departure in these types of cases that involve our \nchildren. This many departures happens to be very disturbing and \nastounding considering the magnitude of the suffering by our Nation's \nyouth at the hands of pedophiles, molesters, and pornographers.\n\n  Let me give one example of the abuse this sentencing reform will \ncorrect. In one particular case, a defendant was charged--this is a \nconvicted child pornographer--with possession of 1,300 separate images \nof child pornography, depicting young children in graphic and violent \nscenes of sexual exploitation that were sickening and horrible. For \nexample, one of the images showed a young girl wearing a dog collar \nwhile engaging in sexual intercourse with an adult male. This same \ndefendant was engaging in online sexual communications with a 15-year-\nold girl.\n  The sentencing guideline for this defendant mandated--these are the \nsentencing guidelines the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, the \ndistinguished Senator from Delaware, and a number of us, including \nmyself, passed long ago--the sentencing guidelines for this defendant \nmandated a sentence in the range of 33 to 41 months. Yet the trial \njudge departed downward to a sentence of only 8 months, citing, No. 1, \nthe defendant's height. He was just short of 6 feet tall, and he said \nthat would make him vulnerable to abuse in prison. No. 2, he said the \ndefendant was naive. And No. 3, the defendant's demeanor--he was meek \nand mild and compassionate.\n  We all have common sense, but this is simply incredible and \noutrageous. Congress has to act, and it has to act now. The compromise \nsentencing reform provisions contained in the conference report are a \nreasonable and measured response to this problem.\n  The compromise proposal would simply require judges to sentence these \nvicious defendants in accordance with the law and not seek new areas or \nnew legal justifications for reducing sentences for these defendants \nwithout specific authorization from the U.S. Sentencing Commission.\n  Contrary to the oft-repeated claims of its opponents, the compromise \nproposal is not a mandatory minimum. Judges handling these important \ncriminal cases can still exercise discretion to depart downward, but \nonly when the Sentencing Commission specifies the factors that warrant \na downward departure.\n\n[[Page S5116]]\n\n  The other major reform in the compromise adopted in the conference \nreport is consistent with prevailing law, requiring de novo review of a \ntrial judge's application of facts to law. Indeed, this is the same \nstandard that applies to appellate review of critical motions to \nsuppress physical or testimonial evidence. There is no reason for \nappellate judges to give deference to the trial judge on such questions \nof law.\n  Even after the compromise amendment, the trial judge's factual \ndeterminations will still be subject to great deference under a \n``clearly erroneous'' standard. If a discretionary downward departure \nis justifiable, it is difficult to understand why anyone would be \nopposed to the appellate courts reviewing them under the same standard \nthat applies to other important areas of law.\n  I wish to take a moment to remind everyone to focus on the problem we \nface: an epidemic of abuse of our children. According to the National \nCenter for Missing and Exploited Children--these facts really are not \nonly astounding, they are deplorable--in our country, 3.9 million of \nthe Nation's 22.3 million children between the ages of 12 and 17 have \nbeen seriously physically assaulted, and 1 in 3 girls and 1 in 5 boys \nare sexually abused before the age of 18. That is unbelievable, but \nthat is what is going on, and that is why this bill is so important. \nThat is why we need to pass it today.\n  Considered in this context, we can have an honest debate about the \nissues, but we have an epidemic that needs to be addressed and \naddressed now. We simply have no greater resource than our children. It \nhas been said that the benevolence of a society can be judged on how \nwell it treats its old people and how well it treats its young. Our \nchildren represent our Nation's future, and I commend all of my \ncolleagues for their tireless efforts on behalf of children and \nfamilies and urge my colleagues to pass this critical \nlegislation. Quite frankly, our Nation's children deserve no less.\n\n  I know there are some misunderstandings from the conference, but \nvirtually everybody but a number of Democrats have signed off on this, \nincluding a number of Democrats have signed off on this conference \nreport, knowing what it says, knowing what it means, knowing what it \nwas represented to mean. I acknowledge some of my dearest friends on \nthe other side feel otherwise, but I believe it was made quite clear \nduring conference what this actually means.\n  I urge my Democratic colleagues to stop any partisanship or partisan \ngamesmanship and support this needed legislation. I do not think we \nshould let our children or our communities down. We need to pass this \nlegislation without delay and send it to the President.\n  The epidemic of downward departures in child pornography cases has \ncreated what I like to call the ``Me Too'' sentencing pitch from the \ndefense. In a recent case in Kansas, the judge departed from the \nSentencing Commission's guideline sentence of 27-33 months in prison, \nand imposed only probation. As part of the reason for the departure, \nthe court stated that it found defense counsel's argument compelling--\nthat in 27.4 percent of cases involving possession of child \npornography, sentencing courts have downwardly departed. In other \nwords, the problem is so out of hand, that defense attorney's point to \nthe downward departure statistics and say, ``Me too, Judge, Me Too.''\n  That is where we are. That is what we are trying to fix. I have to \nsay I have done my best to try to accommodate both sides. I do not know \nhow to accommodate them any differently. Even as late as today, I have \ntried to see if there was any possibility, but there is not any. I \nthink those who stayed for the full conference knew exactly what was \ninvolved, and it is a bipartisan bill. That is apparent from the size \nof the vote over in the House.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, all of us understand the enormous human \ntragedy that has been suffered by families in this country who have \nexperienced the abduction of their children. We have had tragic \nsituations in my own State of Massachusetts. All of us know the primary \nimportance of taking every possible step in order to make our children \nsafer. Secondly, if they are abducted, to rescue these children. And \nfinally, to have an appropriate kind of a penalty for those who would \nbe involved in such an extraordinary aberration of conduct and travesty \nof justice and cruel action. These reasons stimulated the Senate to \npass the AMBER alert bill.\n  We have passed it in the Senate twice already. First, we passed it \nonce on September 10 of last year. I think many of us who supported it \nat that time were very hopeful we would have had speedy action by the \nHouse of Representatives and that they would have sent back to us. It \ndid not seem to us it would take a great deal of time given the needs \nthat are out there in the country. We could understand if the House \nmight want to take a look at it for a few days but report back \npromptly. Nonetheless, we went through the session and there was no \naction by the House of Representatives. So, again, on January 21, 2003, \nit was sent over unanimously from the Senate of the United States, and \nno action later in January, no action in February, no action in March, \nand now, finally there is action in April. The House refused to act on \nthese bills on both occasions. Instead, they sent over a conference \nbill loaded up with the provisions they knew would be strongly objected \nto in the Senate.\n  We are enormously supportive of the AMBER bill, but we question and \nwonder why it should carry with it such extraneous kinds of material \nwhich this legislation in this conference report carries. In the final \nhours of the consideration of the AMBER bill in the House of \nRepresentatives, there was an amendment to the AMBER bill offered by \nCongressman Feeney. In a period of 20 minutes, it was accepted without \nany hearings. It was a part of the conference. The Feeney amendment \naffected the whole issue of sentencing, not just for these kinds of \nheinous crimes that take place against children but also against the \nunderlying concept of our criminal sentencing provisions, affecting \nevery type of criminal sentence, whether we are talking about \nterrorists, murderers, burglars or white-collar crime.\n\n  The amendment had nothing to do with the abduction of children, but \nwould affect all of the other circumstances. It was never very clear \nwhether that was intended or not. What was brought to my attention and \nconcerned me was the observation that was made by the Chief Justice of \nthe Supreme Court. He observed the Feeney amendment will do serious \nharm to the basic structure of the sentencing guidelines system and \nseriously impair the ability of courts to impose just and responsible \nsentences.\n  We are all for the AMBER legislation. We are all for the appropriate \nkinds of penalties for those who are going to violate the law, but this \nlegislation is much more. However the Feeney amendment would do serious \nharm to the basic structure of the sentencing guidelines system and \nwill seriously impair the ability of courts to impose just and \nresponsible sentences. This is not just an objection from the Senator \nof Massachusetts, or from the Senate Democrats, this is an objection \nexpressed by the Chief Justice of the United States.\n  I was personally quite amazed that the Chairman of our committee did \nnot believe this kind of change in the criminal justice system was \nsufficiently important. I am amazed that he would not support the \nposition of some of us who were conferees who suggested that we ought \nto have a day of hearings to call in experts, perhaps even the Chief \nJustice of the United States, or Congressman Feeney or others who might \nbe in favor of the amendment. This would be an opportunity to \nunderstand what the implications were and whether or not it was going \nto undermine the criminal justice system, as the Chief Justice of the \nSupreme Court has suggested. But, no, that was turned down. That \nsuggestion that we have a hearing, chaired by Senator Graham of South \nCarolina, the chairman of our Criminal Justice Subcommittee on the \nJudiciary Committee was turned down. The suggestion that we might hold \na hearing with the understanding that we would expedite any of the \nrecommendations to make sure we were going to target whatever actions \nwe were going to take on the subject matter of the AMBER circumstance, \nmake\n\n[[Page S5117]]\n\nsure we got it right, that was rejected and turned down.\n  Then a second suggestion was made to ask the Sentencing Commission to \nstudy this and report back in 180 days. Then, we would have an \nopportunity to look at what the Sentencing Commission had recommended. \nWe could then either accept it or reject it or take whatever action in \n180 days. The House of Representatives has taken its time in sending \nthis legislation over. We might be able to make a judgment about \nwhether this should be done or considered in this particular way.\n\n  Over the period of these past days, just prior to going to the \nconference, I was amazed at the kind of additional support I received \nfor the Chief Justice's position. I am sure the chairman of the \ncommittee received it as well.\n  The Judicial Conference of the United States said:\n\n       The Judicial Conference strongly opposes these sentencing \n     provisions because they undermine the basic structure of the \n     Sentencing Commission and impair the ability of the courts to \n     impose just and responsible sentences. We must note our \n     concern and disappointment with the lack of careful review.\n       Not 1 day of hearings; not 1 hour of consideration; 20 \n     minutes of debate on the floor and the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee virtually accepted it.\n\n  Then it continues along to those three chairs of the Sentencing \nCommission. These are individuals who have been accepted and approved \nby advice-and-consent votes in the Senate: Dick Murphy, Richard Conboy, \nWilliam Wilkins. William Wilkins, certainly one of the important \nconservative jurists who has served in the Federal court system, joined \nin saying:\n\n       The sentencing provisions are farfetched and effectively \n     rewrite significant portions of the Sentencing Reform Act of \n     1984. No hearings have been held on a number of significant \n     provisions of the current legislation urged our rejection of \n     it.\n\n  The Conference on Civil Rights:\n\n       The Feeney amendment would eviscerate the right to depart.\n\n  American Bar Association:\n\n       This provision would fundamentally alter the carefully \n     crafted and balanced position formed by the Reform Act \n     without the customary safeguards and legislative process by \n     effectively eliminating judicial departures. The Feeney \n     amendment strikes a blow at judicial independence and sends \n     an unmistakable message that Congress does not trust the \n     judgment of the judges it has confirmed to offices.\n\n  Then we have the list of 618 professors of criminal law and \nprocedure:\n\n       Although adopted by the House with certainly no public \n     hearings or debate, the Feeney amendment would effect a \n     dramatic unwarranted change in Federal sentencing law.\n\n  Eight former U.S. attorneys in the Southern and Eastern Districts of \nNew York, one of the most important districts in the prosecution of \ncrime, all, Republican--most Republican and a handful of Democrats' \nproposed legislation not only disregards the Sentencing Commission's \nunique role, it also ignores Congress's own admonition.\n  Even Cato.\n  Business Civil Liberties, an organization affiliated with the \nconservative Washington Legal Foundation, also said:\n\n       It sets a dangerous precedent for further restrictions on \n     Federal judges.\n\n  All of these groups. All within a matter of a few days.\n  We raised this in our conference and said we believe we ought to have \nthe time, either for the Judiciary Committee or the Sentencing \nCommission, to review it if there were these kinds of observations and \ncriticisms.\n  I say this to underscore why these sentencing guidelines are \nimportant. I was here in 1968 when the Brown Commission was set up on \nthe growth of violence in our society, criminal violence. The \nCommission made a series of recommendations. One of them was that we \nought to recodify the Criminal Code because we had so many different \nways of interpreting intent--willfully, wantonly, knowingly, \nunwillingly, lasciviously--all different kinds of mental tests that \ncould be distorted and misrepresented. And we did.\n\n  For the first time in 200 years, we recodified it; we took seriously \nthe recommendations. Unfortunately, the House of Representatives failed \nin their responsibilities.\n  But one of the other very important recommendations was because of \nthe fact that one of the important reasons this Commission said there \nhad been the growth of crime was the enormous feeling among those \ninside the criminal justice system and outside of the sentencing \nprovisions that were so wildly out of whack--the same crimes in \ndifferent jurisdictions and there was no confidence, either by the \nvictims or the defendants or any, in the justice system--that the \ncriminal sentencing provisions were effective, that they worked, or \nwere based upon justice.\n  So we went about it. We passed sentencing reform three different \ntimes in the Senate of the United States before the House of \nRepresentatives. It was finally worked out with the Reagan Justice \nDepartment. Strom Thurmond was very much involved. It was a bipartisan \neffort. So we were going to try to have some kind of rationality in the \nassigning of the penalties for crimes in this country.\n  It is not without its failings. We understand that. There should be \nstrengthening and improvement. We understand that. But it has worked \npretty well.\n  In fact, a number of States are in the process of adopting very \nsimilar guidelines. A number of the States are moving in the direction \nwhich we had established. That is enormously important. I think that is \none of the things that has been effective.\n  In any event, when the time came for this discussion, I said: Why, if \nwe can't at least have an examination, since there is widespread \napplication of these provisions, why don't we just take the provisions \nthat apply to children, sex crimes, and say: OK, we'll let those \nparticular provisions that happen to be particularly restrictive, we \nwill let those apply to those kinds of conditions that are there for \nthe crimes that are included in the AMBER legislation?\n  I thought we had a discussion. I thought the chairman of our \nJudiciary Committee--who is not the chairman of the conference--the \nchairman of the committee agreed. I thought he agreed. Senator Hatch \nrepeatedly stated that at Tuesday's conference meeting that his so-\ncalled ``compromise'' was limited to sex crimes and children. It \nretained much of the underlying Feeney Amendment and dramatically \nlimited departures in all cases.\n  In his own works, Senator Hatch's remarks at conference were ``It's \nimportant to note . . . that the compromise is limited to those serious \ncrimes against children and sex crimes and does not broadly apply to \nother crimes''--and he put in a compromise and said to the Senator from \nMassachusetts, on the question of having this apply to the children--\nthis makes sense and this is what this compromise will do. This is what \nthis compromise will do. These are the words that our chairman of our \nJudiciary Committee used:\n\n       It's important to note . . . that the compromise is limited \nto those serious crimes against children and sex crimes, it does not \napply aptly to other crimes.\n\n  Page 31--what do you conclude from that? That the amendment he puts \nin was just as he implied, applied to children. Furthermore:\n\n       It is important to note that the compromise is limited to \n     these serious crimes against children--serious crimes against \n     children and sex crimes does not broadly apply to other \n     crimes. We're not changing the whole system, which I've tried \n     to do, at the urging of not of my friend from Massachusetts, \n     but judges and a number of other people.\n\n  Page 37:\n\n       Now, the compromise proposal would simply require judges to \n     sentence these vicious defendants, child criminals, I mean \n     defendants who are committing crimes against children, in \n     accordance with the law--[didn't have to sentence them in \n     accordance with the law]--and not seek to find new areas or \n     new legal justification for reducing the sentences for these \n     defendants without specific authorization for the United \n     States Sentencing Commission.\n\n  Do Members of this body believe that when you had a chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee filing an amendment, which we had not seen, and \nthen give us assurance that that was the scope of that amendment, and \nthen to find out that that was not true and have it apply in a number \nof other cases--would the members of the Judiciary Committee of the \nSenate feel that they have been treated fairly? No. The answer is no.\n\n       It is important to note that the compromise--\n\n  Here it is again--\n\n\n[[Page S5118]]\n\n\n     is limited to these serious crimes against children and does \n     not broadly apply to other crimes, which is what the Feeney \n     Amendment did.\n       Now, look, I have to admit I had my own qualms about the \n     totality of the Feeney amendment, and that's why I chatted \n     with the distinguished chairman of the House Judiciary \n     Committee, and that's why I chatted with a lot of others as \n     we, and experts in the field, and I believe we've made a \n     compromise here . . . .\n\n  It just goes on.\n  Then we received the assurances from the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, and--listen to this--Chief Justice Rehnquist is worried \nabout the breadth and scope.\n  He is not worried about this. Where did he get that information? \nWhere did you get that information, Senator Hatch? That is not an \naccurate statement. I don't think any Federal judge should worry about \nwhich language. They know this language is to protect our children in \nour society. We are limiting it to that. I am trying to solve this \nproblem.\n  I could go on. The fact is, in just a cursory examination of that \nlanguage, we saw that was not the case. In fact, the Hatch amendment \nwent way beyond sex crimes and children. It retained much of the \nunderlying Feeney amendment and dramatically limited departures in all \ncases and eliminated for all cases departures based on age and physical \nimpairment, gambling dependence, aberrant behavior, family ties, \nmilitary, and good works.\n  This is what is still in there. It establishes de novo appellate \nreview of all departures. That applies to every single sentence. It \ngoes to the circuit court. That says to the circuit court judges: You \nwill look not at the trial court; look at the facts and the sentences, \nbut you look to de novo, overturning a unanimous Supreme Court.\n  It applies to every case, overturning a Supreme Court decision.\n  It prohibits in all cases downward departures on remands of new \ngrounds. It also chilled the departures in all cases by imposing \nburdensome reporting requirement on judges who depart from the \nguidelines. And it directed the Sentencing Commission to amend the \nguidelines and policy statements ``to ensure that the incidence of \ndownward departures is substantially reduced'' in all cases.\n  In the departures, in all cases, by imposing burdensome reporting \nrequirements--do you know what the requirements are? They have to tell \nsomeone in the Justice Department. Guess who. The Attorney General. \nEvery time you depart from the guidelines, the Attorney General will be \nnotified.\n  Talk about a blacklist for judges. The Attorney General will know. Do \nnot think that does not send a chill into every judge, to know if he is \ngoing to make that kind of judgment, decision, in accordance with the \nsentencing guidelines, that the Attorney General is going to know why. \nObviously, the proponents of the Feeney amendment understood it--in \norder to chill that--to create a blacklist of judges. And everyone \nknows that list will be published. That will be made available to the \ncommittee. It will be made available in every community where the \njudges go.\n  It still applies, not just to children's issues but to all cases--\ndoes everyone understand that?--in all cases.\n  Then it directs the Sentencing Commission to amend the guidelines to \nensure that the incidents of downward departures are substantially \nreduced in all cases, saying, look, we do not like these downward \ndepartures, in spite of the fact that 80 percent of them were requested \nby the Government and in spite of the fact that anytime you have a \ndownward departure, that is sufficient grounds to appeal. If there is a \nconcern, they can appeal that. If it is outside the scope of the \nsentencing provision, it is remanded. That is the way the system works. \nThat is what we included. If it will be excessive, in terms of \ndownward, there is a remedy: Go to appeals. It has worked pretty well. \nIf not, let's go back and take a look and have a hearing.\n\n  But absolutely no--absolutely no.\n  So then we had spotted those raised, and we had the continued \nassurances from the chairman of the Judiciary Committee that we did not \nunderstand it. We just looked at this quickly and did not have a real \ngrasp of it. This was all done in a period of about 45 or 50 minutes. \nWe did not really understand it.\n  The way I have described it is the way it is. This is what happened \nlater. At 1:30 on Wednesday morning, more than 8 hours after Chairman \nSensenbrenner adjourned the conference, Senator Hatch's office \ndistributed a new, revised version of the Hatch substitute to the \nFeeney amendment. At that hour, my staff was trying to figure out what \nexactly was in the old Hatch substitute. It appears, after having \ndebated the Feeney amendment, the Hatch so-called compromise amendment, \nmy secondary amendment after having voted on the items in the final \nconference report, the Republican conferees decided to change a \nsubstantial portion of that conference report and then file it as a \ntechnical amendment without reconvening the conference, to have the \nMembers vote on the new language. This procedure was, to say the least, \nunorthodox.\n  At 1:30 in the morning, the revisioners describe it as a ``technical \nchange . . . made at the request of a democratic Senator.'' No mention \nof by whom the request was made. Unless the request was for only minor \nchanging, it was not fulfilled.\n  At 1:34, the revision did not limit the Hatch amendment to serious \ncrimes against children. To the contrary, like the amendment before it \nand the Feeney amendment before, the 1:34 revision broadly limits \njudicial departures in no-child and non-sex cases in many ways.\n  It overturns the Koon case by establishing the de novo standard for \nappellate review for all cases--still in there.\n  It still directs the Sentencing Commission to amend the guidelines \nand policy statements ``to ensure that the incidence of downward \ndepartures are substantially reduced.''\n  It still chills departures by imposing the burdensome reporting \nrequirements.\n  It is true that at 1:34 the revision improved the bill by limiting \nrestrictions on enumerated departure grounds to child and sex cases \nonly. And it strikes the early text limiting military service \ndepartures. But the very idea that the Feeney amendment and the first \nHatch amendment limited military service departures in this time of war \nshows how poorly considered the entire legislation has been.\n  The modest changes made in the 1:34 revision do not ameliorate the \ndevastating impact the Hatch amendment will have on our system of \ncriminal justice. They do not conform the amendment to the \nrepresentations made by Senator Hatch at our conference meeting. They \ndo not excuse the travesty of a process that has led to this provision \nbeing inserted into a conference that was meant to deal with the AMBER \nalert bill and other provisions involving the protection of children.\n  In reality, the Hatch amendment had nothing to do with the protecting \nof children and everything to do with handcuffing judges, eliminating \nfairness in the Federal sentencing system. That is what the Chief \nJustice of the United States believes.\n\n  Our belief is that if there are changes that are necessary--and there \nmay very well be--we ought to have those changes made in an area of the \ncriminal justice system. If we have to change them in order to deal \nwith terrorism, let's do it. But to do this now, to represent the \nchanges only applied to the children and not to the other parts of the \nprovision, is not accurate and is a serious misrepresentation of what \nwe are doing.\n  I have been assured that there are provisions in this legislation \nthat go far beyond even the conference itself. It is interesting, we \nestablished seven members of the Sentencing Commission, and we say not \nfewer than three judges will be members of the Sentencing Commission. \nThat has changed, to be not more than three judges.\n  The idea that we have seen the number of judges who have served on \nthe Sentencing Commission, all of whom have been approved with the \nadvice and consent of the Senate and have been approved--the idea in \nthe early days of the Sentencing Commission was to bring more judges in \nto bring greater confidence and get their involvement in the drafting \nof the sentencing guidelines. That was the purpose. Now they complain \nabout the guidelines and say no more than three judges; so it will\n\n[[Page S5119]]\n\nnever be more than three judges. There will always be more on the \noutside than judges in the drafting of the sentencing.\n  That was all put in at conference. If someone can show where that was \nin the Senate bill or the House bill--it was not there. It has \nimportant implications in terms of the makeup and the guidance in terms \nof the sentencing. But we found that out just in reading through the \nprocess. No justification. No explanation.\n  Finally, all Members can understand action here in the Senate at the \ntimes of enormous kinds of passion, when we see the circumstances of \nchildren who are abducted and what has happened to them--one cannot \nhelp but to understand that the feeling of the parents and Members is \nto just throw the book out and go to it. That would have been \nsomething, if the House of Representatives had done that when the facts \nwere there last fall--then it would have been something that could have \nbeen done in January--but they did not. They waited all this time. And \nthen, they have not only taken those actions in terms of enhanced \npenalties against the child abductors, all of which I was glad to \nsupport--I would have supported it, and would support it still, not the \nother provisions that have been included in it--but if he is truly \ncommitted to protecting the children and upholding the fairness, I \nwould have hoped we could have at least restricted those provisions to \nthe sentencing that applied on those circumstances, but they did not.\n\n  That is why we are caught, all of us here, in the situation where we \nare sufficiently concerned about the dangers that are out there in \nterms of the abduction of children and conflicted with the kinds of \nviolence we are doing to the Sentencing Commission.\n  It is a lousy way to legislate, Mr. Chairman, and I deplore that we \nare in this circumstance. But we will just have to see what steps are \navailable to us in the remaining time.\n  Mr. President, I would like to address the question of a judge's \nauthority to depart from the guidelines.\n  While this legislation alters the grounds on which a judge may depart \nin certain child-related cases, it does not alter the basic legal \nauthority of a district court to department from the guidelines under \n18 U.S.C. 3553 in other cases. Judges retain ultimate authority to \nimpose a just sentence within statutory limits, and today we reaffirm \nthat departures are an important and necessary part of that authority.\n  As one of the authors of the Sentencing Reform Act, I can say that \nCongress did not intend to eliminate judicial discretion. We recognized \nthat the circumstances that may warrant departure from the guideline \nrange cannot, by their very nature, be comprehensively listed or \nanalyzed in advance. In interpreting the Act, both the Supreme Court \nand the Sentencing Commission have emphasized this point. This is not a \npartisan position. Judicial authority to exercise discretion when \nimposing a sentence was and is an integral part of the structure of the \nFederal sentencing guidelines and indeed of every guideline system in \nuse today. In the eloquent words of Justice Kennedy, when he wrote for \na unanimous Supreme Court to uphold the district court's authority to \ndepart downward in Koon:\n\n       The goal of the Sentencing Guidelines is, of course, to \n     reduce unjustified disparities and so reach toward the \n     evenhandedness and neutrality that are the distinguishing \n     marks of any principled system of justice. In this respect, \n     the Guidelines provide uniformity, predictability, and a \n     degree of detachment lacking in our earlier system. This, \n     too, must be remembered, however. It has been uniform and \n     constant in the federal judicial tradition for the sentencing \n     judge to consider every convicted person as an individual and \n     every case as a unique study in the human failings that \n     sometimes mitigate, sometimes magnify, the crime and the \n     punishment to ensue. We do not understand it to have been the \n     congressional purpose to withdraw all sentencing discretion \n     from the United States district judge.\n\n  According to Koon v. United States, 518 U.S. 81, 113 (1996).\n  In Koon, the Supreme Court held that a sentencing judge may depart \nbased on a factor identified by the Sentencing Commission, or even \nbased upon a factor discouraged by the Commission, as long as the \ndiscouraged factor nonetheless justifies departure because it is \npresent in some unusual or exceptional way. Similarly, a sentencing \njudge may always depart when a factor, unmentioned in the guidelines, \ntakes the case outside the heartland of cases covered by the \nguidelines.\n\n  I do not agree that there is an epidemic of leniency in the Federal \ncriminal justice system. I do not regard the current rate of non-\nsubstantial assistance departures as excessive. There is no such thing \nas an excessive departure rate--the question is whether any particular \ndeparture is warranted or unwarranted. That is a question for appellate \ncourts, not Congress. One of the reforms embodied in the Sentencing \nReform Act was the appealability of sentences. The government was given \nthe power to appeal downward departures under the act. Were downward \ndepartures ``excessive'' presumably the government would have brought \nmore appeals than it has.\n  The Sentencing Reform Act recognized that departures are a healthy \nand necessary component of a just guideline system. In 2001, when we \nexclude those districts with departure policies designed to address the \nhigh volume of immigration caseloads, the non-substantial assistance \ndeparture rate is merely 10.2 percent. This reflects the proper \nexercise of judicial discretion, by Article III judges, who have been \nappointed by presidents of the United States and confirmed by the \nSenate, in conformance with the mandate that Congress gave them in 18 \nU.S.C. Sec. 3553(b).\n  Indeed, the vast majority of downward departures granted by judges \ntoday are those sought by the government, most to reward substantial \nassistance in the prosecution of crime. And, while departures have \nincreased somewhat of late, government initiated departures lead the \nrising departure rate.\n  I am gratified that the concerns voiced by the Federal Judicial \nConference, the American Bar Association, and others concerning the \nhigh rate of downward departures requested by prosecutors have been \nrecognized in the version of the Feeney Amendment approved by the \nconference committee. The bill now requires that the Sentencing \nCommission:\n\n       . . . review the grounds of downward departure that are \n     authorized by the sentencing guidelines, policy statements, \n     and official commentary of the Sentencing Commission; and \n     promulgate, pursuant to section 994 of title 28, United \n     States Code (A) appropriate amendments to the sentencing \n     guidelines, policy statements, and official commentary to \n     ensure that the incidence of downward departures are \n     substantially reduced.\n\n  I welcome this call for a thorough and impartial review of all \ndownward departures, whether requested by the prosecution or the \ndefense. Only a review embracing all downward departures will provide \nthe Commission the information necessary to fulfill the mandate of this \nlegislation.\n  A district court may depart from a guideline range whenever the \nunusual circumstances or combination of circumstance of a case take it \noutside of the ``heartland'' of cases covered by the relevant \nguideline. Other than in certain child-related cases, this legislation \ndoes not limit or lessen the myriad potential grounds for departure \ncurrently available to district courts in making sentencing decisions \nnor is it intended to discourage departure decisions when the unusual \ncircumstances of a case justify a sentence outside the recommended \nrange. It also is not intended to transfer authority over sentencing \ndecisions from judges to prosecutors.\n\n  In that light, I must express my deep concern for the provision of \nthe legislation that requires the Commission to report to the Judiciary \nCommittees of the Congress and even to the Attorney General \nconfidential court records and even ``the identity of the sentencing \njudge.'' I do not believe that this provision serves any legitimate \ninterests of the Congress. I do not believe that authorizing disclosure \nof this information to the executive branch is warranted. I have deep \nconcerns that this provision lacks the respect owed by the Congress to \na co-equal branch.\n  I remain convinced that his legislation is flawed and results from a \nhasty and unreliable process that ill serves us. It is my view that the \ndirective to the Commission ``to promulgate . .  amendments . . . to \nensure that the incidence of downward departures are substantially \nreduced'' is inappropriate. It puts the cart before the horse and is \nbased on faulty numbers of the incidence of departures that have been\n\n[[Page S5120]]\n\nrelied upon by some proponents of the legislation. The better course \nwould be for the Commission to study and report on the question. \nBecause the Feeney amendment was presented without discussion or debate \nand at the last possible moment, Congress was deprived of balanced and \nfull information concerning the issue of whether departure decisions \nare made in inappropriate instances. Even without the opportunity to \nrespond in detail to the amendment, the Commission did produce \nstatistics and information that refute the reliability and credibility \nof the information used in promoting the notion that departures \ndecisions are made too frequently or inappropriately. Indeed, a fact \nthat was withheld by proponents of the amendment, close to 90 percent \nof departure decisions are made at the request of or with the support \nof the government and that number may be even higher.\n  For these reasons, I hope and expect that this legislation will not \nunduly restrict departures or impede the appropriate development of \nguideline departure common law. And we need to review the entire system \nin light of these changes to make sure that we are letting judges carry \nout their responsibility to impose just and responsible sentences.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following letters in opposition to \nthe proposal be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  Supreme Court of\n\n\n                                            the United States,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senator, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: I am responding to your letter of March \n     31, 2003, that requested the views of the Judicial Conference \n     of the United States on a number of specific provisions of a \n     sentencing-related amendment to H.R. 1104. By now you will \n     have received Ralph Mecham's letter, dated April 3, which was \n     sent to other Judiciary Committee members as well, expressing \n     the concerns of the judiciary about the amendment. More \n     specifically, the Judicial Conference:\n       1. Opposes legislation that would eliminate the courts' \n     authority to depart downward in appropriate situations unless \n     the grounds relied upon are specifically identified by the \n     Sentencing Commission as permissible for the departure.\n       2. Consistent with the prior Judicial Conference position \n     on congressionally mandated guideline amendments, opposes \n     legislation that directly amends the sentencing guidelines, \n     and suggests that, in lieu of mandated amendments, Congress \n     should instruct the Sentencing Commission to study suggested \n     changes to particular guidelines and to report to Congress if \n     it determines not to make the recommended changes.\n       3. Opposes legislation that would alter the standard of \n     review in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3742(c) from ``due deference'' \n     regarding a sentencing judge's application of the guidelines \n     to the facts of a case to a ``de novo'' standard of review.\n       4. Opposes any amendment to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 994(w) that \n     would impose specific record keeping and reporting \n     requirements on federal courts in all criminal cases or that \n     would require the Sentencing Commission to disclose \n     confidential court records to the Judiciary Committees upon \n     request.\n       5. Urges Congress that, if it determines to pursue \n     legislation in this area notwithstanding the Judicial \n     Conference's opposition, it do so only after the Judicial \n     Conference, the Sentencing Commission, and the Senate have \n     had an opportunity to consider more carefully the facts about \n     downward departures and the implications of making such a \n     significant change to the sentencing guideline system.\n       I believe these Conference positions respond to most of the \n     questions posed in your letter. Please note, however, that \n     the Conference did not specifically oppose the provisions \n     mentioned in your third and fourth questions. These \n     provisions would amend U.S.S.G. Sec. 3E1.1 and promulgate new \n     policy statement U.S.S.G Sec. 2K2.23. The Conference \n     considered these provisions in adopting its opposition to \n     direct congressional amendments of the sentencing guidelines. \n     The Conference did not take positions on the provisions noted \n     in your seventh and eighth questions. These would primarily \n     affect the Department of Justice.\n       As stated in the April 3 letter, the Judicial Conference \n     believes that this legislation, if enacted, would do serious \n     harm to the basic structure of the sentencing guideline \n     system and would seriously impair the ability of courts to \n     impose just and responsible sentences. Before such \n     legislation is enacted there should, at least, be a thorough \n     and dispassionate inquiry into the consequences of such \n     action.\n           Sincerely,\n     William H. Rehnquist.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               Judicial Conference\n\n\n                                         of the United States,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 3, 2003.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: This provides the views of the Judicial \n     Conference of the United States with regard to Section 109 \n     (``Sentencing Reform'') of S. 151, the ``Child Abduction \n     Prevention Act,'' as passed by the House of Representatives \n     on March 27, 2003. The Judicial Conference strongly opposes \n     several of these sentencing provisions because they undermine \n     the basic structure of the sentencing system and impair the \n     ability of courts to impose just and responsible sentences.\n       At the outset, we must note our concern and disappointment \n     with the lack of careful review and consideration that this \n     proposal has received. While it constitutes one of the most \n     fundamental changes to the basic structure of sentencing in \n     the federal criminal justice system in nearly two decades, \n     the review by Congress to date consists of a hearing at the \n     subcommittee level in the House of Representatives on only \n     part of Section 109 and limited debate on an amendment on the \n     House floor. The Senate has held no hearings on this \n     legislation at all. Neither the Judicial Conference nor the \n     Sentencing Commission has been given a fair opportunity to \n     consider and comment on this proposal. In our opinion, \n     provisions that would have a significant impact on the \n     administration of criminal justice should not be resolved \n     without careful study and deliberation. The risk of \n     unintended consequences should not be taken on such an \n     important matter.\n       Section 109(a) of this bill would amend 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 3553(b) to restrict courts' authority to depart downward \n     from the sentencing guideline range to those situations \n     specifically identified by the Sentencing Commission as \n     grounds for downward departures. The Sentencing Reform Act of \n     1984 created a system of prescriptive sentencing, but \n     Congress wisely recognized that any system that provides for \n     sentencing based upon fixed sentencing factors should include \n     a means to impose a just and responsible sentence on the rare \n     defendant whose offense is not addressed by those sentencing \n     factors. The means chosen was to allow for either upward or \n     downward departures if the court finds ``an aggravating or \n     mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not \n     adequately considered by the Sentencing Commission.'' This \n     system recognizes that a court should possess the authority \n     to consider unforseen circumstances it deems relevant to \n     sentencing determinations, and we urge the current system be \n     retained.\n       Sections 109(b), (g) and (i) make specific changes to \n     existing sentencing guidelines to among other things, \n     restrict the bases for downward departures. The Judicial \n     Conference opposes direct congressional amendment of the \n     sentencing guidelines because such amendments undermine the \n     basic premise in establishment of the Commission--that an \n     independent body of experts appointed by the President and \n     confirmed by the Senate is best suited to develop and refine \n     sentencing guidelines. We recommend instead that the \n     Sentencing Commission be directed by Congress to study the \n     amendment of any particular guideline and either adjust the \n     guideline or report to Congress the basis for its contrary \n     decision.\n       Section 109(d) would alter the standard of appellate court \n     review of departure decisions from ``due deference'' \n     regarding a sentencing judge's application of the guidelines \n     to a ``de novo'' standard of review. In Koon v. United \n     States, 518 U.S. 81 (1996), the Supreme Court interpreted the \n     ``due deference'' standard to require appellate courts to \n     review district court departure decisions for abuse of \n     discretion. The Judicial Conference opposes rescission of the \n     current standard, which recognizes that district judges are \n     better positioned to decide departures, and the substitution \n     of de novo review, which would not adequately guide courts in \n     subsequent departure cases that, by their very nature, are \n     not amenable to useful generalization.\n       Section 109(h) would amend 28 U.S.C. Sec. 994(w) to require \n     the chief judge of each district to assure that certain \n     sentencing records, including the judgment, statement of \n     reasons plea agreement, indictment or information, and \n     presentence report, are forwarded to the Sentencing \n     Commission. Current law, by contrast, requires the sentencing \n     court or other officer to transmit to the Sentencing \n     Commission a ``written report of the sentence'' and other \n     information as determined by the Sentencing Commission, \n     recognizing that the Commission is best able to determine the \n     information it needs to fulfill its statutory \n     responsibilities. We oppose this additional burden upon the \n     courts.\n       This section would further require the Commission, upon \n     request, to provide these newly specified documents to the \n     Senate and House Judiciary Committees. This provision raises \n     two serious concerns. First, presentence reports are retained \n     within the control of the courts and the Department of \n     Justice in order to protect the safety and privacy of \n     individuals identified in the course of criminal prosecutions \n     and sentencings. In the absence of strict accommodations to \n     protect this sensitive information, we believe this practice \n     should be retained. Second, we oppose the systematic \n     dissemination outside the court system of judge-identifying \n     information in criminal case files. The Sentencing Commission \n     compiles and releases annually comprehensive \n\n[[Page S5121]]\n\n     statistics on all federal sentences. Among other things, \n     this data provides for each court the percentage of \n     defendants who receive substantial assistance departures \n     and the percentage of defendants who receive other \n     downward departures. We urge Congress to meet its \n     responsibility to oversee the functioning of the criminal \n     justice system through use of this and other information \n     without subjecting individual judges to the risk of unfair \n     criticism in isolated cases where the record may not fully \n     reflect the events leading up to and informing the judge's \n     decision in a particular case.\n       In the event that Congress determines to go forward with \n     this legislation, we urge that, at the least, the Judiciary \n     Committees await the results of ongoing studies into downward \n     departures being conducted by the Sentencing Commission and \n     the General Accounting Office. To underline this point, an \n     Associate Deputy Attorney General testified to a House \n     Judiciary subcommittee why the ``disturbing trend'' in \n     downward departures in non-immigration cases on grounds other \n     than substantial assistance to the government justified \n     ``long overdue reform'' in sentencing procedures. The \n     Department of Justice statement cited statistics to prove \n     this point; that is, these downward departures rose from 9.6 \n     percent of cases in FY 1996 to 14.7 percent of cases in 2001. \n     The fact is that there were 5,825 more non-substantial \n     assistance downward departures in FY 2001 than in FY 1996. Of \n     the increase, 4,057 occurred in the five southwest ``border \n     court'' districts and 1,755 occurred in the other 89 United \n     States district courts. In other words, the ``border'' \n     districts accounted for almost 70 percent of the increase. \n     The ``disturbing trend'' is not a national trend, but one \n     more vivid measure of the crisis in the administration of \n     criminal justice on the border. S. 151 recognizes that high \n     downward departures in the border courts are a special \n     circumstance and cannot be eliminated. By no means do \n     ``border court'' problems and statistics support the \n     elimination of this type of downward departures in all other \n     district courts.\n       It is also important to note that, popular conceptions \n     notwithstanding, the fact that a defendant is granted a \n     ``downward departures'' does not mean that the defendant was \n     not punished adequately for the crime. Eight-five percent of \n     defendants granted non-substantial assistance departures in \n     FY 2001 were sentenced to prison.\n       Finally, we strongly recommend that, after the data on \n     downward departures is compiled and analyzed, hearings be \n     held so that the views of the various entities with interest \n     in federal criminal sentencing can be carefully considered \n     with regard to the ramifications of his proposal. Congress \n     should not alter the sensitive structure of the sentencing \n     system without reasonable certainty as to the consequences of \n     such legislation.\n       We appreciate your consideration of the views of the \n     Judicial Conference on this significant legislation. If you \n     have any questions regarding these views, please do not \n     hesitate to contact me at 202/273-3000. If you prefer, you \n     may have your staff contact Michael W. Blommer of the Office \n     of Legislative Affairs at 202/502-1700.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Leonidas Ralph Mecham,\n     Secretary.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   U.S. Sentencing Commission,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 2, 2003.\n     Subject: S. 151/H.R. 1104, the ``Child Abduction Prevention \n         Act.''\n\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Hart Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Hatch and Leahy: We, the voting members of \n     the United States Sentencing Commission, join in expressing \n     our concerns over the amendment entitled ``Sentencing \n     Reform'' recently attached to the Child Abduction Prevention \n     Act of 2003, H.R. 1104, 108th Cong. (2003) (hereinafter \n     ``H.R. 1104''). In the past, with an issue of such magnitude, \n     Congress has directed that the Commission conduct a review \n     and analysis which would be incorporated in a report back to \n     Congress. The Commission is uniquely qualified to serve \n     Congress by conducting such studies due to its ability to \n     analyze its vast database, obtain the views and comments of \n     the various segments of the federal criminal justice \n     community, review the academic literature, and report back to \n     Congress in a timely manner. Indeed, such a process is \n     contemplated by the original legislation which established \n     the Commission over 15 years ago. See 28 U.S.C. Sec. 994(o).\n       It is the Commission's understanding that the impetus for \n     this proposed amendment to H.R. 1104 was congressional \n     concern over the increasing rate of departures from guideline \n     sentences for reasons other than substantial assistance. We \n     share this concern. In fact, the Commission is undertaking an \n     expansive review and analysis of all non-substantial \n     assistance departures. That work has already yielded \n     important preliminary data.\n       Based on this preliminary data, it appears that there are a \n     number of factors that need to be examined and understood \n     before drawing conclusions on the non-substantial assistance \n     departure rate. One such factor is the impact on the non-\n     substantial assistance departure rate resulting from policies \n     implemented in a number of districts in an effort to deal \n     with high volume immigration caseloads. For example, in 2001, \n     the overall non-substantial assistance departure rate was \n     18.3 percent. If those districts with departure policies \n     crafted to address these high volume immigration caseloads \n     are filtered out, the non-substantial assistance departure \n     rate is reduced to 10.2 percent.\n       In addition to the impact of the problems unique to \n     districts with high volume immigration caseloads, other \n     factors deserve analysis:\n       (1) the impact, if any, of departures for reasons other \n     than substantial assistance that are the subject of plea \n     agreements and the extent of judicial oversight of such plea \n     agreements;\n       (2) the extent to which courts depart for reasons \n     identified by the Sentencing Commission and specified in the \n     guidelines as compared to factors unmentioned in the \n     guidelines;\n       (3) the extent, if at all, of disparity in departures \n     within circuits and districts and whether such disparities \n     may be unwarranted;\n       (4) the advisability of creating different grounds for \n     upward and downward departures;\n       (5) the extent of appeals of departures; and\n       (6) whether there are particular offense types that reflect \n     unwarranted rates of departure.\n       When Congress created the Sentencing Commission as part of \n     the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, it did so with the idea \n     that the Sentencing Commission would establish policies that \n     would provide certainty and fairness in sentencing and would \n     avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities among defendants. \n     See 28 U.S.C. Sec. 991(b)(1). Congress also recognized, \n     however, that guideline sentences would not fit all cases and \n     instructed the Commission to maintain sufficient flexibility \n     in the drafting of guidelines to permit individualized \n     sentences when warranted by mitigating or aggravating factors \n     not otherwise taken into account. See 28 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 991(b)(1)(B). Based on this congressional policy, the \n     Commission developed the concept of permitting courts to \n     depart either upwards or downwards in unusual or atypical \n     cases that fell outside the ``heartland'' of a particular \n     guideline. The Commission adopted the departure policy not \n     only to carry out congressional intent but also in \n     recognition of the limits of adopting a perfect guideline \n     system that would address all human conduct that might be \n     relevant to a sentencing decision. Such a policy also was \n     important in order to give feedback to the Commission as to \n     whether a particular guideline should be reexamined because \n     of an unusually high upward or downward departure rate. These \n     departures have developed over time and have been adjusted \n     throughout the history of the guidelines with the benefit of \n     input from Congress, the federal criminal justice community, \n     and considerable sentencing data.\n       We would note that there are numerous non-substantial \n     assistance departures, both upward and downward, that appear \n     in other than Chapter Five of the Guidelines Manual. The \n     proposed amendment to H.R. 1104 deletes many of these \n     departure provisions. For example, Chapter Four provides for \n     a departure if the court finds that a defendant's criminal \n     history category significantly either under- or over-\n     represents the seriousness of a defendant's criminal history. \n     See USSG Sec. 4A1.3. Similarly, USSG Sec. 2B1.1 in Chapter \n     Two provides for a departure either up or down if the court \n     determines that the offense level, which is primarily \n     determined by the amount of the loss, either substantially \n     under- or over-states the seriousness of the offense. Were \n     the proposed amendment to be adopted, it would bar a court \n     from downwardly departing in an appropriate case in each of \n     the above examples.\n       The amendments being proposed in this legislation change \n     not only departure guideline policy, but also alter the \n     traditional way in which guideline revisions are implemented. \n     The Commission would respectfully suggest that in order for \n     the Commission to fulfill its statutory purposes as well as \n     be of assistance to Congress in addressing its concern with \n     respect to increased departure rates--a concern which the \n     Commission shares--Congress might instead direct the \n     Commission to review departures, recommend changes where \n     appropriate, and then report back to Congress within 180 \n     days. Such an approach would be in accordance with the \n     procedure set forth by Congress when it established the \n     Commission as well as with historical precedent. See 28 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 994(o).\n       Thank you for your consideration of our concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n     Diana E. Murphy,\n       Chair.\n     Ruben Castillo,\n       Vice Chair.\n     John R. Steer,\n       Vice Chair.\n     William K. Sessions, III,\n       Vice Chair.\n     Michael O'Neill,\n       Commissioner.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). The Senator from Utah.\n\n[[Page S5122]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I don't know anybody on the Senate floor \nwho can roar better than my ``lion'' friend from Massachusetts. He is a \ngreat Senator. And he certainly feels very deeply on this issue. \nApparently I have irritated him, and I feel sorry about that, but he is \ntotally wrong in what he says. I can see why he might feel that way.\n  Now, let me just say this, that I believe the letters that he was \nreferring to, with regard to the courts of this country complaining \nabout this, were before the compromise we enacted in this particular \nconference report. I got a lot of complaints, too. That is why I tried \nto make the change and worked it out with Chairman Sensenbrenner and \nothers in the House who were not very happy to make the change.\n  My friend called and said: Can you do something in this area? I said \nI would try, which I did. And we came up with the Hatch-Graham-\nSensenbrenner amendment. I apologize for my voice, but I have semi-\nlaryngitis. But we came up with the Hatch-Graham-Sensenbrenner \namendment, which I believed moved this in the right direction and I \nthought would please my friend from Massachusetts, but it did not.\n  Now, it needs to be pointed out that this is a bipartisan conference \nreport. On the Senate side, we voted for this report 5 to 2, meaning it \nwas bipartisan. On the House side, they voted in larger numbers for \nthis report.\n  I have to mention that neither the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts nor the distinguished Senator from Vermont signed the \nconference report, so they did not agree with it. And I understand that \nthey are upset about the language in the report. I cannot help that.\n  But we are talking about only 2 percent of the cases that are \naffected by this departure language--only 2 percent of all the cases. I \nthought I did a pretty good job in getting it done.\n  I have to mention one other thing: the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts talking about a blacklist for judges, because he claims \nthat these reports have to be sent to the Attorney General.\n  Well, remember, sometimes Attorneys General are Republican and \nsometimes they are Democrat. I think most Attorneys General really try \nto do a good job. I know the current one is trying to do his best job \nagainst crime in this society. The current Attorney General approved \nand was for the original Feeney language--which we changed--and so were \nmany Members of the House. They were not happy with this change.\n  Let me just make some points here that are important. It is not \nsurprising that the American Civil Liberties Union, the Federal Public \nDefenders, the American Bar Association, and the Judicial Conference \nhave opposed the Feeney amendment.\n  One seriously wonders what would have been heard from the ABA, the \nACLU, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, and others if upward \ndepartures--in other words, making it tougher on crime--had grown at \nthe absurd and dizzying rates that downward departures have.\n  Can anyone seriously believe that they would have been asking for \nmore time to study this issue if upward departures had gone out of \ncontrol, like these downward departures, that are skyrocketing?\n  So everybody in our country understands, we have judges on the \nbench--not many, but enough--who, in these child molestation, child \ndegradation, and child pornography cases--these children's criminal \ncases--who are continually reducing the sentences recommended by the \nSentencing Commission for these criminals who are hurting our children.\n\n  Look at this chart. Since 1991, when there were 1,241 downward \ndepartures--or lesser sentences for these types of people--we are now \nup to 4,098 in 2001. And I am sure it was much higher for 2002 and that \nfor 2003 it will be much higher.\n  Can anyone seriously believe that these liberal groups would be \nasking for more time to study this issue, as is being asked for here? I \nsuspect there would be a loud, steady drumbeat for swift legislative \naction by Congress to stop such an outrage--not more time for the \nSentencing Commission to study the issue--that is, if the upward \ndepartures, in other words, the tougher on crime departures, were \nfollowed by the courts. Well, that isn't the case. These are downward \ndepartures, making it easier on these pedophiles, sex criminals, child \nrapists, child pornographers.\n  I further suspect that these groups would not have waited as long and \nas patiently as we have in watching downward departures increase \nsteadily year after year, making it easy on criminals who do these \ntypes of things to our children.\n  Additionally, I am not surprised the Judicial Conference is opposed \nto this amendment, if it is.\n  It is important to note, however, the compromise is limited to these \nserious crimes against children and sex crimes. But because the problem \nof downward departures is acute across the board, the compromise \nproposal would direct the Sentencing Commission to timely conduct a \nthorough study of these issues, develop concrete measures to prevent \nand limit this abuse--this abuse of downward departures, making it easy \non child molesters--and report these matters back to Congress.\n  In fact, to place this matter in historical context, in debate on the \nSentencing Reform Act, the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts \nobserved, with respect to the Judicial Conference and sentencing \ndisparity, the following:\n\n       With all due respect to the Judicial Conference, the judges \n     themselves have not been willing to face this issue and to \n     make recommendations and to try and remedy this situation.\n\n  He acknowledges that some judges are out of control on these issues. \nAnd I think this chart shows they are out of control in children's \ncases, and it is time to stop it. That is what this bill does.\n  Along these lines, consider the following disparity, demonstrating \nthe increasing undermining of the sentencing guidelines by some of \nthese judges. The average downward departure rate for nonsubstantial \nassistance cases in the Fourth Circuit is 5.2 percent, while in the \nTenth Circuit it is 23.3 percent. The average downward departure rates \nare making for easier sentences for these sex criminals. It is this \ntype of sentencing disparity that risks turning our criminal justice \nsystem of sentencing into--to borrow yet another phrase from Senator \nKennedy on this issue--``a system of roulette.''\n  I urge support for this conference bill. It squarely increases \npunishment for child-related crimes and ensures that those who commit \nthese crimes are incarcerated accordingly. And it says the game is over \nfor judges: You will have some departure guidelines from the Sentencing \nCommission, but you are not going to go beyond those, and you are not \ngoing to go on doing what is happening in our society today on \nchildren's crimes, no matter how softhearted you are. That is what we \nare trying to do here. We are tired of it. I am tired of having \nchildren abused. This bill will go a long way toward stopping that kind \nof abuse.\n  Let me talk about departure rates and the amounts for child-related \ncrimes. The conference report addresses the glaring penalty gaps that \nexist in the sentencing guidelines. The bill represents a compromise \nfrom various points of view. I did my best to try to get a compromise \nthat I hoped my colleagues on the other side would be happy with.\n  They are not, some of them. But I have to say that the distinguished \nSenator from Delaware was. He voted with us on this conference report, \nas he should have. I believe others on the committee should have also. \nFor instance, there was one view that believed all downward departures \nshould be banned, all of them. That was a view by some. The Feeney \namendment, approved in the House before conference, moderated that view \nby merely limiting departures. I cosponsored an amendment in the \nconference with Chairman Sensenbrenner and Senator Graham that we have \nbeen talking about that went even further by limiting departures \nrelated to crimes victimizing children. This bill puts a stop to the \nvery troubling practice of certain trial courts which depart from the \nsentencing guidelines in crimes involving children and sex crimes.\n  The following very troubling statistics related to child crimes \ndemonstrate why this is necessary. According to the Sentencing \nCommission's 2001 Sourcebook of Federal Sentencing Statistics, trial \ncourts reduce the sentence of those convicted of sexual\n\n[[Page S5123]]\n\nabuse of children from the guidelines over 16 percent of the time. \nThink of it. Why do we have these sentencing rules to begin with if \nthey are not going to be followed, especially in these children's \ncases?\n  On average, child courts reduce the sentences of those convicted of \nsexual abuse by an astonishing 63 percent from the guideline range. I \nwould think my colleagues would want to put a stop to that kind of \ninappropriate decisionmaking by some judges. For those convicted of \npornography and/or prostitution-related offenses, trial courts departed \nfrom the recommended guidelines over 18 percent of the time, reducing \nthese defendants' sentences by a staggering 66 percent. Think about it. \nWe are going to let that continue just because some of these groups \ndon't like it or want to be more compassionate towards these criminals? \nThis many departures and this amount of sentencing reductions are \nastounding given the trauma inflicted on victims of these particular \ntypes of offenses, and require us in Congress to step in and ensure the \nsentences in these areas remain uniform and consistent with national \nexpectations.\n  Let me add an overall perspective to this compromise. The compromise \nagreed to in conference will affect only crimes against children and \nsex crimes; that is, sexual abuse, pornography, prostitution, and \nkidnapping/hostage taking. These types of cases represent only 2 \npercent of the Federal criminal caseload. This is only 2 percent of the \ncases that would have been affected by the original Feeney amendment--\nthey all would have been affected by the original Feeney amendment--and \nonly 2 percent of the cases that would have been affected by the \nversion that passed the House by an overwhelming 357 to 58 vote. And we \nhave complaints about this?\n  Hopefully in the future the Sentencing Commission will more closely \nmonitor these types of disparities and will step in to fix these \nproblems in a timely manner. However, when they do not, it is incumbent \nupon the Congress to do so. That is precisely what this bill does. We \nsay in this bill: We are sick of this, judges. You are not going to do \nthis anymore except within the guidelines set by the Sentencing \nCommission. There will be downward departures, but they will meet the \nguidelines and not just be off-of-the-top departures like the 190 pound \nman, five feet 11, almost six feet tall, who had committed a child \ncrime and got reduced 400 percent or more.\n  It is absurd to suggest the Sentencing Commission should be given \ntime to study this issue. The Sentencing Commission has been aware that \nCongress was greatly concerned about this problem since the year 2000, \neven before then. Indeed, these very issues were squarely raised with \nthe Sentencing Commission during the Senate hearing in October 2000. \nBoth Senators Thurmond and Sessions directed many questions at the \ncommissioners and others about their concerns that trial judges \nsystematically undermine the sentencing guidelines by creating new \nreasons to reduce these sentences.\n  Indeed, Senator Sessions expressed his concerns about the troubling \ntrend of departures based on novel and creative reasons directly to the \nchair of the Sentencing Commission.\n  Senators Thurmond and Sessions were assured the Sentencing Commission \nintended to address this issue by including it in a larger report due \nNovember 2002, addressing how well the guidelines were accomplishing \nthe statutory purposes of sentencing. It is now 6 months beyond the due \ndate, and no such report has been produced. In fact, the Sentencing \nCommission announced just this past March it has completed portions of \nthe report on cocaine sentencing and surveys related to Federal judges.\n  However, as to the departure issues raised at the Senate hearing, the \nSentencing Commission continues to study the issue, 2 years, 3 years \nlater. It is apparent this issue, while an obvious priority to the \nCongress, is simply not a priority to the Sentencing Commission. And we \nhave done something about it in this conference report that has \nbipartisan support. After having decided we can no longer be held \nhostage to the schedule set to study this issue by the Sentencing \nCommission, only to watch it unilaterally change, action is now even \nmore necessary.\n  It has now been over 2 years since Congress highlighted this problem \nin an oversight hearing. Further delay would effectively abdicate our \nresponsibilities as legislators and politically accountable members of \nour society, something the Sentencing Commission and the ACLU and the \nABA and other groups are not.\n  With regard to the Hatch-Sensenbrenner-Graham compromise amendment, \nthis amendment limits, but does not prevent, downward departures only \nto enumerated factors for crimes against children in sex offenses \nincluding, one, kidnapping; two, kidnapping involving a minor victim; \ntwo, sex trafficking of children; three, sexual abuse crimes; four, \nsexual exploitation and other abuse of children; five, transportation \nfor illegal sexual activity and related crimes; and, six, obscenity. \nChanges in the standard for review of sentencing matters for all cases \nin Federal courts to a de novo review while factual determinations \nwould continue to be subjected to ``a clearly erroneous'' standard.\n  We require the courts to give specific and written reasons for any \ndeparture from the guidelines. That is a logical thing to do. We \nrequire the judges to report sentencing decisions to the Sentencing \nCommission. They don't like that because that means more work. I have \nto confess, I sympathize somewhat with these judges because they are \nbeing paid less than a number of law review graduates in their first \nyear in private practice. The fact they don't want to increase their \nworkload, I don't blame them for that. But it seems to me in this case, \nit is certainly justified.\n  Contrary to the oft repeated claims of the opponents, the compromise \nproposal is not a mandatory minimum. Judges handling these important \ncriminal cases can sometimes exercise discretion to depart downward, \nbut only when the Sentencing Commission specifies the factors that \nwarrant a downward departure, only when they have the right to do so as \nlisted by the Sentencing Commission. That seems to me just a gimmick. \nYet we have had all this fuss and bother over this.\n  Requiring de novo review of a trial judge's application of the facts \nto the law is totally reasonable. This is the same standard that \napplies to appellate review of critical motions to suppress physical or \ntestimonial evidence. There is no reason for appellate judges to give \ndeference to the trial judge in such questions of law.\n  Even after my compromise amendment, the trial judge's factual \ndeterminations would still be subject to great deference under a \n``clearly erroneous'' standard. If a discretionary downward departure \nis justifiable, it is difficult to understand why anyone would be \nopposed to the appellate court's reviewing them under the same standard \nthat applies to other important areas of law.\n  I hope my colleagues are not obstructing this bill, because they are \nupset they didn't get their way in the conference--when, in fact, they \nwere defeated 5 to 2 on these issues. To suggest the conference report \nsuffers from a procedural flaw, I think, is going way too far. They \nargue, incredibly, that the Hatch-Sensenbrenner-Graham amendment to the \nFeeney amendment to the House bill was improperly modified in \nconference. That is simply ridiculous and we all know it. What occurred \nwas straightforward.\n\n  In response to Democratic concerns raised about the drafting of the \nHatch-Sensenbrenner-Graham amendment to the conference report, we made \na number of technical changes to comport with Democratic Senator \nBiden's understanding of the amendment, as well as concerns raised by a \nCongressman during the conference, as to the meaning of one particular \nprovision. In good faith, my staff addressed these technical drafting \nissues and made certain revisions to comport with these Democratic \nsuggestions.\n  Senator Biden was right. I agreed with these changes. Senator Biden \nagreed with these changes as well. He voted for the conference report. \nKeep in mind these changes had the effect of cutting back on the \nrestrictions contained in the Feeney amendment as it applies to \nsentencing decisions by judges to ensure that the restrictions apply \nonly in a limited category of cases. In the end, Democratic members\n\n[[Page S5124]]\n\nto the conference report--Senator Biden and Representatives Frost, \nHinojosa, and Matheson--all supported the conference report.\n  For some Democratic members to now complain about the process is \nsimply unfair, and I question those positions. I would like to refer to \nthe transcript my colleague was referring to because he believes I \nrepresented one thing when in fact I meant another.\n  Let me start with line 759:\n\n       Chairman Hatch. The proposed amendment would, and I hope my \n     colleague from Massachusetts will listen carefully to this--\n     Ted, if I could get you to listen to this.\n       Senator Kennedy. Yes.\n       Chairman Hatch. Because, hopefully, this will help some of \n     your concerns.\n       The proposed amendment would limit, but not prevent, \n     downward departures only to enumerated factors for crimes \n     against children and sex offenses, including: one, kidnapping \n     at Section 1201; two, sex trafficking of children, Section \n     1591; three, sexual abuse crimes, Chapter 109(a); four, \n     sexual exploitation and other abuse of children, Chapter 110; \n     and five, transportation for illegal sexual activity and \n     related crimes. That's Chapter 117, and also Chapter 71, \n     dealing with obscenity, I've been informed.\n       It will change the standard for review of sentencing \n     matters for appellate courts to a de novo review, while \n     factual determinations would continue to be subject to the \n     ``clearly erroneous'' standard.\n       It would require courts to give specific and written \n     reasons for any departure from the guidelines.\n       It will require judges to report sentencing decisions to \n     the Sentencing Commission.\n       The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 was designed, as Congress \n     wrote in the text of that bill, ``to provide certainty and \n     fairness in meeting the purposes of sentencing, avoiding \n     unwarranted sentencing disparities among defendants with \n     similar records who have been found guilty of similar \n     criminal conduct.''\n       Now, while the United States Sentencing Commission \n     promulgated sentencing guidelines to meet this laudable goal, \n     courts have strayed further and further from this system of \n     fair and consistent sentencing over the past decade.\n       The rate of discretionary downward departures, excluding \n     downward departures for defendants' cooperation, has \n     increased virtually every year since 1991.\n\n  But now Chairman Sensenbrenner--and I don't know whether the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts was there at the time; maybe he was not there. \nChairman Sensenbrenner made it very clear. He said:\n\n       Now there are several other issues that I think have got to \n     be addressed. First of all, with respect to the standards of \n     appellate review, that applies to all cases and it is a de \n     novo review.\n\n  That is what we understood.\n\n       This is in direct response to the Supreme Court's decision \n     in the case of Koon v. United States. Now, you may recall \n     this involved a conviction for a civil rights violation of \n     one of the police officers accused of beating up Rodney King, \n     which we all saw on TV.\n\n  The point is, I think everybody else there recognized what the Hatch-\nSensenbrenner-Graham amendment was meant to be. I feel badly that my \ncolleague feels like he was misled, because I don't think I misled him. \nI think the language I just read shows I didn't. I acknowledge and I \nexpress sorrow that he feels the way he does. I feel badly he feels the \nway he does because I would never deliberately mislead a colleague \nunder any circumstances. I might make a mistake or forget something I \nmight have said earlier, or something like that, but I would never \ndeliberately mislead a colleague. I certainly didn't in this case. I \ndon't think anybody there understood it the way it is being seen \nthrough the eyes of some on the other side.\n  I think to blow up this conference report over this is not only a \nmistake, it is a failure to recognize the tremendously irritating and \ndamaging downward departure situation going on in the country today--\nletting these criminals off with regard to children's crimes.\n  I would add that the Reno Justice Department argued in the Koon case \nfor a de novo standard for appellate review. This was the right \nargument to make.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me finish first. It was a position supported by the \nCongressional Black Caucus. I have a copy of that letter. Let me read \nit:\n\n       As members of the Congressional Black Caucus, we are \n     writing to you because of our concern about the sentencing of \n     Officer Laurence Powell and Sergeant Stacey Koon by Judge \n     John Davies in the Rodney King civil rights case.\n       We are troubled that the sentence for the crime was reduced \n     to 30 months upon the court's consideration of mitigating \n     facts. Such a reduction for mitigating factors may be \n     appropriate in other circumstances. However, we feel that the \n     defendant's special status as police officers, with special \n     duties owed to the public, should have militated against such \n     a significant reduction.\n       As you well know, the maximum possible penalty was ten \n     years and fines of up to $250,000. Your federal prosecutors \n     were asking for seven to nine years. Our federal sentencing \n     guidelines recommended minimum sentences in a range of four \n     to seven years in prison.\n       Instead, Judge John Davies made broad use of subjective \n     factors. He stated that he read only letters addressed to him \n     from the friends and families of Officer Powell and Sergeant \n     Koon. He argued that much of the violence visited on Rodney \n     King was justified by King's own actions. However, these \n     officers were convicted on charges of violating Rodney King's \n     civil rights. We believe these mitigating factors did not \n     justify so large a reduction given the defendants' special \n     responsibilities as police officers.\n       In addition, Judge Davies did not afford proper weight to \n     the racist comments made over police radio by those convicted \n     on the night of the beating in discounting race as a \n     motivation for the beating. He similarly failed to take into \n     account the remarkable lack of remorse shown by Officer \n     Powell and Sergeant Koon since their conviction.\n       People of good will all over this country and of all races \n     were heartened when Officer Powell and Sergeant Koon were \n     convicted by a jury of their peers, a verdict made possible \n     by the Justice Department's resolve to file civil rights \n     charges and by the phenomenal performance of federal \n     prosecutors. With these severely reduced sentences, however, \n     we are sending a mixed message. Are police officers going to \n     be held responsible for excessive use of force or not?\n       We think what has been lost, in all this, is that police \n     officers have an enhanced responsibility to uphold the law.\n       Notwithstanding Judge Davies' authority to modify the \n     sentencing guidelines, most experts agreed that the minimum \n     four to seven years sentence should have been followed in \n     this case.\n       We realize that the trial judge is afforded sufficient \n     latitude in sentencing, but we urge the Department of Justice \n     to appeal these sentences. We need to reexamine these \n     sentences so that justice can finally be done in this \n     difficult, painful case. Only then can we begin to put this \n     behind us.\n\n  It is signed by a large number of good Members of Congress.\n  What we have proposed is that there should be de novo review. We set \na standard that is not an easy standard to overcome. We have shown that \nwe have an outrageous situation in this country where a number of \njudges have been giving extra downward departures far in excess of what \nanybody in their right mind would think they should do.\n  This is happening in criminal cases where children are victims, and \nwe are trying to stop that because we think there has to be \nresponsibility here. We believe that in these child molestation cases, \npornography cases, prostitution cases, child rape cases, and kidnaping \ncases the sentencing guidelines ought to be followed.\n  Nothing says these judges cannot follow the downward departure \nguidelines if they so choose in their discretion as the trial judges, \nbut they can no longer conjure up reasons outside the guidelines to \nreduce criminals' sentences.\n  Basically, that is what the conference report says. I would think \neveryone in this body would vote for this conference report. I think it \ndoes it right and does what we said it would do in the conference, and \nit does what a bipartisan majority in the House and the Senate said it \nshould do. Frankly, I believe that is right.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. From the outset, the underlying legislation, the Amber \nalert legislation, the virtual pornography legislation passed through \nthe Senate unanimously twice. There is no controversy concerning the \nunderlying legislation; the controversy that has arisen came up because \nof an amendment offered by Congressman Feeney of Florida which found \nits way into the House version of the bill and then became a subject \nmatter in the conference.\n  I ask the Senator from Utah this: There appears to be a legitimate \ndifference of opinion, but a very important difference of opinion, \nabout the chart that he has brought to the Chamber. I received, and I \nbelieve he also received, a letter from the president of the American \nBar Association yesterday. The American Bar Association president wrote \nto us talking about the\n\n[[Page S5125]]\n\nso-called downward departures where a decision is made by a judge to \nimpose a sentence below the recommended minimum. He said:\n\n       In fiscal year 2001--\n\n  The last year shown on the Senator's chart--\n\n     of 19,416 downward departures awarded Federal defendants, \n     approximately 15,318 came on Government motion.\n\n  Put another way, in 2001, 7 percent of downward departures in the \nUnited States were requested by the prosecutor, by the Government.\n  I know the Senator from Utah sees it differently, but I would like to \nask him in good faith--this is a good-faith question--many of us are \nconcerned about sentencing guidelines, whether they are too strong or \ntoo weak and whether we should reassess them. I think that was the \nreason the Senator from Massachusetts offered that approach in the \nconference. Would the Senator from Utah, in an effort to try to bring \ntogether what he has asked for, bipartisan support, to give us his \npromise that he would look into a hearing relative to the sentencing \nguidelines so that we can finally bring to rest these questions of fact \nbehind the downward departures and whether we need to look anew at some \nof these sentencing guidelines.\n  Many of us think that hearing and conversation is long overdue. If \nthe chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee would agree to such a \nhearing, that might move us closer to the adoption of this conference \nreport.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I personally believe we can do that. We did have a hearing \nin 2000. The hearing was extensive and led to this legislation. By the \nway, the number on the chart excluded departure requests made by the \nprosecutors under Section 5K1.1 of the Guidelines, when a defendant \nprovides ``substantial assistance'' to the government. We counted 4,098 \ndownward departures excluding the so-called ``5K1.1 motions'' made by \nthe government. The number of downward departures has risen from 1,241 \nin 1991. Any Senator should see that this increase is the reason for \nour concern.\n  I do not disagree with the distinguished Senator. I think it would be \ngood to find out what the Senator wants to know, and that is, if I \nunderstand him correctly, he is asking for a hearing on downward \ndepartures.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield further.\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I hope that we can have a hearing that might go beyond \nthat specific question and to the broader question about sentencing \nguidelines today.\n  Mr. HATCH. I would certainly ask the Subcommittee on Crime to do \nthat.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from Utah, there have been many \ntimes that I have voted for stiff penalties, as he has, for crimes, but \nI can also tell the Senator from Utah that I have visited, for example, \nthe Federal women's prison in Illinois, and I have seen some situations \nthere that I think are awful. They are miscarriages of justice for \nthese women to be sentenced to 5, 10, 15, 20 years because of an angry \nboyfriend snitching on them and really assessing liability against \nthem.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me interrupt the Senator for one second. I agree with \nthe Senator. I have seen the girlfriend courier go to prison for 10 \nyears when she did not even know what was in the package, or at least \nclaimed she did not, while the boyfriend, the drug dealer, pleaded \nState's evidence and gets off. Frankly, I do not like that either.\n  I think we should hold hearings on this, and I will be happy to \nrecommend it to the Crime Subcommittee or if it should be elevated to \nthe full committee, we can perhaps do that. I appreciate the \ndistinguished Senator's willingness to try and help us resolve this \ntoday because this bill needs to pass. I do not see how anybody can \nrefute what I have been saying here. I do not see how anyone would not \nwant to get tougher with sentencing with regard to these sexual crimes, \nespecially when they have gone way outside the downward departure \nlimits the Sentencing Commission gives them. We do not stop trial \njudges from granting downward departures, but they should be done in \ncompliance with the purposes of the sentencing guidelines.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I may respond to the chairman of the committee, I do \nnot think the Senator would have any argument from any Member of the \nSenate, nor would we be here this moment, if he just confined the \nchanges in conference to crimes involving children, sexual molestation. \nI think he will find unanimous approval of that. The fact we have gone \nin to de novo review to these departures applies to all crimes. That is \nwhy I am asking we take a look at the broad expanse of the sentencing \nguidelines.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am not willing to redo this bill because the conference \nis over. A vast majority has supported it in the House--a huge \nmajority--and a bipartisan majority on the conference. But I am \ncertainly willing to look at it. If we need to modify what we have done \nhere today, I will certainly look at that.\n\n  I feel badly the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts feels he \nwas misled, but I do not see how he was misled. I can see there was an \nambiguity if one did not look at the whole record. He may not have been \nthere when we decided to use Chairman Sensenbrenner's language, which \nwas clear and specific. I thought mine was clear, but Chairman \nSensenbrenner's language was more clear than mine. I think everybody \nthere understood.\n  The distinguished Senator from Massachusetts and the distinguished \nSenator from Vermont, the ranking member, the Democrat leader on the \ncommittee, refused to sign the conference report over perhaps this \nmisunderstanding, but it is a misunderstanding, not a desire by me to \ndo something that is improper.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator for his comments here today. Those \nare good points he made, and we will see what we can do.\n  Let me make a couple other comments before I finish. Let me provide \nsome additional examples of sentencing departure abuse and why we want \nto change this and why this bill makes a very good step in the right \ndirection.\n  In one case, a defendant who was convicted of possessing child porn \nimages, over 280 images, more than 10 of which were clearly identified \nas prepubescent children, was sentenced to serve 13 months in prison \nand 14 months in home detention, even though the defendant's lawful \nguidelines sentencing range was 27 to 33 months in prison. Think about \nthat.\n  At sentencing, the defendant threw in the kitchen sink and moved for \na departure on multiple grounds. He argued that his status as a former \nprison guard rendered him as particularly susceptible to abuse in \nprison. He argued that he needed rehabilitation and treatment. I have \nno doubt. He argued his age and his wife's age, his extraordinary \nfamily responsibilities, and his military and work histories justified \na departure. He argued he was entitled to a ``super'' acceptance of \nresponsibility and argued his conduct was aberrant. Although the \nGovernment opposed all grounds of downward departure, the court imposed \nan illegal split sentence and allowed the defendant to spend 14 months \nof his 27-month sentence in the home.\n  Without explaining how many guideline levels it was departing, the \ncourt credited the defendant's claim that he was the only one who could \ntake care of his wife, who had degenerative arthritis and had back \nsurgery but nonetheless continued to work as a night janitor--his wife, \nthat is. The court also credited the defendant's claim that, based on \nhis service in the military and his civilian career in law enforcement, \nhis criminal acts were aberrant. Remarkably, these winning arguments \nenabled the defendant to spend over half of his 27-month sentence in \nthe home.\n  Now let me state why we need this reporting requirement to the \nAttorney General that the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts has \ninappropriately characterized. It is no secret that the Attorney \nGeneral is in charge of every aspect of prosecuting cases in the \nFederal courts. Therefore, he has a direct interest in the disposition \nof criminal cases. Now let me give you a specific example as to why we \nneed this reporting requirement.\n  There is a Federal judge who routinely violates the Sentencing \nCommission guidelines because he believes the Sentencing Commission \nerroneously calculated the sentencing guidelines. He does not depart \nmuch, just a little reduction in a sentence here and a little reduction \nthere. But the fact is, he routinely does it. Now\n\n[[Page S5126]]\n\nthe Attorney General may not have the resources to try to appeal each \nand every time this judge violates the sentencing guidelines. However, \nif an Attorney General is aware of someone routinely abusing this \nprovision, this reporting requirement will allow him to monitor this \nand take action when appropriate. That is why we have the requirement \nin there.\n  Now let me give you another illustration, some more examples of what \nis going on here and what we are trying to correct with this bill.\n  A child pornographer was sentenced this year in Montana. Prior to \nsentencing, the court raised on its own motion that the defendant \nsuffered from diminished capacity. The court ruled that this young man \nhad extraordinary family responsibilities and that he suffered from a \ndiminished mental capacity. The judgment notes, in part, United States \nSentencing Guidelines section 5(k)(2)(13), diminished capacity: \nDefendant was extremely addicted to child pornography and the testimony \nof efforts established that defendant had a significantly impaired \nability to control his behavior that he knew to be wrong; that the \nextent to which the reduced mental capacity contributed significantly \nand substantially to the commission of the offense. The Court departed \ndownward 8 offense levels from offense level 18 to offense level 10. \nThis reduced the guideline range from 27 to 33 months to just 6 to 12 \nmonths.\n  The trial court placed Clark on probation for 5 years.\n  I want to emphasize again a disturbing fact here about child \npornographers. A Bureau of Prisons study shows that 76 percent of child \npornographers and those who had been convicted of traveling in \ninterstate commerce to commit sex acts with minors admitted to \nundetected sex crimes with an average of 30.5 child sex victims. Think \nabout that. These child sexual predators, if you averaged them, \nadmitted to undetected sex crimes with an average of 30.5 child sex \nvictims. Can anyone really say that tougher penalties and sentencing \nreforms are not needed when it comes to these horrible crimes?\n  Does anyone believe that judges should be allowed to grant downward \ndepartures based on reasons that are not contemplated within the \nGuidelines themselves?\n  Now we have supporting letters for this conference report from the \nDepartment of Justice, the National Sheriffs' Association, the Law \nEnforcement Alliance of America, Major County Sheriffs' Association, \nFraternal Order of Police, and the National Association of Assistant \nU.S. Attorneys.\n  One of the criticisms that has been raised about the conference \nagreement is that it limits the membership of Sentencing Commission to \nno more than three Federal judges. Currently, the law requires that the \nSentencing Commission be comprised of at least three Federal judges. \nThe hearings before the House and Senate Judiciary Committees showed \nthat trial judges have downwardly departed from the sentencing \nguidelines to a level beyond what was originally intended. There may be \nan appearance of conflict of interest when judges, desiring to preserve \njudicial discretion, serve on the Sentencing Commission whose mission \nit is to ensure uniformity in sentencing, which necessarily means less \njudicial discretion.\n  Currently, judges outnumber other voting members of the Sentencing \nCommission. Because so, there is a potential for at least an appearance \nof a conflict of interest.\n  Now, I do not argue that there is a conflict or that they are acting \nimproperly. I am proud of those who have served. But there is a \ndifferent attitude in the courts, as Senator Kennedy has suggested. He \nhas all kinds of letters from judges who do not like this. It means \nmore work to them.\n  This change will, hopefully, restore the appearance of balance in the \nSentencing Commission and eliminate any conflict between the \ncommissioners' desire to retain judicial discretion and uniformity in \nsentencing.\n  Now, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the \nNCMEC, expressed its thanks to the House of Representatives and Senate \nconferees on agreeing to the language included in the conference report \nof the Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to end the Exploitation \nof Children Today Act 2003. This was released April 9. NCMEC also \nexpressed its hope that both Houses of Congress would move swiftly to \napprove the report and enact these important provisions into law. \nChildren throughout the United States will be safer because these key \nleaders of the House and Senate were able to come together and reach \nconsensus on so many vital issues--Robbie Callaway, chairman of the \nNational Center for Missing and Exploited Children.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the comments in this press release, \nalong with a letter from Robbie Callaway, who is with the Boys and \nGirls Clubs of America, along with the National Sheriffs' Association, \nalong with the Law Enforcement Alliance of America, and Major County \nSheriffs' Association, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers \nAssociation, the U.S. Department of Justice, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                    April 9, 2003.\n\n National Center for Missing & Exploited Children Commends Senate and \n                            House Conferees\n\n       Alexandria, VA.--The National Center for Missing & \n     Exploited Children (NCMEC) expressed its thanks to the U.S. \n     House of Representatives and U.S. Senate conferees on \n     agreeing to the language included in the conference report of \n     the Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to End the \n     Exploitation of Children Today Act of 2003. NCMEC also \n     expressed its hope that both houses of Congress would move \n     swiftly to approve the report and enact these important \n     provisions into law.\n       ``Children throughout the United States will be safer \n     because these key leaders of the House and Senate were able \n     to come together and reach consensus on so many vital \n     issues,'' said Robbie Callaway, Chairman of the National \n     Center for Missing & Exploited Children.\n       ``NCMEC is particularly pleased that the Conferees \n     finalized language for a true national implementation of the \n     AMBER Alert,'' said Ernie Allen, President and Chief \n     Executive Officer of NCMEC. Allen added, ``this legislation \n     ensures that AMBER Plans become a resource for every state \n     and every community, and that they are implemented in a \n     consistent, meaningful manner.'' The conferees provided \n     funding for notification systems along highways for alerts, \n     as well as funding grants so that states may implement new \n     technologies to improve AMBER Alert communications. Such \n     monies will benefit not just abducted children but every \n     member of the community when an emergency develops, whether \n     weather-related, terrorism, or any other.\n       NCMEC also applauded important changes in attacking the \n     insidious, expanding problem of child pornography. NCMEC also \n     thanked Congressional leaders for allowing the U.S. Secret \n     Service to provide forensic and investigative support to \n     NCMEC to assist in efforts to find missing children.\n       Finally, NCMEC commended Congress for taking a tough, \n     serious look at the problem of sex offenders against children \n     and how they are handled by the criminal justice system. \n     Important provisions like changes in the term of supervision \n     for released sex offenders, eliminating the statute of \n     limitations for child abductions and sex crimes, mandating \n     minimum prison sentences for those who kidnap children, \n     punishing those who participate in child sex tourism, and \n     other important changes will strengthen society's ability to \n     cope with these serious crimes and keep children safe.\n       NCMEC, a private, 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, works \n     in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Justice's Office \n     of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. NCMEC was \n     established in 1984 as a public-private partnership to help \n     find missing children and combat child sexual exploitation. \n     It has assisted local law-enforcement agencies on more than \n     87,000 missing child cases, helping to reunite more than \n     71,000 children with their families.

We are hopeful that final passage will come quickly so \n     that critically important provisions such as the AMBER alert \n     system are enacted.\n       Along with the AMBER system, we are particularly pleased \n     with the bill's efforts to take on the problem of child \n     pornography, the reauthorization of the National Center for \n     Missing and Exploited Children, and national criminal \n     background screening for youth serving organizations. We are \n     confident that these provisions will make America's children \n     safer, and there is nothing more important than that.\n       We were pleased to work with your committee as well as the \n     House Judiciary Committee, and know you will continue to call \n     upon us if we can be helpful in this regard.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Robbie Callaway,\n     Senior Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               National Sheriffs' Association,\n\n                                    Alexandria, VA, April 4, 2003.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I write today to discuss the importance \n     of H.R. 1104, the Child Abduction Prevention Act and I am \n     asking for your support of the legislation and for your \n     support of the Fenney Amendment. Passage of this legislation \n     will protect our children against predators.\n       The House version of the bill has several provisions that \n     protect children. Sheriffs especially support the AMBER Alert \n     provision. AMBER is a highly successful tool for law \n     enforcement and its adoption nationally will enhance our \n     ability to recover children who have been kidnapped. It also \n     provides citizens with a clear means of providing information \n     to law enforcement about these cases.\n       However, there are additional sections in the House bill \n     that are equally important to sheriffs. Specifically, NSA \n     supports the Fenney Amendment, which limits the practice of \n     downward departures from federal sentencing guidelines. The \n     amendment would put strict limitations on departures by \n     allowing sentences outside the guidelines range only upon \n     grounds specifically enumerated in the guidelines as proper \n     for departure. This eliminates ad hoc departures based on \n     vague grounds, such as ``general mitigating circumstances.'' \n     The amendment also reforms the existing grounds of departure \n     set forth in the current guidelines by eliminating those that \n     have been most frequently abused.\n       Sheriffs also support provisions like ``Lifetime \n     Monitoring'' of sex offenders and the ``Two Strikes and \n     You're Out'' for repeat child molesters. These provisions are \n     needed to protect our kids from sexual predators. Child \n     molesters are four times more likely than other violent \n     criminals to recommit their crime. A typical molester will \n     abuse between 30 and 60 children before they are arrested, as \n     many as 380 children during their lifetime. The Two Strikes \n     and You're Out provision will save thousands of kids from \n     going through this torture. Each repeat molester represents \n     hundreds of victims with shattered lives. We can break the \n     chain of violence with simple, straightforward proposals like \n     Two Strikes and You're Out and Lifetime Monitoring.\n       The National Sheriffs' Association welcomes passage of this \n     legislation. We look forward to working with you to assure \n     its swift enactment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               William T. Ferrell,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                      The Law Enforcement Alliance\n\n\n                                                   of America,\n\n                                  Falls Church, VA, April 3, 2003.\n     Senator Bill Frist,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Frist, On behalf of the more than \n     75,000 Members and supporters of the Law Enforcement Alliance \n     of America (LEAA), I write to request your prompt attention \n     and support for conference and passage of H.R. 1104, ``Child \n     Abduction Prevention Act'' and S. 151, the ``Protect'' act.\n       The House recently passed S. 151 with the text of H.R. \n     1104. The provisions in this legislation are vital \n     protections that address clear and present dangers in \n     America's laws to keep our children safe. Judges will be \n     given the power to enforce supervision of convicted sex \n     offenders for as long as is necessary and child rapists and \n     abductors will be barred from pre-trial release. It would \n     fund important grants to local law enforcement for tracking \n     down wanted sex offenders and provide for mandatory 20 year \n     sentences for strangers that kidnap kids.\n       The legislation would help fund a national AMBER alert \n     system, put a two strikes rule for child molesters and double \n     the funding for the National Center for Missing and Exploited \n     Children.\n       LEAA is sure you'll agree that this legislation gives our \n     judges, prosecutors and cops tough tools to fight back at \n     some of America's most horrible criminals. LEAA respectfully \n     asks that you do everything in your power to speed the \n     process for passage of this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   James J.

Orrin Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: On behalf of the Major County Sheriffs' \n     Association (MCSA), thank you for your legislative efforts to \n     protect our children from sexual crime and abduction and to \n     toughen penalties against those who commit these horrific \n     acts.\n       Collectively, the MCSA membership represents over 100 \n     million people throughout the United States. As elected \n     Sheriffs and law enforcement officials, we take seriously our \n     responsibility of protecting and serving our citizens, \n     especially our children. In that regard, we encourage your \n     efforts to move forward on legislation which safeguards our \n     children from the hands of those who inflict irreversible \n     harm and pain through crime and sexual abuse, specifically \n     House Bill 1104 and Senate Bill 151.\n       In addition, the MCSA also supports the language set forth \n     in the Feeney Amendment as passed in House Bill 1104, \n     sponsored by Congressman James Sensenbrenner, which limits \n     downward departures from federal sentencing guidelines. When \n     the perpetrator makes the decision to commit the crime, they \n     must accept the consequences of their actions which should \n     include swift, unwavering penalties. We hope the results of \n     the conference committee scheduled to meet next week will \n     include the Feeney Amendment.\n       Thank you for your attention and consideration to this \n     important issue. We look forward to working with you on this \n     legislation and any other measure that protects and provides \n     for the safety of our children. Please feel free to call upon \n     me for additional information or comment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Michael J.

It will also create a national amber \n     alert communications network regarding abducted children to \n     aid in their recovery. The ``Amber Alert System'' is an \n     important tool to assist law enforcement in obtaining leads \n     from the public to assist in a quick recovery of abducted \n     children.\n       We must protect the children of our nation, for they are \n     our future. The ``Elizabeth Smart Case'' has demonstrated to \n     all of us, the need for this important piece of legislation. \n     As Federal law enforcement officers, we ask that you give us \n     the necessary tools contained in this legislation to assist \n     us in investigating these crimes against our children.\n       If there are any questions, I can be reached at 717-938-\n     2300.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Art Gordon,\n     National Executive Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                Office of Legislative Affairs,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 4, 2003.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: We write to urge that the House-Senate \n     Conference Committee quickly reach agreement on the differing \n     versions of S. 151 and promptly send to the President a \n     strong child protection bill that will comprehensively \n     strengthen the Government's ability to prevent, investigate, \n     prosecute, and punish violent crimes committed against \n     children.\n       The House-passed version of S. 151 includes language that \n     would codify the Administration's ongoing efforts to support \n     AMBER Alert programs by providing for national coordination \n     of state and local AMBER Alert programs and by establishing \n     Federal grant programs for States to support AMBER Alert \n     communication systems and plans. The Senate previously passed \n     very similar legislation, S. 121, by a unanimous vote. The \n     Department strongly supports these AMBER Alert provisions, \n     which should be included in the final version of S. 151.\n       Both the House and Senate versions of S. 151 include \n     provisions designed to revise and strengthen the nation's \n     child pornography laws in light of Ashcroft v. Free Speech \n     Coalition, 122 S. Ct. 1389 (2002). The House version's child \n     pornography provisions are modeled on an Administration \n     proposal that overwhelmingly passed the House last year\n\n[[Page S5128]]\n\n     as H.R. 4623. The Senate's version is likewise a very strong \n     measure, which also has received the Administration's full \n     support. On this score, the two bills overlap very \n     significantly in approach, if not always in wording. We are \n     confident that the relatively modest differences between the \n     two versions of these provisions can be readily resolved, and \n     we would be pleased to offer technical suggestions in that \n     regard. Swift enactment of these important child pornography \n     provisions would be an important step in protecting children \n     from abuse by ensuring effective child pornography \n     prosecutions.\n       The House version of S. 151 also includes a number of \n     important measures designed to enhance the Government's \n     ability to investigate, prosecute, and punish violent crimes \n     against children. These measures include: Extending the \n     length of supervised-release terms for offenders and \n     establishment of a rebuttable presumption in favor of \n     pretrial detention; Enhancing law enforcement tools for \n     identifying and apprehending offenders, by including child \n     exploitation offenses as wiretap predicates and by \n     eliminating the statute of limitations for certain offenses; \n     Increasing penalties to more accurately reflect the extreme \n     seriousness of these offenses, especially repeat offenses; \n     Enhancing the Government's ability to punish offenders who \n     travel abroad to prey on children; and Providing the States \n     with additional tools and assistance to pursue these common \n     goals.\n       The Department has previously testified in strong support \n     of these provisions, and urges the Conference to include them \n     in the final bill.\n       We also wish to express our strong support for Congressman \n     Feeney's amendment to the House version of S. 151. The Feeney \n     amendment added section 109 to the bill, which is designed to \n     address a number of deficiencies in federal sentencing \n     policy--deficiencies that have proven particularly serious \n     with respect to child victim offenses.\n       The amendment would address the longstanding--and still \n     growing--problem of ``downward departures'' from the Federal \n     Sentencing Guidelines--i.e., sentences that are significantly \n     more lenient than those mandated by the Guidelines. The \n     consistency, predictability, and toughness that Congress \n     sought to achieve in the Sentencing Reform Act (which \n     established the Guidelines System) is being undermined by \n     steadily increasing downward departures:\n       The rate of downward departures on grounds other than \n     substantial assistance to the government (i.e., cooperation \n     in investigating other criminals) has climbed steadily every \n     year for the last several years. The rate of such departures \n     in non-immigration cases has climbed from 9.6 percent in FY \n     1996 to 14.7 percent in FY 2001--an increase of over 50 \n     percent in just 5 years.\n       Using the measure recently suggested by the ABA as a \n     benchmark--i.e., excluding downward departures based on \n     substantial assistance and excluding those from Southwest \n     border districts (which use departures to process large \n     numbers of immigration cases)--the rate of downward \n     departures nationwide has more than doubled over the ten \n     years from FY 1991 to FY 2001, going from 5.5 percent to 13.2 \n     percent.\n       The ratio of such downward departures to upward departures \n     has climbed from 11:1 to a staggering 33:1 in just the last \n     five years.\n       Far from being ``highly infrequent''--as required by the \n     Guidelines Manual--departures based on grounds not \n     specifically mentioned in the Guidelines amounted last year \n     to over 20 percent of all downward departures.\n       The rates of such sentencing leniency vary widely from \n     district to district: the average downward departure rate in \n     the Fourth Circuit is 4.2 percent; in the Tenth Circuit, it \n     is 23.3 percent.\n       The rates of downward departures in cases involving certain \n     offenses is nothing short of scandalous. For years, downward \n     departures in child pornography possession cases have ranged \n     between 20 percent and 29 percent nationwide. (In FY 2001, it \n     was 25.1 percent.) Often, these departures are based on much-\n     abused grounds, such as ``aberrant behavior'' and ``family \n     ties.'' And some of the grounds of departure employed in such \n     cases have been as creative as they are outrageous: for \n     example, a 5'11'', 190-lb. child pornography defendant--who \n     has accessed over 1,300 pornography pictures and begun an \n     Internet correspondence with a 15-year-old girl in another \n     State--was granted a 50 percent downward departure in part on \n     the ground that he would be ``unusually susceptible to abuse \n     in prison.'' United States v. Parish, 308 F.3d 1025 (9th Cir. \n     2002) (rejecting Government's appeal and affirming the \n     sentence).\n       The Feeney amendment would enact several reforms to ensure \n     that the Guidelines are more faithfully and consistently \n     enforced:\n       The bill would make it easier for the Government to appeal \n     illegal downward departures by requiring appellate courts to \n     undertake a de novo review of departure decisions. There is \n     nothing unusual at all about applying a de novo standard of \n     review to a mixed question of law and fact such as the \n     decision to depart. Indeed, in most other contexts, appellate \n     courts apply a de novo standard of review to mixed questions \n     of law and fact, such as suppression issues (probable cause, \n     voluntariness of a statement, etc.). It makes no sense to \n     have a de novo standard of review only for mixed questions \n     that generally favor the defendant.\n       The bill would require the Sentencing Commission to provide \n     effective guidance concerning downward departures by \n     prohibiting such departures on grounds that the Sentencing \n     Commission has not affirmatively specified as permissible. \n     Under the amendment, numerous authorized grounds of downward \n     departure are preserved, and the Commission retains very \n     broad discretion to add new factors to the list of authorized \n     grounds of downward departure (with the exception of a few \n     much-abused grounds of downward departure, such as ``aberrant \n     behavior,'' that are eliminated by the amendment). Departures \n     based on grounds not specified by the Commission were always \n     supposed to be ``highly infrequent,'' and the amendment \n     simply requires the Commission to do its job of \n     affirmatively regulating the availability of departures. \n     Moreover, the existence of such unfettered departure \n     authority has made Government appeals of improper \n     sentences more difficult. See, e.g., United States v. \n     Blazevich, 38 Fed. Appx. 359 (9th Cir. 2002) (rejecting \n     Government's appeal of downward departure in child \n     pornography case, because there is ``essentially no limit \n     on the number of potential factors that may warrant \n     departure in child pornography case, because there is \n     ``essentially no limit on the number of potential factors \n     that may warrant departure,'' with the exception of those \n     few factors that the Sentencing Commission has \n     proscribed).\n       The bill would strengthen existing requirements for judges \n     to explain the basis for their departures, thereby \n     facilitating appellate review.\n       The bill would also limit a defendant to one bite at the \n     apple by generally precluding a second downward departure \n     after a successful Government appeal. There are too many \n     cases in which, on remand, the district court simply re-\n     imposes the same illegal sentence on a different theory, \n     thereby necessitating a second government appeal. See, e.g., \n     United States v. Winters, 174 F.3d 478 (5th Cir. 1999) \n     (reversing second imposition of the same illegal sentence in \n     civil rights prosecution against corrections officer); United \n     States v. O'Brien, 18 F.3d 301 (5th Cir. 1994) (reversing \n     district court's imposition, after Government successfully \n     appealed prior downward departure, of an even more lenient \n     sentence in drug case).\n       The Feeney Amendment would also enact a number of \n     additional measures to strengthen the penalties applicable to \n     those who prey upon our nation's children:\n       Under current Sentencing guidelines, a defendant is \n     required to receive an enhanced penalty for engaging in \n     multiple acts of prohibited sexual contact with minors, but \n     the enhancement does not apply if the defendant repeatedly \n     abused the same victim. This irrational and unjust disparity \n     would be explicitly eliminated by the amendment.\n       The amendment would require that child pornography \n     sentences be enhanced based on the number of such images \n     possessed by the defendant. The current Sentencing Guidelines \n     fail adequately to account for the volume of the material, \n     with the result that an offender who sent one image of child \n     pornography over the Internet receives the same treatment \n     under the Guidelines as an offender who set up a website \n     containing thousands of images. The amendment would instead \n     require that sentences be sharply enhanced for offenses \n     involving large numbers of images.\n       The problem of ignoring the Guidelines in favor of ad hoc \n     leniency is well known and has already been the subject of \n     much study. In October 2000, a Senate Judiciary Subcommittee, \n     under the leadership of Senator Thurmond--one of the original \n     architects of the Sentencing Reform Act--held a lengthy \n     hearing on the problem and received extensive evidence \n     examining downward departure rates from many different \n     angles. The data are already out there, the problem is clear, \n     and further inaction would be a travesty. Indeed, the Feeney \n     Amendment was adopted only after the House Judiciary \n     Committee held two hearings over the last year to review a \n     variety of possible solutions to the growing leniency \n     problem, including mandatory minimums, a total ban of \n     downward departures in certain classes of cases (a position \n     previously endorsed by the Department on several occasions), \n     and a de novo review standard for departure appeals (which \n     had been specifically included in H.R. 1161, as introduced). \n     Based on the extensive record already before the Congress, \n     the Feeney Amendment emerged as a compromise position that \n     preserves district judges' ability to depart, but requires \n     that this departure authority be subject to more consistent \n     and careful review and control by the Sentencing Commission \n     and appellate courts.\n       The Department strongly urges the conferees to retain these \n     much-needed provisions of the Feeney Amendment in the final \n     version of S. 151.\n       Thank you for your attention to this important matter. If \n     we may be of further assistance in this or any other matter, \n     we trust that you will not hesitate to call upon us. The \n     Office of Management and Budget has advised that there is no \n     objection from the standpoint of the Administration's program \n     to the presentation of this report.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Jamie E. Brown,\n                                Acting Assistant Attorney General.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I notice the distinguished Senator from Vermont is in the \nChamber. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S5129]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am somewhat perplexed that we are in this \nsituation. Let me explain why. This is not a question of whether people \nare for or against those who abuse children. We are all against that, \nRepublicans and Democrats. It is one of those many areas that would \nunite all of us. Those of us who are parents or grandparents always \nfeel that way. I think of some of the child molesters I prosecuted \nbefore I was in the Senate. Invariably, I sought the stiffest sentences \npossible, and got them, including life sentences. So I do not think any \nof us has to demonstrate that we are against child molesters. I think \nthe American people know that, of course, we are all against them. That \nis the way I was when I prosecuted them and the way I am in the \nlegislation I have helped to write.\n  For example, the AMBER alert bill that is before us: When I was \nchairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee last year, I put that \nthrough in record time. We had a hearing. We had a vote in committee. \nWe brought it up for a roll call vote on the floor in about a week. It \nwas a record. We sent it over to the other body. Of course, they sat on \nit and never passed it.\n  This year, I joined with Senator Hutchison of Texas, Senator \nFeinstein of California, and Senator Hatch of Utah. The four of us put \nthrough AMBER alert again, brought it up, had a rollcall vote on the \nSenate floor. Every single Senator who was here that day voted for it. \nWe sent it over to the other body, where it languished.\n  This conference report also includes the PROTECT Act, to provide \nprosecutors with important tools to fight child pornography. That is a \nHatch-Leahy act. Twice I came to the floor of the Senate and joined \nSenator Hatch in urging passage of this measure that we crafted \ntogether. I do not need to suggest whether I am for that or not. I \nhelped write it.\n  We have housing for abused children in this legislation. Again, I \nhelped write that bill. I am the lead sponsor. Obviously, I am for \nthat.\n  We had the so-called Reid shoe bomber fix to the criminal law. I am \nthe lead sponsor of that.\n  The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children authorization, \nI am a lead sponsor of that.\n  The victims' shield, the cyber-tipline, these are things I have \nsponsored and supported. I have no problem with any one of them.\n  But what happens, and I hate to think this is why the other body has \nrefused to take up our AMBER alert bill twice now, we suddenly have a \nbill that comes back--actually, as my friend Senator Kennedy pointed \nout during our only conference meeting in this matter, subject to a \npoint of order with new and controversial provisions added to a once \nnon-controversial and bipartisan bill.\n  It would have been so much better if the other body had simply taken \nthe bill I got out of the committee last year and we passed in the \nSenate, and having failed to do so, it would have been so helpful had \nthey taken the bill--of Senator Hatch and myself and Senator Kay Bailey \nHutchison and Senator Feinstein--and passed it here, this year, and \ngone with that. The House leaders chose not to pass it. They delayed \nits passage and tried to use it as a sweetener to add on a number of \ncontroversial items.\n  I wonder what would have happened had they simply taken the bill and \npassed it last year. The President made clear he would sign it after we \npassed it by such an overwhelming majority. The other body decided not \nto.\n  I wonder what would have happened had they picked it up and passed it \nthis year after we passed it through the Senate. The President would \nhave signed it. Maybe we would already have a nationwide AMBER alert \nsystem today. One wonders how many children might have been saved by \nsuch a nationwide AMBER alert plan if the other body had been willing \nto pass that bill last year or earlier this year when we passed it.\n  So many, Republicans and Democrats alike, came together on parts of \nthis bill with the idea of protecting children. I worry when efforts to \nprotect our children are used as pawns by those who play politics by \nattaching legislation of a more controversial nature. Of course, the \nAMBER alert legislation is in there. I was a main sponsor of that last \nyear and this year. Of course, I am happy about that and I will speak \nfurther on that later.\n  I cannot imagine a worse nightmare than a family having an abducted \nchild. I remember sitting around the clock with families when I was a \nprosecutor as we were trying to find their children. I also remember \nsome cases where we found a child and the child was dead. I remember as \na young prosecutor, trying to keep my composure in the trials when I \nprosecuted the people who did that and seeking the maximum sentence. \nOne, especially, I still have nightmares about to this day, a case in \nChittenden County. I remember it as though it were yesterday even \nthough it was many years ago.\n  So that is why I worry when we find ourselves in a situation where \nall of this time-consuming discussion on more controversial matters \ncould have been avoided. We have so much in this legislation, that \nRepublicans and Democrats alike have joined in, so much that our staffs \nhave worked on so hard over the last 2 years. So many things of these \nmeasures are helpful and broadly supported by police, Governors, and \nthose who have to deal with abused and neglected children.\n\n  The unfortunate situation is--whether it is overreaching, whether \nsomeone was looking for an opportunity, I do not know--that members of \nthe other body insisted once again on adding controversial measures \nthat have already slowed down this important legislation.\n  These are bills that came out of the House Judiciary Committee and \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee. We, of all people, should be willing to \nset the standards and make sure we follow the rules. We, of all people, \nshould not add things in controversial provisions that do not belong \nhere. That is what has been done.\n  I can think of things I would have liked to have had included in the \nconference report--and not controversial matters at that--but \nunfortunately, even non-controversial requests by the minority were not \nafforded the same consideration as highly controversial proposals by \nthe majority.\n  I tried to add the Hometown Heroes Survivors Benefit Act of 2003. \nThis legislation would improve the Department of Justice Public Safety \nOfficers Program by allowing families of public safety officers who \nsuffer fatal heart attacks or strokes to qualify for Federal survivor \nbenefits. I have been at the funerals of officers who died of a heart \nattack after putting their lives on the line to protect their \ncommunity.\n  Each year hundreds of public safety officers nationwide lose their \nlives and thousands more are subjected to great physical risks. The \nbenefits can never be the substitute for the loss of a loved one. \nFamilies of fallen heroes depend upon us for helping out when their \nfamily members make the ultimate sacrifice.\n  I tried to include the Hometown Heroes bill to fix this loophole and \nassure the survivors of public safety officers who die of heart attacks \nor strokes, who die within 24 hours of being on the job, are eligible \nto receive financial assistance. We passed this bill in the House last \nyear. Representative Etheridge, in the other body, and I introduced \nidentical versions of this legislation. The House passed it, but an \nanonymous Republican hold in the Senate stopped those benefits for the \nfamilies of fallen police and firefighters.\n  During the conference, I offered this bill as an amendment, hoping to \nsee it become law. Unfortunately, the majority blocked it.\n  My colleagues across the aisle overlook the fact that public safety \nis dangerous, exhausting, and stressful work. A first responder's \nchance of suffering a heart attack or stroke greatly increases when he \nor she puts on heavy equipment and rushes into a burning building to \nfight a fire or save lives. To not be able to participate in the PSOP \nprogram--I wish my friends on the other side of the aisle allowed \nfamilies,\n\n[[Page S5130]]\n\nsurvivors of those who died in the line of duty that way, to be able to \nat least have the benefits that go to other officers. I think it is \nunfortunate.\n  I have heard from police officers, I have heard from firefighters. \nThey ask, how can this possibly happen? Is this a partisan issue? I \nsay, I hope it is not. If there is one thing that should unite \nRepublicans and Democrats, it is support for the families of those who \ndie in the line of duty. We could have done that. Unfortunately, \nRepublicans in the House and Republicans in the Senate voted it down. I \nhope they will reconsider that decision. I would welcome them back to \nthe fold. But also, the families of firefighters and police officers, \nthe first responders, would welcome them back. They face grave \ndisappointment today. They cannot understand why this was not done. \nThey would like to see it back. I call on the Republican leadership to \ninstruct the Members to let this go through.\n  I am glad the conference report did include a provision I introduced \nin the last Congress to clarify an airplane as a vehicle for the \npurpose of terrorism and other violent acts. I tried to include this \nbill in the omnibus appropriations measure, but the Department of \nJustice blocked it. Then, to my surprise, the same provision appeared \nin the leaked copy of the Department's new antiterrorism package.\n  This bill is meant to address a discrete problem that surfaced in the \nprosecution of Richard Reid, a man who tried to blow up an \ninternational flight from Paris to Miami. In that case, the court \ndismissed a charge against Reid over the question whether the airplane \nhe attempted to destroy was a mass transportation vehicle. This makes \nit very clear that it is. I am glad this clarification was included at \nmy request.\n\n  There are many things in this conference report that I either helped \nwrite or cosponsored that we can all support. The Leahy-Kennedy \nlegislation establishes a transitional housing grant program within the \nDepartment of Justice to provide to victims of domestic violence, \nstalking, and sexual assault, the necessary means to escape the cycle \nof violence. That is in here. Today, more than 50 percent of homeless \nindividuals are women and children fleeing domestic violence. This will \nhelp real women and children, including many in my home State. I \ncommend my colleagues who, after some initial opposition, joined with \nSenator Kennedy and me on this legislation.\n  I am glad the Protecting Our Children Comes First Act is in this \nconference report. It is a bipartisan bill I introduced both in this \nCongress and the last, joined by my friend from Utah as well as Senator \nDeWine of Ohio and Senators Biden, Shelby, Lincoln, and Harry Reid. Our \nbill reauthorizes the National Center for Missing and Exploited \nChildren. It needs to be reauthorized. That is in here.\n  We proposed reauthorization through the year 2007, but at least it \nhas been agreed to through the year 2005. We agreed to double the \ngrants. We also authorized the U.S. Secret Service to provide forensic \nand investigative assistance to the National Center; and we \nstrengthened the Center's Cyber Tipline to provide online users an \neffective means of reporting Internet-related child sexual exploitation \nin the distribution of child pornography, online enticement of children \nfor sexual acts, child prostitution, and child pornography.\n  Of course, the Hatch-Leahy PROTECT Act is the centerpiece of this \nbill. And after all the hard work that Senator Hatch and I completed to \ncraft this bill, introduce it twice, and usher it through the Senate by \ntwo unanimous votes, I do not have to tell any one how pleased I am \nthat the House adopted most of our provisions. The key provision from \nthe House bill that is retained is the so-called ``virtual porn'' \nprovision, which I predict will be the subject of much constitutional \nscrutiny. We will see how the House provision fares before the Supreme \nCourt, I am sure.\n  So there are a number of things that are good in this bill. That is \nwhy I am frustrated we have this situation. It is because of \noverreaching, because of putting controversial measures in that have \nreceived little or no consideration in either body and have delayed \nenactment of the better parts of this bill, that we do not yet have a \nlaw passed.\n  I say this really out of sadness. No. 1, we did not have to be here \ntoday. The Senate passed both the Amber bill and the PROTECT Act twice, \nonce this year and once in the last Congress, and sent clean bills to \nthe House both times.\n  When these bills came out of committee last year, when I was \nchairman, the Senate passed them by unanimous votes on the Senate \nfloor. They passed. We sent them to the other body and they let the \nbills sit there. When Senator Hatch took over as chairman of the \ncommittee this year, we passed them out again. Both Senator Hatch and \nI, as well as Senators Feinstein and Hutchison, were the main sponsors \nof the Amber bill. Senator Hatch and I were the main sponsors of the \nPROTECT Act. The Senate passed them out again. Again, they sat over in \nthe other body for months without action.\n  Now we find out why. It appears that the Republican majority in the \nHouse was looking for legislation with that kind of universal support \nand popularity on which to attach controversial measures that might not \nhave support in the Senate.\n  That is unfair. That is unfair to children. That is unfair to those \nwho may be abducted. That is unfair to those of us who spent years \ntrying to protect children. It is unfair to those, myself and others in \nthis body, who were once prosecutors and prosecuted child molesters and \nabductors. It is unfair to them and to others.\n  I will put more material in the Record. I will go back to this. But I \nurge my friends on the other side of the aisle to find a way out of \nthis increasing partisanship because it has delayed passage of this \nimportant legislation, which has so much in it to protect children.\n  I see my colleagues on the floor. I see the Senator from Alabama who \nI assume--he is nodding yes--I assume he is looking for the floor, so I \nwill yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I just will share a few thoughts I think \nare very important with regard to this legislation.\n  We seem to have strong or at least grudging support from everybody on \nthe underlying portions of the bill. At least that is what we are told \nrepeatedly. But there is a suggestion that the Feeney amendment is such \na horrible thing that the entire PROTECT bill should not go forward.\n  I will just say a couple of things about that. The Feeney amendment \nwas designed to deal with a growing problem of Federal judges downward-\ndeparting from the mandates of the sentencing guidelines and thereby \ngiving lighter sentences than should be given to criminals. It is a \ngrowing problem.\n  Senator Hatch had the chart there. Downward departures went from \n1,200 in 1991 to over 4,000 in 2001. There have been some erosions of \nthe clarity of the law about that. In effect, we are at a point of some \ndanger that the integrity of the guidelines would be undermined.\n  So I felt from the beginning we ought to give, in this body, serious \nconsideration to the Feeney amendment and review it and see what we \ncould do about it. That is my general view of that.\n  I served as a Federal prosecutor for almost 15 years. I was a Federal \nUnited States Attorney when the sentencing guidelines were passed. I \napplied them. I carried around the sentencing guideline manual. I could \nlook through and find the upward departures and downward departures and \nall the statistics and how to figure out how many prior convictions \nshould be considered in the defendant's criminal history. You would \nfigure out the nature of the criminal act, did it involve violence, did \nthe defendant carry a gun, did it involve a particularly vulnerable \nvictim like a woman or a child. You would do all those things. A lot of \nexperienced people in criminal justice came together and put the \nSentencing Guidelines together over a decade ago. It was a remarkably \ngood achievement.\n  Most experts who knew about it said basically they were compiling and \nputting into law what most Federal judges, mainstream Federal judges in \nAmerica were doing, anyway. But it compromised those who were \nespecially harsh and those who were especially light. Frankly, when you \ngive a lifetime appointment to a Federal\n\n[[Page S5131]]\n\njudge and he or she decides they don't want to enforce child \npornography laws or child abuse laws and they don't think those are \nparticularly significant crimes that ought to be in Federal court and \nthey depart downward, and you are in a position where the law is \nunclear, they can depart with impunity. If the judge is elected, at \nleast you can vote him out of office sometime, but you can't do that \nfor an unelected, lifetime-appointed judge.\n  For the most part, I think judges follow the guidelines scrupulously. \nBut these statistics on this chart, which shows an almost fourfold \nincrease over a decade in downward departures, are troubling.\n  I served on the Senate Crime Subcommittee. We had hearings in the \nyear 2000 to confront this problem. In fact, we even asked the \nSentencing Commission to give us some information on it, but they still \nhave not given us that information.\n  So the Feeney amendment comes along. It was offered in the House of \nRepresentatives and it applied to all crimes. They put that amendment \non to the AMBER Alert legislation that was going through the House of \nRepresentatives, and made it an appropriate part of the PROTECT Act \nthat we would conference about, that we would confer about.\n\n  I thought it was a matter that ought to be given serious thought. I \nhad not overtly committed to the Feeney amendment, but as someone who \nworked with the sentencing guidelines, I felt that the intent of it was \ngood.\n  So there was a big controversy. My colleagues on the other side said: \nWell, we are not going to pass this bill that will protect children. We \nbelieve in protecting children, but you can't have the Feeney amendment \non it. It is irrelevant to children. It does other things in the \ncriminal justice system, and we are not prepared to vote for that. We \nare not troubled, in effect, by Federal judges who are downward \ndeparting in record numbers. So we don't want that on the PROTECT Act.\n  We got a call from a Federal judge who said: It is restricting my \nfreedom to do what I want to do, and we don't think it is a good idea. \nTake the Feeney amendment off.\n  Well, Chairman Hatch, who has been in this body a long time, and has \nbeen chairman of our committee off and on for a number of years, and \nChairman Sensenbrenner in the House, they knew there was a complaint \nabout it. They knew people were unhappy about the Feeney amendment. So \nthey got together and they decided: What could we do about it? And they \ndecided to offer a suggestion and a provision, an amendment that would \nsolve the problem. And I, frankly, am amazed it is having any \ndifficulties getting passed in Congress.\n  What my colleagues on the other side said was: OK, since this is a \nchild protect bill, we will not put in this limitation on downward \ndepartures--this legislation that really only tightens up the freedom \nof judges to abuse the guidelines. We will not do that for all these \nother cases, but since this is a child act, and we have historical and \nanecdotal records of child abuse cases where judges have improperly \ndownward departed, we will just apply the Feeney amendment to those \ncases involving minor victims and sex offenders.\n  Certainly that was very consistent with the intent of the act. It \ndealt with the situation of some judges not taking these cases \nseriously. And we had a history of it. The legislation dealt with the \nproblem of repeat offenders because some people seem to think if a \nperson is caught in a child sexual abuse case, and they come in and \nsay, ``Oh, judge, I'm sorry, I won't do it again,'' that you can rely \non that.\n  People in churches have heard people say that, and they have believed \nthem. But I have been a prosecutor. I have seen the numbers. I have \nseen the prosecutions. Most of them have not offended just once or \ntwice, but they have done it several times over a period of years. They \ncome back to it again and again and again. I wish that were not so. I \nwish it were not so. But you cannot rely on the words of a pedophile, \nthat they are not going to offend again, because history and science \nand criminal justice statistics show that they go back to these \nhorrible acts again and again, ruining the lives of another child, \nanother child, and another child. It is a big deal in America. It is \nnot a little deal.\n  So the Feeney amendment was really constrained. It did not apply to \nall criminal justice cases; it applies to sex cases and those involving \nchild and sexual abuse.\n  I would say, as a Federal prosecutor, and knowing the kind of cases \nthat are prosecuted in Federal court--bank fraud, bank robbery, all \nkinds of white-collar crimes, gun cases, drug cases, international \nsmuggling cases, and all those--I am confident--this may shock some \npeople--I am confident that less than 2 percent--probably less than 1 \npercent--of the Federal cases prosecuted in Federal court deal with \nchild sexual abuse. Most of them--many of them--are tried in State \ncourts, and the ones that are prosecuted in Federal court are fairly \nlimited in number.\n\n  So what Senator Hatch, Senator Graham of South Carolina, and Chairman \nSensenbrenner offered was a tremendous move in the direction of the \nopponents who were concerned about the downward departure rule \ncontained in the Feeney amendment. And they focused it simply on this \nvery small but very important number of cases dealing with the abuse, \nsexual assault, kidnaping and rape of our citizens in America.\n  I think that was a very generous amendment. And I would have thought \nthat would have settled the matter completely. I remain baffled that we \nwould see this kind of opposition, the kind of opposition that would \nsuggest they are willing to kill this important legislation that, if \npassed, this very day could save the lives of children, could save \nother children from being abused by a pedophile, if we pass it. And if \nwe don't pass it, if we delay it, the victimization of our children \ncould continue for a long time.\n  And some say: Well, this Feeney amendment is so extreme and so \ncontroversial. I suggest not, Mr. Chairman. Looking at the vote in the \nHouse of Representatives, when the full Feeney amendment came up, \ntightening up the ability of judges to downward depart on all the cases \nin the criminal justice system--the 98 percent plus the 2 percent--the \nvote was 357 for and 58 against, 1 voting present.\n  Now, that is an overwhelming vote. And then, when the conference \nreport came back, after the Hatch-Sensenbrenner modification was put \nin, dramatically reducing the number of cases impacted by the Feeney \namendment to 2 percent or so, or less--probably 1 percent or less--\ninvolving sexual abuse cases, it passed 400 to 25. So it comes out of \nthe House 400 to 25--overwhelming support from Democrats and \nRepublicans. You have more than 25 liberals, you have liberals and \nconservatives, Republicans and Democrats voting for this bill in the \nHouse of Representatives, overwhelmingly. Yet here we are having this \nlegislation, as critical as it is, being held up over this small \namendment, after Chairman Hatch had worked so hard to settle the issue \nand to accommodate my colleagues on the other side of the aisle.\n  So I think it is important that we understand that. It is important \nthat we pass this bill now. There is no need for it to continue. Who \nknows? This very day--as a matter of fact I know this just because of \nthe statistics that are out there some child has been sexually abused. \nMaybe there is a child being kidnaped right now. This legislation could \nhelp save that child, and other lives.\n  And I noticed Senator Durbin suggested--and I see Senator Kennedy and \nSenator Leahy in the Chamber--well, maybe we could talk about having a \nhearing on the sentencing guidelines and minimum mandatory sentences. I \nam not opposed to that, but I will just say this: I really care about \nsentencing guidelines. I think there should be integrity in the \nenforcement of those guidelines.\n  Federal judges should not get in the habit of eroding the clear \ninjunctions of those acts. And the way they are doing it today, \nsometimes they are not writing opinions and explaining why they are \ndoing it, leaving it very difficult to determine what has actually \noccurred, and making it difficult to appeal. So I think we ought to \nhave integrity in sentencing. But we, as a Congress, I say to my \ncolleagues on the floor, passed the guidelines. We set up the mandatory \nminimums. We created\n\n[[Page S5132]]\n\nthe Sentencing Commission, and we directed them, in large part, on how \nto carry out sentencing.\n  The Congress has taken over sentencing; that is true. And after these \nmany years of experience with the guidelines, I do not have any doubt \nthat we could improve it, and that we ought to make some improvement. \nIn fact, I would say to my colleagues here, who think some of the \nsentencing guidelines are too tough--and that is what you hear a lot--\nthat Senator Hatch and I are the only two Members of this Senate, that \nI know of, who have taken any action to fix it.\n  We offered the Hatch-Sessions bill last year and are reoffering it \nthis year, that would deal with what I believe to be an unfair \ncircumstance: The crack cocaine/powder cocaine sentencing disparity. I \ndon't believe the extent of the disparity is justified. If you want to \ncomplain about something, let's talk about that. Not child pornography, \nchild sexual abuse, not sexual cases. I don't see a problem in the \nguidelines with those cases. If anything, those sentences need to be \ntoughened up.\n\n  I do agree, as a person who regularly and consistently prosecuted \ncases, that we can improve the sentencing disparity on crack and powder \ncocaine. For every child sex case, there are probably 10 crack and \npowder cocaine cases going through Federal court. Let's talk about \nthat. I would be willing to talk about that.\n  I also think we should pass the Hatch-Sessions bill first. That \nlegislation takes a major step forward in creating some fairness in the \nsystem and deals with the courier case, the girlfriend case. It deals \nwith the sentencing disparity between at some points as much as 100 to \n1 between crack and powder cocaine. It narrows that, substantially \neliminating the unfairness there. Let's do it that way. Let's not stop \nthis bill. This bill needs to go forward.\n  I understand the concerns about sentencing guidelines in general. How \nshould we fix it? We should fix it by maintaining integrity in the \nsentencing process, not by standing idly by if judges are violating \nthat process.\n  No. 2, if we carry out our responsibilities, we will look at the act \nas we pass. We will look at the sentences being imposed in the \ncourtrooms of America and if we were wrong in any of those sentences, \nwe should change them. The one area I am confident we could do better \nin is the crack and powder cocaine issue. I am prepared to act on that. \nI have offered legislation that would act on that. It would reduce the \ncrack cocaine sentences significantly. A lot of people don't want to \nappear to be soft on crime. They don't want to appear to reduce any \nsentences. But I have been there. I have seen defendant after defendant \ngo off to jail. Several years in a row my office had some of the \nhighest average sentences in America for drug cases. I didn't apologize \nfor that one bit. But if the sentences are not what we need if some, \nlike powder, are not tough enough and need to be increased, and some \nlike crack need to be reduced we should eliminate some of the \ncriticisms about justice in American by being more consistent in how we \nsentence. That would create more public confidence in the system, and \nwe ought to do that. I am prepared to take the lead on that. In fact, \nSenator Hatch and I have led on that. We have stepped to the plate and \nproposed to make progress.\n  I suggest that the PROTECT Act needs to move forward. Chairman Hatch \nand Chairman Sensenbrenner have done the responsible thing. They have \nexamined the complaints about the Feeney amendment. They have reduced \nthose complaints to an extraordinary degree. They kept this legislation \nfocused on sexual abuse cases, as it should be. We ought to support it.\n  One thing we know is that sexual offenders and predators are repeat \noffenders. A 1998 study of sexual recidivism factors for child \nmolesters showed that 43 percent of offenders sexually reoffended \nwithin a 4-year follow-up period. Almost half of the people arrested as \nchild molesters reoffended in a sexual abuse case within 4 years. I \nwould suggest some of those reoffended and were not caught. There is no \ndoubt in my mind that within 4 years, if this number is accurate, we \ncould say with certainty that over half of those offenders in 4 years \nreoffended. That is a serious social problem.\n  One thing we put in this bill is important. We put in a provision \nthat would allow lifetime supervision after release from custody or \nafter probation, if that occurs, if the judge feels the defendant poses \na danger to society. That is the right thing to do. I am so glad that \nis in this bill. Senator Hatch and I offered language to that effect. \nWe suggested it last year.\n\n  The theory behind it is simply this: science and history tell us that \nchild molesters are repeat offenders. Pedophiles reoffend. Do we want \nto keep them in jail forever? They ought to be kept in jail a long \ntime--no doubt about that in my mind. Should they be kept in jail \nforever? Very few are kept in jail forever, whether they should be or \nnot. Large numbers of them are released. Under the normal Federal \nsentencing guidelines, post conviction supervision is 1 to 5 years. So \nafter that 5 years is over, these sexual offenders are not even being \nsupervised by Federal probation officers.\n  It is a rational and logical and just step to give a Federal judge \nthe ability to impose post-release supervision for as long as he or she \ndeems appropriate. That is a good step in the right direction.\n  According to the Bureau of Justice statistics, released rapists were \n10.5 times as likely as nonrapists to be rearrested for rape, and those \nwho had served time for sexual assault were 7.5 times more likely as \nthose convicted of any other crime to be rearrested for a new sexual \nassault. Do you see what that is saying? Those are stunning numbers, \nwhen you think about it. They tell us that released rapists are 10 \ntimes more likely to rape someone else in the future; that tells us \nthat when you apprehend a rapist, it needs to be taken seriously. We \nneed to understand that a person who has committed rape in the past has \na much, much greater potential for raping another innocent human being \nin the future or for molesting another child in the future. That is why \nFederal supervision can be helpful there.\n  Good Federal probation officers work hard. They stay on top of \noffenders. Perhaps they can identify circumstances when offenders may \nbe getting in trouble or acting in an unhealthy way, to make sure that \nthe jobs sexual offenders take do not place them in contact with \nchildren. Perhaps probation officers can otherwise monitor offenders' \nactivities to substantially reduce the likelihood that they would \nreoffend.\n  I thank Senator Hatch for his leadership. We thought we had an \nagreement with Senators Leahy and Kennedy and others to move this bill \nforward. Unfortunately, we are not moving forward at this moment. I \nhope we can break the logjam so that this important legislation will go \nforward to final passage.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I will only speak for about 3 or 4 \nminutes, I tell the Senator from Massachusetts. I appreciate the \nrecognition.\n  I want to speak on the AMBER alert portion of this legislation \nbecause we have been working on it for several months. We passed AMBER \nalert legislation last year. Senator Feinstein and I cosponsored the \nlegislation. Senator Hatch and Senator Leahy were very supportive. We \npassed AMBER alert again this year and hoped very much that we could \nget a clean bill that would be signed quickly by the President.\n  However, I know provisions were added that are very good provisions. \nI am very pleased that we have finally gotten a bill that the House has \npassed and would be able hopefully to pass this legislation and send it \nto the President.\n  Because the AMBER alert is proven to save lives, Senator Feinstein \nand I have been working very hard to get it passed through the Senate. \nEd Smart, a constituent of the distinguished Senator from Utah, told us \nhow important AMBER alerts were in helping to find his daughter \nElizabeth. Even though she is one of the few abducted children who was \nfound after a long period, it was the publicity that made the \ndifference because a person who saw the picture of the suspect in the \npaper then saw the suspect on the street, and the police were able to \nwalk up to the suspect and Elizabeth Smart was right\n\n[[Page S5133]]\n\nthere with him. So it does make a difference that we have this kind of \npublicity.\n  To date, sixty abducted children have been recovered with the \nassistance of AMBER alert. In fact, the statistics show that 75 percent \nof recovered children are recovered within the first 3 hours. You can \nonly do this with the large electronic road signs and with media \nhelping you to get the word out that this is a child in peril. That is \nwhy the AMBER alerts do work, and the quick recovery is the best chance \nwe have for a recovery at all.\n  There are Federal grants authorized in this legislation that will \nhelp educate States about AMBER alerts and assist States so they won't \nbe overused. The legislation will provide for a person who will be in \nthe Justice Department--the AMBER coordinator--so that a law \nenforcement officer who believes a suspect may be going to another \nState can make one call to the Justice Department and not worry again \nabout the recovery effort continuing. The Justice Department can put \nthe word out to the other contiguous States and really make a \ndifference.\n  The AMBER alert bill has had a lot of supporters: The National Center \nfor Missing and Exploited Children, the National Association of \nBroadcasters, and the Fraternal Order of Police have all been \ninstrumental in passing this legislation. I had hoped we could pass it \nearlier. I had hoped we would have passed it last year to get other \nStates up to speed, so they would have good, solid AMBER alert systems \nthat would coordinate with the Justice Department. But it is April of \n2003 now and it is time to pass this legislation.\n  Senator Feinstein and I have worked very hard to do this. We thank \nSenator Hatch and we thank those who helped us with the original \nlegislation. I know there are differences in some of the add-ons. \nBelieve me, we would have liked to have had a clean bill. But we don't \nget exactly what we want in the legislative process. There are a lot of \nother people with different views and they have to be accommodated.\n  So I am very pleased we have the bill before us. I intend to support \nit, and I hope we can pass it and send it to the President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I listened to the Senator from Texas in \nterms of her strong support. I know she has been involved in the AMBER \nlegislation, as others have, such as my friend and colleague from \nVermont. We all remember the work done by the committee itself last \nyear when we initially sent this over to the House of Representatives. \nWe waited a long time. It didn't come back. We sent it back over in \nJanuary. It didn't come back. Now we have this part come back, of which \nwe are all in support.\n  I must say there are procedures that probably would have to be \nstreamlined, but the provisions that apply to those who are going to be \ninvolved in the abduction and kidnaping of children and the various sex \ncrimes outlined and considered in the legislation, that is not any \npoint of dispute. We are in strong support.\n  The fact is, there are other factors included in this legislation on \nwhich there haven't been hearings and which basically undermine the \ncriminal justice system, as pointed out by the Chief Justice of the \nUnited States. It is not just the Senator from Massachusetts, it is the \nChief Justice of the U.S. and he has not been known as a coddler of \ncriminals or lenient on defendants. That is not the reputation of the \nChief Justice of the United States, Mr. Rehnquist. Yet he has serious \nreservations about the provisions of this legislation which we have \naddressed earlier today and which were addressed in the conference.\n  So I want to make some additional remarks at this time to once again \nlet my colleagues know what is really involved in the legislation.\n  As I mentioned earlier, when we came out of conference, it was said \nby the chairman of the committee that rather than have the Sentencing \nCommission do a review and report back in 180 days about the sentencing \nrequirements under this legislation, then we could either enhance or \nadjust, or rather than even having hearings by the Criminal Justice \nSubcommittee of the Judiciary Committee, then we could move ahead and \nconsider those on the floor of the Senate. We accepted, after the 6 or \n7 minutes of debate and discussion on the floor of the House of \nRepresentatives, and without any hearings whatsoever in the Senate or \nin the Judiciary Committee, provisions that have broad application to \nall of the sentencing guidelines. We have heard explanations that they \nreally don't, but they do.\n  I will review them very quickly here this afternoon once again. There \nare three major ways in which this conference report goes beyond the \nissues of crimes against children.\n  First, the bill changes the standard of appellate review in all \ncases, not just cases in which children are victims. This overturns a \nunanimous Supreme Court decision and radically changes the Federal \nsentencing system.\n  Do we understand that? This legislation overturns a unanimous Supreme \nCourt decision, without a single day, hour, or minute of hearings. That \nis one reason the Chief Justice, the Judicial Conference of Judges, the \nAmerican Bar Association, all have expressed their opposition to these \nprovisions.\n  Second, the bill imposes new reporting requirements when judges \ndepart in any case, not just children cases, and this is a blatant \nattempt to intimidate the judiciary. It says to judges you will be \ncalled on the carpet if you depart downward. Your name will be given to \nthe Attorney General and he will report you to Congress. If that isn't \na blacklisting for Federal judges, I don't know what is, Mr. President. \nIf these judges are not competent to serve on the Federal judiciary, \nthey should not have been recommended--in these cases, Republican \nPresidents--or approved by a Republican Senate. But these are the ones \nwho are basically applying these guidelines at the present time.\n  Third, the bill directs the Sentencing Commission to limit downward \ndepartures in all cases, not just child cases. This proposal is based \non the erroneous view that there is excessive leniency in the Federal \nsentencing system. The Federal prison population has quadrupled in the \nlast 20 years. The length of sentences is up dramatically in 20 years.\n  Those are three major departures from the assurances that were given \nby the chairman of the Judiciary Committee in that conference. His \namendment, which is included in the conference, would only apply to the \nissues that were before us dealing with children and children's crimes. \nThese are three examples of where they will affect all of the \nsentencing, and that has not been refuted this afternoon.\n  I want to take a moment of time to consider a response to many of the \nclaims that have been made here about the problems in the Federal \ncriminal system--claims, quite frankly, that are not supported by any \nrecord in the Senate, I might add. This is the analysis of eight highly \nrespected former U.S. attorneys, most of whom are Republicans. They \nwrote to the Judiciary Committee:\n\n       We write, as former United States Attorneys in the Southern \n     and Eastern Districts of New York, to express our concern \n     about Section 109 of S. 151/H.R. 1104, the Child Abduction \n     Prevention Act. This proposed legislation--which contains \n     some of the most far-reaching revisions of the federal \n     sentencing process in many years--was passed by the House of \n     Representatives on March 27, 2003. Our concern regarding this \n     legislation is based not only on the questionable \n     justification for many of its provisions, but also on the \n     fact that it has already been adopted by one house of \n     Congress without any meaningful input from the judiciary, the \n     Sentencing Commission, members of the bar or other interested \n     experts and members of the criminal justice community.\n\n  It continues:\n\n       . . . The proposed legislation not only disregards the \n     Sentencing Commission's unique role in the federal sentencing \n     process, but also ignores Congress' own admonition that the \n     views of interested parties in the federal criminal justice \n     system be carefully considered before changes to the \n     Guidelines are enacted.\n       The proposed legislation raises serious questions on its \n     merits as well. To start, the justification for such sweeping \n     changes is unclear. Although the number of downward \n     departures not based on cooperation has increased in the last \n     several years, 70 percent of that increase is attributable to \n     departures in a small number of ``border'' districts that \n     handle an extraordinary number of immigration cases which \n     place unique demands on\n\n[[Page S5134]]\n\n     the criminal justice system. The localized nature of this \n     increase does not justify a nationwide restriction on the \n     availability of downward departures in all cases.\n       The sparse legislative history of this proposal similarly \n     reflects that it is an unnecessarily broad response to a \n     particularized concern. The amendment's author has stated \n     that the legislation is prompted by the fact that a \n     ``disturbing trend has occurred, especially in child \n     pornography cases'' and that departures have become a \n     ``common occurrence.'' If downward departures have become \n     commonplace in one particular type of case, then careful \n     scrutiny of the reasons for this phenomenon, and of the \n     appropriateness of the Guideline level for that type of case, \n     may well be warranted. It does not, however, justify a \n     wholesale restriction of downward departures for all cases \n     within the criminal justice system.\n       The legislation also contemplates unwarranted limitations \n     on the exercise of sentencing discretion by the federal \n     judiciary. A United States District Judge has the unique and \n     difficult responsibility of imposing criminal punishment on a \n     defendant based on an individualized assessment of the facts \n     and circumstances of a particular case. Indeed, Congress has \n     explicitly recognized that the Sentencing Guidelines are \n     intended not only to avoid unwarranted disparity in \n     sentencing but also to maintain ``sufficient flexibility to \n     permit individualized sentences when warranted by mitigating \n     or aggravating factors not taken into account in the \n     establishment of general sentencing practices.'' 28 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 991(b)(1)(B). . . . \n       In fiscal year 2001, putting aside the ``border'' districts \n     and departures based on cooperation (which require the \n     government's consent), district judges departed downward only \n     10.2 percent of the time. Moreover, 85 percent of all \n     defendants who received non-cooperation downward departures \n     that year nevertheless were sentenced to prison. What these \n     statistics reveal is a relatively limited exercise of \n     sentencing discretion of the sort contemplated by Congress \n     when it authorized the promulgation of the Guidelines.\n       The legislation also would overrule the Supreme Court's \n     decision in Koon v. United States, 518 U.S. 81 (1996). This, \n     too, is of serious concern. In Koon, all nine Justices of the \n     Supreme Court recognized that an appellate court should \n     review a decision to depart from the Guidelines with ``due \n     deference'' to the district court's decision, and that such a \n     decision should be overruled only if the district court \n     abuses its discretion.\n\n  That is what the Supreme Court said, but that is not what is in the \nHatch amendment.\n  Continuing to quote the letter:\n\n       The decision correctly recognized that district judges are \n     uniquely qualified to decide whether a departure from the \n     Guidelines is justified by the particular circumstances of a \n     given case or the background of a particular defendant. The \n     legislation's substitution of a de novo standard of review \n     would allow appellate courts to second-guess sentencing \n     decisions without any meaningful guidance as to when those \n     decisions should or should not be upheld. Moreover, given the \n     fact that the government currently has the ability to appeal \n     unauthorized or excessive downward departures and is \n     successful in such appeals about 80 percent of the time--\n\n  Understand that, 80 percent of the time when the Government appeals \nthese cases, they are successful.\n\n       A change in the appellate standard of review appears \n     unnecessary to enable the appellate courts to overturn \n     unwarranted departures.\n       These and other concerns have prompted objections to the \n     proposed legislation from representatives of a wide variety \n     of interested parties to this issue. This includes the \n     Secretary of the Judicial Conference of the United States, \n     all five current voting members of the United States \n     Sentencing Commission, all three Chairpersons of the \n     Commission since its creation, the President of the American \n     Bar Association, and numerous other bar organizations. As \n     former members of the Department of Justice, we respectfully \n     urge you to allow careful consideration of their views, and \n     those of other interested parties, in a public forum before \n     deciding upon the wisdom of any of the sentencing reforms \n     contained in this proposed legislation.\n\n  Imagine that, they are requesting us to give some consideration and \nhave a hearing on it. According to the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, there is no chance for that. We are just going to be faced \nwith this situation.\n  The entire premise of the Feeney amendment is that departure from the \nguidelines is a problem that needs to be stamped out. That reflects the \nfundamental misunderstanding of the guideline system. We never intended \nthe Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 to eliminate judicial discretion. We \nstruck a balance between sentencing uniformity and individualized \nsentencing. We recognized that guidelines cannot possibly describe \nevery single case. We need uniform rules, but then we need flexibility \nin individual cases.\n  There is no epidemic of leniency in the Federal criminal justice \nsystem. The Federal prison population has quadrupled in the last 20 \nyears. It is now larger than any State system.\n  The departure rate is not excessive. In the committee report \naccompanying the 1984 act, we anticipated a departure rate of around 20 \npercent. That is what the estimates were at the time we accepted the \nFederal guidelines. In fact, the rate at which judges today depart over \nthe objection of the Government is slightly more than 10 percent. So we \nare well within the acceptable rates.\n  If there is any problem at all, it is with Government departures. The \nAmerican Bar Association reports that 79 percent of the downward \ndepartures in the United States were requested by the Government. \nUnlike judicial departures, which are subject to appellate review, \ndepartures sought by prosecutors are essentially unreviewable. Maybe we \nneed to look at the procedures adopted by the Department of Justice in \nthis area.\n  Why do judges depart? According to the Sentencing Commission, the \nsecond most frequent reason for departure is ``pursuant to a plea \nagreement.'' That accounts for 17.6 percent of downward departures \nother than substantial assistance. Only a small fraction of departures \nare based on the offender traits the Senator from Utah complains \nabout--family ties, 3.8 percent; rehabilitation, 1.7 percent; mental \nconditions, 1.1 percent.\n  It is only a small number of defendants that benefit from judicial \nleniency. In all the talk about leniency, we forget who these judges \nare. Many were appointed by Republican Presidents. All were confirmed \nby the Senate. Many are former prosecutors or other government \nofficials. These are not people predisposed to sympathy for criminals. \nThey are toughminded, responsible pillars of their communities trying \ntheir best to impose just sentences within the constraints of the law. \nAlmost 80 percent of the time, the prosecutor agrees that leniency is \nwarranted. Sometimes the Government does not agree, and that is what an \nappellate review is for.\n  Moreover, the Government wins 78.1 percent of all sentencing appeals. \nSo that mechanism is functioning very well to ensure tough sentences.\n  In this proposal, judges will now have less discretion, and so the \nprosecutor--listen to this, Mr. President--and so the prosecutor will \ndictate the sentence in more and more cases. This is a dangerous \ndevelopment. Judicial discretion in sentencing is an accountability \nmeasure. It is an important way to check the excesses of the \nprosecutor. Our system of government is founded on that type of checks \nand balances. But by weakening the judiciary and depriving judges of \nthe tools they need to do justice in individual cases, the proposal \nundermines accountability and diminishes justice.\n  This is not the end of the fight. It took us 10 years, 75 hearings, \nand extensive consultation with top judges, prosecutors, defense \nattorneys, and other experts to achieve the right balance between \nensuring fairness and consistency in the criminal justice system and \npreserving judges' judicial sentencing discretion.\n  It is not right for us to destroy that balance through an ill-\nconsidered measure that has not received any hearings or any debate in \nthe Senate.\n  It is not right to transform the entire Federal guideline system into \na system of mandatory minimum sentences. Just yesterday, Justice \nKennedy vigorously criticized the existing mandatory minimums as unfair \nand inconsistent with fundamental principles of justice.\n  Of course, Chief Justice Rehnquist, as I mentioned, not known to be \nparticularly sympathetic to criminal defendants, has described this \nprovision as doing serious harm to the basic structure of the \nsentencing guidelines system and impairing the ability of courts to \nimpose just and responsible sentences.\n  That is what the Chief Justice has stated about these provisions in \nthis legislation that we are about to consider, as well as Justice \nKennedy, also nominated by a Republican President and not known to be a \ncoddler of criminals or lenient in terms of sentencing.\n  It is a slap in the face of Federal judges, who have to apply the \nguidelines system on a daily basis, to include these provisions in the \nconference report. It is wrong for my Republican colleagues to \nmisrepresent the nature of this provision, to suggest\n\n[[Page S5135]]\n\nthat it is limited to serious crimes against children, when they know \nmore serious provisions will apply to all of the offenses. It is wrong \nto hold protections for children hostage in order to ram through this \nsweeping, ill-advised provision without a single hour or day of \nhearings or debate.\n  I will continue to pursue this issue and do everything I can to \nprotect the reforms we have achieved on a strong bipartisan basis in \nthe Sentencing Reform Act of 1984.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the conference report be defeated, that \nthe Senate concur in the House amendment with an amendment which is the \ntext of the conference report with a new title IV.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, if this \nchange were allowed, as the Senator's unanimous consent request asks, \nit would effectively kill this bill, and he knows it. If Senators on \nthe other side of the aisle want to vote against this conference \nreport, they can do so.\n  The point is that we are prepared to vote on this bill today and to \nget this to the President for signature before the impending recess so \nthat there will not be any more children subjected to what Elizabeth \nSmart was subjected to, or at least we can have a better set of tools \nto solve these problems. Therefore, we cannot agree to this request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the consent be modified so that there \nnow be 30 additional minutes of debate on the conference report, to be \nequally divided in the usual form, and that following that time, the \nSenate proceed to a vote on adoption of the conference report, with no \nfurther intervening action or debate.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Reserving the right to object, if I may.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The unanimous consent request before the \nSenate is the request from the Senator from Massachusetts. The Senator \nfrom Utah has suggested a modification of that request.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Under the rules, the Senator can either object or accede \nto that request. I retain my right to the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator from Massachusetts calling for \nregular order?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Regular order.\n  Mr. HATCH. Then I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Utah object?\n  Mr. HATCH. I object to the request of the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I have not lost the floor.\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/10/senate-section/article/S5135-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5135]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR FRIDAY, APRIL 11, 2003\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

While it would be \npossible to yield back some of that time, there is no way that all of \nit will be yielded back.\n  The supplemental appropriations bill is something that some Members \nwill have to take a look at before agreeing to a time limit or final \nvote on it. So we have a lot to do.\n  I am personally disappointed that we are not going to be able to move \nsome of those items tonight, but I understand, having been in the same \nposition as my friend from Kentucky, that we do not always have control \nover what goes on.\n  On this side, we will be happy to cooperate any way we can, but these \nare very important issues and we can only give up so many rights. We \nhave to be very careful what rights we give up, I guess is what I \nshould say.\n  I repeat for the third time, we will cooperate tomorrow in any way we \ncan short of giving up what we believe are principled matters on these \ntwo important issues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It is certainly our hope and desire to finish both the \nsupplemental appropriations and the budget conference tomorrow. That is \nthe goal we are all working toward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/10/senate-section/article/S5135-2", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5135]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

The Senator from Massachusetts \nretains the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am going to send to the desk the \nunderlying legislation which also strikes the provisions in title IV. \nIt will limit them to the serious crimes against children. This is what \nwas basically agreed to in the conference report, the AMBER \nlegislation, and the provisions in that Feeney amendment that apply to \nchildren as was, I think, represented by the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  I send the legislation of the committee to the desk and ask for its \nappropriate referral.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nmeasure will be received and appropriately referred.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I now renew any unanimous consent request, \nwithout losing my right to the floor, that we have 30 additional \nminutes of debate on the conference report, to be equally divided in \nthe usual form, and that following that time, the Senate proceed to a \nvote on adoption of the conference report, with no further intervening \naction or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I would like to speak for a few minutes on this bill, \nif I might.\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator will withhold, I will yield a few minutes \nto the Senator, but I first want to do this unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Would the Chair explain what the parliamentary order is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be up to 30 minutes of debate, \nevenly divided, on the conference report. At the expiration of the \ntime, a vote will occur on the report, without any intervening action \nor debate.\n  Mr. HATCH. With that understanding then, I yield to the distinguished \nSenator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I must say I really think this is \nunfortunate. When Senator Hutchison and I proposed the AMBER alert in \nthe last session and when Senator Leahy was good enough to see that it \npassed through the committee very rapidly, the Senate voted on it, the \nHouse did not. This year Senator Hatch was good enough, as chairman, to \nsee that it passed through the Judiciary Committee very rapidly. The \nSenate passed the bill. It went to the House, and it became confused in \nwhat is a rather monumental discussion.\n  I want to make a couple of comments on the AMBER alert bill, and then \nI want to make a few comments on the remainder of the bill.\n  More than any other single law enforcement tool, I deeply believe, as \ndoes Senator Hutchison, that the AMBER alert can result in an abducted \nchild being brought home safely. We know it works, and we know it is a \nprogram that should be nationwide.\n  To date, in 39 States and 49 local and regional jurisdictions, there \nis an AMBER alert. This is up from 16 States and 32 local and regional \njurisdictions just last August. These alerts have been extremely \nsuccessful. They have resulted in the return of 53 abducted children \nacross the country. Hallelujah. That is 53 families who did not have to \nsuffer the pain of losing a loved one, 53 families who did not have to \nlive through the trauma of losing a child, and that is why this \nlegislation is so important. That is why I am going to vote for this \nbill.\n  The first hours after a child is taken are critical. If the child is \nnot found in those first few hours, chances increase dramatically that \nhe or she will disappear forever, and this is the power of the AMBER \nalert. An alert can be issued within minutes of an abduction and \ndisseminate key information.\n  Since the State of California first adopted the AMBER alert just 9 \nmonths ago, 25 AMBER alerts have been issued involving 31 victims. Each \nof these alerts ended with the child being united with their family. \nOne cannot argue with results like that.\n  The provision included in the conference report has a number of key \ncomponents. It would authorize $20 million for the Department of \nTransportation and $5 million to the Department of Justice for the \ndevelopment of AMBER alert systems in States where they do not exist; \nit would build upon the President's Executive order by authorizing a \nnational coordinator; and it would reduce the number of false alerts.\n  The bill would provide a framework for the Justice Department to \nestablish minimum standards for the regional coordination of AMBER \nalerts. It is a good bill. We need it.\n  The report also includes several provisions similar to legislation \nthat I sponsored, with Senator Hatch, which would enhance national \nefforts to investigate, prosecute, and prevent crimes against children. \nI really regret that these provisions have become enmeshed with other \nconcerns over the conference report.\n  I heard Senator Kennedy speak in the Judiciary Committee this \nmorning. I have heard him speak on the floor this afternoon. I \nunderstand his concerns. I do not believe judges should have to report \ntheir sentences on child crime to the Congress of the United States. I \nthink that is a mistake. It should not happen.\n\n[[Page S5138]]\n\n  With respect to Koon v. the United States, I think it is a mistake to \nlet appellate courts change the standard of review. I hope the \nJudiciary Committee will consider these things in the future.\n  Let me state what is in the report that I agree with. It mandates \nthat sex offenders be supervised for a minimum of 5 years after they \nare released from prison. I agree.\n  It ensures that the murder of a child committed as part of a pattern \nof assaulting or torturing a child is considered first-degree murder. I \nagree.\n  It increases the maximum and minimum penalties for anyone who \nsexually exploits a child. For first conviction, a maximum penalty is \n30 years, increased from 20 years. And the minimum sentence is 15 \nyears, increased from 10 years. I happen to agree.\n  It creates a mandatory minimum penalty for kidnapping of not less \nthan 20 years. Some do not agree with mandatories. I understand that. I \nrespect that. But in the instance of a child, I agree with mandatories.\n  It creates a crime with a maximum penalty of 30 years for a U.S. \ncitizen traveling within or outside the United States to engage in \nillegal sexual conduct with children. I agree.\n  It requires a person convicted a second time of a Federal sex offense \ninvolving children to receive a penalty of life imprisonment unless a \ndeath sentence is imposed.\n  Now, if a person is going to be convicted of sexually abusing \nchildren twice, the question comes, should there be a third time? I \nhave to say there shouldn't be a third time. I support this provision.\n  It makes it a crime to attempt international parental kidnapping. \nCurrently, only actual parental kidnapping is illegal. The attempt \nshould be illegal, as well. I support that.\n  It removes the statute of limitations for child abduction and sex \ncrimes. I agree with that.\n  It creates a Federal crime with a 2-year maximum penalty for creating \na domain name with the intent to deceive a person into viewing obscene \nmaterial on the Internet. The maximum penalty is 4 years if the intent \nis to deceive a minor. I agree.\n  It creates a rebuttal presumption against bail for a person accused \nof raping or kidnapping a victim who was under 18.\n  It expands reporting requirements for missing children from 18 to 21 \nyears. Current law requires a host of Federal agencies to report a case \nof a child under 18 who is missing to the National Crime Information \nCenter. In this case, the age of a missing child for reporting purposes \nis increased to 21.\n  It provides more funding for the National Center for Missing and \nExploited Children, increasing funding by $10 million in both fiscal \nyears 2004 and 2005.\n  I wish it did not have to happen this way. I would have felt much \nbetter if we had a chance in the Judiciary Committee to hold the \nrequisite decisions and debate this more fully. I am very hopeful those \nthings which are very controversial--and there are a few in this bill--\nwe will have an opportunity to hear further and amend, if necessary.\n  What is important is to get the AMBER alert established nationally. \nIf we had been at this for a month or two, I would not feel the way I \ndo today. But we passed this bill in this body in the last Congress. \nYet here we are today. I wish it could be a clean bill. I wish it could \nbe just AMBER alert, but I am very pleased and will support the passage \nof this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that today we will finally \npass into law a very important bill designed to protect children.\n  As an original cosponsor of the National AMBER Alert Network Act, S. \n121, I have worked with my Senate colleagues to do all that we possibly \ncan to speedily pass it into law. Twice now we rapidly passed our bill \nthrough the Senate on unanimous, bipartisan votes--last fall and again \nin January. Both times House leaders chose not to pass it, instead \ndelaying its assured passage into law by using the bill as a \n``sweetener'' for a package of other controversial provisions that the \nSenate has not previously considered. The Smart family--who credit the \nAMBER Alert for the safe return of Elizabeth--has repeatedly joined us \nto urge House leaders to promptly take up and pass our Senate bill.\n  Had House leaders opted to stand up and do what is right from the \nbeginning, we would already have a nationwide AMBER Alert system in \nplace to save our children's lives when they are abducted. We will \nnever know how many children could have been saved by a nationwide \nAMBER Plan--if the House had simply passed our bill when the Senate \ndid, I daresay the number of children rescued from their abductors and \ndeath would be much higher. Efforts to protect our children do not \ndeserve to be used as pawns by groups who play politics by attaching it \nto more controversial measures.\n  That being said, I am pleased that AMBER Alert legislation is \nincluded in the conference report, as it will aid states in their fight \nagainst the disturbingly increasing trend of child abductions and their \noften tragic ends. Our plan will enhance the AMBER Alert system created \nafter the 1996 kidnapping and murder of 9-year-old Amber Hagerman of \nArlington, TX. Since 1996, AMBER Alerts have helped rescue 53 children \nfrom their abductors nationwide by using broadcasters, law enforcement \nofficials, road signs and a variety of other tools to instantly \ndisseminate information about child abductions.\n  Today 39 States have statewide AMBER Alert plans. Our AMBER Alert \nlegislation included in the conference report will create voluntary \nstandards that would help States determine the criteria for AMBER \nAlerts and for quickly disseminating official information during AMBER \nAlerts. A newly appointed coordinator within the Justice Department \nwill oversee the communication network for abducted children, working \nwith states, broadcasters, and law enforcement agencies to set up and \nsupplement AMBER plans and responses.\n  Our plan will give law enforcement agencies a powerful tool, while \nproviding flexibility for states to implement the alert system. States \nalso need financial help to create effective Amber Alert systems, and \nthis conference report creates two Federal grant programs to help \nStates establish AMBER plans. One, administered by the Department of \nTransportation, will give States assistance creating Statewide \nnotification and communications systems, including message boards and \nroad signs to help in the recovery of abducted children. The other, \nadministered by the Justice Department, will help States create \ncommunications plans with law enforcement agencies and the communities \nthey serve. My State of Vermont does not yet have an AMBER Alert \nsystem, and law enforcement officials in Vermont have begun laying the \ngroundwork for a system there. They welcome the Federal help our bill \nwill offer to get a system up and running.\n  As a father and grandfather I know that an abducted child is a \nfamily's worst nightmare, and one that happens far too often. The \nfamilies of children taken by strangers need our help, and they will \nget it with the passage of the AMBER Alert legislation.\n  The conference report we consider today includes another very \nimportant piece of legislation this one designed to protect children \nfrom being exploited by child pornographers. I should know because I \nhelped to write this bill in the Senate. Indeed, I am the lead \ncosponsor of the Senate bill, S.151, which we sent over to the House \nwith a vote of 84-0.\n  Ironically, the House and the conference committee have added so many \nextra controversial provisions to the conference report bill that one \nof its core elements, and the element that gives the conference report \nits title--the PROTECT Act--is buried near the end in Title V. Title V \nis largely the bill that Senator Hatch and I jointly crafted, held \nhearings on, and moved through the Senate as the PROTECT Act. I would \nlike to discuss both the content and history of the provisions in this \ntitle of the conference reported bill.\n  When Senator Hatch and I introduced S. 151 in January, I supported \npassing a bill that was identical to the measure that we worked so hard \nto craft in the last Congress. That bill had passed the Judiciary \nCommittee and the Senate unanimously in the 107th Congress. It did not \nbecome law last year because, even though the Senate\n\n[[Page S5139]]\n\nwas still meeting, considering and passing legislation, the House of \nRepresentatives had adjourned and would not return to take action on \nthis measure, which had passed the Senate unanimously, or to work out \nour differences.\n  As I said when we introduced the Hatch-Leahy PROTECT Act and again as \nthe Judiciary Committee considered this measure, although this bill is \nnot perfect, it is a good faith effort to provide powerful tools for \nprosecutors to deal with the problem of child pornography within \nconstitutional limits. We failed to do that in the 1996 Child \nPornography Protection Act (\"CPPA\"), a significant portion of which the \nSupreme Court struck down last year. We must not make the same mistake \nagain. The last thing we want to do is to create years of legal limbo \nfor our nation's children, after which the courts strike down yet \nanother law as unconstitutional.\n  I also said at our Judiciary Committee markup and again when the \nSenate passed this bill unanimously that I hoped we could pass the bill \nin the same form as it unanimously passed in the last Congress. \nUnfortunately, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and in the \nHouse have jointly decided not to follow this route. Despite this fact, \nI have continued to work with Senator Hatch to craft the strongest bill \npossible that will produce convictions that will stick under the \nConstitution.\n  I was also glad to learn that, after we passed the bill unanimously, \nthe administration ``strongly supported'' the Senate version of the \nbill. However, the House still chose not to enact the Senate bill, \ninstead adding numerous controversial provisions to it. That is a \nshame, because it was no easy feat to move a bill fraught with such \nconstitutional difficulties as the PROTECT Act to the point where not a \nsingle Senator voted against it.\n  I want to take a moment to speak again about the history of this \nimportant bill and the joint effort that it took to get to this point. \nIn May of 2002, I came to the Senate floor and joined Senator Hatch in \nintroducing the PROTECT Act , after the Supreme Court's decision in \nAshcroft v. Free Speech Coalition (\"Free Speech\"). Although there were \nsome others who raised constitutional concerns about specific \nprovisions in that bill, I believed that unlike legislative language \nproposed by the administration in the last Congress, it was a good \nfaith effort to work within the first amendment.\n  Everyone in the Senate agrees that we should do all we can to protect \nour children from being victimized by child pornography. That would be \nan easy debate and vote. The more difficult thing is to write a law \nthat will both do that and will produce convictions that stick. In \n1996, when we passed the CPPA many warned us that certain provisions of \nthat Act violated the first amendment. The Supreme Court's decision \nlast year in Free Speech has proven them correct.\n  I believed and continue to believe that we should not sit by and do \nnothing. It is important that we respond to the Supreme Court's \ndecision. It is just as important, however, that we avoid repeating our \npast mistakes. Unlike the CPPA, this time we must respond with a law \nthat passes constitutional muster. Our children deserve more than a \npress conference on this issue. They deserve a law that will last, \nrather than one that will be stricken from the law books.\n  It is important that we do all we can to end the victimization of \nreal children by child pornographers, but it is also important that we \npass a law that will withstand first amendment scrutiny. We need a law \nwith real bite, not one with false teeth.\n  After joining Senator Hatch in introducing the PROTECT Act in the \n107th Congress, as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee in the last \nCongress, I convened a hearing on October 2, 2002 on the legislation. \nWe heard from the Administration, from the National Center for Missing \nand Exploited Children, NCMEC, and from experts who came and told us \nthat our bill, as introduced, would pass constitutional muster, but the \nHouse-passed bill supported by the administration would not.\n  I then placed the Hatch-Leahy PROTECT Act on the Judiciary \nCommittee's calendar for the October 8, 2002, business meeting. I \ncontinued to work with Senator Hatch to improve the bill so that it \ncould be quickly enacted. Unfortunately the Judiciary Committee was \nunable to consider it because of procedural maneuvering by my \ncolleagues that had nothing to do with this important legislation.\n  I still wanted to get this bill done. That is why, for a full week \nlast October, I worked to clear and have the full Senate pass a \nsubstitute to the bill that tracked the Hatch-Leahy proposed committee \nsubstitute in nearly every area.\n  Indeed, the substitute I offered even adopted parts of the House bill \nwhich would help NCMEC work with local and State law enforcement on \nthese cases. Twice, I spoke on the Senate floor imploring that we \napprove such legislation. As I stated then, every single Democratic \nSenator cleared that measure. I then urged Republicans to work on their \nside of the aisle to clear this measure which was substantially similar \nto the joint Hatch-Leahy substitute so that we could swiftly enact a \nlaw that would pass constitutional muster. Unfortunately, they did not. \nFacing the recess before the mid-term elections, we were stymied again.\n  Even after the last election, during our lameduck session, I \ncontinued to work with Senator Hatch to pass this legislation in the \nSenate. As I had stated I would do prior to the election, I called a \nmeeting of the Judiciary Committee on November 14, 2002. In the last \nmeeting of the Judiciary Committee under my Chairmanship in the 107th \nCongress, I placed S. 2520, the Hatch-Leahy PROTECT Act, on the agenda \nyet again. At that meeting the Judiciary Committee amended and approved \nthis legislation. We agreed on a substitute and to improvements in the \nvictim shield provision that I authored.\n  I did not agree with certain of Senator Hatch's committee amendments \nbecause I thought that they risked having the bill declared \nunconstitutional. I nevertheless both called for the committee to \napprove the bill and voted for the bill in its amended form. That is \nthe legislative process and it was followed for this portion of the \nbill. We studied and argued the issues. I compromised on some issues, \nand Senator Hatch compromised on others. Even though the bill was not \nexactly as either of us would have wished, we both worked fervently to \nseek its passage.\n  The same day as the bill unanimously passed the Judiciary Committee, \nI sought to gain the unanimous consent of the full Senate to pass the \nHatch-Leahy PROTECT Act as reported, and I worked with Senator Hatch to \nclear the bill on both sides of the aisle. I am pleased that the Senate \ndid pass the bill by unanimous consent. I want to thank Senator Hatch \nfor all he did to help clear the bill for passage in the 107th \nCongress. Unfortunately, the House failed to act on this measure last \nyear and the administration decided not to push for passage. If they \nhad, we could have passed a bill, sent it to the President, and had a \nnew law to protect children on the books months ago.\n  Instead, we were forced to repeat the entire process again, and we \ndid it. I am glad to have been able to work hand-in-hand with Senator \nHatch on the real ``PROTECT Act''--now Title V of the massive bill we \nare considering--because, it is a bill that gives prosecutors and \ninvestigators the tools they need to combat child pornography. The \nHatch-Leahy PROTECT Act strives to be a serious response to a serious \nproblem. Let me outline some of the important provisions in Title 5 \nthat I helped to write and move through the Senate.\n  I was glad that the House retained the Senate version of Section 503 \nof the bill, which created two new crimes aimed at people who \ndistribute child pornography and those who use such material to entice \nchildren to do illegal acts. Each of these new crimes carries a 15-year \nmaximum prison sentence for a first offense and double that term for \nrepeat offenders. First, the bill criminalizes the pandering of child \npornography, creating a new crime to respond to the Supreme Court's \nrecent ruling striking down the CPPA's definition of pandering. This \nprovision is narrower than the old pandering definition in at least one \nway that responds to a specific Court criticism. The new crime only \napplies to the people who actually pander the child pornography or \nsolicit it, not to all those who possess the material ``downstream,'' \nand it\n\n[[Page S5140]]\n\nrequires the government to demonstrate that the defendant acted with \nthe specific intent that the material is believed to be child \npornography.\n  The bill also contains a directive to the Sentencing Commission which \nasks it to distinguish between those who pander or distribute such \nmaterial and those who only ``solicit'' the material. As with narcotics \ncases, distributors and producers are more culpable than users and \nshould be more harshly punished for maximum deterrent effect. With the \nmany problematic sentencing provisions that were included in the \nconference report, this provision that I crafted does it the correct \nway. It points out an important distinction between possessors and \ndistributors but ultimately leaves it to the bipartisan commission to \nset the guidelines.\n  I would have liked for the pandering provision to be crafted more \nnarrowly so that ``purported'' material was not included and so that \nall pandering prosecutions would be linked to ``obscenity'' doctrine. \nThat is the way that Senator Hatch and I originally wrote and \nintroduced this provision in the last Congress. Unfortunately, the \nSenate amendment process has resulted in some expansions to this once \nnon-controversial provision that may subject it to a constitutional \nchallenge. Thus, while it responds to some specific concerns raised by \nthe Supreme Court, there are constitutional issues that the courts will \nhave to seriously consider with respect to this provision. I will \ndiscuss these issues later.\n  Second, section 503 creates a new crime that I proposed to take \ndirect aim at one of the chief evils of child pornography: namely, its \nuse by sexual predators to entice minors either to engage in sexual \nactivity or the production of more child pornography. This was one of \nthe compelling arguments made by the government before the Supreme \nCourt in support of the CPPA, but the Court rejected that argument as \nan insufficient basis to ban the production, distribution or possession \nof ``virtual'' child pornography. This bill addresses that same harm in \na more targeted and narrowly tailored manner. It creates a new felony, \nwhich applies to both actual and virtual child pornography, for people \nwho use such material to entice minors to participate in \nillegal activity. This will provide prosecutors a potent new tool to \nput away those who prey upon children using such pornography--whether \nthe child pornography is virtual or not.\n\n  Next, this bill attempts to revamp the existing affirmative defense \nin child pornography cases both in response to criticisms of the \nSupreme Court and so that the defense does not erect unfair hurdles to \nthe prosecution of cases involving real children. Responding directly \nto criticisms of the Court, the new affirmative defense applies equally \nto those who are charged with possessing child pornography and to those \nwho actually produce it, a change from current law. It also allows, \nagain responding to specific Supreme Court criticisms, for a defense \nthat no actual children were used in the production of the child \npornography--i.e. that it was made using computers.\n  The final bill includes the House provision on banning virtual and \nnon-obscene child pornography, a provision that I have counseled \nagainst in both bills because it renders the bill weaker against \nconstitutional attack. One addition to the bill that I helped to \ninclude is the inclusion of a definition of material as ``graphic'' in \nnature. Had that definition, which narrowed the field to hard core \nchild pornography, been applied to the entire definition, the measure \nwould have been much stronger against constitutional attack. By also \nincluding ``lascivious simulated'' material in the virtual porn \ndefinition, however, the conference report risks having the entire \nprovision stricken.\n  At the same time, I was pleased the House agreed to accept the \nprovision I authored that protects prosecutors from unfair surprise in \nthe use of this affirmative defense by requiring that a defendant give \nadvance notice of his intent to assert it, just as defendants are \ncurrently required to give if they plan to assert an alibi or insanity \ndefense. As a former prosecutor I suggested this provision because it \naffects the real way that these important trials are conducted. With \nthe provision, the government will have sufficient notice to marshal \nthe expert testimony that may be needed to rebut this ``virtual porn'' \ndefense in cases where real children were victimized.\n  This improved affirmative defense measure also provides important \nsupport for the constitutionality of much of this bill after the Free \nSpeech decision. Even Justice Thomas specifically wrote that it would \nbe a key factor for him. This is one reason for making the defense \napplicable to all non-obscene, child pornography, as defined in 18 \nU.S.C. 2256. In the bill's current form, however, the affirmative \ndefense is not available in one of the new proposed classes of virtual \nchild pornography, which would be found at 18 U.S.C. 2256(8)(C). This \nomission also may render that provision unconstitutional under the \nfirst amendment.\n  The bill also provides much needed assistance to prosecutors in \nrebutting a false ``virtual porn'' defense by removing a restriction on \nthe use of records of performers portrayed in certain sexually explicit \nconduct that are required to be maintained under 18 U.S.C. 2257, and \nexpanding such records to cover computer images. These records, which \nwill be helpful in proving that the material in question is not \n``virtual'' child pornography, may be used in federal child pornography \nand obscenity prosecutions under this act. The purpose of this \nprovision is to protect real children from exploitation. It is \nimportant that prosecutors have access to this information in both \nchild pornography and obscenity prosecutions, since the Supreme Court's \nrecent decision has had the effect of narrowing the child pornography \nlaws, making it more likely that the general obscenity statutes will be \nimportant tools in protecting children from exploitation. In addition, \nthe Act raises the penalties for not keeping accurate records, further \ndeterring the exploitation of minors and enhancing the reliability of \nthe records.\n  Next, the Hatch-Leahy bill contains several provisions altering the \ndefinition of ``child pornography'' in response to the Free Speech \ncase. One approach would have been simply to add an ``obscenity'' \nrequirement to the child pornography definitions. Outlawing all obscene \nchild pornography--real and virtual; minor and youthful-adult; \nsimulated and real--would clearly pass a constitutional challenge \nbecause obscene speech enjoys no protection at all. Under the Miller \nobscenity test, such material--one, ``appeals to the prurient \ninterest,'' two, is utterly ``offensive'' in any ``community,'' and \nthree, has absolutely no serious ``literary, artistic or scientific \nvalue.''\n  Some new provisions of this bill do take this ``obscenity'' approach, \nlike the new section 1466A, which I crafted with Senator Hatch. Other \nprovisions, however, take a different approach. Specifically, the House \nvirtual porn provision 2256(8) include persons who are \n``indistinguishable'' from an actual minor. This adopts language from \nJustice O'Connor's concurrence in the Free Speech case. The problem \nwith that is that Justice O'Connor was not the deciding vote in the \nFree Speech case, she was the seventh vote to strike down the law. \nThus, while this language is defensible, I predict that this provision \nwill be the center of much constitutional debate. Although I will \nexplain in more detail later, these new definitional provisions risk \ncrossing the constitutional line.\n  Title V, which was already in the unanimously passed Senate bill \nbefore the House saw fit to make the bill more controversial, itself \ncontains a variety of other measures designed to increase jail \nsentences in cases where children are victimized by sexual predators. \nFirst, it enhances penalties for repeat offenders of child sex offenses \nby expanding the predicate crimes which trigger tough, mandatory \nminimum sentences. Second, the bill requires the U.S. Sentencing \nCommission to address a disturbing disparity in the current Sentencing \nGuidelines. The current sentences for a person who actually travels \nacross State lines to have sex with a child are not as high as for \nchild pornography. The commission needs to correct this oversight \nimmediately, so that prosecutors can take these dangerous sexual \npredators off the street. These are all strong measures designed to \nprotect children and increase prison sentences for child molesters and \nthose who otherwise exploit children but--unlike the ill-considered \nFeeney and\n\n[[Page S5141]]\n\nHatch-Sensenbrenner amendments--they are done the right way within the \nstructure that Congress established under the Sentencing Reform Act of \n1984.\n  Also retained from the original Hatch-Leahy PROTECT Act are several \nprovisions designed to protect the children who are victims in these \nhorrible cases. Privacy of the children must be paramount. It is \nimportant that they not be victimized yet again in the criminal \nprocess. This bill provides for the first time ever a provision that I \nsuggested. It is an explicit shield law that prohibits the name or \nother non-physical identifying information of the child victim, other \nthan the age or approximate age, from being admitted at any child \npornography trial. It is also intended that judges can and will take \nappropriate steps to ensure that such information as the child's name, \naddress or other identifying information not be publicly disclosed \nduring the pretrial phase of the case or at sentencing. The conference \nreport also retained a Senate provision requiring the judge to instruct \nthe jury, upon request of the government, that no inference should be \ndrawn against the United States because of information inadmissible \nunder the new shield law.\n\n  The conferees also voted to adopt a provision from the original \nHatch-Leahy PROTECT Act that amended certain reporting provisions \ngoverning child pornography. Specifically, it allows Federal \nauthorities to report information they receive from NCMEC to State and \nlocal police without a court order. In addition, the bill removes the \nrestrictions under the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) for \nreporting the contents of, and information pertaining to, a subscriber \nof stored electronic communications to NCMEC when a mandatory child \nporn report is filed with NCMEC pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 13032.\n  While this change may invite rogue Federal, State or local agents to \ntry to circumvent all subpoena and court order requirements under ECPA \nand allow them to obtain subscriber emails and information by \ntriggering the initial report to NCMEC themselves, it should be well \nunderstood that this is not the intention behind this provision. These \nimportant safeguards are not being altered in any way, and a deliberate \nuse of the tip line by a government agent to circumvent the well \nestablished statutory requirements of these provisions would be a \nserious violation of the law. Nevertheless, we should still consider \nfurther clarification in the future to guard against subverting the \nsafeguards in ECPA from government officials going on ``fishing \nexpeditions'' for stored electronic communications under the rubric of \nchild porn investigations.\n  As I made clear when the Senate bill was introduced and again when it \npassed the Senate, I continue to express my disappointment in the \nDepartment of Justice information sharing regulations related to NCMEC \ntip line. According to a recent Government Accounting Office (GAO) \nreport, due to outdated turf mentalities, the Attorney General's \nregulations exclude both the United States Secret Service and the U.S. \nPostal Inspection Service from direct access to important tip line \ninformation. That is totally unacceptable, especially in the post 9-11 \nworld, where the importance of information sharing is greater than \never. How can the Administration justify support of this provision, \nwhich allows state and local law enforcement officers such access, when \nthey are simultaneously refusing to allow other federal law enforcement \nagencies access to the same information? I once more urge the Attorney \nGeneral to end this unseemly turf battle and to issue regulations \nallowing both the Secret Service (now in the Department of Homeland \nDefense) and the Postal Inspection Service, both of whom perform \nvaluable work in investigating these cases, to have access to this \nimportant information so that they can better protect our nation's \nchildren.\n  Section 506 of the conference report also adopted the Senate \nprovision providing for extraterritorial jurisdiction where a defendant \ninduces a child to engage in sexually explicit conduct outside the \nUnited States for the purposes of producing child pornography which \nthey intend to transport to the United States. The provision is crafted \nto require the defendant to have the intent of actual transport of the \nmaterial into the United States, unlike the House bill, which \ncriminalized even an intent to make such material ``accessible.'' Under \nthat overly broad wording, any material posted on a foreign web site \ncould be covered, whether or not it was ever intended that the material \nbe downloaded in the United States. Under the bill we consider today, \nhowever, proof of a specific intent to send such material to the United \nStates is required.\n  Finally, Section 510 of the bill provides a new private right of \naction for the victims of child pornography that was part of the Senate \nbill. This provision has teeth, including injunctive relief and \npunitive damages that will help to put those who produce child \npornography out of business for good. I commend Senator Hatch for his \nleadership on this provision and his recognition that such punitive \ndamages provisions are important means of deterring misconduct. These \nprovisions are important, practical tools to put child pornographers \nout of business for good and in jail where they belong. These are \nprovisions that were in the Senate Hatch-Leahy bill and could have \nalready been law had the House not chosen to hold them hostage to try \nto gain passage of the more controversial elements of the House \npackage.\n  The committee process is there for a reason. It is there because it \ncauses us to work together and improve bills as they go along. The \nSenate version of the PROTECT Act, much of which is included in the \nconference reported bill, is a prime example of the merits of that \nprocess. I only wish that other portions of this bill had been so \nconsidered. Let me explain.\n  As I mentioned previously, the Senate Hatch-Leahy PROTECT Act--most \nof which is now stuck in at the end of the bill--is a good faith effort \nto tackle the child pornography problem, and I have supported its \npassage from the outset. Until our conference, Senator Hatch and I \nworked closely together to make this bill as strong as possible. In \nfact, Senator Hatch and I were able to offer a joint amendment in the \nJudiciary Committee that strengthened the bill further against \nconstitutional attack. Here are some of the improvements that we \njointly made to the bill as introduced and which are in the final bill.\n\n       The Hatch-Leahy committee amendment created a new specific \n     intent requirement in the pandering crime. The provision is \n     now better focused on the true wrongdoers and requires that \n     the government prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the \n     defendant actually intended others to believe that the \n     material in question is obscene child pornography. This is a \n     positive step.\n       The Hatch-Leahy committee amendment narrowed the definition \n     of ``sexually explicit conduct'' for prosecutions of computer \n     created child pornography. Although I continue to have \n     serious reservations about the constitutionality of \n     prosecuting cases involving such ``virtual child \n     pornography'' after the Supreme Court's decision in Free \n     Speech Coalition v. Ashcroft, narrowing the definition of the \n     conduct covered provides another argument that the provision \n     is not as overbroad as the one in the CPPA. I had also \n     proposed a change that contained an even better definition, \n     in order to focus the provision to true ``hard core'' child \n     pornography, and I was glad that this provision--relating to \n     ``graphic'' pornography, was included in the final conference \n     report.\n       The Hatch-Leahy committee amendment refined the definition \n     of virtual child pornography in the provision that Senator \n     Hatch and I worked together to craft last year, which will be \n     a new 18 U.S.C. 1466A. These provisions rely to a large \n     extent on obscenity doctrine, and thus are more rooted in the \n     Constitution than other parts of the bill. I was pleased that \n     the Hatch-Leahy amendments included a definition that the \n     image be ``graphic''--that is, one where the genitalia are \n     actually shown during the sex act--and that the House agreed \n     to adopt this definition for the virtual porn provision as a \n     whole for two reasons.\n       First, because the old law would have required proof of \n     ``actual'' minors in cases with ``virtual'' pictures, I \n     believe that this clarification will remove a potential \n     contradiction from the new law which pornographers could have \n     used to mount a defense.\n       Second, it will provide another argument supporting the \n     law's constitutionality because the new provision is narrowly \n     tailored to cover only the most ``hard core'' child \n     pornography. If only we would have gone the extra step of \n     requiring this level of obscenity for all virtual child \n     pornography, I think the bill would be safe from \n     constitutional challenge, instead of skating along the \n     constitutional edge.\n       The Hatch-Leahy committee amendment also clarified that \n     digital pictures are covered by the PROTECT Act, an important \n     addition in today's world of digital cameras\n\n[[Page S5142]]\n\n     and camcorders. I am glad that the final bill adopted that \n     change.\n\n  These were important changes, and I was glad to work with Senator \nHatch to craft them. It is unfortunate that this bipartisan cooperation \ndid not extend to the controversial provisions that were added to the \nbill in the House and in the conference.\n  Even Title V of this law--the real PROTECT Act--is not perfect, \nhowever, and I would have liked to see some additional improvements to \nthe bill. Let me outline some of them.\n  First, with regard to the tip line, I would have liked to further \nclarify that law enforcement agents may not and should not ``tickle the \ntip line'' to avoid the key protections of the Electronic \nCommunications Privacy Act (ECPA). This might have included modifying \n42 U.S.C. 13032 to clarify that the initial tip triggering the report \nmay not be generated by the government's investigative agents \nthemselves. A tip line to NCMEC is just that--a way for outsiders to \nreport wrongdoing to NCMEC and the government, not for the government \nto generate a report to itself without following otherwise required \nlawful process. It was not the intent of any part of this bill to alter \nthat purpose.\n\n  Second, regarding the affirmative defense, I would have liked to \nensure that there is an affirmative defense for each new category of \nchild pornography and for all cases where a defendant can prove in \ncourt that a specific, non-obscene image was made not using any child \nbut only actual, identifiable adults. That will no doubt be a basis for \nattacking the constitutionality of this law. I specifically made this \nsuggestion in conference negotiations but my Republican colleagues from \nboth the House and the Senate refused to adopt a ``complete'' \naffirmative defense, instead leaving holes that will surely be raised \nin constitutional attacks on the bill.\n  As a general matter, it is worth repeating that we could have avoided \nall these problems were we to take the simple approach of outlawing \n``obscene'' child pornography of all types, which we do in one new \nprovision that I suggested and which is the new Section 1466A \nestablished in the conference report. That approach would produce a law \nbeyond any possible challenge. This approach is also supported by \nNCMEC, which we all respect as the true expert in this field.\n  Following is an excerpt from NCMEC's answer to written questions \nsubmitted after our hearing, which I will place in the Record in its \nentirety:\n\n       Our view is that the vast majority (99-100%) of all child \n     pornography would be found to be obscene by most judges and \n     juries, even under a standard of beyond a reasonable doubt in \n     criminal cases. Even within the reasonable person under \n     community standards model, it is highly unlikely that any \n     community would not find child pornography obscene. . . .\n       In the post Free Speech decision legal climate, the \n     prosecution of child pornography under an obscenity approach \n     is a reasonable strategy and sound policy.\n\n  Thus, according to NCMEC, the approach that is least likely to raise \nconstitutional questions--using established obscenity law--is also an \neffective one. In short, the obscenity approach is the most narrowly \ntailored to prevent child pornography. New section 1466A adopts this \nobscenity approach, but because that is not the approach that other \nparts of the PROTECT Act uses, I recognize that it contains provisions \nabout which some may have legitimate constitutional questions.\n  Specifically, in addition to the provisions that I have already \ndiscussed, there were two amendments adopted in the Judiciary Committee \nin the last Congress and one in this Congress to which I objected that \nare included in the bill as we consider it today. I felt and still feel \nthat these alterations from the original language that Senator Hatch \nand I introduced needlessly risk a serious constitutional challenge to \na bill that provided prosecutors the tools they needed to do their \njobs. The bill would be even stronger than it is now were they changed. \nLet me discuss my opposition to these changes adopted by the Judiciary \nCommittee in this Congress and the last.\n  Although I worked with Senator Hatch to write the new pandering \nprovision in the PROTECT Act, I did not support two of Senator Hatch's \namendments extending the provision to cover (1) ``purported'' material, \nand (2) material not linked to obscenity. Although our bill, unlike the \nHouse bill which had a pandering provision with no link to obscenity at \nall, had at least one provision which covered predominantly unprotected \nspeech, it was needlessly altered in the legislative process and made \nvulnerable to attack.\n  First, during our markup in the last Congress I objected to an \namendment from Senator Hatch to include ``purported'' material in the \npandering provision. ``Purported'' material criminalizes speech even \nwhen there is no underlying material at all--whether obscene or non-\nobscene, virtual or real, child or adult. The pandering provision is an \nimportant tool for prosecutors to punish true child pornographers who \nfor some technical reason are beyond the reach of the normal child porn \ndistribution or production statutes. It is not meant to federally \ncriminalize talking dirty over the internet or the telephone when the \nperson never possesses any material at all. That is speech, and \ncriminalizing it goes too far.\n  The original pandering provision in S. 2520 as introduced last \nCongress was quite broad, and some argued that it presented \nconstitutional problems as written, but I thought that prosecutors \nneeded a strong tool, so I supported Senator Hatch on that provision.\n  I was heartened that Professor Schauer of Harvard, a noted first \namendment expert, testified at our hearing last year that he thought \nthat the original provision was constitutional, barely. Unfortunately, \nProfessor Schauer has since written to me stating that this new \namendment to include ``purported'' material ``would push well over the \nconstitutional edge a provision that is now up against the edge, but \nprobably barely on the constitutional side of it.'' I placed his letter \nin the Record upon introduction of the bill in this Congress on January \n13, 2003.\n  The second amendment to the pandering provision to which I objected \nexpanded it to cover cases not linked in any way to obscenity. It would \nallow prosecution of anyone who ``presented'' a movie that was intended \nto cause another person to believe that it included a minor engaging in \nsexually explicit conduct, whether or not it was obscene and whether or \nnot any real child was involved. Any person or movie theater that \npresented films like Traffic, Romeo and Juliet, and American Beauty \nwould be guilty of a felony. The very point of these dramatic works is \nto cause a person to believe that something is true when in fact it is \nnot. These were precisely the overbreadth concerns that led 7 justices \nof the Supreme Court to strike down parts of the 1996 Act. We do not \nwant to put child porn convictions on hold while we wait another 6 \nyears to see if the law will survive constitutional scrutiny.\n  Because these two changes endanger the entire pandering provision, \nbecause they are unwise, and because that section is already strong \nenough to prosecute those who peddle child pornography, I opposed those \nexpansions of the provision which are in the bill we consider today. At \nleast with those provisions, however, we debated and carefully \nconsidered alternatives. As I have said, with respect to other \nprovisions in the bill the process has been fundamentally flawed.\n  Although I joined Senator Hatch in introducing this bill, even when \nit was introduced last year I expressed concern over certain \nprovisions. One such provision was a new definition of ``identifiable \nminor.'' When the bill was introduced, I noted that this provision \nmight both confuse the statute unnecessarily and endanger the already \nupheld ``morphing'' section of the CPPA. I said I was concerned that it \ncould present both overbreadth and vagueness problems in a later \nconstitutional challenge. Unfortunately, this provision remains \nproblematic and susceptible to constitutional challenge. I was even \nmore concerned with the House bill, which included 100 percent virtual \nchild pornography from the start.\n  Unfortunately, as we consider the bill today, we have the House \nprovision designed to cover ``virtual'' child pornography--that is, 100 \npercent computer generated pictures not involving any real children.\n  The ``identifiable minor'' provision in the current law may be used \nwithout\n\n[[Page S5143]]\n\nany link to obscenity doctrine. Therefore, what potentially saved the \noriginal version we introduced in the 107th Congress was that it \napplied to child porn made with real persons. The provision was \ndesigned to cover all sorts of images of real kids that are morphed or \naltered, but not something entirely made by computer, with no child \ninvolved.\n  The provision we now consider, however, dislodges, in my view, that \nsole constitutional anchor. The new provision could be read to include \nimages that never involved real children at all but were 100 percent \ncomputer generated. That was not the original goal of the Senate \nprovision.\n  There are other provisions in this bill that deal with obscene \nvirtual child pornography that I support, such as those in new section \n1466A, which are linked to obscenity doctrine. This provision, however, \nwas intended to ease the prosecutor's burden in cases where images of \nreal children were cleverly altered to avoid prosecution. By changing \nthe Senate's identifiable minor provision into the House's virtual porn \nprovision, the conference needlessly endangered its constitutionality.\n  For these reasons, I was glad to work in a bipartisan manner to shore \nup this provision in conference. Unfortunately, despite our best \nefforts, I fear we did not do everything possible to strengthen it \nagainst constitutional attack. Let me explain.\n  The new ``virtual'' porn provision in section 502 lumps together such \ntruly ``hard core'' sexual activities such as intercourse, bestiality, \nand S with simple lascivious exhibition of the genitals and simulated \nintercourse where any part of a breast is shown. Equating such \ndisparate types of conduct, however, does not mesh with community \nstandards and is precisely the type of ``one size fits all'' approach \nthat the Supreme Court rejected in the area of virtual pornography in \nthe Free Speech case. The contrast between this broad definition and \nthe tighter definition in new Section 1466A, crafted by Senator Hatch \nand myself, is striking. Although I was glad that we included the same \ndefinition of ``graphic'' conduct found in new section 502 as in \nSection 1466A, we have also left intact the less focused language that \nimperils the bill. The provision may be open to overbreadth attacks.\n\n  I am pleased that the conference addressed the vagueness concern in \nthe new statute 2256(2) as it applies in virtual cases. By removing the \nrequirement of ``actual'' conduct, we corrected the vagueness issue and \nhave prevented clever defendants from seeking to argue that this new \nprovision still requires proof ``actual'' sexual acts involving real \nchildren.\n  The Supreme Court made it clear that we can only outlaw child \npornography in two situations: No. 1, where it is obscene, or No. 2, \nwhere it involves real kids. That is the law as stated by the Supreme \nCourt, whether or not we agree with it.\n  Senator Hatch and I agree that legislation in this area is important. \nBut regardless of our personal views, any law must be within \nconstitutional limits or it does no good at all. Section 502, which \nwould include most ``virtual'' child pornography in the definition of \nchild pornography, in my view, crosses the constitutional line and \nneedlessly risks protracted litigation that could assist child \npornographers in escaping punishment.\n  I supported passage of the original PROTECT Act as Senator Hatch and \nI introduced it and as it passed the Senate unanimously in the last \nCongress. Even so, I was willing to work with him to further amend the \nbill in the Judiciary Committee. Some amendments that we considered in \ncommittee I supported because they improved the bill. Others went too \nfar. I had hoped the House would simply adopt the unanimously passed \nSenate bill and we would have already had a law on the books. \nUnfortunately, the House chose to proceed otherwise. Nevertheless I \ncontinued to work side by side with Republicans in conference to work \nthrough a variety of controversial and largely unrelated provisions. I \nwish I could say that my efforts have been reciprocated. One wonders \nwhether everyone is placing the interests of our children first.\n  A media report on this legislation at the end of the last Congress \nreported the wide consensus that the Hatch-Leahy bill was more likely \nthan the House bill to withstand scrutiny, but quoted a Republican \nHouse member as stating: ``Even if it comes back to Congress three \ntimes we will have created better legislation.''\n  To me, that makes no sense. Why not create the ``better legislation'' \nright now for today's children, instead of inviting more years of \nlitigation and putting at risk any convictions obtained in the interim \nperiod before the Supreme Court again reviews the constitutionality of \nCongress' effort to address this serious problem? That is what the \nSenate passed version of the PROTECT Act sought to accomplish.\n  As I have explained, I believe that this issue is so important that I \nhave been willing to compromise and to support a measure even though I \ndo not agree with each and every provision that it contains. That is \nhow legislation is normally passed. I am disappointed that the \nAdministration and the House decided to play politics with this issue \nand add controversial positions that could bog the bill down.\n  There are a few additional measures in the conference report that I \nwant to mention. First, Section 604 of the conference report, which was \nproposed by Senator Grassley, amends Section 170101(e) of the Violent \nCrime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. That section would amend \nseveral provisions of the sexual registry established under that law. \nFirst, it would add additional crimes to those that are included in the \nregistry. Second, it would require that such registries be made \navailable over the Internet. Finally, and quite significantly, this \nprovision would not only require a ``process'' be established for \ncontesting the accuracy of any information on the registry, but would \nalso require that the instructions for following that process be \nreadily available on the Internet. For the first time, then, we are \nexplicitly requiring that there is a mechanism for those who believe \nthat information has been erroneously posted on the registry to \nchallenge that information and seek to have it removed.\n  Second, I want to thank the conferees for supporting measures \nincluded in the Protecting Our Children First Act, S. 773, a bipartisan \nbill that I introduced in both this Congress and the last, joined by \nSenators Hatch, Kennedy, DeWine, Biden, Shelby, Lincoln, and Reid, to \nreauthorize the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. As \nthe nation's top resource center for child protection, NCMEC spearheads \nnational efforts to locate and recover missing children and raises \npublic awareness about ways to prevent child abduction, molestation, \nand sexual exploitation. NCMEC works to make our children safer by \nbeing a national voice and advocate for those too young to vote or \nspeak up for their own rights.\n  We had proposed reauthorization through 2007 but have at least \nachieved agreement to extend its activities through 2005. We were able \nto double the grants from $10 million to $20 million a year so that the \nNational Center can help more children and families. We also authorize \nthe U.S. Secret Service to provide forensic and investigative \nassistance to the National Center, and we strengthen NCMEC's Cyber \nTipline to provide online users an effective means of reporting \nInternet-related child sexual exploitation in distribution of child \npornography, online enticement of children for sexual acts, and child \nprostitution.\n  Third, I am pleased that conferees agreed to include in the \nconference report Leahy-Kennedy-Biden legislation that will establish a \ntransitional housing grant program within the Department of Justice to \nprovide to victims of domestic violence, stalking, or sexual assault \nthe necessary means to escape the cycle of violence.\n  Today, more than 50 percent of homeless individuals are women and \nchildren fleeing domestic violence. They are homeless because, in their \ndesperate attempt to leave their abusers, they find themselves with \nfew, if any, funds to support themselves. Shelters offer a short-term \nsolution, but are often overcrowded and unable to provide all of the \nsupport that is needed. Transitional housing allows women to bridge the \ngap between escaping from a domestic violence situation and becoming \nfully self-sufficient. Such assistance is limited, however, because no \nfederal funds exist for transitional housing programs geared \nspecifically\n\n[[Page S5144]]\n\nto victims of domestic violence. We last authorized such a transitional \nhousing grant program as part of the reauthorization of the Violence \nAgainst Women Act in 2000. This program would have been administered \nthrough the Department of Health and Human Services and would have \nprovided $25 million in fiscal year 2001. Unfortunately, funds were \nnever appropriated for the program, and the authorization expired.\n  If we truly seek an end to domestic violence, then transitional \nhousing must be available to all those fleeing their abusers. First of \nall, such housing provides women and children a stable, sustainable \nhome base. Second, it gives these victims opportunity to participate in \neducational programs, to work full-time jobs, to learn new job skills, \nand to search for adequate child care in order to gain self-\nsufficiency. Without such resources, many women and children eventually \nreturn to situations where they are abused or even killed.\n  This conference report amends the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 \nto authorize $30 million for each of fiscal years 2004-2008 for the \nAttorney General to award grants to organizations, States, units of \nlocal government, and Indian tribes to help victims of domestic \nviolence, stalking, or sexual assault who need transitional housing or \nrelated assistance as a result of fleeing their abusers, and for whom \nemergency shelter services or other crisis intervention services are \nunavailable or insufficient. Funds may be used for programs that \nprovide short-term housing assistance, including rental or utilities \npayments assistance and assistance with related expenses. The funds may \nalso support services designed to help individuals locate and secure \npermanent housing. Lastly, these resources may be used to help \nintegrate domestic violence victims into the community by providing \nservices, such as transportation, counseling, child care services, case \nmanagement, employment counseling, and other assistance.\n  This new grant program will make a significant impact in many areas \nof the country, such as my State of Vermont, where the availability of \naffordable housing is at an all-time low. There are many dedicated \npeople working to provide victims of domestic violence with resources, \nbut they can not work alone. We must provide women and children who \nhave endured domestic violence with a safe place to gain the skills and \nstability needed to make the transition to independence. I thank the \nconferees for adding this language to the conference report and \nrecognizing that this is an important component of reducing and \npreventing crimes that take place in domestic situations. Together, we \ncan help the victims of these crimes to move on with their lives.\n  Fourth, I am pleased that the conference report includes a provision \nthat I introduced in the last Congress to clarify that an airplane is a \nvehicle for purposes of terrorist and other violent acts against mass \ntransportation systems. A significant question about this point was \nraised in an important criminal case and deserves our prompt attention.\n  On June 11, 2002, a U.S. District Judge in Boston dismissed one of \nthe nine charges against Richard Reid stemming from his alleged attempt \nto detonate an explosive device in his shoe while onboard an \ninternational flight from Paris to Miami on December 22, 2001. The \ndismissed count charged defendant Reid with violating section 1993 of \ntitle 18, United States Code, by attempting to ``wreck, set fire to, \nand disable a mass transportation vehicle.''\n  Section 1993 is a new criminal law that was added, as section 801, to \nthe USA PATRIOT Act to punish terrorist attacks and other acts of \nviolence against, inter alia, a ``mass transportation'' vehicle or \nferry, or against a passenger or employee of a mass transportation \nprovider. I had urged that this provision be included in the final \nanti-terrorism law considered by the Congress. A similar provision was \noriginally part of S. 2783, the ``21st Century Law Enforcement and \nPublic Safety Act,'' that I introduced in the 106th Congress at the \nrequest of the Clinton Administration.\n  The district court rejected defendant Reid's arguments to dismiss the \nsection 1993 charge on grounds that one, the penalty provision does not \napply to an ``attempt'' and two, an airplane is not engaged in ``mass \ntransportation.'' ``Mass transportation'' is defined in section 1993 by \nreference to the ``the meaning given to that term in section 5302(a)(7) \nof title 49, U.S.C., except that the term shall include schoolbus, \ncharter and sightseeing transportation.'' Section 5302(a)(7), in turn, \nprovides the following definition: ``mass transportation'' means \ntransportation by a conveyance that provides regular and continuing \ngeneral or special transportation to the public, but does not include \nschool bus, charter or sightseeing transportation.'' The court \nexplained that ``commercial aircraft transport large numbers of people \nevery day'' and that the definition of ``mass transportation'' ``when \nread in an ordinary or natural way, encompasses aircraft of the kind at \nissue here.'' U.S. v. Reid, CR No. 02-10013, at p. 10, 12 (D. MA, June \n11, 2002).\n  Defendant Reid also argued that the section 1993 charge should be \ndismissed because an airplane is not a ``vehicle.'' The court agreed, \nciting the fact that the term ``vehicle'' is not defined in section \n1993 and that the Dictionary Act, 1 U.S.C. Sec. 4, narrowly defines \n``vehicle'' to include ``every description of carriage or other \nartificial contrivance used, or capable of being used, as a means of \ntransportation on land.'' Emphasis in original opinion. Notwithstanding \ncommon parlance and other court decisions that have interpreted this \nDictionary Act definition to encompass aircraft, the district court \nrelied on the narrow definition to conclude that an aircraft is not a \n``vehicle'' within the meaning of section 1993.\n  The new section 1993 was intended to provide broad Federal criminal \njurisdiction over terrorist and violent acts against all mass \ntransportation systems, including bus services, airplanes, railroads \nand other forms of transportation available for public carriage. The \nmore inclusive definition would also cover cruise ships. Unfortunately \nterrorist attacks against Americans is not a new threat. In 1985, four \nterrorists brutally attacked the Achille Lauro Cruise Ship. The \nwheelchair-bound Leon Klinghoffer, a stroke victim, was shot once in \nthe head and once in the back by the terrorists who then pushed him \nover the side of the ship into the Mediterranean.\n  Section 609 of the conference report adds a definition of ``vehicle'' \nto 18 USC 1993 and clarifies the breadth of the meaning of this term \nboth in common parlance and under this new criminal law to protect mass \ntransportation systems. Specifically, it defines this term to mean \n``any carriage or other contrivance used, or capable of being used, as \na means of transportation on land, water or through the air.''\n  Having reviewed all the positive elements of the conference report, I \nwant to speak to the conference process itself. I am deeply \ndisappointed by the process that characterized Tuesday's AMBER Alert \nand PROTECT Act conference. By taking bipartisan, noncontroversial \nbills and adding numerous controversial, unrelated measures, the \nRepublicans have decided yet again to play games with important \nmeasures to protect our children. They are rolling the dice with the \nsafety of America's children. I do not say this lightly, and I say it \nwith a heavy heart, but House and Senate Republicans are now holding \nthe passage of AMBER and the PROTECT Act hostage to these very \ntroubling additions.\n  With respect to new matters never considered by this body, the \nconference committee in this matter tried no less a feat than to \nrewrite the criminal code on the back of an envelope. That type of \neffort is unwise and doomed to failure.\n  There are many things in this bill that I support--indeed as a former \nprosecutor I brought my personal experiences to bear and I wrote much \nof it. That is why even after the House Republicans loaded the bill \nwith numerous controversial, unrelated provisions, I worked in good \nfaith to come to agreement on many provisions. In fact, staff members \nof the conferees met all through the weekend and late into the early \nhours of Tuesday morning to find common ground. It is unfortunate that \nour good faith was repaid with attempts to add even more extraneous \ncontroversial provisions at the conference meeting.\n  Tuesday's conference, which was convened in the spirit of bipartisan \ncooperation, turned political, however,\n\n[[Page S5145]]\n\nwhen Republicans sprung a lengthy and complex amendment on the \nDemocrats. This 9-page document was not a simple substitute for a \nportion of the bill. It was a highly complex amendment requiring \ncareful consideration. The sponsors denied a request to break briefly \nin order to give conferees a moment to analyze the document. After \nmeeting for three days in good faith, the Democratic conferees were \neffectively slapped in the face with a totally new proposal. Then, to \nadd insult to injury, the sponsors of the amendment misrepresented its \ncontents in the conference meeting and quickly forced a vote before the \nconferees had a chance to review or debate the amendment.\n\n  I was sorely disappointed by the way that this amendment was \nexplained to the conferees. One sponsor said not once or twice, but \nthree separate times: ``It's important to note that the compromise is \nlimited to these serious crimes against children and sex crimes and \ndoes not broadly apply to other crimes.'' In fact, the amendment was \nnot limited as he described, and did apply broadly to downward \ndepartures in sentencing for all Federal crimes.\n  After the conferees were forced to vote on the Hatch-Sensenbrenner \namendment, Senator Hatch's office, at 2:00 a.m., substantially changed \nthe text of his own amendment--the amendment that had already been \nvoted upon in open conference. With no new meeting and no new vote of \nthe conferees, the Republicans changed the conference report as it was \nvoted on, and filed it in the House. The 2:00 a.m. text came closer to \nreflecting the original description of the amendment, but was still not \nlimited, as was promised, to crimes against children.\n  The substance of the Hatch-Sensenbrenner amendment--whether in the \nform that was voted on in conference, or in the form that was \ncirculated after the conference adjourned--is just as outrageous as the \nway in which it was adopted. This amendment modifies in very limited \nways the Feeney amendment, which was added to the bill on the House \nfloor after only 20 minutes of debate. This far-reaching proposal will \nundermine the Federal sentencing system and prevent judges from \nimposing just and responsible sentences. In short, it amounts to an \nattack on the Federal judiciary.\n  Speaking about the original Feeney amendment, Chief Justice Rehnquist \nwrote: ``this legislation, if enacted, would do serious harm to the \nbasic structure of the sentencing guideline system and would seriously \nimpair the ability of courts to impose just and responsible \nsentences.'' In another bald mischaracterization of the Hatch-\nSensenbrenner amendment, Senator Hatch claimed in the conference \nmeeting that he had addressed the Chief Justice's concerns. He said, \n``Chief Justice Rehnquist is worried about the breadth and scope of the \nFeeney Amendment. He's not worried about this [language]. I don't think \nany federal judge would worry about this language. They know this \nlanguage is to protect our children in our society, and we're limiting \nit to that.'' In fact, the Hatch-Sensenbrenner amendment does not \naddress the problems raised in Chief Justice Rehnquist's letter, which \nwere directed at the assault on the sentencing structure that is \nretained in the amendment.\n  In addition to the Chief Justice of the United States, this is an \nissue on which we have heard from the Judicial Conference, other \ndistinguished judges, the Sentencing Commission, the former chairmen of \nthe Sentencing Commission, the American Bar Association, the Washington \nLegal Foundation, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, the Cato \nInstitute, the National Petroleum Refiners Association and a number of \nother business associations, all of which opposed the House language.\n  Just this week, Justice Kennedy voiced grave concerns over the \nexcessive application of mandatory minimum sentences. He said, ``When \nthe guilt determination phase and the sentencing is over,'' Kennedy \nsaid, ``the legal system loses all interest in the prisoner. And this \nmust change. Winston Churchill said a society is measured by how it \ntreats the least deserving of its people. And two million people in \nprison in this country is just unacceptable.''\n  A number of the groups opposed to the original proposal have \nexpressed continued opposition. Others have not had time to write about \nthe new version because this proposal is being rushed through the \nlegislative process.\n  The language that was adopted in the conference report establishes \nnew and separate departure procedures for child-related and sex \noffenses. So, we will have one set of sentencing rules for \npornographers and a more flexible set of sentencing rules for other \nFederal defendants, including terrorists, murderers, mobsters, civil \nrights violators, and white collar criminals. No one here believes that \nsex offenders deserve anything less than harsh sentences, but I cannot \nunderstand why we would treat the terrorists better.\n  The conference report also overturns a unanimous Supreme Court \ndecision, Koon v. United States, by establishing a new standard of \nappellate review in all departure cases. This provision, like so many \nothers, is not limited to cases involving children. The Court in Koon \ninterpreted the departure standard in a way that limited departures but \nleft some room for judicial discretion. By contrast, the new provision \nwould appear to require appellate courts to consider the merits of a \ndeparture before it can decide what standard of review to apply to the \nmerits. That is because, in order to determine which standard of review \napplies--``due deference'' or ``de novo''--the appellate court must \nfirst decide whether the departure advances the objectives of 18 USC \n3553(a)(2) (incapacitation, deterrence, etc.) or is authorized under 18 \nUSC 3553(b) (a mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not \nadequately considered by the Sentencing Commission) or is justified by \nthe facts of the case. This sloppily drafted, circular provision is \nlikely to tie up the courts in endless litigation, draining already \nscarce judicial resources, and costing the taxpayers money.\n  The Republican supporters of this amendment seem to believe that our \nFederal judges cannot be trusted. I have always advocated doing a \nthorough review of our Federal judge nominees when they come before the \nSenate for lifetime appointments. Perhaps that is the difference \nbetween my view of Federal judges and those of my colleagues across the \naisle who seem to believe they should rubber stamp the President's \nnominees to these lifetime positions. I believe we should pick our \nFederal judges carefully and them trust them once appointed, not \nrubber-stamp them and then feign disbelief when we are unhappy with \ntheir decisions.\n  The amendment effectively creates a judicial ``black list'' of judges \nthat stray from the draconian mandates of this bill. The Hatch-\nSensenbrenner language retains the Feeney amendment's attempt to \nintimidate Federal judges by compiling a ``hit list'' of all judges who \nimpose sentences that the Justice Department does not like in any type \nof criminal case. It takes a sledge hammer to the concept of separation \nof powers.\n  In a further demonstration of hostility to our Federal judiciary as \nenvisioned by our constitution, the Hatch-Sensenbrenner amendment \nremoves almost all discretion for Federal judges to depart from the \nsentencing guidelines in some extraordinary cases.\n  At the conference's one meeting, during the brief period afforded for \ndebate on the Hatch-Sensenbrenner amendment, I pointed out that the \namendment retained language from the original Feeney amendment that \neliminated the ability of Federal judges to depart and give lower \nsentences based upon extraordinary military service.\n  The sponsors of the amendment dismissed my concern. They said that I \nwas wrong--that their amendment did not eliminate the departure for \nextraordinary military service. They were both quite certain on this \npoint, even after I raised it a second time. One sponsor said, ``I \ndon't know where you're getting your language from.'' Another assured \nus that ``this nine-page amendment has been very well drafted . . . It \ndoes exactly what we have said.''\n  After the conference had adjourned and they took the time to \nfamiliarize themselves with their own amendment, they discovered that I \nwas correct. They were, in fact, eliminating the departure for \nextraordinary military service in all Federal criminal cases--for \ncongressional medal of honor winners, for example, and veterans who\n\n[[Page S5146]]\n\nhad been seriously wounded while defending their nation in battle. What \nis worse, they were doing this during a time of war, when future \nveterans are literally risking their lives for America. Realizing that \nthis might not go down well on the floor of the United States Senate, \nthey quietly dropped the provision from the final conference report.\n  I have discussed this issue at some length not to embarrass any \nmember or his staff, but to make the point that Congress should spend \nmore than a few minutes considering legislation with such far-reaching \nconsequences. The conference report blithely overturns the basic \nstructure of the carefully crafted guidelines system without any \nserious process in either the House or the Senate, and without any \nmeaningful input from judges and practitioners.\n  With respect to the few parts of the Hatch-Sensenbrenner amendment \nthat are limited to crimes against children, it may not be the end of \nthe guidelines system, but it is very likely the beginning of the end. \nOnce we prohibit judges from exercising discretion in one set of cases, \nwe will have established a prototype for future attacks on the \nguidelines system--a form of ``mission creep'' in this uncompromising, \nanti-judge agenda. The same ``tough on crime'' political posturing that \nfuels the relentless drive for more mandatory minimums and death \npenalties will lead to future expansions of the Hatch-Sensenbrenner \namendment to crimes having nothing to do with minors.\n  My Republican colleagues on the conference claim that there is a \ncrisis on the Federal bench of downward departures in sentencing. In \nfact, downward departure rates are well below the range contemplated by \nCongress when it authorized the Sentencing Guidelines, except for \ndepartures requested by the government.\n\n  The overwhelming majority of downward departures are requested by \nFederal prosecutors to reward cooperation by defendants or to manage \nthe high volume of immigration cases in certain border districts. When \nthe government does not like a specific downward departure, it can \nappeal that decision, and it often wins--approximately 80 percent of \nsuch appeals are successful. This amendment is a solution in search of \na problem.\n  Rather than rush to change the law with no factual basis for doing \nso, the Democrats in this conference asked for hearings on the topic. \nIn fact, Senator Graham, the new chairman of the newly constituted \nCrime, Corrections and Victims' Rights Subcommittee indicated that he \nplanned to hold hearings on this topic very soon--that is, until the \nFeeney amendment and the subsequent Hatch-Sesenbrenner amendment \novertook events. The Republican conferees now claim that no study is \nnecessary. They believe that no hearings are necessary. They would \nrather significantly increase incarceration rates at taxpayer expense \nthan take the time to determine whether such severe changes are \nnecessary or appropriate.\n  The Hatch-Sensenbrenner amendment not only maintains the worst \naspects of the controversial Feeney Amendment--provisions that have \nnothing to do with child protection--but also adds in new provisions \nthat were not in the original Feeney amendment. For example, it limits \nthe number of Federal judges who can serve on the Sentencing Commission \nbecause, as Chairman Sensenbrenner explained, ``we don't want to have \nthe Commission packed with Federal judges that have a genetic \npredisposition to hate any kind of sentencing guidelines.'' I, for one, \nbelieve that judges are extremely valuable members of the Commission. \nThey bring years of highly relevant experience, not to mention reasoned \njudgment, to the table. The Republicans apparently believe that their \nknowledge is of limited value.\n  I find it ironic that the Republicans, in forcing through this \nmeasure, will undercut one of the signature achievements of Ronald \nReagan's Presidency--a firm, tough, fair system of sentencing in the \nFederal criminal justice system. The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 \nstruck a balance between uniformity and judicial discretion and was \nenacted after years of study and consideration of the problems in the \nprevious sentencing system. Congress understood that a guidelines \nsystem that encompasses every relevant sentencing factor is neither \npossible nor desirable. Departures, both upward and downward, are an \nintegral and healthy part of the guideline system. They do not reflect \nan avoidance of the law by Federal judges but rather their \nconscientious compliance with the congressional mandate to impose a \nguideline sentence unless the court finds a circumstance not adequately \nconsidered by the Commission that warrants a departure.\n  Moving beyond the sentencing amendments offered at the conference, \nthere are several provisions of the conference report that are equally \nproblematic.\n  Section 106 of the conference report, entitled ``two strikes and \nyou're out,'' is one of the many controversial provisions in the House-\npassed bill that have never been considered in the Senate. It mandates \nlife imprisonment without parole for defendants who have twice been \nconvicted of certain crimes against children.\n  Another section of the conference report creates several new \nmandatory minimum sentences, and raises some existing ones, for crimes \ninvolving child pornography and prostitution.\n  We can all agree that those who commit crimes against children should \nbe severely punished. In fact, the bill that Senator Hatch and I \nauthored--the real PROTECT Act, which is buried in title V of the \nconference report--contains a number of very strong sentencing \nprovisions. But I believe we can accomplish our common goal of ensuring \nthat those who prey on children receive tough punishment without \nfurther expanding the mandatory sentencing scheme that is gradually \nreplacing the guidelines system.\n  The arguments against mandatory minimums are well known. The Chief \nJustice of the United States has observed that mandatory minimum \nsentences ``frustrate the careful calibration of sentences, from one \nend of the spectrum to the other, which the Sentencing Guidelines were \nintended to accomplish.'' Another conservative member of the Court, \nJustice Kennedy, testified before a House subcommittee in 1994 that \nmandatory minimums were ``imprudent, unwise, and often an unjust \nmechanism for sentencing.'' As I mentioned previously, Justice Kennedy \nreiterated that thought just this week, before another House committee. \nJustice Breyer, who served on the original Sentencing Commission, has \nwritten that mandatory minimums prevent the Commission from developing \na rational, coherent, and fair set of punishments. Most judges in the \nFederal system, Republicans and Democrats alike, agree with these \ncriticisms.\n  Senator Hatch has also expressed reservations about statutory \nmandatory sentences. In a 1993 law review article, Senator Hatch \nobserved that mandatory minimums are fundamentally inconsistent with \nthe guidelines system. He wrote:\n\n       Whereas the guidelines permit a degree of individualization \n     in determining the appropriate sentence, mandatory minimums \n     employ a relatively narrow approach under which the same \n     sentence may be mandated for widely divergent cases. Whereas \n     the guidelines provide for graduated increases in sentence \n     severity for additional wrongdoing or for prior convictions, \n     mandatory minimums often result in sharp variations in \n     sentences based on what are often only minimal differences in \n     criminal conduct or prior record. Finally, whereas the \n     guidelines incorporate a ``real offense'' approach to \n     sentencing, mandatory minimums are basically a ``charge-\n     specific'' approach wherein the sentence is triggered only if \n     the prosecutor chooses to charge the defendant with a certain \n     offense or to allege certain facts.\n\n  Senator Hatch concluded that Congress should make greater use of the \nvarious alternative sentencing methods proposed by the Commission, \nincluding increased statutory maximums.\n  I am disappointed that Congress is poised, once again, to demonstrate \nthat we are ``tough on crime'' by enacting new mandatory minimum \nsentences. That being said, I am pleased that the conference accepted \nmy proposals to modify the two strikes provision to eliminate its \nharshest and most disproportionate applications. Among other things, \nthe conference clarified that the ``two strikes'' law would not apply \nto a defendant whose only prior sex conviction was a misdemeanor under \nstate law. The conference also provided a limited affirmative defense \nfor defendants convicted under certain Federal statutes that have less \nculpable applications. Congress provided a\n\n[[Page S5147]]\n\nsimilar defense in the three strikes law, and it is appropriate that we \nincluded one here as well.\n  We should also have included in the two strikes provision a carve-out \nfor Indian country. Unfortunately, the conference refused in a party \nline vote to allow Indian nations to decide for themselves whether or \nnot to be part of the new two strikes regime.\n  There is no question that the two strikes law will disproportionately \naffect Indian country. Sentencing Commission data indicates that \napproximately 75 percent of cases to which the two strikes provision \nwill be applied will involve Native Americans on reservations. Thus, \nthe two strikes provision will have the effect of singling out Native \nAmericans for harsher treatment.\n  Congress has confronted this problem before, when passing various \ncriminal laws with particularly harsh sentences. In those situations, \nwe have allowed the tribes to decide whether they want to be covered. \nThe amendment that I offered, and that the Republican conferees \nrejected, was identical to provisions for Indian Country in current \ncriminal statutes such as the ``three strikes'' law, the juvenile \ndelinquency statute, and the Federal death penalty statute. These \nprovisions preserve the sovereignty of the Indian tribes by providing \ntheir governing bodies with authority to control the laws affecting \ntheir land and people. For Congress to treat the ``two strikes'' \nprovision differently is simply wrong.\n  Another provision of the conference report dealing with statutes of \nlimitations raises concerns about the message we are sending to law \nenforcement. Section 202 extends the statute of limitations for certain \ncrimes against children. This provision is substantially narrower than \nthe version passed by the House, which covered a laundry list of crimes \nhaving nothing at all to do with children.\n  The purpose of section 202 is to address the problem--highlighted in \nseveral recent cases--of child victims who fail to notify authorities \nthat they have been victimized until years and even decades after the \nevent. Current law deals with this problem by allowing prosecution of \ncertain offenses involving the abuse of a child until the child turns \n25. Section 202 goes further, extending the limitations period for the \nentire life of the child.\n  During the conference, I expressed concern that section 202's \nlifetime extension of the limitations period would reduce law \nenforcement's incentive to move quickly and aggressively to solve these \nvery serious crimes. I therefore proposed a modification along the \nlines that Congress adopted last year in the context of corporate \nfraud. More specifically, I proposed that a 3 or 5 year limitations \nperiod should exist, and start to run, once the facts constituting the \noffense were known, or reasonably should have been known, by Federal \nlaw enforcement authorities. This modification would have benefitted \nvictims by requiring authorities to focus on their case, and to take \nimmediate steps to bring the perpetrator to justice, as soon as the \ncrime was brought to their attention. Senate Republicans fought for \nsimilar language in the Sarbanes-Oxley bill. Their opposition to it \noutside the context of corporate crime suggests a troubling double \nstandard.\n  A final point on section 202: I am pleased that the conference agreed \nto drop language from the original House-passed bill that would have \nextended the limitations period retroactively. That language, which \nwould have revived the government's authority to prosecute crimes that \nwere previously time-barred, is of doubtful constitutionality. We are \nalready pushing the constitutional envelope with respect to several of \nthe ``virtual porn'' provisions in this bill. I am pleased that we are \nnot doing so in section 202 as well.\n  The next section of the conference report is another example of \nhastily drafted language that has not been vetted thoroughly by either \nhouse of Congress. Section 203 adds certain crimes against children to \nthe list of offenses that carry a rebuttable presumption against pre-\ntrial release. Like the other provisions in titles I and II, this \nsection has never been considered by the Senate, and received only the \nmost cursory consideration by the House.\n  I have two problems with this provision. First, as with sentencing \ndeterminations, I believe that judges, not Congress, should determine \nwho gets bail. Clearly, judges are in the better position to determine \nwhether, for public safety reasons, an accused offender should be \ndetained.\n  Second, I am concerned that the complete absence of legislative \nfindings supporting the new presumption could imperil its \nconstitutionality under the Excessive Bail Clause. At a minimum, it \ncould give defendants a good argument that the presumption should be \novercome more easily than the authors of this provision perhaps \nintended. That is what happens when we do not take the time to do \nthings the right way.\n  For the same reason, I am troubled by section 521 of the conference \nreport, which makes it a crime to use a ``misleading'' domain name with \nthe intent to deceive a person into viewing obscenity on the Internet, \nor with the intent to deceive a minor into viewing ``material that is \nharmful to minors'' on the Internet. This provision is similar to \nsection 108 of the House-passed bill, which was added as a floor \namendment with no prior consideration in either body.\n  I have serious doubts about whether section 521 will survive \nconstitutional challenge. For one thing, its failure to define the term \n``misleading'' may unduly chill constitutionally-protected speech. For \nexample, it is unclear whether a website like ``northernlights.com'' \nwould be considered ``misleading'' if it contains images of naked \npersons that are deemed harmful to minors.\n  Section 521 does create a ``safe harbor'' for those who include the \nword ``porn'' or ``sex'' in their Internet domain name. This form of \nmandatory labeling of the site of a mainstream business, which includes \nmaterial constitutionally protected as to adults, but which may be \ndeemed inappropriate for some level of minors, also raises \nconstitutional concerns. In addition, labeling domain names in this \nmanner could turn sites into attractive nuisances, drawing more \nchildrens' eyes to the site and thus having the opposite of its \nintended effect.\n  My uncertainty about the constitutionality of this provision is, of \ncourse, compounded by the fact that there is virtually no legislative \nrecord on it. It has never been introduced in the Senate, and received \na grand total of 10 minutes of debate before being passed as a floor \namendment in the House. And in case any judge is reading this and \nwondering, there was no discussion of this provision during the one \nafternoon that the conference committee actually met.\n  In recent years, Congress's efforts to regulate protected speech on \nthe Internet have not fared well in the Supreme Court, which takes its \nresponsibility to uphold the first amendment a bit more seriously than \nsome of my Republican colleagues. It would not surprise me if the Court \nwas especially dismissive of this current effort.\n  I am also concerned about the inclusion of the Illicit Drug Anti-\nProliferation Act in this conference report. This bill has drawn \nserious grass-roots opposition, and I know that I am not alone in \nhearing from many constituents about their serious and well-considered \nobjections to it. Despite this opposition, and even though the Senate \nhas never held a hearing on this bill, the conference committee agreed \nto include it in this hastily-assembled package.\n  I know that Senator Biden has made changes to the bill since the last \nCongress, beginning with its title, and I appreciate his flexibility. \nBut these changes do not address some of the questions that have been \nraised about this legislation.\n  The bill's primary purpose is to expand the existing ``crack house \nstatute,'' (21 USC 856) which makes it unlawful to knowingly open or \nmaintain any place for the purpose of manufacturing, distributing, or \nusing any controlled substance, or to make a place available to someone \nelse for use for such purposes or for storing a controlled substance. \nThe bill would expand the statute to include those who lease, rent, or \nuse property, including temporary occupants, and would allow for civil \nsuits against violators.\n  The crack house statute has been on the books for more than 15 years, \nand for most of its existence, Federal prosecutors have used it solely \nagainst\n\n[[Page S5148]]\n\nproperty owners who have been directly involved in committing drug \noffenses. The House Judiciary Committee, however, heard evidence last \nyear that the Drug Enforcement Administration and prosecutors are now \nusing the ``crack house statute'' to pursue even business owners who \ntake serious precautions to avoid drug use at their events. Business \nowners have come to Congress and told us there are only so many steps \nthey can take to prevent any of the thousands of people who may attend \na concert or a rave from using drugs, and they are worried about being \nheld personally accountable for the illegal acts of others. Those \nconcerns may well be overstated, but they deserve a fuller hearing.\n  In addition, the provision allowing civil suits dramatically \nincreases the potential liability of business owners. Of course, this \nis a good thing when applied against those who are knowingly profiting \nfrom illegal drug use. But we have been told that even conscientious \npromoters may think twice before holding large concerts or other events \nwhere some drug use may be inevitable despite their best efforts. I do \nnot know enough to know whether that claim is exaggerated, but I think \nwe would have been well-served by making a greater effort to find out.\n  Finally, I want to speak on a very important piece of legislation \nthat I attempted to add in conference. I am deeply disappointed that \nthe Republican House and Senate conferees refused to include in the \nconference agreement the ``Hometown Heroes Survivors Benefits Act of \n2003,'' tri-partisan legislation that I introduced earlier this year \nwith ten cosponsors, including the lead Republican cosponsor Senator \nGraham of South Carolina, who served as a member of this conference. \nThis legislation would improve the Department of Justice's Public \nSafety Officers' Benefits (PSOB) program by allowing families of public \nsafety officers who suffer fatal heart attacks or strokes to qualify \nfor Federal survivor benefits.\n  Every year, hundreds of public safety officers nationwide lose their \nlives and thousands more are injured while performing duties that \nsubject them to great physical risks. While we know that PSOB benefits \ncan never be a substitute for the loss of a loved one, the families of \nall our fallen heroes deserve our support for making the ultimate \nsacrifice.\n  The PSOB Program currently provides a one-time financial benefits \npayment to the families of law enforcement officers, firemen, emergency \nresponse squad members, and ambulance crew members who are killed in \nthe line of duty. Unfortunately, PSOB guidelines do not allow survivors \nof public safety officer who die of a heart attack or stroke while \nacting in the line of duty to collect those benefits, ignoring the fact \nthat service-connected heart conditions are silent killers of public \nsafety officers nationwide.\n  I sought to include our tri-partisan bill in the conference report to \nfix the loophole in the PSOB program. This language would ensure that \nthe survivors of public safety officers who die of heart attacks or \nstrokes in the line of duty or within 24 hours of a triggering incident \nwhile on duty--regardless of whether a traumatic injury is present at \nthe time of the heart attack or stroke--are eligible to receive \nfinancial assistance. Representative Etheridge and I introduced \nidentical versions of this legislation last Congress, and the House \nbill passed that body, but an anonymous Republican hold in the Senate \nkilled it.\n  I am saddened that the House and Republican conferees voted to strike \nHometown Heroes from consideration by the conference. They squandered a \nchance to pass legislation to support our first responders and their \nfamilies by striking it in a strict party line vote.\n  Public safety is dangerous, exhausting, and stressful work. A first \nresponder's chances of suffering a heart attack or stroke greatly \nincrease when he or she puts on heavy equipment and rushes into a \nburning building to fight a fire and save lives. The families of these \nbrave public servants deserve to participate in the PSOB Program if \ntheir loved ones die of a heart attack or other cardiac-related ailment \nwhile selflessly protecting us from harm.\n  It is time for both the Senate and House to show their support and \nappreciation for these extraordinarily brave and heroic public safety \nofficers by passing the Hometown Heroes Survivors Benefit Act.\n  Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to thank my staff for \nall their hard work on these provisions to protect our nation's \nchildren. I want to recognize Julie Katzman, Steve Dettelbach, Tara \nMagner, Ed Pagano, Phil Toomijian, Jessica Berry, Tim Lynch and \nMarguererite McConihe for their dedication to these important measures. \nTheir diligence and professionalism do credit to this body.\n  I also wish to recognize the staff of the other Senate conferees for \ntheir hard work, including Robin Toone, Neil MacBride, Tonya Robinson, \nEric Rosen, Chad Groover, Mike Volkov, Reed O'Connor, Wan Kim, James \nGalyean, and William Smith.\n  Finally, I wish to thank the staffs of the Democratic House \nconferees, including Perry Apelbaum, Bobby Vassar, Greg Branes, Ted \nKalo, as well as Chairman Sensenbrenner's professional staff, \nespecially Will Moschella, Phil Kiko, Beth Sokul, Sean McLaughlin and \nJay Apperson.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nconference report on the PROTECT Act, S. 151. As a conferee on that \nConference Committee, I proudly support this important bill. It is \nundoubtedly, one of the most significant and comprehensive pieces of \nlegislation ever drafted to protect children. By marrying the AMBER \nalert bill with the Senate's PROTECT Act, and the House's Child \nAbduction Prevention Act, we will be ensuring a greater measure of \nprotection for our children and greatly impacting their safety.\n  I am proud to have been a cosponsor of the Senate's version of the \nPROTECT Act. This portion of the conference bill does many important \nthings. Because of advances in modern technology, prosecutors and \nexperts are finding it more and more difficult to determine which \nimages of child pornography are of real children and which are computer \ngenerated. This makes it very difficult to prove that an image is of a \nreal child in a criminal case. To solve this problem, the bill makes it \nillegal to possess any material that contains a visual image of a minor \nengaging in sexually explicit conduct. Because child pornography, \nincluding morphed child pornography, is used to seduce children, the \nbill also makes it illegal to try to induce a child, through any means, \nincluding by computer, to participate in any activity that is illegal. \nThe bill also makes any identifying information of a child, with the \nexception of age, inadmissible evidence in a court of law. Finally, to \ncombat a grave problem that is growing worse daily, the bill requires \nthe Attorney General to appoint 25 additional trial attorneys that \nwould focus on the investigating and prosecuting Federal child \npornography and obscenity laws.\n  Another important inclusion in this bill is the Public Outreach \nTitle, which deals with the AMBER alert and the National Center for \nMissing and Exploited Children. The Senate Judiciary Committee heard \nvery poignant testimony about how the AMBER alert, had it been \navailable, could have been used to save young children, like Polly \nKlaas. We also heard testimony of how the California AMBER alert was \nsuccessfully used to find two Lancaster teenagers, last summer. That \nhearing built a good record for why we need a nationally coordinated \nAMBER alert communications network. Additionally, the Public Outreach \nTitle increase the support for the National Center for Missing and \nExploited Children; gives the US Secret Service the authority to render \ninvestigative and forensic support to missing children; and creates a \ncyber tipline. This title will greatly enhance the ability of law \nenforcement to find our Nation's missing children.\n\n  While the bill makes significant progress in strengthening Federal \nchild pornography laws and in enhancing public outreach, so that \nmissing and exploited children can be recovered, the bill also includes \nthe Houses' tough on crime penalties for Federal sex offenses. The bill \nincreases penalties for crimes like kidnaping, sex tourism, child \nabuse, and child torture. It also includes a ``two-strikes'' provision \nthat would establish a mandatory life sentence for twice convicted sex \noffenders.\n\n[[Page S5149]]\n\nThis one provision alone will help keep some of the worst violent child \nmolesters off the streets and out of the exploitation business. The \nbill also includes new rules for supervised release of sex offenders, \nso that criminals with deep-seated aberrant sexual tendencies will not \njust be released to the public without some measure of protecting the \npublic once the criminal is let out of prison. Additionally, the bill \nremoves the statute of limitations for sex crimes against minors. This \nprovision will be particularly helpful in cases where there is old DNA \nevidence, but still no suspect. It is my hope that these new sanctions \nwill have a tremendous deterrent impact, and when taken all together \nthey will provide for greater security for America's most precious \nresource--it's children.\n  Although the underlying bill is an exceptional piece of legislation, \nI felt that there were a few additional provisions that would make the \nbill even better. I appreciate the way some members of the conference \nworked with me to include these additional provisions on the bill. \nFirst, I was able to get accepted an amendment to include child \npornography manufacturers and distributors in the Federal sex offender \nregistry. Because child pornography is a gateway to child molestation, \njust as marijuana is a gateway to harder drugs, those who deal in this \ntype of material should be included in the offender registry, so that \nthe public is on notice of these criminals.\n  I was also able to get approved a technical amendment to the \nCommunications Decency Act. This amendment would conform the language \nof the CDA to the Supreme Court's decision in Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. \n844 (1997). The amendment strikes the indecency provisions, which the \ncourt ruled were unconstitutionally vague, and limits the scope of the \nCDA to obscenity and child pornography, which can be restricted since \nthey do not benefit from first amendment protection.\n  The conference also accepted two sense-of-Congress provisions. The \nfirst provision expresses that it is the sense of the Congress that the \nChild Exploitation and Obscenity Section of the Department of Justice \nshould focus its investigative and prosecutorial efforts on major \nproducers, distributors, and sellers of obscene material and child \npornography that use misleading methods to market their material to \nchildren. This provision was recommended in the 2000 report of the COPA \nCommission, a congressional commission tasked with studying how to \nprotect children from pornography online. The second provision, which \nis also taken from the COPA Commission report, expresses that it is the \nsense of the Congress that the online commercial adult industry should \nvoluntarily refrain from placing obscenity, child pornography, or \nharmful-to-minors material on the front pages of their Web sites. By \ntaking this step, these Web sites will be helping to protect minors \nfrom material that may negatively impact their social, moral, and \npsychological development.\n  With improved child pornography laws, enhanced public outreach, and \ntougher sentences for sex offenders who victimize minors, this \nconference report will be essential to keeping our children safe from \nindividuals who wish to do them harm. I urge my colleagues to vote for \nthe conference report on S. 151, The PROTECT Act.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate is considering the \nconference report to accompany S. 151, the Protect Act. As a member of \nthe conference committee tasked with reconciling the differences \nbetween the House and Senate bills, I am gratified to see action being \ntaken on this measure today. The conference report before us addresses \none of the most important issues in America--protecting our kids from \nsexual and physical abuse. Enactment of this measure could literally \nsave lives.\n  This bill will expand the nationwide AMBER Alert System to ensure \nmaximum coordination between state and local law enforcement in their \nefforts to catch predators that kidnap kids. ``Amber alerts''--\ntypically distributed through radio and television broadcasts and \nelectronic highway signs--gained prominence after last summer's \nunfortunate and high-profile child abduction cases. These bulletins \nproved invaluable in their ability to disperse information about the \nmissing children quickly and broadly--and they remain a critically \nimportant law enforcement tool.\n  The conference report that we consider today will expand and improve \nthe program by establishing an AMBER Coordinator within the Department \nof Justice to enhance and centralize the operation of the \ncommunications system. It will establish minimum standards for \ncoordination between various AMBER plans, particularly between state \nplans. And, perhaps most important, it will authorize two grants--one \nin the Department of Transportation to help sustain the AMBER alert \nprograms themselves and a second in the Department of Justice to fund \neducation, training, and related equipment. This common-sense \nlegislation has been delayed far too long. We know that the AMBER Alert \nSystem helps save abducted children, and we should not let a single \nadditional day pass before voting this measure into law. With this \nlegislation, safeguards will soon be in place to protect children and \ntheir families.\n  The conference report also includes a negotiated version of the \nPROTECT Act, which this body unanimously adopted in February. The \nmeasure responds to last year's Supreme Court decision in Ashcroft v. \nFree Speech Coalition by writing a tough new child pornography law \nthat, we hope, will allow prosecutors to go after those who traffic in \nchild pornography--while not running afoul of the Court's first \namendment holdings. Importantly, in addition to prohibiting the \nproduction and distribution of pornographic material depicting \nchildren, this bill achieves a range of other improvements to the law:\n  First, it strengthens penalties against repeat offenders. Second, it \nprotects the privacy of children victimized by pornographers by \npreventing the introduction of any non-physical identifying \ninformation--like the child's name or social security number--into \nevidence at court. Third, it facilitates information-sharing between \ninternet providers, who report incidents of child pornography and \nexploitation on their sites, and State law enforcement officers. And \nfinally, it provides a civil remedy for victims of child pornography--\nincluding injunctive relief to stop immediately the bad conduct. These \nimportant improvements put children and their needs first. Is the \nlegislation perfect? No. But it will move us substantially down the \nroad to protecting out kids from predators, while preserving important \nfirst amendment principles.\n\n  I am pleased that several bipartisan proposals which I sponsored in \nthe Senate will be included in this conference report. Like the AMBER \nAlert and child porn provisions, these additional initiatives will also \nprotect our kids from child predators. I would like to take a moment to \nexplain several of the provisions that I worked to see included in this \nconference report.\n  Section 108 establishes the Child Safety Pilot Program, an initiative \nthat for the first time will permit groups like the Boys and Girls \nClubs to apply directly to the Justice Department for background checks \nfor their volunteers. It is a proposal that has been a long time in the \nmaking, and I am very pleased the conferees agreed to its adoption.\n  This section is drawn from legislation that I authored along with \nSenator Thurmond in the 107th Congress, the National Child Protection \nand Volunteers for Children Improvement Act. That bill passed the \nSenate unanimously but was not acted upon by the other body. I first \nraised concerns about the current state of background checks for \nvolunteers in 2000 with the introduction of S. 3252. That bill and the \nbill that passed the Senate last year would have markedly simplified \nthe current process for background checks for volunteers who work with \nkids.\n  Today, 87 million of our children are involved in activities provided \nby child and youth organizations which depend heavily on volunteers to \ndeliver their services. Millions more elderly and disabled adults are \nserved by public and private service organizations. Organizations \nacross the country, like the Boys and Girls Clubs, often rely solely on \nvolunteers to make these safe havens for kids a place where they can \nlearn. The Boys and Girls Clubs and others don't just provide services \nto kids--their work reverberates throughout our communities, as the \nafter-\n\n[[Page S5150]]\n\nschool programs they provide help keep kids out of trouble. This is \njuvenile crime prevention at its best, and I salute the volunteers who \nhelp make these programs work.\n  Unfortunately, some of these volunteers come to their jobs with less \nthan the best of intentions. According to the National Mentoring \nPartnership, between 1 and 7 percent of children in child care \nsettings, foster homes and schools are sexually abused. Organizations \nhave tried to weed out bad apples, and today most conduct background \nchecks on applicants who seek to work with children. Regrettably, these \nchecks can often take months to complete, can be expensive, and many \norganizations do not have access to the FBI's national fingerprint \ndatabase. These time delays and scope limitations are dangerous: a \nprospective volunteer could pass a name-based background check in one \nstate, only to have a past felony committed in another jurisdiction go \nundetected.\n  Effective December 20, 1993, the National Child Protection Act, NCPA, \nP.L. 103-209, encouraged States to adopt legislation to authorize a \nnational criminal history background check to determine an employee's \nor volunteer's fitness to care for the safety and well-being of \nchildren. On September 13, 1994, the Violent Crime Control and Law \nEnforcement Act of 1994 (P.L. 103-322) expanded the scope of the NCPA \nto include the elderly and individuals with disabilities.\n  As envisioned by Congress, the NCPA was to encourage states to have \nin effect national background check procedures that enable a \n``qualified entity'' to determine whether an individual applicant is \nfit to care for the safety and well-being of children, the elderly, or \nindividuals with disabilities. The procedures permit this entity to ask \nan authorized state agency to request that the Attorney General run a \nnationwide criminal history background check on an applicant provider.\n  ``Qualified entity'' is defined at 42 U.S.C. 5119c as ``a business or \norganization, whether public, private, for-profit, not-for-profit, or \nvoluntary, that provides care or care placement services, including a \nbusiness or organization that licenses or certifies others to provide \ncare or care placement services. . . .''\n  The authorized agency should access and review state and Federal \ncriminal history records through the national criminal history \nbackground check system and make reasonable efforts to respond to an \ninquiry within 15 business days. Congress addressed this issue again in \n1998 through enactment of the Volunteers for Children Act, Sections 221 \nand 222 of P.L. 105-251, ``VCA''. The VCA amended the NCPA to permit \nchild care, elder care, and volunteer organizations to request \nbackground checks through state agencies in the absence of state laws \nimplementing the NCPA.\n  Thus, the NCPA, as amended by the VCA, authorizes national \nfingerprint-based criminal history background checks of volunteers and \nemployees (including applicants for employment) of qualified entities \nwho provide care for children, the elderly, or individuals with \ndisabilities, and those who have unsupervised access to such \npopulations (regardless of employment or volunteer status), for the \npurpose of determining whether they have been convicted of crimes that \nbear upon their fitness to have responsibility for the safety and well-\nbeing of children, the elderly, or individuals with disabilities.\n  Three years ago, organizations seeking to conduct background checks \non their employees and volunteers made me aware of serious problems \nwith the current background check system, problems that were \njeopardizing the safety of children. Groups like the Boys and Girls \nClubs of America alerted me that, despite the authorities provided in \nthe NCPA and the VCA, national check requests were often delayed, in \nsome jurisdictions they were never processed, and that the prohibitive \ncosts of some of these checks were discouraging entities from seeking \nthe reviews.\n  Under current law, whether they want a state or national criminal \nbackground check, organizations must apply through their state-\nauthorized agency. The state agency then performs the state check and \nforwards the request to the FBI for a national check. The FBI responds \nback to the state agency, which then forwards the information back to \nthe volunteer organization. In Delaware, the State Police Bureau of \nIdentification works with groups to fingerprint prospective workers and \ncheck their backgrounds.\n  A patchwork of statutes and regulations govern background checks at \nthe state level; there are currently over 1,200 State statutes \nconcerning criminal record checks. This has led to widely different \nsituations in each state: different agencies are authorized to perform \nthe checks for different types of organizations, distinct forms and \ninformation are required, and the results are returned in various \nformats that can be difficult to interpret. States have not been \nconsistent in their interpretation of the NCPA and VCA. Put simply, the \ncurrent system is extremely cumbersome, particularly for those \norganizations that must check criminal records in multiple states, and \nfor those groups employing seasonal workers, such as summer camps, for \nwhom time is of the essence when seeking the results of background \nchecks.\n  After careful study of this issue it became clear to me that the \nconcerns of groups such as the National Mentoring Partnership and the \nBoys and Girls Clubs are not merely anecdotal. In 1998, the FBI's \nCriminal Justice Information Services, CJIS, Division performed an \nanalysis of fingerprints submitted for civil applicants purposes. CJIS \nfound that the average transmission time from the point of fingerprint \nto the state bureau was 51.0 days, and from the state bureau to the FBI \nwas another 66.6 days, for a total of 117.6 days from fingerprinting to \nreceipt by the FBI. The worst performing jurisdiction took 544.8 days \nfrom fingerprinting to receipt by the FBI. In a survey conducted by the \nNational Mentoring Partnership, mentoring organizations on average \nwaited 6 weeks for the results of a national criminal background check \nto be returned.\n  The danger these delays post to mentoring groups and others cannot be \noverstated. Suppose a group seeks to hire a volunteer who grew up in a \nneighboring jurisdiction to work with children. The group has the \nvolunteer fingerprinted at their local police department, forwards \nthose prints along to the agency designated by state statute or \nprocedure to receive such requests, and then waits for the national \nresults. FBI data indicates they will wait close to four months, on \naverage, for the final results of the background check. That's too \nlong. It forces groups to choose between taking a risk on someone's \nbackground, not making the hire at all, or seeking out only candidates \nfrom their jurisdiction for whom a full national background check may \nnot be necessary.\n  Delay is not the only problem with the current system. The NCPA/VCA \ncaps the fees the FBI can charge for national background checks at $24 \nfor employees. For state fees, the NCPA/VCA requires States to \n``establish fee systems that insure that fees to nonprofit entities for \nbackground checks do not discourage volunteers from participating in \nchild care programs.'' In a survey of mentoring organizations, the \nNational Mentoring Partnership found that organizations were paying on \naverage $10 for a State records check, plus the fee for a national \ncheck. For organizations utilizing hundreds of volunteers and \nemployees, the costs of conducting thorough background checks can be \nexorbitant. Small, community-based organizations with limited funding \noften must choose between funding services to children and checking the \ncriminal history records of prospective volunteers.\n  Section 108 does three things. First, subsection (a)(2) establishes a \nState Pilot Program that will facilitate the ability of youth-serving \norganizations in three States designated by the Attorney General to \ncheck the backgrounds of their volunteers. The intent of this provision \nis for State Pilot Program to operate as the Congress intended the \nNational Child Protection Act to operate. That is, youth-serving \norganizations who attempt to check the backgrounds of volunteers under \nthis section shall be able to access the FBI's national criminal \nhistory database when necessary. The requesting process will go through \nthe appropriate State agency. The State will review its criminal \nhistory records, and then forward the organization's request along to \nthe FBI if a national check is required. Under 108(a)(2)(D), all \ncriminal\n\n[[Page S5151]]\n\nhistory records will be provided to the State agency. The language in \nthat section which reads ``consistent with the National Child \nProtection Act'' is intended to result in that State agency then making \na determination of the potential volunteer's fitness to work with \nchildren. While (a)(2)(D) does permit the National Center for Missing \nand Exploited Children to access the criminal history records of the \npotential volunteer under (a)(2)'s State Pilot Program, it is my view \nthat the Conferees intended this section result in fitness \ndeterminations being made by the appropriate State agency as under \ncurrent law. Subsection (a)(2)(F) ensures that this determination will \nbe provided to the organization in a timely fashion.\n\n  Second, subsection (a)(3) establishes a Child Safety Pilot Program. \nUnder this subsection, three youth-serving organizations will be \npermitted to allocate a number of Federal background checks to their \nmembers or affiliates over an 18-month period. Current law does not \npermit these organizations to provide fingerprint cards directly to the \nFBI's criminal history records system in order to check the backgrounds \nof potential volunteers. This subsection changes that. Ninety days \nafter the date of enactment of this conference report, the Attorney \nGeneral will notify the Boys and Girls Clubs of America, the National \nMentoring Partnership, and the National Council of Youth Sports that \nthey have been statutorily designated to make 100,000 background check \nrequests of the FBI. Allocations of these checks are set out in \n(a)(3)(C). The three eligible organizations may not accept fingerprint \ncards under this Pilot Program from any of their members or affiliates \nlocated in the three States designated by the Attorney General to \nparticipate in the State Pilot Program described in (a)(2). The \norganizations are required to obtain a signed statement from the \npotential volunteer along with the volunteer's fingerprints. Once the \nAttorney General receives fingerprint cards from the volunteer \norganizations, subsection (a)(3)(F) gives him 14 business days to \nprovide any resulting criminal history records information to the \nNational Center for Missing and Exploited Children. The Attorney \nGeneral shall charge these three organizations no more than $18 to \nperform these checks. The National Center for Missing and Exploited \nChildren will work with the three organizations to develop standards to \ndetermine how to evaluate the criminal history records information \nprovided by the FBI, and to set standards to guide the fitness \ndetermination described in (a)(3)(G)(i). Nothing in this subsection \nrequires the NCMEC to make such a fitness determination; the language \nof (a)(3)(G)(i) is discretionary. It is my view that the conferees \nintended this subsection to permit NCMEC to work with the eligible \norganizations in determining the fitness of prospective volunteers to \nwork with children. However, it is my view that the conferees did not \nintend for NCMEC to perform this function unless adequate \nappropriations are allocated to it pursuant to subsection (c)(1). NCMEC \nshall not be liable for any fitness determination made pursuant to \n(a)(3)(G)(i), consistent with the limitation on liability set forth in \nsection 305(a) of the conference report.\n  Third, subsection (d) requires the Attorney General to report to \nCongress on the implementation of the pilot programs at their \nconclusion, and to make legislative recommendations to Congress on \nwhether the National child Protection Act requires amendments to ensure \nthat organizations like those described in section 108 have access to \nprompt, effective, and affordable national criminal history background \nchecks. It is important to point out that section 108 establishes only \na pilot program for 100,00 checks. Members of the National Mentoring \nPartnership alone rely upon close to one million volunteers. The boys \nand Girls Clubs have close to 150,000 volunteers. Hundreds of thousands \nmore volunteer with little leagues, soccer leagues, and other youth \nsports leagues affiliated with the National Council of Youth Sports. We \nshould be doing more than establishing a pilot program, and I am \ndisappointed the department of Justice continues to maintain that \nenactment of my legislation that passed the Senate last year, S. 1868, \ncould overburden its fingerprinting infrastructure. Ensuring that those \nwho volunteer to work with out kids in an investment that we should be \nwilling to make. I intend to work to expand this Child Safety Pilot \nProgram until ultimately all of those who want to access the FBI's \ncriminal history records system are able to do so, consistent with the \nprivacy protections provided by current law.\n  I thank Robbie Callaway and Steve Salem of the Boys and Girls Clubs \nof America for their strong support for my original bill and for this \nsection would not be included in this conference report we take up \ntoday. Margo Pedroso of the National Mentoring Partnership has been \nextremely helpful to me and my staff in terms of educating Congress \nconcerning the extent of the current problem, and I thank her and her \norganization for their support for this section. John Walsh with \nAmerica's Most Wanted provided effective, timely advocacy for this \nprovision and I am extremely grateful for his tireless commitment to \nprotecting the Nation's children from criminals. I am also thankful for \nthe efforts of Sally Cunningham of the National Council of Youth Sports \nfor her organization's support for this program this year.\n  This bill also contains a provision I sponsored that reauthorizes \nChild Advocacy Centers. Child Advocacy Centers bring together law \nenforcement, prosecutors, child protective services and medical and \nmental health professionals to provide comprehensive, child-focused \nservices to child victims of crimes. They provide immediate attention \nto young victims of sexual and physical abuse so that they are not \n``twice abused,'' first by the perpetrator and second by a system which \nused to shuttle them from a medical clinic to a counseling center to \nthe police station to the D.A.'s office.\n  Operating in all 50 states, Child Advocacy Centers served over \n116,000 child victims last year. Of these victims, 26,934 received \nonsite medical exam, 27,684 received counseling and 69,443 went through \na forensic interview process especially designed for children. Seventy-\nsix percent of the children they serviced were under the age of 12. In \nDelaware, there are currently two operational Centers. Last year, Child \nAdvocacy Centers in Delaware handled 1,000 cases where child victims as \nyoung as three alleged physical or sexual abuse.\n  Widely cited as an efficient, cost-effective mechanism of handling \nchild abuse cases, Child Advocacy Centers are widely supported by \npolice, prosecutors and the courts. Not surprisingly, communities with \ncenters report increased successful prosecution of perpetrators, more \nconsistent follow-up to child abuse reports, increased medical and \nmental health referrals for victims, and more compassionate support for \nchild victims. It is also worth noting that in a May 1998 publication \ntitled, New Directions from the Field, the Department of Justice \nincluded Children's Advocacy Centers as their number one recommendation \nfor improving services to children who directly experience or witness \nviolence--number one.\n  Mr. President, in 1994, this body passed the Violence Against Women \nAct, which I authored. This act made it clear that victims of domestic \nviolence were victims in need of the full extent of this nation's \nmedical and legal resources. My child advocacy provision is designed to \nbring this same type of concentrated focus, general awareness, and \ncoordinated response to victims of child abuse\n  Section 607 is of the conference report includes my Secure \nAuthentication Feature and Enhanced Identification Defense Act of 2003, \nalso known as the ``SAFE ID'' Act. I would also like to thank Senator \nHatch for joining me in introducing this legislation as a stand-alone \nbill and for helping to ensure that it became part of this conference \nreport.\n  Mr. President, two of the terrorists who perpetrated the acts of 9/11 \nheld false identification documents, which they purchased from a broker \nof false IDs. That broker was convicted under State law, but sentenced \nmerely to probation. The judge and the prosecutor publicly lamented \nthat the law did not subject such a person to harsher penalties.\n  These events focused new attention on an existing, growing problem--\nthe ease with which individuals and organizations can forge and steal \nIDs and use\n\n[[Page S5152]]\n\nthem to harm our society. These circumstances weaken our efforts in the \nfight against terrorism; identity theft; underage drinking and drunk \ndriving; driver's license, passport and birth certificate fraud; even \nchild abduction. In the post-9/11 era, we must do more to prevent the \ncreation of false, misleading or inaccurate government IDs. This has \nbecome an issue of national importance and therefore merits a national \nresponse.\n  In recent years, the ability of criminals to produce authentic-\nlooking fake IDs has grown immensely. Today, unfortunately, it is \nbecoming increasingly common for criminals to either steal or forge, \nand traffic in, the very items that issuing authorities use to verify \nthe authenticity of their IDs.\n  These ``authentication features'' are the holograms, watermarks, and \nother symbols, letters and codes used in identification documents to \nprove that they are authentic. Unfortunately, today ID's carrying \nauthentication features can be purchased on the Internet or through \nmail order outfits. In addition, breeder documents, such as birth \ncertificates, are desk-top published, with an illegitimate embossed or \nfoil seal. Put another way, not only do crooks forge \nidentification documents, they also now illegally fake or steal the \nvery features issuing authorities use to fight that crime.\n\n  Under current law, it is not illegal to possess, traffic in, or use \nfalse or misleading authentication features whose purpose is to create \nfraudulent IDs. That is why I have authored the SAFE ID Act. The SAFE \nID Act would prohibit the fraudulent use of authentication features in \nidentity documents. Specifically, the SAFE ID Act adds authentication \nfeatures to the list of items covered by an existing law prohibiting \nfraud and related activity in connection with identification documents. \nIn addition, the act requires forfeiture of any violative items, such \nas false authentication features and relevant equipment.\n  The act defines ``authentication feature'' as ``any hologram, \nwatermark, certification, symbol, code, image, sequence of numbers or \nletters, or other feature that either individually or in combination \nwith another feature is used by the issuing authority on an \nidentification document, document-making implement, or means of \nidentification to determine if the document is counterfeit, altered, or \notherwise falsified.''\n  Holograms have long been used on credit cards, and are beginning to \nbe deployed in identification documents. The term ``hologram'' is meant \nto include diffractive optical gratings and other optically variable \ndevices, regardless of their manner of fixation to, or formation in, a \ndocument substrate.\n  Watermarks take a variety of forms including fabricated paper \nwatermarks and digital watermarks. Watermarks have a long history of \nuse as authentication features in paper, and were traditionally \nfabricated during the wet paper phase of the paper-making process by \nvarying the thickness of paper fiber. Such conventional watermarks are \nnow fabricated in a number of other ways, including chemical treatment. \nGenerally, the watermark pattern--e.g., a logo--is revealed by viewing \nthe document at an angel, or subject to certain illumination.\n  A second type of watermark is a digital code, sometimes referred to \nas a digital watermark. This code is secretly conveyed by an \nidentification document using a number of steganographic technologies. \nIn one, artwork on the document is altered in very slight respects to \neffect changes to the luminance, chromaticity, or reflectance at \ndifferent locations across the artwork. This pattern is imperceptible \nto the human eye, but can be revealed by digitally scanning the \ndocument, examining the resulting data for these slight variations, and \ninterpreting these variations to discern the digital code. The artwork \nencoded in this fashion can be a photograph, a logo--e.g., a seal of \nthe issuing authority--or ornamentation--e.g., guilloche patterning. In \nother steganographic techniques, the background of the card is tinted \nwith a subtle patterning, or a patterned texture is formed on the \ndocument. Again, such patterns are too slight to be recognized by human \nobservers as conveying the digital watermark code, but the code can be \ndiscerned by scanning, and then analyzing the scan data.\n  This type of watermark finds application in detecting counterfeit, \naltered, and otherwise falsified documents in a number of different \nways. For example, a photograph on a driver's license may \nsteganographically convey a digital watermark code that identifies the \nissuing authority (e.g., the State of New Jersey). If the license is \naltered--by substituting a different photo--then analysis of the \nlicense will reveal the substitution because the photograph will not \nconvey the expected digital code. Likewise, the blank stock on which \ndriver's licenses are printed may convey, e.g., in a tint pattern, a \ndigital code that identifies the issuing authority. If a suspect \ndriver's license is found not to convey the expected code, it will be \nrecognized as non-authentic.\n\n  In still other documents, the watermark can serve as a logical cross-\ncheck of other data or security features on the card. For example, the \ndigital watermark code with which a driver's license is \nsteganographically marked can convey a ``hash'' of the ASCII characters \nforming the lawful owner's name that is originally printed on the \nlicense. If the name on the license is altered, the hash resulting from \nthat name will be different, and will not longer match the hash \nconveyed by the digital watermark code. Likewise, the birthdate printed \non the license can be hashed and serve as the watermark. If the printed \nbirthdate is altered, its hash will no longer match that conveyed by \nthe steganographic encoding. By such arrangements, alteration of text \nand other elements of an identification document can readily be \ndiscerned by reference to digital watermarks.\n  Sometimes authentication features are used in the creation of so-\ncalled ``novelty IDs.'' These are documents that appear to be \nidentification documents from recognized issuing authorities, but in \nfact are not. (An Internet search on the term reveals hundreds of web \nsites.) Sometimes such documents follow the exact layout of text, \nphoto, and design elements used in authentic identity documents. \nHowever, such mimicry is not essential for such a ``novelty ID'' to be \naccepted as legitimate (e.g., a liquor store owner in California may \nnot know what a genuine Vermont driver's license looks like). Such non-\nidentical documents commonly make use of features that are relied upon \nby others in ascertaining the genuineness of an identification \ndocument. The definition of ``authentication feature'' thus embraces \nsuch features, and provisions elsewhere in the amended statute prohibit \nthe use of such features on so-called ``novelty IDs.''\n  Subpart (4) extends the former statutory definition of ``false \nidentification document'' from documents that are counterfeit ab inito, \nto also include documents that were originally issued lawfully, but \nsubsequently altered for a purpose of deceit.\n  In like manner, subpart (5) makes clear that ``false identification \ndocument'' includes both features that were never genuine, but appear \nto be genuine, as well as features that originally were genuine but \nwere subsequently (i) tampered with or altered for purposes of deceit; \nor (ii) diverted, or intended for diversion, without the authorization \nof the issuing authority.\n  Subpart (6) is amended to define ``issuing authority.'' This term \nincludes ``quasi-governmental organizations,'' such as The Port \nAuthority of New York and New Jersey, and governmentally chartered \nentities (e.g., the United States Postal System and the U.S. Federal \nReserve System).\n  Mr. President, this section will give law enforcement officials a \npowerful tool to crack down on identity thieves. According to the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice, up to 700,000 people in the United States may be \nvictimized by identity bandits each year, costing the average victim \nmore than $1,000. Additionally, banks lost at least $1 billion to \nidentity thieves last year. The SAFE ID Act will also go a long way \ntoward combating the nationwide problem of underage drinking. Underage \ndrinking is a serious problem with dangerous, and sometimes deadly \nconsequences. The SAFE ID Act will help prevent underage drinking by \nmaking it harder for fraudulent criminals to provide young people with \nfake IDs. It perhaps goes without saying that legislation such as this, \nwhich makes it\n\n[[Page S5153]]\n\nharder to obtain fake IDs, will also make it harder for those who \nabduct innocent children to mask their identity and thereby avoid \ndetection.\n  Mr. President, it is rare that we have before us legislation that \nwould effectively address problems as disparate as homeland defense, \nidentity theft, underage drinking, and child abduction. The SAFE ID Act \nwould do just that, by cutting the legs out from under those who would \nmisuse technology to mislead government authorities.\n  I am pleased that we were also able to include in the conference \nagreement the text of the Illicit Drug Anti-Proliferation Act, a bill \nwhich I introduced with Senator Grassley in the Senate as S. 226, and \nthat Representatives Coble and Smith introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  This legislation arose out of a series of hearings Senator Grassley \nand I held in the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control on \nthe risk that the so-called ``club drug'' Ecstasy poses to young people \nand the predatory behavior of some promoters of all-night dance \nparties--known as ``raves''--in distributing the drug to them.\n  The bill provides federal prosecutors the tools needed to combat the \nmanufacture, distribution or use of any controlled substance at any \nvenue whose purpose is to engage in illegal narcotics activity.\n  Rather than create a new law, it merely amends a well-established \nstatute to make clear that anyone who knowingly and intentionally uses \ntheir property--or allows another person to use their property--for the \npurpose of distributing or manufacturing or using illegal drugs can be \nheld accountable, regardless of whether the drug use is ongoing or \noccurs at a single event.\n  The bill is aimed at the defendant's predatory behavior, regardless \nof the type of drug or the particular place in which it is being used \nor distributed. One problem that we are facing currently involves so-\ncalled ``club drugs'' and raves. According to the Partnership for a \nDrug Free America, teens who report attending a rave are seven times \nmore likely to have tried Ecstasy than teens who report not attending a \nrave. I find this statistic quite troubling and I hope that the changes \nmade by the conference report before us today will make promoters think \ntwice before endangering kids in this manner.\n  Despite the conventional wisdom that Ecstasy and other club drugs are \n``no big deal,'' a view that even the New York Times magazine espoused \nin a cover story, these drugs can have serious consequences, and can \neven be fatal. Earlier this year we got some encouraging news: after \nyears of steady increase, Ecstasy use is finally beginning to decrease \namong teens. That said, the rate of use remains unacceptably high and \nwe still have quite a bit of work to do to counter the widespread \nmisconception that Ecstasy is harmless, fashionable and hip.\n  At a 2001 Drug Caucus hearing, witnesses testified that rogue rave \norganizers commonly go to great lengths to portray their events as safe \nso that parents will allow their kids to attend. But the truth is that \nsome of these raves are drug dens where use of Ecstasy and other ``club \ndrugs''--such as the date rape drugs Rohypnol, GHB and Ketamine--is \nwidespread.\n  We know that there will always be certain people who will bring drugs \ninto musical or other events and use them without the knowledge or \npermission of the promoter or club owner. This is not the type of \nactivity that my bill would address. My bill would help in the \nprosecution of rogue promoters who not only know that there is drug use \nat their event but also hold the event for the purpose of illegal drug \nuse or distribution. That is quite a high bar. The coalition of \nLicensed Beverage Associations and the International Association of \nAssembly Managers, who initially expressed concerns that my bill would \nmake their members liable for the actions of their patrons, have \nendorsed my legislation because they realized that my bill was not \naimed at responsible party promoters.\n  I am confident that the overwhelming majority of promoters are \ndecent, law abiding people who are going to discourage drug use--or any \nother illegal activity--at their venues. But there are a few promoters \nout there who are taking steps to profit from drug activity at their \nevents. Some of these folks distribute drugs themselves or have their \nstaff distribute drugs, get kickbacks from drug sales, have thinly \nveiled drug messages on their promotional flyers, tell security to \nignore drug use or sales, or send patients who need medical attention \nto a hospital across town so that people won't link emergency room \nvisits with their club.\n  My bill has met fierce resistance from a number of groups who have \nnot felt the need to be constrained by the facts. Earlier this week the \nDrug Policy Alliance, a group whose goal is to end criminal penalties \nfor marijuana, sent out an alert to get people to call their Senators \nand Representatives to register their disapproval of my bill. The \nbackground information they provided on the issue discussed my bill \ninterchangeably with a House bill that I have never had any association \nwith, have never supported, and was not being discussed by the \nconference committee. Rather than quoting the legal standard in my \nbill--which makes clear that an individual would have to knowingly \nmaintain a place for the purpose of drug use--the Drug Policy Alliance \nchose to quote from the House bill that (1) has a legal standard--that \nthe individual ``knows or reasonably ought to know'' that a controlled \nsubstance will be used at their event--that is far lower than that in \nmy bill and (2) is specifically targeted at raves and promoters. What \nis more, on their web site, the Drug Policy Alliance makes the \noutlandish claim that:\n  The ``RAVE'' Act threatens free speech and musical expression while \nplacing at risk any hotel/motel owner, concern promoter, event \norganizer, nightclub owner or arena/stadium owner for the drug \nviolations of 3rd parties--real or alleged--even if the event promoter \nand/or property owner made a good-faith effort to keep their event \ndrug-free. It applies not just to electronic-music parties, but any \ntype of public gathering, including theatrical productions, rock \nconcerns, DJ nights at local bars, and potentially even political \nrallies. Moreover, it gives heightened powers and discretion to \nprosecutors, who may use it to target events they personally don't \nlike--such as Hip-Hop events and gay and lesbian fundraisers.\n  The law that my bill amends, 21 U.S.C. 856, has been on the book for \nnearly two decades and I am unaware of it ever being used to prosecute \na legitimate business. My bill would not change that fact.\n  The reason that I introduced this bill was not to ban dancing, kill \nthe ``rave scene'' or silence electronic music--all things of which I \nhave been accused. Although this legislation grew out of testimony I \nheard at a number of hearings about the problems identified at raves, \nthe criminal and civil penalties in the bill would also apply to people \nwho promoted any type of event for the purpose of drug use or \ndistribution. If rave promoters and sponsors operate such events as \nthey are so often advertised--as places for people to come dance in a \nsafe, drug-free environment--then they have nothing to fear from this \nlaw. In no way is this bill aimed at stifling any type of music or \nexpression--it is only trying to deter illicit drug use and protect \nkids.\n  Again, I am glad that this measure was included in the conference \nreport. I believe it is a fitting addition to a bill whose purpose is \nto protect children.\n  I am pleased that we were also able to include in the conference \nagreement section 10 of S. 152, the ``DNA Sexual Assault Justice Act of \n2003,'' a bill which I introduced with Senators Specter, Cantwell and \nClinton, along with 20 bipartisan cosponsors, in the Senate and that \nRepresentatives Green and Maloney introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives. This bill unanimously passed the Senate in the 107th \nCongress as S. 2513.\n  Section 611 would amend Title 18 to encourage federal prosecutors to \nbring ``John Doe/DNA indictments'' in federal sex crimes. Specifically, \nthe provision amends 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3282 to authorize explicitly \nfederal prosecutors to issue an indictment identifying an unknown \ndefendant by this DNA profile within the 5-year statute of limitations. \nIf the indictment is issued within the 5-year statute of limitations, \nthe statute is then tolled until the perpetrator is identified through \nhis or her DNA profile at a later date. The John\n\n[[Page S5154]]\n\nDoe/DNA indictment would permit prosecution at anytime once there was a \nDNA ``cold hit'' through the national DNA database system.\n  While the Justice Department is permitted currently to bring John \nDoe/DNA indictments under Rule 7 of the Federal Rules of Criminal \nProcedure, see, e.g., United States v. Fawcett, 115 F.2d 764, 767 (3d \nCir. 1940) (an indictment is an accusation against a person, not \nagainst a name, and hence the name is not of the substance of the \nindictment), they have not been frequently used in federal sex \noffenses. Accordingly, section 611 in no way should be construed, by \nnegative implication, as suggesting that a DNA profile is the only \nalternative method of identification in criminal indictments.\n\n  Joe Doe/DNA indictment strike the right balance between encouraging \nswift and efficient investigations, recognizing the durability and \ncredibility of DNA evidence and preventing an injustice if a cold hit \nhappens years after the crime if law enforcement did not promptly \nprocess forensic evidence. Providing incentives for law enforcement to \ntest quickly crime scene DNA from sexual assaults will also help \nidentify sex offenders (who are often recidivists) to permit their \nspeedy apprehension and prosecution.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, this conference report will do a lot to \nprotect our kids. I commend the Chairman of the Judiciary committee \nSenator Hatch for his efforts. Our ranking member Senator Leahy \ndedicated himself to passing a meaningful Amber Alert bill. The staffs \nof the Senate and House Judiciary Committees worked long hours to get \nus to this point today. I am especially grateful for the efforts of \nMakan Delrahim, Mike Volkov, Reed O'Connor and Jennifer Wagner of \nSenator Hatch's staff. Thanks also to Bruce Cohen, Ed Pagano, Julie \nKatzman, Steve Dettelbach, Tim Lynch, Tara Magnere and Jessica Berry of \nSenator Leahy's staff. The majority and minority staffs of the House \nJudiciary Committee worked equally hard to produce this conference \nreport. I am appreciative of the efforts of Phil Kiko, Steve Pinkos, \nWill Moschella, Jap Apperson, Sean McLaughlin, Beth Sokul and Katy \nCrooks of Congressman Sensenbrenner's staff. Also I would like to thank \nTed Kalo with Congressman Conyers and Bobby Vassar and Greg Barnes with \nCongressman Scott for their working during the conference committee.\n  Finally, and most importantly, I thank my Judiciary Committee staff \nfor their efforts on behalf of this conference report. Neil MacBride, \nEric Rosen, Tonya Robinson, Marcia Lee, Jonathan Meyer, Louisa Terrell \nand my very able law clerk Tracy Carney each ensured that many of my \nlegislative priorities were included in this conference report and in \nso doing they helped to ensure our kids will be safer tomorrow then \nthey are today. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the conference \nreport.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am deeply concerned about sentencing-\nrelated provisions included in the legislation now under consideration. \nThe bill which the Senate passed in February of this year addressed an \nimportant issue--on which their was unanimous bipartisan agreement--of \ncracking down on child pornography. While I am pleased that the bill \nbefore us retains the provisions of that bill, it also proposes \nwholesale, and in my view unwise, changes to procedures for judicial \ndepartures from the sentencing guidelines in criminal cases.\n  The bill before the Senate contains a provision requiring de novo \nreview of all sentencing departure cases appealed to the circuit \ncourts. This provision overturns, without there having been any State \ndebate on the issue, the interpretation of the ``due-deference'' \nstandard for review of district court sentencing decisions contained in \nthe Supreme Court's 1996 decision in Koon v. United States. In that \ncase, the Court said:\n\n       We agree that Congress was concerned about sentencing \n     disparities, but we are just as convinced that Congress did \n     not intend, by establishing limited appellate review, to vest \n     in appellate courts wide ranging authority over district \n     court sentencing decisions. Indeed, the text of section 3742 \n     manifests an intent that district courts retain much of their \n     traditional sentencing discretion. Section 3742(e), as \n     enacted in 1984, provided ``[t]he court of appeals shall give \n     due regard to the opportunity of the district court to judge \n     the credibility of the witnesses, and shall accept the \n     findings of fact of the district court unless they are \n     clearly erroneous.'' In 1988, Congress amended the statute to \n     impose the additional requirement that courts of appeals \n     ``give due deference to the district court's application of \n     the guidelines to the facts . . .\n\n  The bill also threatens to chill the use of judicial discretion to \ndepart from the sentencing guidelines by imposing burdensome reporting \nrequirements on judges who depart. Further, it requires the Attorney \nGeneral to provide both the House and Senate Judiciary Committees with \na report containing information--including the identity of the district \ncourt judge--on every downward departure in any case. The Judicial \nConference of the United States has said, in an April 3, 2003, letter \nto Senator Hatch:\n\n       We oppose the systematic dissemination outside the court \n     system of judge-identifying information in criminal case \n     files. . . . We urge Congress to meet its responsibility to \n     oversee the functioning of the criminal justice system \n     through the use of this and other information without \n     subjecting individual judges to the risk of unfair criticism \n     in isolated cases where the record may not fully reflect the \n     events leading up to and informing the judge's decision in a \n     particular case.\n\n  Surely we should hear from the Judicial Conference which has some \nserious concerns about the impact of this provision on judicial \ndecisionmaking.\n  The bill could also have the effect of dramatically altering the \ncomposition of the U.S. Sentencing Commission. The Sentencing \nCommission consists of seven members. Under current law, at least three \nof it members must be Federal judges selected by the President from a \nlist of six judges submitted by the Judicial Conference. By removing \nthe requirement that judges hold at least three of the seven seats on \nthe Sentencing Commission, the bill threatens the integrity and future \ngood judgement of the Commission. I do not believe that this is a wise \nchange because judges have a unique perspective on the issue of \ncriminal sentencing.\n  These are just a few among the many troublesome provisions that were \ninserted into a piece of legislation after its passage in the Senate \nhad enjoyed broad bipartisan support. The Senate has not had the \nopportunity to consider the potential impact of these provisions \nthrough either hearings or floor debate. Mr. President, I am \ndisappointed that they are now being considered in a conference report \nwhich we will not have opportunity to amend.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the CARE Act \nwhich is an important piece of legislation that was passed yesterday. \nThe CARE Act will help thousands of charitable organizations across the \ncountry perform the important work that they do every day on behalf of \npeople and causes that need and deserve our assistance.\n  Every day in America, men and women and sometimes children--working \nand volunteering under the auspices of countless charitable \norganizations--feed hungry children, provide hot meals and home visits \nto senior citizens, clean our parks and lakes and rivers, care for \nneglected and abused animals, and provide clothes, food, and shelter \nfor the homeless and mentally ill. These activities take place each day \ndespite great costs to workers and volunteers in terms of time and \nresources.\n  I would daresay that were this bill not to become law, volunteers and \ncharitable organizations around the country would be no less committed \nand dedicated to their work. But because we have passed this \nlegislation and because this legislation or a reasonable facsimile \nthereof will hopefully become law in the near future, it is my belief \nthat the work performed by charitable organizations and volunteers \nthroughout America will be supported, strengthened, and expanded upon \nfor years to come.\n  One of the most important provisions in this bill will allow those \nwho do not itemize their deductions to receive a tax deduction for \ntheir charitable contributions. This deduction will benefit millions of \nlow and middle-income families who are already making significant \ncharitable contributions each year, and it will encourage even more \ncharitable contributions in future years.\n  This bill also authorizes preferential treatment of gifts made from \nIRAs. This provision is important to many\n\n[[Page S5155]]\n\nmajor charities and universities throughout our Nation.\n  I am also very pleased that the CARE Act restores funding for the \nSocial Services Block Grant. The social services block grant pays for \ncritical services for millions of children, families, seniors, and \npersons with disabilities each year. Congress has been ignoring its \nresponsibility to those in need for too long. Since 1995, annual \nfunding for SSBG has been cut by more than $1 billion, from a high of \n$2.8 billion to the current level of $1.7 billion. This bill will \nrestore the amount to $2.8 billion in the next fiscal year which is \nespecially important now since we are seeing States across America cut \nand sometimes even eliminate the very services that SSBG was enacted to \nsupport because of the budget deficits they are currently faced with.\n  I do not believe it is an exaggeration to say that, if you want to \nknow what America is all about, visit one of America's charities. There \nyou will find the American spirit burning brightly. It is a spirit of \ncompassion, selflessness, equal opportunity, and initiative. Those are \nthe values that have made our Nation great. Those are the values that \nare nurtured each and every day in these organizations. And those are \nthe values that will be given new strength and potency by this \nlegislation.\n  I commend those of our colleagues who have worked hard to bring this \nlegislation to the floor today. And I look forward to continuing to \nwork with them in the days to come to enact it into law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of the \ndistinguished Senator from California. There is no question she and the \ndistinguished Senator from Texas have been major movers of this \nlegislation and she has been a strong supporter of the bill that this \nis attached to that does so much for children. I personally would have \npreferred to have just passed AMBER alert, but I am overjoyed we have \nthis child legislation.\n  By the way, the judges did not have to report to the Congress, they \nonly have to report to the Sentencing Commission, which is made up in \npart of judges. I wanted to correct that in the Record because I know \nmy colleague will appreciate knowing that.\n  One of the most startling statistics is to find almost 4 million kids \nout of the 23 million children in our country between 12 and 18 have \nbeen abused. It is unbelievable. A study conducted by the Bureau of \nPrisons found that 76 percent of defendants convicted of child \npornography or of traveling in interstate commerce to engage in sex \nwith minors, admitted to undetected sex crimes, with an average of 30.5 \nvictims; on average, 76 percent of people convicted of child \npornography or of traveling in interstate commerce to engage in sex \nwith minors, admitted to undetected--in other words, crimes that nobody \nknows about--sex crimes with minors with an average of 30.5 additional \nchild sex victims. Every one of them.\n  It is time we get tough. This bill is a tough bill, as it should be. \nThis bill will help solve some of the problems of society, as it \nshould.\n  I have to confess, I have been underwhelmed by some of the arguments, \nunderwhelmed by some of the arguments in this area. All I can say is \nthat we do not do away with downward departures; they better be the \ndepartures allowed by the Sentencing Commission and not just conjured \nout of thin air by the judges.\n  I have to also confess the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts \nis continuously bringing up Justice Rehnquist and Justice Kennedy. \nTheir letters were to the Feeney amendment which has been drastically \nmodified by the Hatch-Sensenbrenner-Graham amendment. That argument, in \nand of itself, does not stand or hold water. I will not say that it is \na misrepresentation, as has been indicated on the other side, but I \nwill say it does not hold any water.\n  Now, there have been some complaints from some that the conference \ncommittee refused to pass a stand-alone AMBER alert and PROTECT Act \nbill. They complain that the conference bill contains measures that \nthey had not considered and are opposed to including in the conference \nbill. We have a wonderful system of government in this country. Our \nsystem divides the Congress into two coequal branches of Government \nbecause that is the case. It is not unusual the legislation covering \nthe same topics pass both Houses with language and subject matter that \nis not entirely the same. Just because the two legislative bodies do \nnot agree on each and every provision, we do not simply walk away from \nthe legislation. Instead, we convene a conference between the two \nlegislative bodies in an attempt to harmonize the legislation.\n  Sometimes the conference between the two bodies reaches agreement, \nand sometimes the two bodies do not. In this case, we did. Both bills--\nthe House bill and the Senate bill--dealt with crimes that victimized \nchildren. However, the two bills were not identical in every respect. \nThe House bill included significant provisions that add stiff \npunishments to those who actually victimize children, as well as other \npunishment-related issues.\n  The House passed a measure that would have provided for a study on \nvolunteer background checks, but we from the Senate side insisted that \nthe bill go further, to include a pilot program so the volunteers would \nhave access immediately. A majority of the conferees, after considering \nall of the measures, have agreed to this conference bill.\n  While all may not agree to each and every specific compromise made by \nthe conference, this bicameral system has succeeded in compiling and \nproducing comprehensive child protective legislation. In fact, it would \nbe safe to say that some of the 400 Members of the House who voted for \nthis today, who voted for this conference bill, agreed to each and \nevery provision in the conference bill, but as with every piece of \nlegislation, overall they voted to pass it.\n  That is how our system works. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor \nof this measure because this measure is a measure that can help to put \nan end to some of these crimes against children that are so affecting \nour society.\n  I want to pay tribute to John Walsh, to the people who run the Boys \nand Girls Clubs of America, and my friend, Wintley Phipps, who runs the \nDream Academy to help children of prisoners who have family members in \nprison; to bring mentors and tutors into their lives to help them come \ninto the digital world and brings mentors and teachers to help them \nunderstand computers, to help them understand there is a better way. \nMany of these kids, 65 to 85 percent of them, depending on the \njurisdiction, would go to crime themselves.\n  I want to compliment those groups I mentioned and many others I wish \nI had time to mention, who are fighting these battles on the front \nlines against these child molesters, pornographers, rapists, et cetera. \nThey deserve our respect and they deserve this legislation.\n  We all deserve this legislation. As a father of 6 children, and a \ngrandfather of 21, I have to tell you I want all my kids and \ngrandchildren protected. My kids are now adults so hopefully they can \nprotect themselves, but my grandchildren by and large are not. I am \nworried about children all over this country. When you think the \naverage convicted child molester has personally abused 30.5 kids, it is \ntime to get tough on them. Frankly, it is time to quit playing games \nwith the sentencing guidelines in this area.\n  I don't see why judges should be offended or concerned if we have \nthem review decisions on guidelines, downward departures by the lower \ncourt, especially when those departures are unjustified, unwarranted, \nand in many cases ridiculous.\n  Let me address something else that has me deeply troubled about what \nI have heard on the floor about the main complaint by our friends on \nthe other side--some of our friends on the other side; very few, I \nbelieve. I believe the vast majority of Democrats are for this bill. I \nhope they will vote for it. I will be shocked if they do not.\n  But the main complaint by Democrats appears to be they do not like \nthis compromise that provides for meaningful review of the sentencing \nguideline provisions. Why anyone would oppose provisions that simply \ngrant appellate courts the opportunity to give meaningful review to \ncriminal sentences is just simply beyond me. The House had Sentencing \nCommission\n\n[[Page S5156]]\n\nhearings. The Senate has had Sentencing Commission hearings--regardless \nof the representations by my distinguished friend from Massachusetts. \nWe had extensive hearings back in the year 2000. We all know a lot \nabout this.\n  This measure, through compromise, has taken steps to address a \ngrowing problem both bodies identified in guideline sentencing.\n  But I am even more troubled by remarks I have heard or read from the \nAssociated Press, where Republicans were accused of:\n\n     . . . kidnapping the AMBER alert bill in an attempt to \n     achieve partisan and wholly unrelated goals, getting judicial \n     sentencing guidelines.\n\n  Understand, those who support this bill want to strengthen \npunishments. That is what the supporters have voted for; that is what \nthe supporters who plan to vote for this bill want.\n  However, the insinuation that supporters of this bill have kidnapped \nanything is offensive. I am appalled that was said in public and in the \npress.\n  The AMBER alert provision is named after Amber Hagerman, from \nArlington, TX. This child was kidnapped and murdered. This tragic crime \nhas led to AMBER alerts in various States and is one of the provisions \nincluded in this bill for nationwide implementation. To invoke her name \nin connection with kidnapping is simply offensive. I suspect that when \nher family reads about that, instead of feeling proud about a law that \nis named in Amber's memory, this kidnapping reference in connection \nwith her name will only prove more hurtful.\n  Let's put these unwarranted snipes--and that is what they are--aside. \nLet's vote on this bill and send it to the President immediately. It \nwill be signed by Easter and those criminals who even think of stepping \noutside the law with respect to any of these offences will know the \nfull weight of the law will be brought down to bear on them.\n  Mr. President, I again urge my colleagues to pass this bipartisan \ncompromise agreement. The House of Representatives passed this \nlegislation this morning by a vote of 400-25. I am pleased we will act \ntonight by voting on this critical measure to protect our children.\n  This bill enjoys widespread support, and the need for the measures \ncontained in the bill is well demonstrated. Law enforcement \norganizations around the country have expressed their support for this \nbill. Victims' families and citizens alike have done so. Earlier I read \na letter we received from Elizabeth Smart's family in support of the \nbill. Even citizens from Senator Kennedy's home State of \nMassachusetts--such as Maggie Bish whose daughter Molly, was abducted \nin 2000 and hasn't been found--have expressed their support for this \nlegislation.\n  I now urge my colleagues to vote in support of this bill and forward \nit to the President for his signature as soon as possible.\n  I know that some on the other side do not agree with each and every \nmeasure contained within it. I suspect that there are those among the \n400 Members in the House who voted for this conference bill did not \nagree with each and every provision. They might not have agreed with \nthe specifics of Representative Feeney's amendment. However, overall, \nthey believed that the conference bill includes child protection \nmeasures that will ultimately benefit those in our society who are most \nvulnerable.\n\n  The fact is, this legislation has many provisions that will help \nprevent crimes against children, as well as help keep those who prey \nupon the innocent out of our society and away from our children. I am \nnot going to list all of them again here. But I note that provisions \nsuch as the AMBER Alert and Code Adam systems will allow the public to \nassist law enforcement in the timely search for and safe return of \nchild victims. Stronger penalties for pedophiles and child molesters, \nand especially recidivists, will ensure that those who victimize \nchildren will stay behind bars where they deserve to be. Enhanced \ninvestigative tools will enable law enforcement officers to prosecute \nthose who exploit children. The sentencing reforms will prevent \nsentencing abuses in cases involving child and sexual crimes where too \noften we have seen lenient sentences imposed. They will also ensure \nthat appellate courts can adequately review sentences by district \ncourts.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to take this opportunity to \nrecognize the tireless work of the dedicated staff members on both \nsides of the aisle whose work around the clock made this legislation \npossible. First, on my staff, I want to specifically commend my former \nstaffer Wan Kim, who recently re-joined the United States Attorney's \nOffice for the District of Columbia as an Assistant United States \nAttorney. He, along with Mike Volkov, Reed O'Conner, Jennifer Wagner, \nTed Lehman, Dabney Friedrich, and my Chief Counsel and Staff Director \nMakan Delrahim, all poured their hearts into this legislation. On \nSenator Leahy's staff, I want to thank Julie Katzman, Steve Dettelbach, \nTara Magner, Jessica Berry, and Ed Pagano. On Senator Biden's staff, \nNeil McBride, Tonya Robinson and Eric Rosen. On Senator Session's \nstaff, William Smith and Andrea Sanders. On Senator Grassley's staff, \nChad Groover. On Senator Graham's staff, James Galyean. On Chairman \nSensenbrenner's staff, I want to commend Will Moschella, Phil Kiko, Jay \nApperson, Beth Sokul, Katy Crooks and Sean McLaughlin for their hard \nwork and dedication.\n  It is time for us to vote.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Order Of Procedure\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote with \nrespect to this conference report occur at 6:40 today, and that \nimmediately following that vote, the Senate proceed to executive \nsession and a vote on calendar No. 60, the nomination of Ross Swimmer, \nto be Special Trustee for American Indians; further, I ask consent that \nfollowing that vote, the President be immediately notified of the \nSenate's action, and the Senate then resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have no objection on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to executive session to consider Calendar No. 60, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Ross Owen Swimmer, of \nOklahoma, to be Special Trustee, Office of Special Trustee for American \nIndians, Department of the Interior.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the Senate is about to vote on the \nnomination of Ross Swimmer for Special Trustee for American Indians.\n  Trust reform is a critical issue for the Native American community \nnationwide, and the Special Trustee is the official responsible for \ndirecting the Department of the Interior's efforts to correct this \nlongstanding problem and provide sound fiduciary services to trust \nbeneficiaries. This nomination and vote will affect the prospects for \nsuccess of this critical reform effort.\n  I think it is extremely important for the full Senate to reflect on \ntwo central facts about the trust debate as they consider Mr. Swimmer's \nnomination. First, for generations, residents of Indian Country have \nbeen victimized by persistent mismanagement of trust assets by the \nFederal Government. Far too many families for far too long have been \ndenied trust assets to which they are entitled because of this \nmismanagement. And this situation has adversely affected their quality \nof life.\n  Second, frustration with the Federal Government's failure to come to \ngrips with this problem has not only led to litigation (Cobell v. \nNorton), it has also solidified the tribes' determination to contribute \nto the development of a workable solution to the problem. Effective \ntrust management reform will remain an elusive goal if the tribes are \nnot full participants in this exercise.\n  The tribes understand that the Special Trustee for American Indians \nmust be their ally in the search for a solution, not an independent \nactor balancing other agendas. In the past months, leaders of South \nDakota's nine tribes have expressed to me their concerns about the \nadministration's desire to entrust Ross Swimmer with this influential \nrole.\n  The bottom line is that trust beneficiaries deserve a Special Trustee \nin whom they can have confidence to restore sound accounting principles \nand integrity to the Federal Government's management of trust assets. \nThere is a critical need to elevate the Indian trust issue to higher \nlevels within the administration. The current state of Indian trust \nmanagement is a debacle and has come to be known as the ``Enron of \nIndian Country.'' We need an individual who is able to tackle this \nissue with the interested stakeholders. I agree with South Dakota \ntribal leaders and the Great Plains Tribal Chairmen's Association that \nRoss Swimmer is not the right man for this job.\n  Ross Swimmer has had many responsibilities at the Department of the \nInterior. But, most significantly for this debate, over the past \nseveral years, he has been an integral part of the Department's \ndisappointing effort to impose a trust management solution conceived by \nFederal bureaucrats without the full engagement and consent of Native \nAmerican leadership. It is time to make sure that trust beneficiaries \nreceive the assets to which they are entitled. We must not allow the \nbureaucracy to ``run out the clock'' in the hope that the courts will \n``save the day'' by absolving the Government of its trust \nresponsibility.\n  To provide some perspective, the 16 tribes of the Great Plains in \nSouth Dakota, North Dakota and Nebraska own 10 million acres of land \nheld in trust by the U.S. Government. These lands represent over one-\nthird of the tribal trust assets. They have huge interests at stake in \nensuring that the Special Trustee is committed to a fair resolution of \nthe trust assets management controversy.\n  I value and respect the judgment of South Dakota tribal people, their \ntribal leadership and the Great Plains Tribal Chairmen's Association on \nthis important issue. Therefore, I cannot support Mr. Swimmer's \nnomination as Special Trustee for American Indians.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, today I want to speak on the nomination \nof my good friend Ross Swimmer to be Special Trustee for American \nIndians. Back in 1994 Congress passed the American Indian Trust Fund \nManagement Reform Act, which created the position of Special Trustee \nfor American Indians. This position was created to address years of \ntrust fund mismanagement. Special Trustee is a very challenging \nresponsibility not to mention a thankless job. The President could not \nhave picked a better person for this job. Because of Ross's extensive \nbackground in Indian law, banking, and finance, I believe that Ross \nSwimmer can begin to resolve this issue.\n  I have had the pleasure of knowing, respecting, and working with Ross \nfor more than 22 years. He has served Indian country in both the public \nand private sectors where he has served in numerous leadership \ncapacities. For 10 years, Ross was Principal Chief of the Cherokee \nNation, the second largest Indian tribe in the United States. He served \n3 years as Assistant Secretary at the Department of Interior, where he \nmanaged a $1.5 billion budget; 15,000 employees, and the oversight and \nmanagement of policy concerning Indian affairs.\n  Ross was president of the First National Bank in Tahlequah and \nchairman of the First State Bank in Hulbert, OK. He was president of a \nmultimillion-dollar manufacturing company, owned by the Cherokee \nNation, which is involved in the aerospace, defense, and \ntelecommunications industries. Ross's legal experience includes General \nCounsel to the Cherokee Nation, associate and partner in the Oklahoma \nCity firm of Hanson, Fisher, Tumilty, Peterson and Tompkins. Because of \nRoss's background with Indian law, he established the Indian law \ndivision for the law firm of Hall, Estill, Hardwick, Gable, Golden and \nNelson.\n  Ross had the distinction of serving as cochairman of the Presidential \nCommission on Reservation Economies; chairman of the Energy Resources \nTribes; and chairman of the White House Conference on Indian Education. \nHe was also named Outstanding American Indian Leader in 1985 and was \ninducted into the Tulsa Historical Society's Hall of Fame.\n  I am delighted to be here to recommend my friend Ross Swimmer, to be \nSpecial Trustee for American Indians. I have confidence in Ross that he \nwill work with the Indian community toward resolving the issues \nsurrounding the Indian trust. As you can see by Ross's career, he has \nthe dedication, experience, and qualifications as well as the \nunderstanding of Indian law necessary to address this complex, \nmonumental task.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Ross Owen Swimmer, of Oklahoma, to be Special Trustee, Office of \nSpecial Trustee for American Indians?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

We have been proud of each \nand every soldier and the work they are performing under very difficult \ncircumstances, but they are performing beautifully, exceptionally, as \nexpected. We are very proud of their work, the Active Forces as well as \nthe Reserve Forces.\n  We know we have done many things right in Iraq. We know there are \nsome weaknesses we will address. The military is always the first to \nsay--which is why I enjoy working so closely with them--this is what we \ndid right and we are proud of it and we are going to do it better. But \nwe don't mind admitting there are some things we could do better next \ntime. And lessons learned is something that our military goes through \nafter each and every exercise, which is why they are so good, and why \nwe get better and better and better. I am very proud of that kind of \napproach.\n  So as we watch this victory unfold in Iraq, with every toppling of \nevery statue, with the destruction of every image of Saddam Hussein, we \ncan begin to build a new image, a new vision for the people of Iraq, \none they so richly deserve and have waited decades and decades to \narrive. And it is our pride and our great joy that America and Britain \nand our allies are helping to bring about this vision, as we speak \ntonight on the floor of the Senate.\n\n  We have been involved today in many other important issues, but, of \ncourse, there is no issue more important to this Senate or to this \nCongress or to this country right now, or to the world, than what is \nunfolding in Iraq as we speak.\n  I want to just make a note about one specific aspect of the \npostbattle plan for Iraq. I am going to be working closely with many \ncommittees in the Senate to help to fashion that plan, which, of \ncourse, will be broad and comprehensive. Hopefully, we will have \nbipartisan support.\n  The President will submit many of his own ideas. The international \ncommunity will contribute. I, for one, have felt very strongly that our \nmilitary should continue to lead that effort. While they are soldiers \nfirst, and soldiers always, they have tremendous skills and abilities \nwhen it comes to postconflict periods, when the battle is actually over \nand the bullets stop flying and the construction and reconstruction \nbegins. Not that our military would want to be engaged over a long \nperiod of time, but there are, most certainly, skills that our military \ncan bring to establishing the, at least, early stages of that civil \naffairs network and framework.\n  So I am pleased to see the House and the Senate moving back to the \nadministration's original position, which was to allow our military to \nlead that effort and the Pentagon, as opposed to the State Department; \nmost certainly for the U.S. to continue that leadership position as \nopposed to the U.N. The U.N. should be a partner, the international \ncommunity should be a partner, but the U.S. should lead that effort.\n  I think that is the way we are moving, and I most certainly support \nthat. And I could venture to say, without seeing any polls, I know the \npeople of Louisiana would want that kind of arrangement to be made.\n  In one part of the post battle plan for Iraq, the reconstruction \nplan, I am hoping that we would strongly consider--and I will be filing \na resolution in just a few days, as soon as we can get some of the \ndetails worked out, and, hopefully, file it in a bipartisan way--a \nresolution that would suggest that we help the people of Iraq establish \na permanent trust fund for their long-term economic development, a \ntrust fund based on the revenues received from the production of oil \nand gas.\n  The reason I want to spend just a few minutes speaking about this \nidea is there have been several articles written. We have done, in our \noffice, some research on this subject. And I have had a great deal of \nexperience with the people of Louisiana with this concept. And we are \nnot the only State that has created trust funds from the oil and gas \nreserves.\n  Just like Iraq, although we are not a nation, Louisiana produces a \ntremendous amount of oil and gas and has some of the richest reserves \nin the United States.\n  Texas is also a State that has tremendous resources and established, \nyears ago, a permanent trust fund. The proceeds of that fund are \ndirected to the support and maintenance and the strengthening of their \ntwo major universities in Texas. And the billions of dollars that have \nflowed into this trust fund have provided educational opportunities and \nresearch opportunities that have led to jobs creation and economic \nstrength in the State of Texas.\n  The State of Alaska probably has the largest of such a trust fund, \ncalled the Permanent Alaska Trust Fund. Not only have those resources \nbeen used to help Alaska strengthen its economy, but there are also, \nliterally, rebates that go from that fund to each individual citizen of \nAlaska. There are only 500,000 people, but the fund has worked in many \nwonderful ways.\n\n  I will suggest through this resolution that we in the Congress lay \nout an idea to create such a trust fund for the people of Iraq, run by \nthe people of Iraq, to make sure of that diminishing resource, although \nthey supply now 6 percent of the world's oil, and while I am convinced \nthat our technology working with them will find more oil, and \npotentially gas reserves, that is a diminishing resource, just as in \nLouisiana\n\n[[Page S5159]]\n\nand Texas and Alaska. And beginning a plan now for that money to be \nused in appropriate ways for education, for health care, for economic \ndevelopment, for improving the infrastructure in Iraq and setting up in \na way that protects those moneys so they can be used for the people of \nIraq would serve as a great foundation or at least a significant part \nof a plan for reconstruction for Iraq.\n  In conclusion, the people are talented and industrious, the \ninfrastructure is there to be built on. With a few good and solid ideas \nlike carving out a trust fund with specific funding from their oil and \ngas reserves, the people of Iraq can enjoy those reserves and benefit \nfrom them, not just in the next year but in many years to come.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/10/senate-section/article/S5159-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5159-S5161]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE BUDGET CONFERENCE AND OUR ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wanted to make a comment about what I \nhave been reading this afternoon and hearing most of today about a \nprocess by which the budget conference is going to cobble together a \ncompromise and bring it to the House and the Senate, with the prospect \nof having the Senate have its arms tied behind its back procedurally in \norder to accomplish a very large tax cut.\n  Now, what I do not understand is this: We have an economy that \neveryone understands is in some significant trouble. We have a fiscal \npolicy that does not add up.\n  About 2 years ago, the President said he wanted a fiscal policy with \na very large tax cut, $1.7 trillion. Some of us said: Well, what we \nought to do is be a little careful and be a little bit conservative \nbecause we don't know what is going to happen in the future.\n  The President said: No. What we have are budget surpluses as far as \nthe eye can see, and we ought to give that money back.\n  I said: I believe we ought to provide some tax cuts, but maybe we \nought to be a little bit conservative. Who knows what is going to \nhappen in the future.\n  Well, the President won the day on that, and we had the tax cuts. And \nthen we ran into a couple of problems: One, a recession; two, the \nterrorist attack of 9/11, which was devastating both with respect to \nloss of life and also this country's economy.\n  Then we had the largest corporate scandals in this country's history. \nWe had a pancaking or a flattening of the stock market, a collapsing of \nthe technology bubble in the stock market.\n  All of these things came to the same intersection at the same time \nand have caused enormous problems for this country's economy.\n  Some people say none of that matters. The medicine is still the same \nno matter the circumstance. I submit, when your economy is sluggish, \nand people are concerned about the future, they don't have the kind of \nconfidence you would expect about the future--confidence is, after all, \nwhat allows this economy to grow--that you ought to take a look at the \nfiscal policy and see if you can construct a policy that adds up.\n  Let me describe where we are today.\n  Two years ago, we had projections that we would have budget surpluses \nfor the next decade--every year, big budget surpluses.\n  Well, 2 years later, guess where we are. This year, we have a \nprojected $460 billion budget deficit. Under this fiscal policy, this \nGovernment spends almost $1.5 billion a day more than it takes in--\nevery single day, 7 days a week. People say it does not matter.\n  We send our sons and daughters off to war. And those brave souls have \nperformed in a way that make all of us proud. But are we saying to \nthem: ``Go fight this war and come back and we'll allow you to bear the \nburden of the costs. We will allow you to bear the burden of paying off \nthe debt''. That is what this fiscal policy does.\n\n  Some will say the budget deficit is only $300 billion. That is not \ntrue. One hundred sixty billion is the Social Security trust fund. That \nbelongs in the trust fund. You can't use that to counter the deficit. \nOur budget deficit right now is $460 billion.\n  What is the solution? The majority party says the solution is to \ncobble together a budget that looks like Disneyland to me in its \nconstruct, that says what we ought to do is have larger and larger tax \ncuts. Why? Because it is a growth policy.\n  The only thing that is growing in this economy is the Federal debt. \nThe budget that left the Senate--I will bet not many Senators know \nthis--which had the lower tax cut number in it, $350 billion over the \nnext 10 years, proposed on page 6 that at the end of 10 years we would \nhave a $12.9 trillion debt. I wonder if people know that.\n  Will it grow the economy? No, it is not going to grow the economy. \nThis fiscal policy is going to grow the Federal debt, from just over $6 \ntrillion to nearly $12 trillion in 10 years.\n  I come from a small town, but we know how to add and subtract. That \nisn't progress, not for this country.\n  What is the construction of all of this? The construction is to say, \nit is a troubled world, we need more defense spending, a lot more. Most \nMembers have decided, yes, we should do that; it is a troubled world; \nwe are threatened by terrorists; we need more spending to protect the \nhomeland--homeland defense it is called, and most Members say yes; I \nsay yes to both of those. So higher homeland security and defense \nspending, and then very large tax cuts, and then saying: Let's shrink \nthe domestic discretionary spending; let's decide to shrink that.\n  I was at one hearing today--one example of dozens--on shrinking \nspending: Let's cut spending for young American Indians going to tribal \ncolleges to try to better themselves through education. That is what \nthey propose. We will shrink spending for that. Does that make any \nsense?\n  I told a story this morning about a young woman named Loretta--\nsomeone I have been privileged to know. She grew up in a pretty \ntroubled circumstance. She was shy, stuttered, had a baby out of \nwedlock, got into lots of trouble. She found her way back. This young \nwoman went to a tribal college on an Indian reservation, got an \neducation, had the support of an extended family for childcare and the \nkinds of things you can get support for when you are going to a tribal \ncollege on the Indian reservation. That young woman who started out in \nsuch a difficult situation is now called Doctor. She went to school. \nThey called her a savage. She had a very troubled beginning. But now \nshe is a Ph.D.\n  Do tribal colleges work? Does it matter? Does it make sense? Is it an \ninvestment in life that makes sense? The answer is yes.\n  So if the construct of the fiscal policy says, let's add for defense \nand homeland security, and we all agree to that, and let's have very \nbig tax cuts, and then let's cut programs such as tribal colleges that \ngive some of those young American Indians an opportunity, if that is \nthe construct, I say this country is not investing smartly. I would \nmuch sooner provide an opportunity for those young kids to go to \ncollege than provide a tax cut, on average, which will be $80,000 a \nyear for the American who earns $1 million a year in income. At a time \nwhen we have a $460 billion annual budget deficit--yes, it is that \nunless you take the Social Security trust fund and use it as it has \nbeen misused--we say we will just take this out of the hide of some \nprograms that really help people. I don't think that makes any sense. \nBy the way, we will have to do that in order to pay for very large tax \ncuts. That doesn't make sense either.\n\n  I don't know what happened to conservatism. I thought being \nconservative meant that you did not want to see this runup in Federal \nbudget deficits, you did not want to end up in 2013 with a $1.9 \ntrillion Federal debt. Yet that is where we are headed. That is on page \n6 of the budget report that enough of my colleagues voted for to send \nit on to the House. Coming back, it will be worse. Coming back, I \nguarantee you that on whatever page they list public indebtedness, it \nwill be higher than $11.9 trillion, if they come out with the House \nnumber rather than the Senate number on tax cuts.\n  I don't understand the rationale. We have Nobel laureates, some of \nthe top business men and women, we have almost anybody who looks at \nthis fiscal policy through a lens other than the rose-colored lens of \npolitics saying: This is crazy. This doesn't make any sense. It doesn't \nadd up. This fiscal policy is going to steer this country in a way that \nwill prevent us from having economic growth.\n\n[[Page S5160]]\n\n  It is interesting to me that this fiscal policy is always described \nas the growth plan. Even the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office \nsays this is not going to grow the economy. The only thing it is going \nto grow is the Federal debt, doubling it from $6 trillion to $12 \ntrillion. I don't understand. And perhaps some will say: You don't \nunderstand; this is a new approach. But it is really not even new. \nTwenty years ago we did this. Then the fiscal policy was to say, let's \ndouble defense spending and cut taxes, and somehow it would produce \nmore revenue and add up.\n  The fact is, we ended up on the road to $6 trillion in additional \nindebtedness. Then, through a series of good fortunes, this country saw \nits economy begin to pick up steam once again, and we saw a whole \nseries of things happen, with massive creation of new jobs and growth. \nThen we began finally to create budget surpluses.\n  At that moment, very quickly eyes began to water; everybody began to \nsalivate over the surpluses: What can we do with the budget surpluses? \nThe President said: It is their money; it belongs to the American \npeople--he is right about that--so the surplus should go back to the \nAmerican people.\n  But some said: Let's not lock in place a tax cut so large for 10 \nyears that it would put our economy at risk.\n  Never mind, he said.\n  So now the question: What belongs to the people? The debt? At $1.5 \nbillion a day, every single day, $1.5 billion more that we spend every \nday than we take in.\n  It is unfathomable that we have seen this juxtaposition in American \npolitics that those who say they are conservatives don't worry about \nthe debt. But, of course, the evidence is quite to the contrary.\n  I am perhaps limited by having taught economics for a couple of \nyears. I always point out that although I taught economics, I have been \nable to overcome that experience. The fact is, the study of economics \nis not a science; it is an art. But we know enough about how this \neconomy works to understand it works with respect to people's \nconfidence. If the American people are confident about the future with \nrespect to this economy, they do the things that manifest that \nconfidence, and that is the expansion side of the business cycle. They \nbuy a home, take a trip, buy a car, make a purchase, and you have the \nexpansion side of the American business cycle. If, however, they are \nnot confident about the future, they do exactly the opposite: They \ndecide not to make the purchase; they postpone the trip; they don't buy \nthe car; they don't buy the house. And that is the contraction side of \nthe business cycle.\n  It is all about confidence. The question raised by Nobel laureates \nand many others, and op-ed pieces, in fact, in the last day or so by a \nbipartisan group of the most distinguished American thinkers, in my \njudgment, is: How can the American people be confident about the future \nof this economy until and unless they see a Congress willing to make \nthe tough choices to put this economy back on track and make these \nbudgets add up. The easiest political lifting in America, the easiest \nlifting for American politicians, is to say: Let me support tax cuts. A \nmore difficult proposition for a politician is to say: Let us make \ntough choices to make sure our budgets add up.\n\n  There is no way that what we are going to be confronted with tomorrow \nmorning adds up. The American people know it, politicians know it, \neconomists know it, and it is going to erode confidence in this country \nthat will, in my judgment, stall and stutter the recovery that we \nexpect, need, and deserve.\n  I will have more to say tomorrow on this subject. It is a \ndisappointing day to know what has happened that will bring the budget \nto the floor tomorrow in such a state that we will hardly give the \nAmerican people confidence about our country's future.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                         JUDGE MARY BEATTY MUSE\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, on April 29, 2003, Judge Mary Beatty Muse \nof Boston will receive the Lifetime Achievement Award from Boston \nCollege Law School which she attended 50 years ago. Judge Muse's \nprofessional and personal achievements are extraordinary, and Boston \nCollege Law School does well to honor this admirable woman whose life \nstands as a reminder of honor, courage, commitment, duty to profession, \nand love of family. It has been my good fortune to know Mary Muse over \nthe past several years, as three of her grandsons and my own boys have \nbecome close friends and our families have shared many times together. \nLet me provide a brief summary of Judge Muse's considerable \nachievements and note several of the commendations she has received \nbecause of her professional and personal integrity.\n  Mary Beatty Muse was born on July 12, 1920, in Boston, the daughter \nof Irish immigrants. In 1937, she graduated from the Boston Latin \nSchool for Girls and then attended Emmanuel College, graduating in \n1941.\n  Soon after Pearl Harbor, she enlisted in the Navy and joined the \nfirst class of the newly formed WAVES. She served in the Navy for 3 \nyears as an intelligence and communications officer. Lieutenant Muse \nwas cited for numerous achievements during World War II, as she and \nthis newly formed group of woman sailors served valiantly during that \nconflict.\n  Following the war, she attended Boston College Law School on the GI \nbill, graduating as one of three women in a class of approximately 160 \nstudents. That law school, like so many other of our institutions, has \nseen much progress over the past several decades. In noting this \nprogress, it is imperative we recall and honor the people who were in \nthe vanguard of this movement of women into our professions. The \ncircumstances back in 1950 were dramatically different for women. It \ntook unusual courage, perseverance, and fortitude to achieve as Mary \nMuse did.\n  From the early days in her professional career, Judge Muse served as \na role model to a generation of younger women, particularly in the \nBoston area. In her law practice and on the bench, she inspired \ncountless women by her words and actions. Over time, the disparity that \nwas so palpable and obvious when she started her career in law has been \nerased. Only now because of women like Judge Muse can it be said that \nour educational institutions are open to all, regardless of gender. \nThis past year, Boston College Law School had a graduating class of 267 \nstudents, 123, or 46 percent, of whom were women, a vastly different \nsetting from the early fifties when Mary Muse and her two female \nclassmates accounted for less than 2 percent of their class.\n  In 1983, Mary B. Muse was appointed a justice of the Massachusetts \nTrial Court. On the bench, she was known for her firm but kindly \nmanner, as she treated all participants--attorneys, court personnel, \nand parties--with the respect and courtesy that should be the hallmarks \nof our justice system. She remained on the bench until her mandated \nretirement at the age of 70. To say that she ``retired'' though is to \nmisspeak. Judge Muse is now almost 84 and has not begun to slow down in \nher daily chores or professional activities. Since she left the court, \nshe has been active in numerous and varied undertakings. With an \nunswerving sense of commitment and an untiring energy, she has served \nas a member of the Supreme Judicial Court Rules Committee; a member of \nthe board of governors for the Massachusetts Academy of Trial Lawyers; \nan officer of the Massachusetts Association of Woman Lawyers; vice \npresident of the Massachusetts Judges Conference; a member of the board \nof directors of the Massachusetts Catholic Lawyers Guild; an elected \nofficial in Brookline, MA; a member of the board of trustees of \nEmmanuel College; and as an officer and member of various other groups \nand organizations that serve the community . She has also been \nappointed by the Governor of Massachusetts to be a Master for the \nReview of Treatment Plans for the Mentally Ill and has been a member of \nthe Governor's Advisory Board to the Department of Mental Retardation.\n  Her involvement in the Catholic Church reflects the same level of \ncommitment that she brings to her professional endeavors. She has been \na Eucharistic lay minister and an active member of her church. But more \nimportantly, behind the scenes, she has been a source of constant and \nunremitting charity to scores of those\n\n[[Page S5161]]\n\nin need. She understands and lives by the notion of quiet charity, \nhelping others both by spiritual and material assistance.\n  Judge Muse has been honored numerous times by colleges, bar \nassociations, and other organizations. She is the recipient of an \nhonorary degree from Emmanuel College. She has received the Irish \nAmerican Charitable Award and has been acknowledged with the \nDistinguished Jurist Award from the Massachusetts Association of Woman \nLawyers. In 1991, she was the recipient of Emmanuel College's Alumna of \nthe Year Award. In 1998, Boston College gave her its Alumni Award for \nExcellence.\n  I provide this background to give a small sample of the full and \nvital life of this still very active woman. But it has one critical \nomission. Along the way, Judge Muse also raised her 11 children, 8 sons \nand 3 daughters. Each of them was not only a college graduate, but also \nhas a graduate degree from a professional school. They are lawyers, \ndoctors, teachers, builders--and one son is a judge like his mom. If \nyou asked Judge Muse her greatest achievement in life, it would be a \nquick answer: her family. Throughout her career, she has placed a \nprimacy on what she deems most important in life: her loved ones. As \nshe pursued and reached the pinnacle of her professional career, she \nraised a family that was deeply nurtured in great love and values. \nJudge Muse stands heroically in the eyes of her 11 children, all of \nwhom will come from different spots in the country and abroad to be \nwith her on April 29 when she receives this special acknowledgment of \nher remarkable life.\n  Finally, my statement would not be complete if I didn't make some \nmention of the other great force in her life. Her husband, Bob Muse, \nhimself a great trial lawyer and a much decorated Marine Corps fighter \npilot, has been her partner for 60 years. No one will stand prouder on \nApril 29. He has been her source of strength and love--as she has been \nfor him.\n  Judge Muse has served as an exemplar for others, men and women alike, \nwho seek to achieve in this world while holding on to the values of \nfamily, friends, and community. She is a gentle and unassuming person \nwhose modesty and Irish wit forbid her from reflecting on, or talking \nabout, the great influence she has had on so many. But it is \nappropriate and right that others do so--and Boston College Law School \ndoes well to honor one of its most distinguished graduates.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/10/senate-section/article/S5161-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5161-S5163]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              NORTH KOREA\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today North Korea formally withdrew \nfrom the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Yet while the United States \nhas marshaled its military, diplomatic, and political resources against \nIraq over the past 6 months, too little appears to have been done with \nregard to North Korea, which I believe represents the most imminent, \nserious, and dangerous threat facing the United States.\n  Over the past few months North Korea has: expelled International \nAtomic Energy Agency inspectors; moved 8,000 previously canned \nplutonium rods back to a reprocessing facility; started up its Yongbyon \nnuclear facility again; scrambled fighter jets to intercept a U.S. Air \nForce reconnaissance plane over the Sea of Japan; and, threatened to \nabandon the armistice that has been in effect since 1953.\n  We must face facts: North Korea, an isolated dictatorship, with a \ncollapsed economy, controlled by its military, and in possession of \nnuclear weapons and the means to deliver them, represents a clear and \npresent danger.\n  If the United States does not exercise leadership and seek a \npragmatic approach to engaging North Korea--pragmatism that comes not \nfrom weakness, but from strength--we run the risk of disrupting \nstrategic stability in the Asia-Pacific region, the most vital \npolitical, military, and economic region for the United States in the \n21st century, and undermining our international credibility and global \nnuclear nonproliferation efforts.\n  North Korea is a quasi-Stalinist state which, since its formal \ncreation in 1948, has been run by two men--Kim Il Sung, who died in \n1994, and his son, Kim Jong Il. It is still almost entirely closed to \nthe Western World, a stark and isolated country marked by repression \nand poverty.\n  The North Korean people have no access to outside sources of \ninformation, such as television or radio or the Internet.\n  The totalitarian discipline of the North Korean people is \ndramatically illustrated by the fact that North Korean infiltrators \ncommonly commit suicide rather than allow themselves to be captured. \nOnly in rare cases have they been captured before they killed \nthemselves. That is a measure of fanatical devotion.\n  Second, the North Korean economy is increasingly isolated and stands, \nin my view, on the brink of collapse.\n  In many ways, North Korea is the ``black hole'' of Northeast Asia. \nEven before Russia and China curtailed their energy and food support in \nthe 1990s, the North Korean economy was in free-fall.\n  One measure of the dire straits facing the North Korean economy is \nthe famine that has gripped that nation for the past decade. Largely \ncreated by gross human negligence, not natural causes, it has killed an \nestimated 2 million people since the mid-1990s. Although harvests have \nimproved modestly in recent years, food shortages are still a serious \nproblem.\n  In recognition of this problem, just last month Secretary of State \nPowell announced that the United States would provide 40,000 tons of \nfood aid to the North--a modest level compared to recent years but \nsignificant nonetheless.\n  A second measure of the desperate situation facing the North Korean \neconomy is the collapse of its energy sector.\n\n  North Korea's total electricity consumption in 2000 was only 65 \npercent of what it had been in 1991. North Korea has resorted to a \nrationing system for electricity and often experiences extended \nblackouts and power losses due to an antiquated transmission grid, and \nthe North Korean agricultural sector is severely afflicted by a lack of \ndiesel and power supplies, as well as spare parts and fertilizer.\n  Taken together, North Korea's continuing isolation, famine, and \neconomic collapse constitute a humanitarian crisis, and act as a \nbarrier to improving cooperation and engagement in Northeast Asia on a \nnumber of fronts--political, economic, and military.\n  In early October of 2002, Assistant Secretary of State James Kelly \ninformed North Korean officials that the United States was aware that \nNorth Korea had a program underway to enrich uranium for use in nuclear \nweapons.\n  According to Secretary Kelly, with whom I have discussed this \nsituation on several occasions, North Korea initially denied the \nallegations, but later confirmed the U.S. claim. In confirming that \nthey had an active nuclear weapons program, they also declared that the \n1994 Agreed Framework was essentially null and void.\n  Under the Agreed Framework, signed by North Korea and the United \nStates: North Korea would freeze its existing nuclear program and agree \nto enhanced International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, safeguards; the \nUnited States would lead an effort to replace the DPRK's graphite-\nmoderated reactors for related facilities with light-water, LWR, \npowerplants; the U.S. pledged to provide 500,000 tons of heavy fuel \noil, HFO, annually until the LWRs were completed; both countries would \nmove toward full normalization of political and economic relations; \nboth sides would work together for peace and security on a nuclear-free \nKorean peninsula; and both sides would work to strengthen the \ninternational nuclear nonproliferation regime.\n  Implementation of the Agreed Framework was never perfect. None of \nthose who negotiated it or worked to implement it were operating under \nthe mistaken belief that North Korea was a ``good actor.'' But the guts \nof the deal--international safeguards on North Korea's plutonium \nfacilities in exchange for HFO and the construction of the LWRs--\nappeared to be intact until October 2002, when North Korean officials \nacknowledged the existence of a clandestine program to enrich uranium \nfor nuclear weapons that is in violation of the Agreed Framework and \nother agreements.\n  With the Agreed Framework now null and void, North Korea may well\n\n[[Page S5162]]\n\nfind in the production of fissile material a new cash crop, ready for \nexport, to support its sagging economy.\n  What makes the North Korean nuclear program of particular concern is \nthat North Korea also possesses advanced missile technology--in fact, \nit is the only country on earth that continues to sell Missile \nTechnology Control Regime-banned missiles--including missiles that one \nday may be capable of reaching the United States.\n  North Korea produces a wide range of ballistic missiles, including \nextended range versions of the Soviet-era Scud missile as well as \nindigenous medium range No Dong and Taepo Dong missiles.\n  In fact, in 1998, North Korea test fired one of its Taepo Dong \nmissiles over Japan and into the Pacific.\n  In addition, since at least 1987, North Korea has been developing \nlong-range missiles, including the Taepo Dong 2. A two-stage Taepo Dong \n2 has a range of approximately 6,000 miles, while a three-stage version \nhas a 9,300 mile range, allowing it to hit almost any point in North \nAmerica.\n  North Korea has also developed and produced cruise missiles. In fact, \nthe land-to-ship missile fired last month on the eve of Roh Moo-hyun's \ninauguration as South Korea's new President, was a cruise missile \nbelieved to be based on the Chinese Silkworm missile design.\n  Exporting missiles is one of the few sources of hard currency for \nNorth Korea, and in addition to the recent Scud sale to Yemen, North \nKorean leader Kim Jong II has admitted that Pyongyang sells missile \ntechnology to other nations, including Syria, Iran, and Libya.\n  Now, I believe the blame for precipitating the current crisis lies \nsquarely with North Korea, which clearly violated the Agreed Framework \nby undertaking its secret uranium enrichment program.\n  The government of Kim Jong II has clearly placed its focus not on \nfeeding its people but in developing its military, its missiles, and \nits nuclear capability all in defiance of the treaties it has signed.\n  Yet it also appears that our own handling of events on the Korean \npeninsula over the past 2 years, as well as our broader foreign policy \nrhetoric and statements have served, ironically, to fuel North Korea's \nparanoia and made the situation much more difficult to manage.\n  Part of the problem was our reluctance to endorse former President \nKim Dae Jung's ``Sunshine Policy,'' a diplomatic and economic effort by \nthe South Korean Government to ease tensions with the North. President \nKim was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2000 for precisely these \ninitiatives.\n  This move was perceived as a major humiliation in South Korea, helped \nset the stage for the rise of anti-Americanism, and was seen as a sign \nby the North that the administration was intent on a policy of \nisolation and confrontation.\n  Next month, when President Roh visits Washington, I would urge the \nadministration to take great care to assure that the United States and \nSouth Korea share a common vision, goal, and purpose regarding North \nKorea.\n  The North Korean situation offers no easy solution. But over the past \nseveral months it has gone from bad to worse, and the administration \nhas yet to demonstrate the degree of high-level seriousness and \ncommitment necessary to defuse the crisis.\n  We cannot allow North Korea to produce additional nuclear material. \nRestarting its production facility will allow North Korea to develop at \nleast a half dozen nuclear weapons within 6 months.\n  It is bad enough that North Korea might acquire a significant nuclear \narsenal for its own possible use. But even worse would be North Korea \nbecoming a plutonium factory selling fissile material to the highest \nbidder. As we were reminded in December when we intercepted a quasi-\nlegal missile shipment to Yemen, this is a regime that will sell \nanything it develops.\n  In short, the administration's justification for being concerned \nabout Iraq that it is a brutal dictatorship that may threaten \ninstability in the region and may provide WMD to terrorists is quickly \nbecoming a reality with North Korea.\n  A failure to stop North Korea's nuclear program is sending a terrible \nmessage to other rogue states and to our friends and allies as well. \nEvery would-be proliferator is measuring our response to North Korea as \nthey consider how to chart their futures.\n  And a nuclear North Korea may lead friends in the region, like Japan \nand South Korea, to conclude that they have to increase their military \ncapabilities, sparking an arms race in Asia and drawing China, India, \nand Pakistan into a regionwide cycle of escalation.\n  At the end of the day, I believe that we face the same three basic \noptions today that we did in 1994: We can launch a preemptive strike \nagainst North Korea's nuclear facilities; we can pursue a policy of \nisolation and containment; or, we can seek to persuade North Korea to \nabandon its nuclear ambitions through negotiations.\n  In reality, a preemptive strike is not a feasible option.\n  First, while we might be able to take out Yongbyon and other well-\nknown sites, we simply don't know where all of North Koreans fissile \nmaterial, missile, or nuclear facilities are located. There are over \n10,000 caves and holes in North Korea. We don't know the location of \nthe uranium facility.\n  Second, launching a preemptive strike is hardly a palatable option \ngiven the military realities on the ground at the DMZ. Such a strike \nwould lead to all-out war on the Korean peninsula, and although I \nbelieve the U.S. and our allies would emerge victorious, the price \nwould be high.\n  Finally, our South Korean allies strongly reject a preemptive strike, \nwhich should give us pause.\n  Likewise, there are major problems with continuing a policy of \nisolation and containment, as some in the administration have argued \nfor. In essence, isolation and containment appear unlikely to succeed \nin toppling a regime that has been isolated and contained for so long. \nAnd it means that we have acquiesced to North Korea's going nuclear, \nand to North Korea acquiring serial production capacity for nuclear \nweapons and fissile material. Furthermore, isolation will not prevent \nNorth Korea from exporting fissile material to Iran, al-Qaida, or \nothers.\n  A policy that allows North Korea to build and retain nuclear weapons \nand long-range missiles capable of reaching the United States, and to \npossess excess fissile material and a highly efficient network to sell \nor transfer fissile material to terrorists or other rouge states, is \nnot in our best interest, which brings us to the third option \nnegotiations.\n  I strongly believe that the United States must signal its willingness \nto engage in immediate U.S.-North Korean negotiations to dismantle \nNorth Korea's nuclear program in return for U.S. security assurances to \nNorth Korea, economic assistance and normalized relations. In fact, as \nsome experts have suggested, bilateral negotiations themselves could be \npremised on a North Korean commitment not to reprocess the Yongbyon \nreactor fuel rods into plutonium during the discussions.\n  As we seek creative solutions to engage North Korea and go forward \nwith a process of negotiations, it is critical that we do so in harmony \nwith South Korea and Japan, and both China and Russia must also play a \nmajor role. The administration is right that this crisis is an \ninternational problem that requires the active involvement of the other \npowers in the region.\n  I am particularly pleased to note that China has, in fact, played a \nconstructive role in helping to convey to North Korea the gravity of \nits current course.\n  At the same time, I believe that the burden of international \nleadership falls on the United States, and, as we seek to engage North \nKorea diplomatically, we must move beyond continuing to argue over the \nshape of the table or how many chairs should be at it. Continuing to do \nso is little more than an excuse for those who would prefer to see the \ncrisis escalate instead of seeking to solve it.\n\n  Although the administration believes, correctly, that bad behavior \nshould not be rewarded, it is also a truism of diplomacy that if you \nwant to get something you must be prepared to give something.\n  And I strongly believe that it is in the United States' best \ninterests to get something from North Korea: That North Korea cease and \ndesist its nuclear activities and stop proliferating missiles.\n\n[[Page S5163]]\n\n  So I believe that it is imperative to think creatively about \ninducements that can be offered to induce North Korea to relinquish its \nnuclear ambitions. Implementation of several relatively modest \nnonnuclear energy sector initiatives--introducing market institutions \nto the North Korean energy sector; undertaking efforts to repair the \nexisting electric grid; rehabilitating coal supply and transport; \neliminating waste; and underwriting small-scale renewable projects--\nwould provide for a stable energy sector for North Korea in the near \nand intermediate term. And, as part of a process of larger diplomatic \nengagement with North Korea, this can contribute significantly to \ndefusing the current crisis.\n  There is no evidence that North Korea has started to reprocess. North \nKorea may well be determined to go down the nuclear path and a nuclear \nNorth Korea may well be an unavoidable consequence of the current \ncrisis. But nothing is yet set in stone, and at a time of increasing \nuncertainty the world looks to the United States to lead. And there is \nno better way to underscore our seriousness than through direct \nnegotiations. Such talks are all the more important when dealing with \nan isolated, tyrannical and bellicose regime, because miscommunication \ncan all too easily lead to miscalculation, with possibly catastrophic \nconsequences.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/10/senate-section/article/S5163-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5163]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 REAUTHORIZING THE ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, a Bureau of Justice Statistics survey \npublished in November 2001 reported that almost 7 percent of State \ninmates and more than 9 percent of Federal inmates carried military-\nstyle semiautomatic weapons in carrying out the crime for which they \nwere convicted. In 1997, roughly 43 percent of inmates who carried a \nmilitary-style semiautomatic or fully automatic weapon fired it and \nmore than 25 percent of them killed or injured their victim.\n  Military-style semiautomatic weapons are modifications of traditional \nsemiautomatic weapons. They incorporate features intended to give users \nan advantage in combat situations. Such features include but are not \nlimited to: pistol grips, folding stocks, bayonet mounts, and flash \nsuppressors. The 1994 semiautomatic assault weapons ban prohibited the \nmanufacture of semiautomatic weapons that incorporate at least two of \nthese military features and accept a detachable magazine. Preexisting \nmilitary-style semiautomatic weapons were not banned.\n  The semiautomatic assault weapons ban will expire on Sept. 13, 2004. \nIf the law is not reauthorized, the production of military-style \nsemiautomatic weapons can legally resume. As the Bureau of Justice \nStatistics study illustrates, the use of military-style semiautomatic \nweapons is already a widely used option for many in the criminal \npopulation. Restarting production of these weapons will obviously \nincrease their number and availability. Such an increase does not bode \nwell for public safety.\n  It is critical that we reauthorize the semiautomatic assault weapons \nban. We should not wait for new statistics to demonstrate that more \ncriminals are turning to newly manufactured military-style \nsemiautomatic weapons. Existing evidence of past behavior is clear. If \nwe wait, more damage will already have been done. Military-style \nsemiautomatic weapons represent a danger to the lives of police \nofficers and the general public. For the safety of our Nation's \ncitizens, the Congress should act this year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/10/senate-section/article/S5163-2", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5163]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH.

The student was walking home from \nclasses when he was alarmed to see a stranger charging after him, his \narms already swinging.

Mr. President, we can all celebrate the collapse of Saddam \nHussein's brutal, corrupt regime. While much remains to be done to \nrebuild Iraq and reassure the Arab world that the United States is a \nliberator, not a conqueror, and that we have no intention of imposing \nour will on the Iraqi people, the demise of such a tyrant should be \nuniversally welcomed.\n  As we reflect on the past 3 weeks of war, we should above all pay \ntribute to the extraordinary courage and professionalism of our Armed \nForces. They conducted themselves in ways that should make all of us \nproud.\n  We should also make note of the vast arsenal of modern weapons which \nenabled them to prevail. These weapons have devastated Iraqi troops, \narmor, and military infrastructure.\n  We have seen on television how effective our precision-guided \nmissiles and bombs are, and we can only imagine how many civilian \ncasualties were avoided because of their accuracy. It is partly because \nwe have such increasingly accurate weapons that I want to discuss an \nissue that concerns me, and that is the use of cluster bombs by our \nforces in Iraq.\n  Cluster bombs, otherwise known as ``submunitions'' or ``bomblets,'' \nare strewn by aircraft or artillery over a wide area. They can be as \nsmall as a baseball. They are designed to detonate on impact and \nscatter deadly shrapnel in every direction. However, on average some 2-\n20 percent do not explode on impact. Instead, they remain on the \nsurface of the ground, often hidden by sand or vegetation, where they \nlie in wait for some unsuspecting child, farmer, or other innocent \nperson. They also pose a grave danger to U.S. forces in the area.\n  The United States military dropped millions of cluster bombs on Laos \nduring the Vietnam war. Today, over 30 years later, they continue to \nmaim and kill innocent people. The cost of removing these tiny, lethal \nweapons is prohibitive for an impoverished country like Laos. The \nUnited States Agency for International Development, through the Leahy \nWar Victims Fund, is aiding some of the severely disabled victims of \nthese indiscriminate weapons.\n  More recently, the United States has used cluster bombs in several \ncountries, including Kosovo, Afghanistan, Iraq during the first gulf \nwar, and, according to reports, again in Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  In the first gulf war, U.S. planes dropped more than 24 million \nsubmunitions on Iraq, leaving roughly 1.2 million duds which resulted \nin over 1,600 Kuwaiti and Iraqi civilian deaths and an additional 2,500 \ninjured following the war. The cost of clearing these duds and other \nunexploded ordnance was in the hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\n  In 1995 in Bosnia, U.S. military officers reportedly banned the use \nof cluster bombs because they were seen to present an unacceptable risk \nto civilians. However, 3 years later, during the NATO air campaign in \nYugoslavia, U.S., British and Dutch military aircraft dropped more than \n295,000 submunitions. The U.N. Mine Action Coordination Center \nestimated that more than 20,000 live bomblets remained after the war, \nand the International Committee of the Red Cross reported that in the \nyear following the war there were 151 reported casualties due to \ncluster bombs.\n  The U.S. Air Force has used cluster bombs in Afghanistan, where, \npredictably, they have caused the deaths of innocent civilians. \nAdditionally, the appearance of the yellow bomblets bore a\n\n[[Page S5164]]\n\nremarkable similarity to food aid parcels being airdropped. Civilians \nsearching for food instead have found a hidden death. Also, the bright \nyellow of the bomblets attracted children, who thought it might be a \ntoy. I read recently that this same problem has occurred in Iraq.\n  According to Human Rights Watch, television images and reports from \njournalists embedded with the U.S. military indicate that U.S. forces \nare using artillery projectiles and rockets containing large numbers of \ncluster munitions of a type which, according to a Department of Defense \nreport, have a failure rate of 16 percent. This could result in \nhundreds or thousands of dangerous duds.\n  In addition, The Washington Post reported on March 29 that U.S. \nforces fired 18 Army Tactical Missile Systems against suspected air \ndefense sites in support of a helicopter attack by units of the 101st \nAirborne Division on March 28. The payload of an ATACMS is 300 or 950 \nsubmunitions with a reported failure rate of 2 percent.\n  There is also apparently video footage of U.S. Marine artillery units \nsupporting the 3rd Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion using 155 \nmillimeter artillery firing projectiles at Iraqi positions. A reporter \ndescribed ``hundreds of grenades'' being fired at the Iraqis. These \nwere apparently a type of submunition which have a 14 percent dud rate.\n  Submunitions that fail to detonate upon impact become de facto \nlandmines. I have long opposed the use of landmines, and while cluster \nbombs differ from landmines in that the former are designed to explode \non impact, I have urged the Department of Defense to only use cluster \nbombs that contain reliable self-destruct fuses. Modern self-destruct \nfuses, which cost only $8-10 each, could reduce the number of duds and \nthe number of innocent casualties by more than 97 percent. Yet, the \ncluster bombs used by U.S. forces in Iraq do not, to my knowledge, \ninclude this available technology. Innocent people, whether Iraqis or \nAmericans, should not die on account of a mere ten dollars.\n  I have also urged the Pentagon to adopt rules of engagement to \nprevent the use of cluster bombs in heavily populated areas. These \nweapons, which are designed to detonate over a wide area, are not \naccurate enough to prevent widespread death and injury to \nnoncombatants.\n\n  I also want to speak about the use of landmines by Iraqi forces. As I \nmentioned, I oppose the use of landmines--specifically, landmines that \ndo not have a man in the loop. According to Human Rights Watch and \npress reports, Iraqi soldiers and paramilitaries have strewn \nantipersonnel mines widely. They even stored mines inside a mosque in a \ntown in northern Iraq, and placed them around the mosque. This is a war \ncrime.\n  Iraq is not among the 132 countries that are party to the 1997 Ottawa \nConvention that outlaws any use, production, stockpiling or trade in \nantipersonnel mines. Neither is the United States. However, landmines \nthat do not have a man in the loop which can distinguish between an \nenemy soldier and an innocent civilian are outmoded, inhumane weapons. \nThey should be universally condemned.\n  Even before this latest conflict, Iraq was a heavily mined country. \nIt is littered with mines from the Iraq-Iran war and from decades of \ninternal fighting. Landmines were used in the first Gulf war by Iraq, \nas well as by U.S. forces. I am very pleased that U.S. forces \napparently have not used landmines in Operation Iraqi Freedom. The fact \nthat even without landmines our soldiers were able to destroy the Iraqi \narmy in a matter of weeks is the latest evidence that landmines without \na man in the loop should have no future in U.S. war fighting plans.\n  Landmines continue to take their toll. In the past 3 weeks, a \ncameraman working for the BBC was killed in Iraq when he stepped on a \nmine, and at least three U.S. marines have been injured by mines in \nseparate incidents. It is a virtual certainty that innocent people will \ncontinue to be maimed and killed by mines in Iraq long after the \nfighting stops.\n  Saddam Hussein's army had a long history of atrocities against the \nIraqi people, as well as against Iraq's neighbors. Its use of landmines \nis but another example of its utter disregard for innocent life.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, today is a new beginning for the people \nof free Iraq. The central authority in Baghdad has collapsed. Saddam \nHussein's regime has lost control. But we know that there will be hard \ndays ahead, days that will test our leadership, and test our \nwillingness to engage with the rest of the world.\n  In the coming months and years, America faces the enormous challenge \nof helping the Iraqi people rebuild their lives in peace and \nprosperity. This challenge presents an extraordinary opportunity for \nthe United States as well. If we do this right, we have a chance to \nensure that the United States occupies a place of respect and \nadmiration in the world. We must take advantage of this opportunity to \nstrengthen relationships with our core allies, to revitalize the United \nNations, and to demonstrate American leadership through respectful \nengagement with the rest of the world.\n  Today, in Baghdad and throughout Iraq, America's military forces are \nstill in harm's way, and our thoughts and prayers are with them. Over \nthe past 3 weeks, I have visited with some of our troops and their \nfamilies in North Carolina at Fort Bragg, Camp Lejeune, and with the \nNational Guard. These young men and women inspire us all. They are \nperforming brilliantly, and they will bring us to a great military \nvictory. I support our troops, and I support the cause for which they \nare fighting.\n  I have long argued that disarming Saddam, even if it meant the use of \nmilitary force, was necessary to defend America's national interests. \nLast fall, I cosponsored and voted for the resolution authorizing force \nto disarm Saddam. As I argued then, lasting victory will require more \nthan removing Saddam from power and disarming Iraq once and for all. \nVictory means winning the peace. We have proved that we have firepower. \nNow we must show that we have staying power.\n  We must make a major commitment to help rebuild Iraq. It is in \nAmerica's national interest to help build an Iraq at peace with itself \nand its neighbors, because a democratic, tolerant and accountable Iraq \nwill be a peaceful regional partner. Such an Iraq could serve as a \nmodel for the entire Arab world. If done right--with humility, patience \nand cooperation--this effort to rebuild Iraq will bring the world \ntogether and return America to a place where it is respected and \nadmired.\n  The President has spoken about his commitment to Iraq's future and \npledged that America will be there to help. We must hold him to these \ncommitments, especially because in Afghanistan the President's rhetoric \nabout winning the peace looks more and more like an empty promise.\n  In order to succeed, our actions to help Iraq must be based on four \nclear and simple principles.\n  First, the United States cannot do this alone. It would be a huge \nmistake if the reconstruction of Iraq were an ``American-only'' effort. \nThe United Nations must play a central role, not just through passive \nendorsement, but through active engagement in reconstruction, \nhumanitarian relief, and civil administration. In addition, we should \nbe working with our NATO allies to find ways the alliance could be \ninvolved in providing security assistance, and we should seek help from \nour friends in the European Union. Finally, we need to work with \nregional partners such as Turkey and Jordan to support these efforts. A \nrobust multilateral approach to this problem will not just increase the \nlikelihood of success. It also will allow us to share the burden of the \nreconstruction costs with the rest of the international community. And \nit will help create a free Iraqi Government with legitimacy and \nauthority in the region and the world.\n  Second, we must ensure the immediate security and safety of the Iraqi \npeople, and help them achieve stability over the long-term. In the \nbeginning, most of this security will have to come from American and \nBritish military forces. While our forces should be there as long as it \ntakes, and not be restricted by artificial deadlines, an American \nmilitary presence in Iraq cannot be indefinite. We should support \ncreating a multinational force to follow our efforts, including a \ncentral role for NATO. There are many other urgent security needs as \nwell, such as eliminating the instruments of Iraq's\n\n[[Page S5165]]\n\nsystem of repression and securing Iraq's borders and oil facilities. \nThe Iraqi people will only be able to emerge from the shadow of Saddam \nHussein's tyranny if they are freed from the threat of violence and \nlawlessness.\n  Third, the Iraqi people must be able to shape their own future, not \nhave it imposed on them by outsiders. We can help create an environment \nfor this to happen. This means, most fundamentally, a civil \nadministration that protects three basic freedoms: freedom of speech, \nfreedom of assembly, and freedom of movement. Iraq also must develop \nthe rule of law. Its people need the international community's help in \ncapturing and trying war criminals, developing legal institutions, \neducating judges and lawyers, and developing a legitimate police force.\n  The reconstruction effort must also begin to restore the basic \nelements of everyday life, from ensuring that they have adequate \nelectricity and clean water to helping them at tasks life rebuilding \ntheir roads and schools.\n  All Iraqis must have confidence that they will have a voice in their \nfuture and that they will have a government that reflects their \ndiversity. A free and democratic Iraq will not spring up by itself or \novernight in a multi-ethnic, complicated society that has suffered \nunder repression for generations. The Iraqi people deserve and need our \nhelp to rebuild their lives and to create a prosperous, thriving, open \nsociety. All Iraqis--including Sunnis, Shia and Kurds--deserve to be \nrepresented.\n  Fourth, the Iraqi people must have the tools to build a prosperous \neconomy that is theirs alone. Iraqi has enormous natural resources and \nit has great potential. While we should help the Iraqi people tap into \nthat potential, we have to make clear to the Iraqi people that the oil \nis theirs, and not for the U.S. or others to exploit. We also will have \nto explore all possibilities for debt restructuring and relief. Yet \ndoing what it takes to succeed in Iraq is only one of the challenges we \nface. We have to develop a new kind of leadership throughout the world.\n\n  In the Middle East, it is time to engage to achieve a real peace \nbetween the Israelis and the Palestinians. I think this \nadministration's disengagement in this crisis for the past 2 years has \nbeen a mistake. With the end of the conflict in Iraq, we have an \nopportunity to bring hope to this troubled region. We must seize it.\n  We also have to do far more to support democracy and freedom \nthroughout the Middle East. No region of the world is more vital to our \ninterests; yet no region is as undemocratic. Ultimately, there is no \ngreater force for peace and prosperity--and against terrorism--than the \npromotion of democratic regimes that respect human rights and the rule \nof law, both within and beyond their borders.\n  Showing a new kind of leadership in the Middle East will also help \nbegin to bridge the gap that has grown between America and many of our \nbest friends in the world.\n  The most powerful country in the world can afford to heed the \nconcerns of its friends. We cannot afford to lose them. Yet I am \nconcerned that some would move us in the opposite direction, attempting \nto punish allies that disagreed with us on Iraq. This is wrong. We also \nhave to take action to revitalize institutions like NATO and the United \nNations. At times these institutions can be frustrating, but we must \nremember that it was America's vision and leadership that created these \ninstitutions. American leadership will be indispensable to helping them \nact to tackle today's challenges.\n  Make no mistake, America's families are safer in a world where \nAmerica is looked up and respected, not isolated and resented. \nAmerica's interests are best served when we lead in a way that brings \nothers to our side, not drives them away. Like the generation of \nFranklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman, we have a chance to define how \nAmerica uses its power--whether it is defending against threats, \npromoting prosperity and freedom or giving help to those who need it.\n  We have a chance to strengthen international institutions and \nalliances to help us meet these challenges.

Mr. President, as a strong supporter of Federal \nprograms to strengthen and protect libraries, I am pleased to recognize \nApril 6 to 12 as National Library Week. This is the 45th anniversary of \nthis national observance, and its longevity is evidence of the great \nimportance our Nation places on libraries, books, reading, and \neducation.\n  National Library Week grew out of 1950s research that showed a \ntroublesome trend Americans were spending more money on radios and \ntelevision and less on buying books. The American Library Association \nand the American Book Publishers joined forces and introduced the first \nNational Library Week in 1958 in an effort to encourage people to read \nand to use their libraries.\n  When the free public library came into its own in this country in the \n19th century, it was, from the beginning, a unique institution because \nof its commitment to the principle of a free and open exchange of \nideas, much like the Constitution itself. Libraries continue to be an \nintegral part of all that our country embodies: freedom of information, \nan educated citizenry, and an open and enlightened society.\n  I firmly believe libraries play an indispensable role in our \ncommunities. They promote reading and quench a thirst for knowledge \namong adults, adolescents, and children. More importantly, they provide \nthe access and resources to allow citizens to obtain timely and \nreliable information that is so necessary in our fast-paced society. In \nthis age of rapid technological advancement, libraries are called upon \nto provide not only books and periodicals, but many other valuable \nresources as well--audiovisual materials, computer services, internet \naccess terminals, facilities for community lectures and performances, \ntapes, records, videocassettes, and works of art for exhibit and loan \nto the public.\n  Libraries provide a gateway to a new and exciting world for all--the \nplace where a spark is often struck for disadvantaged citizens who, for \nwhatever reason, have not had exposure to the vast stores of knowledge \nand emerging technology available to others. In this information age, \nthey play a critical role in bridging the digital divide. Many families \ncannot afford personal computers at home, yet the role of computers has \nbecome almost necessary to a basic educational experience. The children \nof these families would suffer without the access to emerging \ntechnology that libraries provide to all patrons regardless of income. \nIn addition, special facilities libraries provide services for older \nAmericans, people with disabilities, and hospitalized citizens.\n  During National Library Week, I wish to salute those individuals who \nare members of the library community and work so hard to ensure that \nour citizens and communities continue to enjoy the tremendous rewards \navailable through our libraries. Library staff, volunteers, and patrons \nwork to ensure existing libraries run smoothly and have adequate \nresources, as well as advocate for increased funding and new libraries.\n  I am proud that Maryland is a State of readers. Recent statistics \nshow that Maryland citizens borrowed more public library materials per \nperson than those of almost any other State, nearly 9 per person. In \naddition, 67 percent of the State's population are registered library \npatrons. We are lucky to have 24 public library systems, providing a \nfull range of library services to all Maryland citizens and a long \ntradition of open and unrestricted sharing of resources. The State \nLibrary Network that provides interlibrary loans to the State's public, \nacademic, special libraries, and school library media centers has \nenhanced this policy. Marylanders have responded to this outstanding \nservice by showing their continued enthusiasm and support for our \npublic libraries.\n  I have worked closely with members of the Maryland Library \nAssociation, colleges and universities, and others involved in the \nlibrary community throughout the State, and I am very pleased to join \nwith them and citizens throughout the Nation in this week's celebration \nof National Library Week.\n\n[[Page S5166]]\n\nI look forward to continuing this relationship with those who enable \nlibraries to provide the unique and vital services available to all \nAmericans.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the attached op-ed by Carla Hayden, \n``Don't Take Libraries for Granted,'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Baltimore Sun, Apr. 9, 2003]\n\n                    Don't Take Libraries for Granted\n\n                          (By Carla D. Hayden)\n\n       Americans have several beacons of light in what seem to be \n     dark and fearful times, among them libraries.\n       The Enoch Pratt Free Library is proud to join the American \n     Library Association in celebrating all that libraries have to \n     offer during National Library Week this week.\n       Every day, more than 120,000 librarians nationwide connect \n     students, families, senior citizens, businesspeople, teachers \n     and professors with the information they need to be \n     successful in a swiftly changing and increasingly troubled \n     era.\n       Americans rely on libraries for help in finding jobs, using \n     the Internet, demystifying technology, getting free access to \n     thousands of books and videotapes and connecting with their \n     neighbors and colleagues. And this couldn't be more relevant \n     in Baltimore City, where more than 23 percent of our \n     residents live at or below the poverty level.\n       The staff at the Pratt works to meet the needs of the \n     community by providing seminars on race relations, building \n     personal assets, entrepreneurship, computer training and \n     more.\n       As the State Library Resource Center for Maryland, the \n     Pratt is dedicated to assisting residents across the state in \n     finding information they need 24 hours a day, seven days a \n     week. We are a major support of the new ``Ask Us Now'' \n     statewide library reference service, an invaluable resource. \n     And it's all free of charge.\n       Librarians are committed to freedom of access to \n     information and are fighting to ensure that such freedom \n     remains intact so that no one is afraid to search for answers \n     to important questions. It is often easy to take our \n     libraries and librarians for granted.\n       Carla D.

Mr. President, I want to pay tribute to Daniel Patrick \nMoynihan, a man for whom I had the utmost respect.\n  One of the first times I was presiding in the Senate, Senator \nMoynihan was speaking from the floor. What he had to say and the way he \nsaid it made a lasting impression on me. The next day I asked for a \ncopy of the statement and have kept it in my desk ever since. Senator \nMoynihan began: ``Mr. President, it is agreed that I will begin these \nbrief remarks in order that our chairman might conclude the debate and \nproceed to the vote which I think has every prospect of being \nprodigious in its majority.'' He continued to explain one of the most \ncomplicated and difficult issues that we will deal with here in the \nSenate in a clear and concise manner. ``In very short order, I would \nsimply like to recapitulate the four simple steps which will put Social \nSecurity on an actuarially sound basis for the next 75 years. They are: \n1. Provide for an accurate cost-of-living adjustment. In 1996, the \nBoskin Commission originally estimated that the CPI overstates changes \nin the cost-of-living by 1.1 percentage points; now they say it is 0.8 \nof a percentage point; 2. Normal taxation of benefits; 3. Extend \ncoverage to all newly hired State and local workers; 4. Increase the \nlength of the computation period from 35 to 38 years.''\n  I don't know if this is the answer, but I will always refer to it \nwhen the topic of Social Security comes up. He laid out a plan with \nprofessorial clarity and a complete grasp of the issue. Whether you \nagreed or disagreed with Senator Moynihan, you had to appreciate his \nstyle.\n  Although I did not have a close working relationship with Senator \nMoynihan, I am truly impressed with the depth and breadth of his career \nachievements. From his pioneering work on Social Security reform, his \nalmost encyclopedic knowledge of fiscal policy, to his championing of \nenvironmental and transportation issues, Senator Moynihan was the kind \nof Senator worth emulating. I also admired his ability to always look \nat the long view of the steps taken today and their impact on future \ngenerations. Senator Moynihan had an unwavering commitment to care for \nall people in need and was willing to cross party lines to accomplish \nhis goals. His work as advisor to Presidents of both parties is \ntestament to the high regard that official Washington had for his \nintellect and integrity.\n  As a dear friend of my father's for over 25 years, my strongest sense \nof the Senator comes from hearing my dad speak of Senator Moynihan with \nreverence and true admiration. Upon my father's passing, Senator \nMoynihan included an excerpt from a wonderful poem by W.B. Yeats, ``The \nMunicipal Gallery Revisited,'' in his tribute. Those kind words were a \ngreat comfort to our family.\n  In the words of another poem by the poet W.B. Yeats:\n\n     The man is gone guided ye, unweary, through the long bitter \n           way,\n     Ye by the waves that close in our sad nation,\n     Be full of sudden fears,\n     The man is gone who from this lonely station\n     --Has moulded the hard year . . .\n     Mourn--and then onward, there is no returning\n     He guides ye from the tomb;\n     His memory is a tall pillar, burning\n     Before the gloom\n\n  Our Nation will mourn, but Senator Moynihan would insist that we move \non. On behalf of my mother and the Chafee family, we send our sincere \ncondolences to Liz and all her family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/10/senate-section/article/S5166-2", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5166-S5168]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      JEFF MADRICK ON ``THE U.S. ECONOMY AND THE IRAQI TIME BOMB''\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, last Sunday's magazine section of the New \nYork Times contained an excellent and insightful article by Jeff \nMadrick on the Nation's troubled economy as a result of huge tax cuts, \nthe stalled economy, and the cost of the war and the reconstruction of \nIraq. His article emphasizes the severe consequences we will face if we \nfail to bring the exploding deficit under control. Mr. Madrick's \narticle, ``The Iraqi Time Bomb,'' will be of major interest to all of \nus in Congress, and I ask unanimous consent that it may be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        [From the New York Times Magazine Section, Apr. 6, 2003]\n\n                          The Iraqi Time Bomb\n\n                           (By Jeff Madrick)\n\n       The denial of economic reality that permeated Wall Street a \n     few years ago has now migrated to Washington. On Wall Street, \n     when companies did not generate the promised profits to \n     justify the bubble in stock prices, many analysts told \n     investors that profits did not matter. A new economy would be \n     gauged by other measures, they insisted. Today, in similar \n     fashion, as the federal budget has plunged into the red over \n     the past two years, President Bush's economic team is telling \n     the nation that deficits no longer matter.\n       At first, perhaps, the claim seemed plausible. Damage to \n     the economy was not yet evident. And I, for one, am not a \n     deficit hawk. At times, deficits are necessary to stimulate \n     economic growth, and their dampening impact on private \n     investment is occasionally exaggerated. But because of the \n     Bush administration's policies and a weak economy, deficits \n     are now approaching unmanageable levels, as they did in the \n     1980's. In fact, the federal government's fiscal health has \n     deteriorated at a pace so stunning that few have yet caught \n     up with the facts.\n       Here are some of those facts. Even without a war, the \n     budget deficit would have exceeded $300 billion this year--\n     just three years after the budget experienced a surplus of \n     nearly $240 billion. (This was in the midst of a four-year \n     run of substantial surpluses.) But with war costs escalating \n     and revenues falling as a result of the flat economy, this \n     year's deficit could rise to $400 billion. In fiscal year \n     2004, it is likely to be higher.\n       The president has asked Congress for $75 billion to finance \n     war-related costs, but many think a more realistic estimate \n     of the combined costs of war and reconstruction will be \n     closer to $200 billion. More alarming is the decline of \n     government revenues over the long run. Instead of generating \n     $5 trillion to $6 trillion in surpluses over 10 years from \n     rising tax revenues on growing incomes, the government will \n     now probably come up nearly $2 trillion short through 2013. \n     That recession and slower growth have shrunk tax revenues is \n     predictable enough. But the sinking stock market has taken \n     more of a toll than expected: there are no more outsize \n     capital gains to tax. These yielded fat revenues in the late \n     1990's, when stocks were soaring, exaggerating the fiscal \n     health of the nation. Now the train is running in reverse.\n       Finally, the Bush tax cuts have made long-term financial \n     prospects significantly worse. Occasionally, tax cuts make \n     sense. But the\n\n[[Page S5167]]\n\n     $1.4 trillion tax-cut package passed in 2001 would have been \n     more productive if it had been temporary and applicable to \n     more taxpayers. Instead, it was skewed to the rich (who are \n     prone to save rather than spend) and will be permanent--far \n     from disappearing should the economy improve, the tax cut \n     will grow larger. The administration proposed a second major \n     tax cut in early January, estimated to cost $726 billion over \n     10 years, and it appears to be even less effective as a near-\n     term stimulus: more than half of the total results from the \n     elimination of taxes on dividends, an idea raised at Bush's \n     economic summit in Waco, Tex., last August by a stockbroker, \n     Charles Schwab. In addition, the Bush administration followed \n     up this tax plan with a new budget that would extend the 2001 \n     cuts three years past their expiration, costing another $600 \n     billion.\n       The Senate has since voted to reduce the $726 billion \n     budget request by half, but last week it was still far from \n     clear that this change would prevail, given that the House \n     passed a budget resolution that assumed the president's tax \n     cuts.\n       The consequence of all these steps? Budget deficits as far \n     as the eye can see. When Bush took office, his budget team \n     estimated there would be a cumulative surplus of some $5.6 \n     trillion over the next 10 years. Now, in light of the 2003 \n     tax cuts and the new Bush budget, the Congressional Budget \n     Office, the nonpartisan economic research arm of Congress, \n     calculates that a long-term surplus will turn into a $1.8 \n     trillion deficit between 2004 and 2013.\n       Unfortunately, economists outside the government estimate \n     that the deficit will be even larger. William Gale and Peter \n     Orszag of the Brookings Institution figure the deficit is \n     likely to approach $2.5 trillion. The Wall Street economists \n     William Dudley and Edward McKelvey of Goldman Sachs say that \n     the deficit will exceed $4 trillion by 2013.\n       The timing of this looming deficit could not be worse. The \n     retirement of baby boomers is about to begin en masse. In 10 \n     years, the costs of Social Security and Medicare will start \n     rising rapidly. By the 2020's, these costs will begin to \n     reach roughly 12 to 15 percent of gross domestic product, \n     compared with about 6.8 percent today. To put this in \n     perspective, consider that all current federal expenditures \n     now come to only 20 percent of G.D.P.\n       The concern about large deficits is that they reduce long-\n     term economic growth and produce even less revenue for social \n     programs. When large enough, government deficits require so \n     much federal borrowing that they can displace private \n     investment and push up interest rates on mortgages, consumer \n     credit and business borrowing to levels that thwart home \n     buying, consumer purchases and capital investment. (If \n     interest rates should stop falling, home refinancing, which \n     has recently been a principal source of more money for \n     consumers, will be less attractive.) Big deficits also make \n     the U.S. economy especially vulnerable to the loss of capital \n     investment from overseas. Because Americans save so little, \n     and because the nation imports much more than it exports, the \n     United States must attract close to $500 billion of foreign \n     capital annually to finance its growth. High budget deficits \n     could easily reduce the confidence of foreign investors, who \n     already own 36 percent of U.S. government debt. If they sell \n     some of those securities, they will drive down the value of \n     the dollar and U.S. investments will become even less \n     attractive. Over the last year, the dollar has already fallen \n     by 20 percent against some major currencies.\n       The slower growth that results from large deficits affects \n     everybody. It leads to lost jobs, lower wages and fewer \n     business opportunities. A return to the sluggish economy of \n     the 1980's and early 1990's is not only possible but likely.\n       Straitened conditions are being felt already. States, \n     starved for revenues because they cannot borrow to make up \n     for the deficits caused by the economic downturn, are now \n     cutting education, health and poverty programs aggressively. \n     State and local governments are also complaining that money \n     promised by Washington for homeland security has not arrived. \n     And the president recently told the states that there's no \n     extra money for them.\n       Given the pinch, how can we explain the administration's \n     fiscal choices? Some economists in the Bush camp claim that \n     lower tax rates and the elimination of taxes on dividends \n     will both motivate people to work harder and investors to \n     invest more. The economy will grow faster than traditional \n     economic models anticipate, producing tax revenues that will \n     reduce projected budget deficits. But most economists say \n     there is a large measure of ideological wishful thinking \n     here, reminiscent of the supply-side economists who advised \n     President Reagan. Bush's economic advisers argue, for \n     example, that the dividend tax cuts may generate more \n     growth than any conventional economic model can predict by \n     making investment in stocks more attractive; rising stock \n     prices will in turn encourage investment. Few economists \n     agree, however that eliminating dividend taxes will have \n     more than a modest impact on stock prices. And even a 20 \n     percent boost in stock prices from current levels does not \n     restore them to their recent highs.\n       Narrow politics, of course, can partly account for the Bush \n     administration's tax proposals. The tax cuts \n     disproportionately benefit the wealthy, which, after all, is \n     Bush's natural political constituency. But Bush's policies \n     may, in fact, best be explained by another, more radical \n     agenda. Extensive tax cuts will require Congress to limit the \n     growth of social programs and public investment and undermine \n     other programs altogether. If that is your vision of the best \n     direction America can take, the strategy makes some sense. \n     So, we were wrong about how dividend tax cuts stimulate \n     growth, you can almost hear the Bush advisers thinking. No \n     problem. Rising deficits will inevitably force Congress to \n     starve those ``wasteful'' social programs. The prospective \n     high deficits may even make it imperative to privatize Social \n     Security and Medicare eventually. Social spending is the \n     problem, goes the argument, not tax cuts.\n       The Bush administration has been inconsistent about its \n     economic rationales since it earliest days in office. First, \n     President Bush justified his $1.4 trillion tax cut in 2001 by \n     claiming the government should return surpluses to taxpayers \n     when the economy is strong. He found a convincing ally in \n     Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, whose \n     influence was critical to the tax cut's passage. Then, as the \n     economy appeared to be weakening, Bush argue that a tax cut \n     was needed for an entirely different reason. It would \n     stimulate the weak economy inherited from Bill Clinton. This \n     made sense, but as noted, the tax package was not a short-\n     term stimulus package.\n       When, by early 2003, there was no escaping the fact that \n     the federal budget would remain in long-term deficit, the \n     Bush administration's budget office did not issue the \n     customary 10-year forecast. Instead, it only forecast a five-\n     year budget. Beyond that, the Bush team said, economic events \n     were too uncertain.\n       The Congressional Budget Office, however, does not enjoy \n     such flexibility. It produced its standard 10-year outlook, \n     which spelled out the obvious. But to give the Bush \n     administration its due, a more recent C.B.O,. analysis also \n     tried to take into account the possible growth incentives of \n     the tax cuts. Based on at least seven different approaches to \n     how government policies may affect future finances, none of \n     the Congressional Budget Office's economic projections \n     eliminated the future deficit. To the contrary, they all \n     clustered around the original $1.8 trillion deficit figure \n     that the office had calculated earlier. (The number of \n     possible approaches to these forecasts alone suggests how \n     little is truly known about the impact of such changes.) \n     There would be a significant budget deficit every year \n     through at least 2013, and, by implication, for many years \n     after.\n       Can we live with these new deficits? If they remain as low \n     as the budget office predicts, they will come to less than 1 \n     percent of gross domestic product in the last few years of \n     the forecast. Even so, this will probably impede economic \n     growth. And by 2014, when baby boomer liabilities begin to \n     rise rapidly, there will be no easy way to finance them. As \n     Lee Price, the chief economist of the Senate Budget Committee \n     Democrats, points out, by 2010 or even earlier, the nation \n     will have to start gearing up to pay for the baby boom \n     retirement. This will require either a very large tax \n     increase or substantially reduced benefits. The financial \n     markets will force the government to become more responsible \n     about spending, or interest rates will be driven to \n     damagingly high levels.\n       And that's based on a moderately optimistic forecast, one \n     that assumes the economy grows at a healthy rate. \n     Specifically, it assumes that productivity--the output per \n     hour of work that is the primary source of growth--will rise \n     by 2 percent year. That is a rate slower than that of the \n     booming late 1990's, but it is considerably faster than the \n     average pace between 1973 and 1995.\n       The C.B.O.'s projection incorporates only changes proposed \n     in the Bush budget. But other costly adjustments will be \n     necessary. Most important, tax cuts will subject as many as \n     40 million taxpayers to the higher alternative minimum tax. \n     (The A.M.T. forces taxpayers, whose payments would be very \n     low on account of large deductions, to pay at least a minimum \n     rate.) The government will almost certainly change that, \n     further reducing tax revenues. Also, some expiring tax \n     provisions will surely be extended. Gale and Orszag of the \n     Brookings Institution find that these factors add another \n     $700 billion to the 10-year deficit. This does not include \n     war expenditures.\n       Dudley and McKelvey of Goldman Sachs reach their estimated \n     $4.2 trillion 10-year deficit by adding war and \n     reconstruction estimates. They also expect that Congress will \n     pass a substantially higher provision for reimbursement of \n     prescription drug costs under Medicare than Bush has \n     proposed, and that economic growth will be slower than \n     anticipated.\n       These and several other realistic assumptions result in a \n     federal deficit that is unquestionably a terrible burden. The \n     deficits will require so much borrowing that the Goldman \n     economists figure that the size of the federal debt will rise \n     from 33 percent of gross domestic product to 49 percent. \n     This, even more than annual deficits, alarms economists. The \n     federal revenue needed just to pay the interest will be \n     enormous.\n       Even this estimate does not take into account a realistic \n     view of the costs of war and a new foreign-policy doctrine \n     that could mean military involvement elsewhere. The $75 \n     billion in appropriations that the Bush administration \n     recently asked for covers only the first six months in Iraq. \n     As for the\n\n[[Page S5168]]\n\n     costs of peace, it is hard to make any sensible assessment. \n     Some military experts claim that the presence of only 50,000 \n     troops will be required. Gen. Eric Shinseki, the Army chief \n     of staff, estimates that as many as 200,000 troops will be \n     needed. That could well cost $50 billion a year. There are \n     wide-eyed hopes that Iraq's oil revenues will defray most of \n     the cost of reconstruction, but it will take several years to \n     bring production to its full potential, as well as billions \n     of dollars--and that's assuming there is complete peace. Some \n     put the estimates of maintaining peace and building democracy \n     in the hundreds of billions of dollars.\n       And implementing the new world vision Bush has discussed \n     recently will require still more money. An ongoing presence \n     in the Middle East beyond Iraq will soak up additional \n     billions; potential crises in Korea and elsewhere will demand \n     expensive attention. As I understand it, since even before \n     the war started, the Defense Department has been spending \n     money so fast it can't keep track of it. In sum, the new \n     defense commitment looks open-ended.\n       The budget resolution the House passed last month makes \n     clear the dollar amount of cuts in domestic programs that \n     would have to be made in order to retain something close to \n     fiscal balance in Washington in 10 years. They will involve \n     deep cuts in programs from Medicaid to school lunches to \n     college loans to, perhaps most cynically in the current \n     environment, veterans' benefits. The Center on Budget and \n     Policy Priorities calculates that reductions in mandatory \n     programs for the elderly, veterans and the poor would come to \n     $265 billion over 10 years. Another $210 billion would be \n     lopped off of discretionary programs. The total of $475 \n     billion is about equal to the tax reduction the president is \n     requesting for the top 1 percent of earners in America.\n       To make this politically palatable, the reductions would be \n     phased in. Average reductions would be only 1 percent in the \n     first year, but they would rise rapidly and would average 4 \n     percent over 10 years. In the worst years, the budget for \n     Medicaid would be cut by 7 percent.\n       But the House bill is based on the C.B.O. projections. If \n     other economists are right, and the deficits are considerably \n     larger, still greater cuts will be required to balance the \n     budget over time--in fact, perhaps double the amount. The \n     Bush administration insists that it can live with the budget \n     deficits and still maintain many of these programs. Denial \n     has become almost a ritual. But it cannot have anticipated \n     how quickly America's finances have turned to red, and it is \n     not very likely that it is prepared to face the reality that \n     the financial markets, if not Congress, will eventually \n     impose on it. If there is no growth miracle on the horizon \n     that would raise government revenues, the Bush \n     administration's options will be limited not only \n     domestically, which may be part of its design, but also \n     militarily. The administration may well be compromising its \n     own dearest goals.\n       The longer we wait, the harder it will be to correct the \n     nation's finances. Most of us will be hit from both ends. \n     Incomes will not rise the way they did in the late 1990's, \n     and it will be difficult to save for retirement. The rising \n     costs of education and health care will be harder for the \n     typical family to meet. Meanwhile, government will not have \n     the money to help. Programs may be cut across the board. And \n     consider what was not accomplished in the 1990's, despite the \n     nation's prosperity. More than 40 million Americans still \n     have no health insurance. The United States has the highest \n     proportion of children born into poverty in the developed \n     world. The quality of education remains grossly unequal. Even \n     two-worker families cannot afford quality day care. Much \n     remains to be done.\n       There is time for a course correction. But the longer the \n     nation waits, the harder the problems will be to fix. \n     Forecasting the economic future, as everyone knows by now, is \n     no sure thing. But the federal government simply cannot \n     indefinitely spend so much more than it takes in. At some \n     point, the nation will either raise taxes significantly or \n     make painful cuts in cherished federal programs.\n       But as long as the full consequences of Bush's extravagance \n     are not immediate, and war limits serious public criticism, \n     the president may for now get away with promising guns and a \n     little butter. And we will all pay for it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/10/senate-section/article/S5168-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5168]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n       TRIBUTE TO THE PIKEVILLE HIGH SCHOOL FRESHMAN CHEERLEADERS\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

Mr. President, on April 26, 2003, more than 1,200 \nstudents from across the United States will visit Washington, DC, to \ncompete in the national finals of the ``We the People: The Citizen and \nthe Constitution'' program, the most extensive educational program in \nthe country developed specifically to educate young people about the \nConstitution and the Bill of Rights.\n  I am pleased and proud to announce that a class from Findlay High \nSchool from Findlay, OH, will represent our state in the upcoming \nnational event. These young scholars have worked conscientiously to \nreach the national finals by participating at local and statewide \ncompetitions. As a result of their experience, they have gained a \nthorough knowledge and deep understanding of the fundamental principles \nand values of our constitutional democracy.\n  The 3-day We the People national competition is modeled after \nhearings in the Congress. The hearings consist of oral presentations by \nhigh school students before a panel of adult judges on constitutional \ntopics. The students are given an opportunity to demonstrate their \nknowledge while they evaluate, take, and defend positions on relevant \nhistorical and contemporary issues. Their testimony is followed by a \nperiod of questioning by the judges who probe the students' depth of \nunderstanding and ability to apply their constitutional knowledge.\n  The We the People program provides curricular materials at upper \nelementary, middle, and high school levels. The curriculum not only \nenhances students' understanding of the institutions of American \nconstitutional democracy, but it also helps them identify the \ncontemporary relevance of the Constitution and Bill of Rights. Critical \nthinking exercises, problem-solving activities, and cooperative \nlearning techniques help develop participatory skills necessary for \nstudents to become active, responsible citizens.\n  Furthermore, independent studies by the Educational Testing Service, \nETS, revealed that students enrolled in the We the People program at \nupper elementary, middle, and high school levels significantly \noutperformed comparison students on every topic of the tests taken. \nAnother study by Richard Brody at Stanford University discovered that \nstudents involved in the We the People program develop greater \ncommitment to democratic principles and values than do students using \ntraditional textbooks and approaches. Researchers at the Council for \nBasic Education noted:\n\n       [T]eachers feel excited and renewed. . . . Students are \n     enthusiastic about what they have been able to accomplish, \n     especially in terms of their ability to carry out a reasoned \n     argument. They have become energized about their place as \n     citizens of the United States.\n\n  The class from Findlay High School is currently preparing for their \nparticipation in the national competition, and it is inspiring how \nthese young people advocate the fundamental ideals and principles of \nour government--ideas that identify us as a people and bind us together \nas a Nation. I send these fine young constitutional experts my best \nwishes as they compete in the We the People national finals.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/10/senate-section/article/S5169-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5169]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S5169]]\n IN RECOGNITION OF ARCHBISHOP VATCHE HOVSEPIAN ON THE 52ND ANNIVERSARY \n         OF HIS ORDINATION AND FOR HIS SERVICE TO THE COMMUNITY\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to bring to the \nSenate's attention His Eminence Archbishop Vatche Hovsepian, on the \n52nd anniversary of his ordination.\n  Archbishop Hovsepian is an inspirational and dynamic leader in the \nArmenian Church, and this milestone anniversary is a symbol of the \nArchbishop's 52 years of dedicated service and commitment to the \nArmenian people and the greater community in which he serves. Since \n1996, he has served as the Archbishop of the Western Diocese of the \nArmenian Church of North America.\n  During his 50 years of service to his Church and community, His \nEminence Vatche Hovsepian has been very active. The Archbishop has met \nwith five Presidents of the United States, along with various religious \nleaders and political figures from all over the world, created new \nparishes, Armenian schools and summer camps. His Eminence Vatche \nHovsepian has traveled and studied all over the world, thus allowing \nhim to have the knowledge of many customs, traditions, cultures and \nlanguages.\n  The Archbishop has spoken eloquently about the Armenian Genocide and \nthe importance that it be remembered by Armenians and people around the \nworld.\n  He has addressed the California State legislature and been warmly \nreceived. He is widely known for his good works, including assistance \nwith reconstruction in Armenia after the 1988 earthquake.\n  His Eminence Archbishop Vatche Hovsepian is a warm, compassionate and \ncharismatic leader who is most deserving of the outpouring of \nadmiration that greets him today and each day. I am honored to pay \ntribute to him, and I encourage my colleagues to join me in \ncongratulating the Archbishop on this grand anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/10/senate-section/article/S5169-2", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5169]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/10/senate-section/article/S5169-3", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5169]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a treaty which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/10/senate-section/article/S5169-4", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5169]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:14 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1036.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Wyoming relative to tax treatment of Health \n     insurance; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                         Joint Resolution No. 1\n\n       Whereas, the high cost of health insurance has created a \n     large number of uninsured citizens in the United States and \n     the State of Wyoming;\n       Whereas, those without health insurance are less likely to \n     receive adequate health care;\n       Whereas, insurance purchasing decisions are to a large \n     extent made by employees and not insurance beneficiaries;\n       Whereas, overraliance on empoloyer-provided health \n     insurance impedes worker mobility;\n       Whereas, spiraling health care costs are in part caused by \n     a lack of active consumer participation in health care \n     markets;\n       Whereas, employers can deduct the full cost of employee \n     health insurance as a business expense, while individuals may \n     not: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the members of the Legislature of the State of \n     Wyoming:\n       Section 1. That the Wyoming State Legislature petitions the \n     Congress of the United States to equalize the tax treatment \n     of employer-provided and individually purchase health \n     insurance by creating a tax credit for the full amount of \n     insurance purchased by individuals.\n       Section 2. That the Secretary of State of Wyoming transmit \n     copies of the resolution to the President of the United \n     States, to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the \n     House of Representatives of the United States Congress and to \n     the Wyoming Congressional Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-78. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Wyoming relative to the declaration of an \n     emergency in watersheds located in the national forests \n     within Wyoming; to the Committee on Environment and Public \n     Works.\n       Whereas, the Wyoming State Legislature finds that:\n       (a) A state of emergency exists in Wyoming due to a \n     shortage, and ever diminishing aggregate total supply, of \n     water available to its citizens, communities, livestock, \n     wildlife and their habitats.\n       (b) Virtually all Wyoming communities have been seriously \n     threatened and impacted by a shortage of available water \n     within the last calendar year.\n       (c) Virtually all Wyoming waterways are either presently \n     experiencing, or within the last calendar year have \n     experienced, a significant depletion of available water as \n     well as the streams and tributaries that contribute water to \n     the waterways.\n       (d) Most Wyoming livestock, wildlife and threatened or \n     endangered species are now or are likely to be seriously \n     imperiled by a shortage of available water either directly or \n     indirectly via the impact of the water shortage on their \n     supply of forage or prey base.\n       (e) Due to the existence of this declared state of \n     emergency it is imperative that Wyoming promptly take \n     necessary actions to restore and increase the aggregate total \n     supply of water available within the state.\n       (f) This state's aggregate total supply of water is \n     significantly dependent upon watersheds located on federal \n     lands. To achieve an increase in the aggregate total supply \n     of water in Wyoming it is imperative for the state to take \n     appropriate actions that may be available to remedy the \n     presently existent deteriorated conditions of these \n     watersheds.\n       (g) The existence of excessive overgrowth on Wyoming's \n     federal forests has been publicly acknowledged and declared \n     both by state officials and in 2002 by the President of the \n     United States, members of his cabinet, other administration \n     officials and numerous members of the United States Congress.\n       (h) Numerous state and local Wyoming elected officials and \n     other citizens have repeatedly petitioned the United States \n     Forest Service over the last several years to take actions \n     needed to remove or eliminate the excessive forest overgrowth \n     conditions that exist on watersheds on the federal lands \n     within the state of Wyoming. All the petitions have been \n     effectively ignored by the Secretary of Agriculture and other \n     officers within the federal government under her authority, \n     reflecting what can only be characterized as their utter \n     disregard for both the needs of Wyoming citizens and \n     wildlife, and Wyoming's lawful rights to the waterflows.\n       (j) The United States Congress, in pertinent \n     part, expressly provided that ``No national forest shall \n     be established, except to improve and protect the forest \n     within the boundaries, or for the purpose of securing \n     favorable conditions of waterflows . . .'' 16 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 475. Congress reaffirmed this directive when it \n     passed the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960 by \n     specifically stating that the national forests ``shall be \n     administered'' for ``watershed'' purposes, 16 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 528 et seq.\n       (k) The United States Supreme Court in United States v. New \n     Mexico, 438 U.S. 696 (1978) stated ``Congress has evidenced \n     its continuing concern with enhancing the water supply for \n     nonforest use by specifically authorizing the President to \n     set aside and protect national forest lands needed as sources \n     of municipal water supplies. 16 U.S.C. Sec. 552a.''\n\n[[Page S5171]]\n\n     Moreover, the Supreme Court further stated that the ``States \n     have exclusive control of the distribution of water on public \n     lands and reservations.''\n       (m) The following facts are indisputable:\n       (i) Wyoming's watersheds located on federal lands presently \n     contain millions of excess and unnecessary junipers and \n     conifers;\n       (ii) Each of these excess trees individually consumes from \n     ten (10) to two hundred (200) gallons of water each and every \n     day of the year, depending on its size;\n       (iii) Thus, in the aggregate, the millions of excess trees \n     on Wyoming's watersheds unnecessarily consume hundreds of \n     acre feet of water each and every day of the year;\n       (iv) The continued existence of the overgrowth serves no \n     legitimate federal or state purpose. In fact, these \n     conditions have been previously declared to constitute a \n     state of emergency because the catastrophic fire potential \n     they create poses a present unreasonable risk to the lives \n     and property of Wyoming citizens;\n       (v) The federal government's persistent failure to remove \n     the excess tree overgrowth from Wyoming's watersheds prevents \n     downstream flow to Wyoming in violation of the state's legal \n     entitlement to the diverted waters under both state and \n     federal law.\n       (n) Based on the foregoing findings of fact, the following \n     conclusions are indisputable:\n       (i) Wyoming has a legal entitlement to the waterflows that \n     either are or may be derived from federal lands within the \n     state;\n       (ii) The excessive overgrowth on the watersheds is \n     depriving the state of Wyoming of its legal entitlement to \n     the waters in direct violation of the mandates of the United \n     States Congress and the rulings of the United States Supreme \n     Court;\n       (iii) Therefore, to abate this illicit diversion of \n     Wyoming's water, to increase the aggregate total supply of \n     water available in and to Wyoming in the future, and to \n     thereby remedy the state of emergency declared by this act, \n     Wyoming hereby now affirms and asserts the supremacy of its \n     right over that of the federal government to the ownership \n     and use of those waters that are currently being unlawfully \n     diverted by the federal government without justification to \n     supply the demands of the needless federal forest overgrowth \n     on Wyoming's watersheds: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the members of the Legislature of the State of \n     Wyoming:\n       Section 1. That the legislature declares the existence of a \n     state of emergency due to a shortage of water available to \n     Wyoming caused in significant part by the deteriorating \n     conditions of the state's watersheds located on federal \n     lands. These conditions are due in turn to unnecessary \n     excessive forest overgrowth. This overgrowth is unlawfully \n     diverting Wyoming's waterflows, thus depleting Wyoming's \n     total supply of water available to its citizens, communities, \n     livestock, wildlife and wildlife habitats.\n       Section 2. (a) The legislature further finds that the \n     continued existence of the state of emergency poses a direct \n     threat to the health, safety, well-being and economic \n     viability of Wyoming's citizens and to the continued health \n     and viability of its communities, livestock, wildlife and \n     wildlife habitats. It is therefore imperative that Wyoming \n     take such actions as may be necessary to mitigate or \n     eliminate the federal forest watershed overgrowth conditions \n     that shall include the following:\n       (i) The state shall take any and all actions necessary to \n     obtain a transfer to the state of such limited jurisdiction \n     over federal lands as may be necessary to enable the state to \n     take appropriate actions that are needed to restore the \n     state's watersheds to a condition of health, and to increase \n     waterflows available within Wyoming; and\n       (ii) Upon the transfer of the limited jurisdiction, the \n     state shall utilize the police and contract powers of the \n     state to the extent necessary to garner the public and \n     private resources and services needed to mitigate and \n     ultimately eliminate the state of emergency hereby \n     declared.\n       Section 3. (a) The legislature further finds that to \n     further achieve the objectives of this resolution, within \n     ninety (90) days of this resolution, the governor of this \n     state shall consider:\n       (i) Taking actions necessary and appropriate pursuant to \n     the provision of 7 U.S.C. Sec. 2268 and any other state or \n     federal law that may be determined relevant by the attorney \n     general of this state in order to request and obtain from the \n     United States Secretary of Agriculture limited jurisdiction \n     over relevant federal lands as may be necessary for Wyoming \n     to restore its watersheds to a condition of health and \n     thereby increase the waterflows that may be derived from the \n     watersheds; and\n       (ii) Including within the application to the United States \n     Secretary of Agriculture for the transfer of the limited \n     jurisdiction an express provision that any acceptance by \n     Wyoming of a transfer of limited jurisdiction to restore \n     watershed health upon federal lands shall be conditioned on \n     Wyoming's receipt of sufficient federal funds determined by \n     Wyoming to be necessary to enable the state to perform the \n     actions needed to mitigate or eliminate the state of \n     emergency created by the federal government's impairment of \n     Wyoming's watersheds, waterflows and aggregate water \n     supplies.\n       Section 4. (a) The legislature further finds that in the \n     event limited jurisdiction coupled with necessary federal \n     funds are not made available by the United States Secretary \n     of Agriculture to Wyoming within one hundred eighty (180) \n     days from the date this resolution is passed, the governor \n     shall direct the Wyoming attorney general to consider the \n     preparation, filing and pursuit of a lawsuit on behalf of \n     Wyoming to:\n       (i) Obtain a judicial declaration of Wyoming's lawful right \n     to the waterflows originating from watersheds located on \n     federal lands within the state;\n       (ii) Obtain a judicial declaration of the impairment of the \n     state's rights to waterflows originating on federal lands as \n     a foreseeable consequence of excessive and unjustifiable \n     forest overgrowth; and\n       (iii) Compel the United States, the Secretary of \n     Agriculture and the Forest Service to take such actions as \n     may be determined by a court of law to be necessary, \n     appropriate and lawful to mitigate or eliminate the state of \n     emergency declared by this act.\n       Section 5. That the Secretary of State of Wyoming transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President of the United \n     States, to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the \n     House of Representatives of the United States Congress, to \n     the United States Secretary of Interior and the United States \n     Secretary of Agriculture and to the Wyoming Congressional \n     Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-79. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Kansas relative to urging the Federal Energy \n     Regulatory Commission to work to develop sufficient electric \n     transmission facility infrastructure and design and implement \n     regional transmission; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 5007\n\n       Whereas, The existing transmission systems in the United \n     States is an extensive network of high-voltage powers lines \n     which transport electricity from generators to consumers and \n     which must accommodate the nation's growing demand for \n     reliable and affordable power; and\n       Whereas, The system is rapidly becoming congested due to \n     growth in demand, investment in new generation facilities and \n     lack of investment in expansion and improvement of \n     transmission facilities; and\n       Whereas, Expansion and improvement of the transmission \n     system is vital to the national interest because congestion \n     creates bottlenecks which result in decreased reliability \n     less competition, higher prices to consumers and increased \n     infrastructure vulnerability; and\n       Whereas, The United States Department of Energy recognizes \n     that Kansas transmission system is vital to the national \n     interest because congestion creates bottlenecks which result \n     in decreased reliability, less competition, higher prices to \n     consumers and increased infrastructure vulnerability; and\n       Whereas, The existing transmission systems is increasingly \n     incapable of providing reliable service to the nature load in \n     Kansas and does not have the capacity to support economic \n     development of renewable and fossil-fuel resources or to \n     economically dispatch power within the state; and\n       Whereas, The existing transmission system experience \n     significant constraints to the importation of additional \n     power from outside the state and export of additional power \n     to markets beyond the state's boundaries in support of \n     national energy reliability and clean air standards; and\n       Whereas, The leadership of the Federal Energy Regulatory \n     Commission is crucial to resolving issues related to cost \n     recovery of transmission facility upgrades and regional \n     transmission system reliability issues: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the State of \n     Kansas, the Senate concurring therein, That the Legislature \n     urges the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to work with \n     the State of Kansas in development of sufficient transmission \n     facility infrastructure to support the state's economic \n     development efforts and the nations growing energy, security \n     and reliability needs, along with the design and \n     implementation of regional transmission organizations and \n     cost recovery mechanisms, and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of State is directed to \n     provide a copy of this enrolled resolution to each member of \n     the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the President of \n     the United States, the Vice-President of the United States, \n     the United States Secretary of Energy, the President Pro \n     Tempore of the United States Senate, the Minority leader of \n     the United States House of Representatives, each member of \n     the Kansas Congressional delegation, he State Corporation \n     Commission, the Nebraska Power Review Board, the Missouri \n     Public Service Commission, the Oklahoma Corporation \n     Commission and the Public Utility Commission of Texas.\n       I hereby certify that the above Concurrent Resolution \n     originated in the House, and was adopted by that body.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-80. A Senate resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Michigan relative to expressing support to the \n     war in Iraq; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 37\n\n       Whereas, While our nation has faced a wide range of threats \n     to our freedom over the years, the unique war on terrorism in \n     which we now find ourselves engaged demands an exceptional \n     commitment. From our leaders and our military to our citizens \n     and state and local governments, we all must work together to \n     increase the security of our homeland. In the aftermath of \n     September 11th,\n\n[[Page S5172]]\n\n     our country must deal with the entire range of terrorist \n     threats before us; and\n       Whereas, The ongoing preparations for a military action to \n     deal with threats from Iraq and its weapons of mass \n     destruction are a direct and necessary response for the \n     United States and our allies. As the world learns more about \n     the links between the reign of hatred of Saddam Hussein and \n     international terrorist organizations, including those \n     affiliated with Osama bin Laden, the gravity of the world's \n     situation has become increasingly clear. The smokescreen of \n     misinformation that has hampered United Nations efforts in \n     Iraq must not be permitted to jeopardize the homeland \n     security of our nation or the stability of other parts of the \n     world; and\n       Whereas, A number of Michigan citizen soldiers are engaged \n     in the noble effort to defend our liberties. In addition to \n     those already serving in the military, several reserve units \n     have been called into duty. It is important to voice our \n     support for all of them, as their courage and steadfastness \n     in the face of war represents the highest standard of \n     citizenship. For the families with loved ones in the \n     military, the world's tensions take on much more intensity. \n     Once again, we are reminded that the true cost of freedom is \n     clearly beyond measure; and\n       Whereas, Unity in the face of adversity is essential for \n     success in any grave battle. The people of this state, well \n     aware of the high stakes of any military action, stand behind \n     our President in his work to protect peace in our troubled \n     world: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we express support for the \n     President's strategy for protecting the security of the \n     United States through our efforts in Iraq and to express \n     support for the men and women of our military and their \n     families; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/10/senate-section/article/S5172-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5172]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. GREGG, from the Committee on Health, Education, \n     Labor, and Pensions, without amendment:\n       S. 880.

A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to prohibit \ntaking minors across State lines in circumvention of laws requiring the \ninvolvement of parents in abortion decisions; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Child Custody \nProtection Act. This legislation makes it a Federal offense to \nknowingly transport a minor across a State line, with the intent that \nshe obtain an abortion, in circumvention of a State's parental consent \nor parental notification law.\n  I have three young children in school, including a daughter, so I \nknow something about parental consent. My wife and I, like most \nparents, have to give our written consent for school activities all the \ntime.\n  In most schools, an underage child can't go on a school field trip \nwithout a signed permission slip. An underage child also can't receive \nmild medication at school, such as aspirin, for the alleviation of pain \nor discomfort unless a parent signs a release form permitting the \nschool nurse to administer it. In some schools, a child may not take \nsex education class without parental consent. Nothing, however, \nprevents this same child from being taken across State lines, in direct \ndisobedience of State laws, for the purpose of undergoing a life-\naltering abortion.\n  The Child Custody Protection Act simply attempts to strengthen the \neffectiveness of State laws designed to protect children from the \nhealth and safety risks associated with abortion. In many cases, only a \ngirl's parents know of her prior psychological and medical history, \nincluding allergies to medication and anesthesia. Also, parents are \nusually the only people who can provide authorization for post-abortion \nmedical procedures or the release of pertinent data from family \nphysicians. When a pregnant girl is taken to have an abortion without \nher parents' knowledge, none of these precautions can be taken. The \nharsh reality is that leaving parents uniformed about their underage \ndaughter's abortion may not only be detrimental to the physical and \nmental health of the child but may, in some instances, be fatal.\n  This legislation does not supercede, override, or in any way alter \nexisting State parental involvement laws. It does not impose any \nparental notice or consent requirement on any State. The Child Custody \nProtection Act addresses the interstate transportation of minors in \norder to circumvent valid, existing state laws and uses the authority \nof Congress to regulate interstate activity to protect those laws from \nevasion.\n\n[[Page S5176]]\n\n  Currently, forty-three States have laws requiring a minor to get the \nconsent of or notify one or both parents prior to an abortion, but only \nthirty-three are enforcing those measures. Most of the statutes apply \nto a child under the age of 18 and provide for a court bypass procedure \nshould she be unable to involve her parents.\n  This legislation is a common sense solution to a dire problem. A \nminor who is forbidden to drink alcohol, to stay out past a certain \nhour, or to drive a car in some states is certainly not prepared to \nmake a life-altering, hazardous decision, such as an abortion, without \nthe consultation or consent of at least one parent.\n\n  In fact, a poll found that 85 percent of voters, including 75 percent \nof ``pro-choice'' voters, said ``No'' when asked, ``Should a person be \nable to take a minor girl across State lines to obtain an abortion \nwithout her parents' knowledge?''\n  I would like to thank the original cosponsors of this bill for their \nsupport, Senators Brownback, Inhofe, Talent, Santorum, Grassley, Enzi, \nSessions, Allen, Bunning, Fitzgerald, Chambliss, DeWine, McConnell, \nColeman, Kyl, Nickles, Lindsey Graham, Bond, Hagel, Craig, McCain and \nHatch. I look forward to working with them, and other members of the \nSenate, to ensure that underage girls are protected from unscrupulous \nindividuals who want them to make a life-altering decision without \nparental involvement.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 851\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Transportation of minors in circumvention of certain laws \n  relating to abortion..........................................2431''.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to join with my colleagues in \nintroducing the Child Custody Protection Act and express my strong \nsupport for this important piece of legislation. Similar legislation \nwas previously introduced in past sessions of Congress but, and I am \nsad to say, never was signed into law. However, I hope that today is \nthe beginning of a new day to help protect the health and safety of \nchildren while safeguarding the rights and responsibilities of parents.\n  This bill is a reasonable effort to build upon two basic points with \nwhich many agree--despite other longstanding differences. The first is \nthe desirability of parental involvement in a minor's abortion \ndecision, and the other is the need to protect a pregnant minor's \nphysical health.\n  This bill does not supersede, override, or in any way alter existing \nState parental consent or notification laws. Nor does this bill require \nStates to implement their own parental involvement laws. The Child \nCustody Protection Act simply makes it a Federal offense to knowingly \ntransport a female minor across a state line, with the intent that she \nobtain an abortion, in circumvention of State laws requiring parental \nconsent or notification.\n  This bill, I would emphasize, is not a Federal parental involvement \nlaw; it merely ensures that State laws are not evaded through \ninterstate activity. The Federal Government is not trying to tell the \nStates how they must act and when, and this bill is not forcing parents \nto be good parents. This legislation strengthens the effectiveness of \nState laws, which is where the issue is best addressed and enforced. If \nwe fail to pass this bill, we would be choosing to ignore the \nlegitimacy and constitutionality of States to create and pass laws that \nspecifically address the needs and desires of its citizens, especially \nwhen it comes to the health and safety of children.\n  The Child Custody Protection Act is a reasonable and rational \napproach to fixing a serious problem. In most places, a school nurse \ncannot provide an aspirin to a student for a headache without \npermission from the parent. Students cannot go on field trips without \nparental approval. Some report cards need a parent's signature to \nverify the parent knows how their child is performing academically.\n  This bill is not addressing something relatively trivial; it is \ndrawing attention to a very serious medical procedure and protecting \nthe health and safety of young girls. States that choose to implement \nparental notification laws because of their concerns with the well-\nbeing and safety of children should have every tool necessary to \nenforce their own laws.\n  An abortion is a risky medical procedure, especially for young \nteenagers. This bill is designed to protect children from the health \nand safety risks associated with abortion. In many cases, only a young \ngirl's parents know of her prior psychological and medical history, \nincluding allergies to medication and anesthesia. Many other medical \nprocedures in this country require the\n\n[[Page S5177]]\n\nconsent of parents before they are performed. Also, parents are usually \nthe only people who can provide authorization for post-abortion medical \nprocedures or even release important information from family \nphysicians. Given all of these other important medical situations that \nrequire parental consent, it is only reasonable and logical to \nrecognize and enforce a States law asking for parental consent or \nnotification for certain abortions.\n  We all know how contentious the issue of abortion can get around \nhere, and across the country. But this matter is not really even about \nabortion. This bill is simply about protecting the health and safety of \nminor children and the rights that their own States have concluded \ntheir parents should have.\n  I would urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation and \nprevent circumvention of State laws, especially when the health and \nsafety of children is involved.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Smith, and Mr. \n        Leahy):\n  S. 852. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to provide \nlimited TRICARE program eligibility for members of the Ready Reserve of \nthe Armed Forces, to provide financial support for continuation of \nhealth insurance for mobilized members of reserve components of the \nArmed Forces, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed \nServices.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I join with a bipartisan group of \ncolleagues from the Senate Guard Caucus to introduce the National Guard \nand Reserve Comprehensive Health Benefits Act of 2003. This bill will \nallow reservists and their families to receive health coverage through \nTricare by paying a modest premium.\n  These dedicated men and women deserve a better benefit package, given \nthe dramatic expansion of their role within our military. Indeed, there \nis concern that the high rate of mobilizations--which no one expects to \nabate--will erode this force's ability to recruit and retain top-notch \npersonnel. South Dakota Guard leaders tell me this bill would be \nperhaps the most powerful tool we could give them for recruiting and \nretention. By providing access to quality affordable health care for \nreservists and their families, this bill will also ensure that when \nthey are mobilized, they are healthy and ready to go.\n  As I stand before you today, nearly 2,000 members of South Dakota's \nGuard and Reserves are deployed throughout the world--from force-\nprotection missions at home to assignments in Europe and the Persian \nGulf. Most of these reservists will be mobilized for 6 months, and some \nwill stay activated for up to 2 years. And while South Dakota has one \nof the highest per-capita mobilization rates in the country, it is not \nunique. As the U.S. role as an international leader evolves, the \nNational Guard and Reserves are being called upon at unprecedented \nrates to bolster our Nation's defense.\n  Indeed, since the 1991 gulf war, and particularly since the \nterrorists attacks of September 11, the demands on Reserve and Guard \nunits have increased steadily. Not only are more reservists deployed \nmore often, they are also activated for increasingly diverse tasks. \nHistorically, this force has helped address a wide variety of social \nneeds--from enforcing civil rights laws to fighting forest fires--and \nhomeland defense is shaping us a major new duty that will require its \nsustained engagement.\n  While the demands we place on reservists have grown markedly in the \nlast decade, the Federal Government's commitment to this dedicated \ngroup of men and women has not kept pace. In fact, the basic pay and \nbenefit structure that was established during the cold war--when \nreservists could see their entire career pass by without being \nactivated--remains in place today. As a result, leaders of the National \nGuard and Reserves are increasingly worried about their ability to \nrecruit and retain new members.\n  The legislation we are introducing today takes a major step toward \nproviding the men and women of our Reserve components with the support \nthey need to carry out their new, vital role in the total force \nstructure. It will offer Reserve and National Guard members the \nopportunity to participate for themselves and their family members in \nthe same Tricare program available to active-duty service members and \ntheir families. Reservists and their families will share the cost of \npremium payments with the Department of Defense, with the same cost \ndistribution as used in the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan. This \nprogram will help the National Guard and Reserves attract and keep the \nbest and brightest men and women in the Nation.\n  The National Guard Association of the United States reports that the \naverage cost of a family health care plan through a civilian HMO is \n$7,541 per year. In contrast, it estimates that the Tricare cost per \nfamily is only $5,173 per year, even without the Government sharing any \nof the cost. With Government cost-sharing, this will be an attractively \npriced option for securing health coverage.\n  Beyond recruitment and retention, this program will improve \nreadiness. More than 20 percent of the Ready Reserve--and as much as 40 \npercent of young enlisted personnel--do not currently have health \ninsurance. Providing access to quality health care during all phases of \nservice can drastically reduce the occurrence of situations in which \nlarge portions of a unit are unable to deploy because of medical \nreasons. Maintaining a healthy force is absolutely essential to \nmaintaining a prepared force.\n  Our legislation will also reduce the incidence of problems that \ninvariably occur during mobilization, when families leave their \nprivate-sector health plan and enter a wholly new plan, Tricare. Last \nmonth, I worked with Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld to end a \nnationwide problem among families of mobilized reservists. Simply put, \nthey were being forced, unfairly and improperly, to join a more \nexpensive Tricare plan. We did solve that problem, but many families \nhad to wait weeks without knowing whether they should try to extend \ntheir private coverage or whether they could afford Tricare. That is \nsimply unacceptable. It is the last thing a reservist should have to \nworry about when preparing, possibly, for deployment to a war zone.\n  Another challenge for families going through mobilization is learning \nthe Tricare benefit structure and understanding its system for helping \nthose with problems or questions. Again, all this would be eliminated \nif families could enroll in Tricare before mobilization. If a family \nbelieves its employer's civilian plan is superior, they would be free \nto remain, and, during periods of mobilization, those premiums would be \npartially subsidized.\n  We have developed this bill in consultation with leaders of the \nNational Guard and Reserves at the State and National levels. I \nappreciate their concern for this problem and their work to help \ndevelop a solution. In this regard, I would particularly like to \nacknowledge the efforts and strong support of the South Dakota National \nGuard, as well as the Military Officers Association of America, the \nEnlisted Association of the National Guard, the National Guard \nAssociation of the United States, the Reserve Officers Association, the \nMarine Corps Reserve Officers Association, the National Military Family \nAssociation, the National Association for Uniformed Services, and the \nNational Military/Veterans Association.\n  I would like also to thank my cosponsors, Senator Leahy, Senator \nDeWine, and Senator Gordon Smith, for helping advance this project.\n  Guaranteeing that all reservists have access to health care--either \nthrough civilian employers or Tricare--will ensure that this force is \nready to fight at a moment's notice. The bill we are introducing today \nwill not only improve the readiness of the current Reserve Force, but \nwill pay dividends in the future by improving our ability to recruit \nand retain the best and brightest men and women for the National Guard \nand Reserves.\n  The Senate has set aside time each day for the last 3 weeks to honor \nand support the dedicated service of our troops in Iraq. Surely we can \nagree that one of our high priorities should be to ensure that, as long \nas they continue their service to our country, they will always have \naccess to high-quality affordable health care.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am joined by Senator DeWine, by our \nminority leader, Senator Daschle, and\n\n[[Page S5178]]\n\nby Senator Smith in introducing legislation that will boost the \nreadiness of our Nation's military Reserve.\n  Never has our Nation relied more heavily on the Selected Reserve--\nmore than 875,000 men and women, who stand ready for deployments at \nhome or abroad, at a moment's notice. More than 54 percent of the U.S. \nArmy's and 34 percent of the U.S. Air Force's end strength resides in \nthe Selected Reserve. Both the Army and the Marine Corps rely on these \nReserve forces for almost 20 percent of their manpower strength. The \nskill, experience and professionalism of these dedicated citizens often \nmeet and exceed those of their brave counterparts in the active force.\n  It is no wonder that more than 200,000 reservists have been called to \nduty for service that is related to the war in Iraq. Many States have \nthousands of their citizens who have temporarily dropped their civilian \njobs and left their families for deployments halfway across the globe. \nMore than 300 citizen-soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines in my home \nState of Vermont are serving proudly at the moment, here and abroad. \nWhen you include the call-ups since the September 11 attacks, the \nnumber of activated reservists across the country far exceeds those in \nthe first gulf war.\n  These deployments have spotlighted some specific and solvable \nproblems that have affected the readiness of the reserves and, in turn, \nour entire military. Some of the troops who have been called up have \nnot been as healthy as possible. Others have faced the stress of \nleaving their families behind while looking back in concern as their \nfamilies try to navigate the sometimes arcane military health care \nsystem. While often experiencing a loss of income, reserve family \nmembers also have had to leave their civilian doctors and join the \nmilitary's TRICARE program.\n  More troubling, many of the members of the Guard and Reserve who \nmight be activated any day do not currently have access to affordable \nhealth insurance. A recent General Accounting Office report underscores \nthe fact that most of these uninsured Guard and Reservists reside in \nthe lower enlisted ranks, where the reserve soldiers, sailors, airmen, \nand marines oftentimes are unemployed or switch jobs frequently. It is \nunfair to them and their families, and it is unwise for the \npreparedness of our military, to expect someone to deploy anywhere at \nthe drop of a hat, but then to disregard whether they will be as \nhealthy as possible when we need to call them to active duty.\n  These men and women are ready to make the ultimate sacrifice for \ntheir country, and so are their families. But they are performing as \nfull-time soldiers with part-time benefits.\n  This situation is preventing the National Guard and the Reserve from \nbeing as ready as possible for action. At the same time, the stress and \nstrain that activations place on families has hurt recruiting and \nretention. To ensure the strongest and most effective reserve and the \nstrongest and most effective military capability, it is critical that \nwe address these issues and provide comprehensive health insurance \ncoverage.\n\n  The National Guard and Reserve Comprehensive Health Benefits Act of \n2003 will provide seamless health coverage to our reserve forces at all \nphases of their service. Under our plan, if one of 876,000 members of \nthe Selected is in a drill status, that reservist and his or her family \nwill become eligible to join the TRICARE military health insurance \nprogram. The reservist will pay an annual premium, around 30 percent of \nthe annual cost of providing care. For a single reservist, the premium \nwould be about $420 per year, while for a family the annual payment \nwould be about $1,450. This is not rock-bottom-cheap health care, but \nour aim is to ensure affordable health insurance for hard-working \nfamilies that may not otherwise have access to coverage.\n  If a reservist is activated, he or she will continue to have free \nhealth care through the military health system. But under our \nlegislation, the reservist's family will be able to avoid the \nconsiderable difficulties of switching doctors and health insurance. \nThey also can apply to have their civilian health insurance reimbursed. \nThe program will not cost any more to the Federal Government than the \ncurrent arrangement because the per capita costs are capped to ensure \nthat they are no more than the cost of TRICARE. And when a reservist \ncomes off active duty, he or she will be able to enter the new premium-\nbased TRICARE program, just as before deployment.\n  Because reservists will be able to have access to affordable \ninsurance whatever their deployment status, this legislation is being \nsupported by several leading organizations, including the National \nGuard Association of the United States, NGAUS, the Enlisted National \nGuard Association of the United States, EANGUS, the Reserve Officers \nAssociation, ROA, the Naval Reserve Association, NRA, the National \nMilitary Family Association, NMFA, Marine Corps Reserve Officers \nAssociation, the National Association for Uniformed Services, the \nNational Military/Veterans Association, and the Military Officers \nAssociation, MOA. This legislation is the top priority of The Military \nCoalition's Guard/Reserve Committee.\n  We have worked hard to fully understand the existing problems and to \nconstruct this efficient and effective solution. I would particularly \nlike to thank former Undersecretary of Defense Fred Pang and former \nHouse Armed Services Committee Professional Staff Member Karen Heath \nfor their sage counsel and guidance in developing this legislation. We \nare part of a strong, bipartisan coalition that will push for enactment \nof this long-overdue legislation. In the coming weeks we plan to \nwelcome additional cosponsors for this comprehensive bill as we begin \nthe process of moving it without delay through the legislative process \nand to the President's desk.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 853. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \neliminate discriminatory copayment rates for outpatient psychiatric \nservices under the medicare program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Medicare \nMental Health Copayment Equity Act with my colleague on the Finance \nCommittee, Senator John Kerry.\n  In brief, my bill would a correct a serious disparity in payment for \ntreatment of mental disorders under Medicare law. Medicare \nbeneficiaries typically pay 20 percent copayment for outpatient \nservices, including doctor's visits and Medicare pays the remaining 80 \npercent. But for treatment of mental disorders, Medicare law requires \npatients pay a 50-percent copayment. Under my bill, this copayment will \nbe reduced over a six year period, starting in 2004, from the current \n50 percent to 20 percent. This means that in 2010, patients seeking \noutpatient treatment for mental illness will pay the same 20 percent \ncopayment required of Medicare patients that receive treatment for any \nother illness.\n  Let's look at this issue in another way. If a Medicare patient has an \noffice visit for treatment for cancer or heart disease, the patient is \nresponsible for 20 percent of the doctor's fee. But if a Medicare \npatient has an office visit with a psychiatrist, psychologist, social \nworker, or other professional for treatment for depression, \nschizophrenia, or any other condition diagnosed as a mental illness, \nthe copayment for the outpatient visit for treatment of the mental \nillness is 50 percent. What sense does this make?\n  Indeed, my bill has a larger purpose, to help end an outdated \ndistinction between physical and mental disorders, and ensure that \nMedicare beneficiaries have equal access to treatment for all health \nconditions. Perhaps this disparity would matter less if mental \ndisorders were not so prevalent. But the Surgeon General has told us \notherwise.\n  The importance of access to treatment for mental disorders is \nemphasized in a landmark report on mental health released by the \nSurgeon General in 1999. The Surgeon General reported mental illness \nwas second only to cardiovascular diseases in years of healthy life \nlost to either premature death or disability. And the occurrence of \nmental illness among older adults is widespread with a substantial \nproportion of the population 55 and older--almost 20 percent of this \nage group--experiencing specific mental disorders that are not part of \n``normal'' aging.\n  Further, older Americans have the highest rate of suicide in the \ncountry,\n\n[[Page S5179]]\n\nand the risk of suicide increases with age. In fact, in the State of \nMaine, the suicide rate for seniors is three times as high as the rate \nfor adolescents. Untreated depression among the elderly substantially \nincreases the risk of death by suicide.\n  There is another sad irony. While Medicare often is viewed as health \ninsurance for people over age 65, Medicare also provides health \ninsurance coverage for people with severe disabilities. The single most \nfrequent cause of disability for Social Security and Medicare benefits \nis mental disorders--affecting almost 1.4 million of 6 million \nAmericans who receive Social Security disability benefits. Yet, at the \nsame time, Medicare pays less for critical mental health services \nneeded by these beneficiaries than if they had a non-mental disability.\n  But there also is very good news that there are increasingly \neffective treatments for mental illnesses. With proper treatment, the \nmajority of people with a mental illness can lead productive lives. By \nremoving financial barriers that inhibit access to treatment services, \nwe will be able to eliminate stigmas and overcome a lack of \nunderstanding of mental disorders.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with me to bring Medicare payment policy \nfor mental disorders into the 21st century.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague Senator \nSnowe in introducing the Medicare Mental Health Copayment Equity Act. \nThis legislation will establish mental health care parity in the \nMedicare program.\n  Medicare currently requires patients to pay a 20 percent co-payment \nfor all Part B services except mental health care services, for which \npatients are assessed a 50 percent co-payment. Thus, under the current \nsystem, if a Medicare patient sees an endocrinologist for diabetes \ntreatment, an oncologist for cancer treatment, a cardiologist for heart \ndisease treatment or an internist for treatment of the flu, the co-\npayment is 20 percent of the cost of the visit. If, however, a Medicare \npatient visits a psychiatrist for treatment of mental illness, the co-\npayment is 50 percent of the cost of the visit. This disparity in \noutpatient co-payments represents blatant discrimination against \nMedicare beneficiaries with mental illness.\n  The prevalence of mental illness in older adults is considerable. \nAccording to the U.S. Surgeon General, 20 percent of older adults in \nthe community and 40 percent of older adults in primary care settings \nexperience symptoms of depression, while as many as one out of every \ntwo residents in nursing homes are at risk of depression. The elderly \nhave the highest rate of suicide in the United States, and there is a \nclear correlation between major depression and suicide: 60 to 70 \npercent of suicides among patients 75 and older have diagnosable \ndepression. In addition to our seniors, 400,000 non-elderly disabled \nMedicare beneficiaries become Medicare-eligible by virtue of severe and \npersistent mental disorders. To subject the mentally disabled to \ndiscriminatory costs in coverage for the very conditions for which they \nbecame Medicare eligible is illogical and unfair.\n  There is ample evidence that mental illness can be treated. \nUnfortunately, those in need of treatment often do not seek it because \nthey are ashamed of their condition. Among our Medicare population, the \nmentally ill face a double burden: not only must they overcome the \nstigma about their illness, but once they seek treatment they must pay \none-half of the cost of care out of their own pocket. The Medicare \nMental Health Copayment Equity Act will phase-down the 50 percent co-\npayment for mental health care services to 20 percent over six years. \nBy applying the same co-payment rate to mental health services to which \nall other outpatient services are subjected, the Medicare Mental Health \nCopayment Equity Act will bring parity to the Medicare program and \nimprove access to care for our senior and disabled beneficiaries who \nare living with mental illness. I urge my colleagues to join with us to \npass this critical legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that several letters of support be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                Maine Osteopathic Association,\n\n                                    Manchester, ME, April 9, 2003.\n     Hon. Olympia Snowe,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Snowe: On behalf of the osteopathic physicians \n     (D.O.'s) in Maine, I want to applaud your leadership efforts \n     in sponsoring the Medicare Mental Health Co-payment Equity \n     Act of 2003. This bill would end Medicare's unfortunate \n     discrimination against patients with mental illness.\n       We support this legislation that would end this \n     discrimination because it requires that Medicare patients pay \n     only the same 20 percent co-payment for mental illness \n     treatment that they pay when seeking other medical treatment, \n     such as treatment for diabetes, asthma or influenza.\n       The Maine Osteopathic Association appreciates your \n     thoughtfulness, commitment and compassion in equitably \n     treating persons with mental illness.\n       Your sponsorship of this most important bill is a major \n     step to end Medicare's discrimination coverage of mental \n     illness treatment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Daniel M. Pierce, D.O.\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    April 9, 2003.\n     Hon. John Kerry,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kerry: On behalf of the American Association \n     for Geriatric Psychiatry (AAGP), I am writing to add AAGP's \n     endorsement to legislation which you are planning to \n     introduce with Senator Snowe to end the discriminatory \n     copayment required by Medicare for treatment of mental \n     illness.\n       Medicare coverage of mental health services is fragmented \n     and subject to arbitrary and discriminatory limitations. \n     Although coinsurance for most services covered by Medicare is \n     20 percent, current law requires a 50 percent co-payment for \n     mental health services furnished by psychiatrists and other \n     health care professionals who specialize in the treatment of \n     mental illness. This limit, which dates back to the inception \n     of the Medicare program in 1965, is based on the outmoded \n     assumption that all mental illness is chronic and requires \n     unlimited therapeutic services. Advances in treatment have \n     made this assumption highly inaccurate. Your bill would \n     establish copayment parity between mental health benefits and \n     other medical benefits under the Medicare program.\n       Your legislation stands to dramatically improve the lives \n     of Medicare beneficiaries by providing them with the access \n     to mental health care that they deserve.\n       AAGP commends you for your dedication to ensuring that all \n     Americans have adequate access to effective mental health \n     treatments, and we look forward to working with you to \n     achieve the enactment of this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Joel E.

Olympia Snowe,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Snowe: On behalf of the 38,000 physician \n     members of the American Psychiatric Association (APA), and \n     most particularly on behalf of the patients they treat, \n     please accept my thanks for your House sponsorship of the \n     Medicare Mental Health Copayment Equity Act of 2003.\n       As you know, Medicare Part B requires by statute that \n     beneficiaries pay a copayment of 20 percent, except for the \n     discriminatory 50 percent copayment charged for outpatient \n     mental health treatment. It is time for Congress to end what \n     amounts to cost-sharing discrimination by diagnosis. The bill \n     you are introducing with Representative Richard Neal would \n     ultimately require Medicare beneficiaries to pay the same 20 \n     percent copayment amount for outpatient mental health \n     treatment as they would otherwise pay for other Part B \n     services. Asking our Medicare beneficiaries to pay half the \n     cost of their mental health care out of pocket is simply \n     unjust, and is a significant barrier to necessary treatment.\n       Thank you for your foresight and leadership in your lead \n     sponsorship of the Medicare Mental Health Copayment Equity \n     Act of 2003. Thanks are also due to the outstanding work by \n     Catherine Finely, who ably represents you. The APA looks \n     forward to working with you to make your bill a reality this \n     year.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          Paul S.

Olympia Snowe,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Snowe: On behalf of NAMI's 210,000 members and \n     1,200 affiliates I am writing to offer our strong support for \n     the Medicare Mental Illness Nondiscrimination Act. Thank you \n     for bringing forward this important legislation to bring a \n     discrimination in outpatient treatment services in the \n     Medicare program. As the nation's largest organization \n     representing persons with severe mental illness and their \n     families, we are extremely grateful for your leadership on \n     this important issue.\n       Perhaps the most glaring shortcoming in the Medicare \n     program is the discriminatory\n\n[[Page S5180]]\n\n     co-payment for most outpatient mental illness treatment \n     services. As you know, outpatient psychotherapy services are \n     covered at 50 percent under Medicare, with a 50 percent \n     beneficiary co-payment requirement. This is stark contrast to \n     the 80 percent payment, and 20 percent co-payment for all \n     other outpatient services. In NAMI's view, this is a clear \n     form of discrimination in one of the federal government's \n     most important health care programs--providing coverage to \n     more than 39 million Americans--both seniors and non-elderly \n     people with severe disabilities such as serious mental \n     illnesses. We know that treatment makes a tremendous \n     difference in the lives of persons with mental illness. Your \n     legislation removes a significant financial barrier to such \n     necessary care for the Medicare population.\n       Thank you for once again leading the way in the Congress in \n     bringing an end to discrimination against persons living with \n     severe mental illness.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Richard C.

Olympia Snowe,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Snowe, on behalf of the psychiatric physicians \n     of the Maine Psychiatric Society, I want to offer you my \n     sincere appreciation for your leadership in sponsoring the \n     Medicare Mental Health Copayment Equity Act of 2003, working \n     to end Medicare's historic discrimination against patients \n     with mental illness.\n       Your legislation would end this discrimination by requiring \n     that discriminatory copayments required of Medicare patients \n     for mental illness treatment would eventually be reduced from \n     the current 50 percent level to the 20 percent level patients \n     pay for other medical treatment, such as treatment for \n     diabetes, heart disease, or the flu. This legislation \n     promotes parity for mental health benefits and improves \n     access to mental health care for all Medicare beneficiaries \n     in Maine and across the country.\n       The Maine Psychiatric Association appreciates your ongoing \n     commitment to persons with mental illness, and your \n     sponsorship of this most important bill to end Medicare's \n     discriminatory coverage of mental illness treatment.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                         Edward Pontius, M.D.,\n\n                             Chair, Legislative Affairs Committee,\n     Maine Psychiatric Association.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    Maine Medical Association,\n\n                                                    April 9, 2003.\n     Hon. Olympia Snowe,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Snowe: I am writing to you on behalf of the \n     Maine Medical Association and the Maine Psychiatric \n     Association, representing over 2500 Maine-licensed \n     physicians, to thank you sincerely for assuming the \n     leadership in sponsoring the Medicare Mental Health Co-\n     payment Equity Act of 2003, that would end Medicare's \n     historic discrimination against patients with mental illness.\n       As you know, mental health illness and treatment are very \n     often complicated by concurrent major physical illnesses, \n     like cancer, heart disease, and diabetes. Unfortunately, co-\n     payment for treatment of mental illnesses are two and a half \n     times higher than that for physical illnesses. Your \n     legislation would end this discrimination by requiring that \n     Medicare patients pay only the same 20 percent co-payment for \n     mental illness treatment that they would pay when seeking \n     other medical treatment.\n       The Maine Medical Association and the Maine Psychiatric \n     Association appreciate your ongoing commitment to persons \n     with mental illness and your sponsorship of this most \n     important bill to end Medicare's discriminatory coverage of \n     mental illness treatment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Krishna Bhatta, M.D.,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             American Psychiatric Association,\n\n                                     Arlington, VA, April 9, 2003.\n     Hon. John Kerry,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kerry: On behalf of the 38,000 physician \n     members of the American Psychiatric Association (APA), and \n     most particularly on behalf of the patients they treat, \n     please accept my thanks for your House sponsorship of the \n     Medicare Mental Health Copayment Equity Act of 2003.\n       As you know, Medicare Part B requires by statute that \n     beneficiaries pay a copayment of 20 percent, except for the \n     discriminatory 50 percent copayment charged for outpatient \n     mental health treatment. It is time for Congress to end what \n     amounts to cost-sharing discrimination by diagnosis. The bill \n     you are introducing with Representative Richard Neal would \n     ultimately require Medicare beneficiaries to pay the same 20 \n     percent copayment amount for outpatient mental health \n     treatment as they would otherwise pay for other Part B \n     services. Asking our Medicare beneficiaries to pay half the \n     cost of their mental health care out of pocket is simply \n     unjust, and is a significant barrier to necessary treatment.\n       Thank you for your foresight and leadership in your lead \n     sponsorship of the Medicare Mental Health Copayment Equity \n     Act of 2003. Thanks are also due to the outstanding work by \n     Kelly Bovio, who ably represented you. The APA looks forward \n     to working with you to make your bill a reality this year.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          Paul S. Applebaum, M.D.,\n                                                        President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COLEMAN (for himself and Mr. Dayton):\n  S. 854. A bill to authorize a comprehensive program of support for \nvictims of torture, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill I \nintroduce today to authorize a comprehensive program of support for \nvictims of torture be printed in the Record.\n  There being on objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 854\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify \nthe unrelated business income limitation on investment in certain debt-\nfinanced properties; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Small \nBusiness Investment Company Capital Access Act of 2003 whose purpose is \nto increase the amount of venture capital available to small \nbusinesses. As the chair of the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I am pleased that my good friend and former chairman \nof the Committee, Senator Bond, and the chairman of the Senate Finance \nCommittee, Senator Grassley, have agreed to be the principal cosponsors \nof this important bill.\n  During the past 2 years, there has been a significant contraction of \nthe private equity market. During this same period, the Small Business \nAdministration's Small Business Investment Company program has taken on \na significant role in providing venture capital to small businesses \nseeking investments in the range of $500,000 to $3 million.\n  Small Business Investment Companies are government-licensed, \ngovernment-regulated, privately managed venture capital firms created \nto invest only in original issue debt or equity securities of U.S. \nsmall businesses that meet size standards set by law. In the current \neconomic environment, the SBIC program represents an increasingly \nimportant source of capital for small enterprises.\n  While debenture SBICs qualify for SBA-guaranteed borrowed capital, \nthe Government guarantee forces a number of potential investors, namely \npension funds and university endowment funds, to avoid investing in \nSBICs because they would be subject to tax liability for unrelated \nbusiness taxable income. More often than not, tax-exempt investors opt \nto invest in venture capital funds that do not create UBTI. As a result \nan estimated 60 percent of the private capital potentially available to \nthese SBICs is effectively off limits.\n  The Small Business Investment Company Capital Access Act of 2003 \nwould correct this problem by excluding government-guaranteed capital \nof debenture SBICs from debt for purposes of the UBTI rules. This \nchange would permit tax-exempt organizations to invest in SBICs without \nthe burdens of UBTI recordkeeping or tax liability.\n  In 1958, Congress created the SBIC program to assist small business \nowners in obtaining investment capital. More than 40 years later, small \nbusinesses continue to experience difficulty in obtaining investment \ncapital from banks and traditional investment sources. Although \ninvestment capital is readily available to large businesses from \ntraditional Wall Street investment firms, small businesses seeking \ninvestments in the range of $500,000 to $3 million have to look \nelsewhere. SBICs are frequently the only sources of investment capital \nfor growing small businesses.\n  Often we are reminded that the SBIC program has helped some of our \nNation's best known companies. It has provided a financial boost at \ncritical points in the early growth period for many companies that are \nfamiliar to all of us. For example, when Federal Express needed help \nfrom reluctant credit markets, it received a needed infusion of capital \nfrom two SBA-licensed SBICs at a critical juncture in its development \nstage. The SBIC program also helped other well-known companies, when \nthey were not so well known, such as Intel, Outback Steakhouse, America \nOnline, and Callaway Golf.\n  What is not well known is the extraordinary help the SBIC program \nprovides to main street America small businesses. These are companies \nwe know from hometowns all over the United States. Main street \ncompanies provide both stability and growth in our local business \ncommunities.\n  In 1991, the SBIC program was experiencing major losses, and the \nfuture of the program was in doubt. Consequently, in 1992 and 1996, the \nCommittee on Small Business worked closely with the Small Business \nAdministration to correct deficiencies in the law in order to ensure \nthe future of the program.\n  Today, the SBIC program is expanding rapidly in an effort to meet the \ngrowing demands of small business owners for debt and equity investment \ncapital. And it is important to focus on the significant role that is \nplayed by the SBIC program in support of growing small businesses. When \nFortune Small Business compiled its list of 100 fastest growing small \ncompanies in 2000, six of the top 12 businesses on the list received \nSBIC financing during their critical growth year.\n  The Small Business Investment Company Capital Access Act of 2003 is \nimportant for one simple reason: once enacted it paves the way for more \ninvestment capital to be available for more small businesses that are \nseeking to grow and hire new employees. According to the National \nAssociation of Small Business Investment Companies, a conservative \nestimate of the effect of this bill would be to increase investments in \ndebenture SBICs by $200 million per year from tax-exempt investors. \nTogether with SBA-guaranteed leverage, that will mean as much as $500 \nmillion per year in new capital assets for debenture SBICs to invest in \nU.S. small businesses.\n  According to the SBA, one job is created for every $36,000 invested \nin a small company. At that rate, this bill could be responsible for \nthe creation or support of as many as 16,600 jobs--within companies \nreceiving investments directly as well as within those firms \nbenefitting indirectly through increased sales of goods and services to \nthe former companies. In short, this bill is a jobs creator.\n  And the cost? The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated in the last \nCongress that this bill would result in tax revenue loss of only $1 \nmillion per year for the next 10 years.\n  Mr. President, the cost is low and the potential for economic gain is \ngreat. Passage of the bill will make the Government's existing SBIC \nprogram more effective in providing growth capital for America's small \nbusiness entrepreneurs.\n  And most importantly, it will provide sorely needed capital for the \nsector of our economy that provides a majority of the net new jobs in \nthis country--small businesses. That is a real stimulus that would \ncause new investments to be made and the creation of critically needed \nnew jobs. Our economy is primed for this kind of support, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support this important bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a summary of \nits provisions be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    ``Small Business Investment Company Capital Access Act of 2003''\n\n\n                       description of provisions\n\n       The bill amends section 514 of the Internal Revenue Code to \n     exclude government-guaranteed capital borrowed by Debenture \n     Small Business Investment Companies (SBICs) from debt for \n     purposes of the Unrelated Business Taxable Income (UBTI) \n     rules. This change would permit tax-exempt organizations to \n     invest in SBICs without the burdens of UBTI record keeping or \n     tax liability.\n       Currently, while Debenture SBICs qualify for borrowed \n     capital guaranteed by the Small Business Administration, the \n     government guarantee forces a number of potential investors, \n     namely pension funds and university endowment funds, to avoid \n     investing in SBICs because they would be subject to tax \n     lability for UBTI. Frequently, tax-exempt investors generally \n     opt to invest in venture capital funds that do not create \n     UBTI. As a result, an estimated 60% of the private-capital \n     potentially available to these SBICs is effectively ``off \n     limits.''\n\n                                 S. 855\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na tax incentive to individuals teaching in elementary and secondary \nschools located in rural or high unemployment areas and to individuals \nwho achieve certification from the National Board for Professional \nTeaching Standards, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I am introducing two key \neducation initiatives designed to promote quality education across our \ncountry and respond to the compelling needs in our schools. When I meet \nwith teachers and parents, and even business leaders in West Virginia, \neveryone is concerned about the condition of our school buildings and \nthe importance of qualified committed teachers working in those \nclassrooms.\n  To address these clear and compelling needs, I am introducing two \neducation bills. The first initiative, America's Better Classroom Act \nof 2003, is a school construction initiative to respond to the \noverwhelming needs for school construction. The Department of Education \nreports that the average public school building is 42 years old. In \n1995, GAO estimated that we needed $112 billion for school construction \nand renovations. A more recent survey in 2001 in the Journal of \nEducation Finance indicates that the need is increasing, and the unmet \nneed for school infrastructure over the next decade is over $200 \nbillion. My State of West Virginia will need as much as $2 billion for \nschool construction and renovations.\n  America's Better Classroom Act provides the financial tools to help \nbuild and renovate our schools. It will continue the Qualified Zone \nAcademy Bonding, QZAB, Program that has helped economically \ndisadvantaged communities. This provision would provide $2.8 billion to \ncontinue and expand the successful QZAB Program. In recent years, this \nprogram has provided $4.2 million for support school construction and \nrenovations in disadvantaged communities. Effective programs have \nearned continued support.\n  But the truth is that many schools districts need help with school \nconstruction and renovations, which is why the America's Better \nClassroom Act creates a $22 billion Qualified School Bonding Program. \nFunding will be allocated to the states based on the Title 1 formula so \nit is targeted, but the states will have flexibility in allocating \nsupport among school districts.\n  Last summer, I toured two schools in Berkeley County, WV--Martinsburg \nHigh School and South Middle School. The high school was built in 1928, \nbut it had been renovated. The middle school was built in 1954, and \nneeded serious work. The cafeteria had to serve as a part-time \nclassroom, and they used portable trailers. These schools are in our \neastern panhandle which is the region of the greatest population \ngrowth, so Berkeley County predicts that it will need to build or \nrenovate nine schools over the next 10 years. Given the current state \nfiscal crisis, states and communities need the America's Better \nClassroom Act so that we can make needed investments. Also school \nconstruction can play a positive role in helping to stimulate our \neconomy and create needed jobs. School construction is a more reliable \neconomic stimulus, and an important investment in our children's \neducation. I am proud to have Senators Tom Harkin, Tom Daschle, and Tim \nJohnson as cosponsors of this important initiative. Senator Harkin has \nbeen a true leader on education issues throughout this career, \nincluding school construction and renovations.\n  The next initiative to improve education is a bipartisan bill, known \nas Incentives to Educate American Children Act, or I TEACH. I am proud \nto have Senators DeWine, Landrieu, and Cochran as cosponsors.\n  Under No Child Left Behind, every classroom should have a qualified \nteacher. Studies suggest that an estimated 2 million new teachers will \nbe needed in our classrooms over the next decade. It will be important \nto ensure that we recruit and retain good teachers in every classroom, \nincluding our most disadvantaged schools and our rural schools, which \noften have more trouble recruiting and keeping teachers.\n  Unfortunately, without our help, America's disadvantaged and rural \nschools may not be able to attract the qualified teachers required by \nthe No Child Left Behind Act. Isolated and impoverished, competing \nagainst higher paying and well-funded school districts for scarce \nclassroom talent, they are already facing a desperate shortage of \nqualified teachers. As pressure to hire increases, that shortage could \nbecome a crisis, and children already at a disadvantage in relation to \ntheir more affluent and less isolated peers will be the ones who suffer \nmost. Principals in West Virginia already are reporting shortages of \ntrained teachers.\n  To help bring dedicated and qualified teaching professionals into our \nschools, the I TEACH Act will provide teachers a $1000 refundable tax \ncredit every year they practice their profession in the public schools \nwhere they are needed most. In addition to this incentive for \ndisadvantage and rural schools, every public school teacher has the \nability to earn a $1000 refundable tax credit if a teacher achieves the \nNational Board for Professional Teaching Standards certification. Under \nthe bill, every teacher willing to work in underserved schools will \nearn a tax credit. Every teacher who gets Board certification will earn \na tax credit. Teachers who work in rural or poor schools and get \ncertified will have both credits, worth $2000. Schools who desperately \nneed help attracting teachers will get a boost. And children educated \nin poor and rural schools will benefit most.\n  One-fourth of America's children attend public schools in rural \nareas, and of the 250 poorest counties in the United States, 244 are \nrural. West Virginia has rural schools scattered throughout 36 of its \n55 counties, and these schools face real challenges in recruiting and \nretaining teachers, as well as dealing with other issues related to \ntheir rural location. Attracting teachers to these schools is difficult \nin large part due to the vast gap between what rural districts are able \nto offer and the salaries paid by more affluent school districts--as \nwide as $20,000 a year, according to one study. Poor urban schools must \novercome similar difficulties. It is often a challenge for these \nschools to attract and keep qualified teachers. Yet, according to the \n2001 No Child Left Behind Act, every school must have qualified \nteachers by the end of the 2005-2006 school year.\n  In my State of West Virginia, as in over 30 other States, there is \nalready a state fiscal incentive for teachers who earn National Board \ncertification. My legislation builds upon the West Virginia program; \ntogether, they add up to a powerful tax incentive for teachers to \nremain in the classroom and to use their skills where they are most \nneeded.\n  Education should be among our top national priorities, essential for \nevery family with a child and vital for our economic and national \nsecurity. I supported the bold goals and higher standards of the 2001 \nNo Child Left Behind Act, but they won't be met unless we invest in \nquality schools and good teachers. I am committed to working closely \nwith my Senate colleagues this fall to secure as much funding as \npossible for our children's education.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORZINE (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Smith, \n        Mr. Dodd, Mr. Leahy, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Lautenberg, \n        and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 859. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act with respect to \nfacilitating the development of microbicides for preventing \ntransmission of HIV and other diseases; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation, \nthe\n\n[[Page S5183]]\n\nMicrobicides Development Act of 2003. I am very pleased to be \nintroducing this bipartisan bill along with my colleagues, Senators \nSnowe, Cantwell, Gordon Smith, Dodd, Leahy, Murray, Durbin, and \nLautenberg. I thank my colleagues for their support of this important \nlegislation, which we believe is vital to the pursuit of combating the \nglobal HIV/AIDS crisis.\n  As you know, recently released UN reports paint the most horrendous \npicture yet of the HIV epidemic, with AIDS continuing to kill more \npeople worldwide than any other infectious disease, and sparing no \ncorner of the world. According to the UN, China could have more than 10 \nmillion HIV-infected people by 2010. Infection rates in Russia and \nEastern Europe are rising faster than anywhere else. India may soon \nhave the largest number of people living with HIV/AIDS in the world. \nAnd Sub-Saharan Africa remains devastated by an epidemic that has \nlowered life expectancy from 62 years on average to just 47. In hard-\nhit countries like Botswana, where 45 percent of women attending \nprenatal clinics are HIV-positive, a 15-year old youth has an 80 \npercent chance of dying of AIDS.\n  The UN reports come on the heels of CIA assessments that the AIDS \npandemic is entering a ``stage of substantial increases in size and \nscope.''\n  Despite alarm bells ringing from the organizations as diverse in \nmandate as the UN and the CIA, little attention is paid to the reality \nthat the face of the HIV epidemic both at home and abroad is \nincreasingly female. As of the end of 2002, according to the Joint \nUnited Nations/World Health Organization Programme on HIV/AIDS, half of \nthe world's HIV/AIDS-infected people were women. In Sub-Saharan Africa, \n58 percent of all adult HIV/AIDS cases were found in women, and in \nhard-hit nations such as Zambia, girls are five times more likely than \nboys to be HIV positive.\n  Here in the United States, 30 percent of new HIV infections each year \noccur among women, most of whom, 64 percent, are African-American. The \nmajority of U.S. women, 75 percent, acquire the disease through \nheterosexual transmission. My own State of New Jersey has the Nation's \nhighest HIV/AIDS infection rate among women and the sixth highest \ninfection rate among all adults. And here in our Nation's capital, one \nin three people with HIV now is a woman.\n  Biologically, women are four times more vulnerable to HIV infection. \nTheir vulnerability increases due to their lack of economic and social \npower in many societies, where women often cannot control sexual \nencounters or insist on protective measures such as abstinence or \nmutual monogamy. The typical woman who gets infected with HIV has only \none partner--her husband. This trend devastates families and puts \nchildren at risk.\n  This astounding reality bears restating: The single greatest risk \nfactor for a woman in the developing world of contracting the HIV virus \nis being married.\n  Women need HIV-prevention tools that they can control to safeguard \ntheir health and that of their families and communities. Unfortunately, \nthere exists absolutely no HIV or STD prevention method that is within \na woman's personal control. Condom use must be negotiated with a \npartner. We are all aware that for too many women, particularly low-\nincome women in the developing world and many in our own country who \nrely upon a male partner for economic support, there is no power of \nnegotiation. We know these women are at risk--yet, we expect them to \nprotect themselves without any tools.\n  Today we have the opportunity to invest in groundbreaking research \nthat can produce these tools, and ultimately, empower women. \nMicrobicides are self-administered products that women could use to \nprevent transmission of STDs, including HIV/AIDS. I say ``could'' \nbecause due to insufficient research investments, no microbicides have \nbeen brought to market. This legislation would expand federal \ninvestments for microbicide research at the National Institutes for \nHealth, NIH, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, and \nthe United States Agency for International Development, USAID.\n  In addition to encouraging new investments in microbicide research, \nthe Microbicides Development Act will expedite the implementation of \nthe NIH's five-year strategic plan for microbicide research, as well as \nexpand coordination among Federal agencies already involved in this \nresearch, including NIH, CDC, and the United States Agency on \nInternational Development, USAID.\n  Perhaps most importantly, the legislation calls for the establishment \nof a Microbicide Research and Development Branch within the National \nInstitute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n  The National Institutes of Health, principally through the National \nInstitute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIAID, spends the \nmajority of Federal dollars in this area. However, microbicide research \nat NIH is currently conducted with no single line of administrative \naccountability or specific funding coordination. In addition, other \nfederal agencies such as CDC and USAID undertake microbicides research \nand development activities. Because there is no federal coordination, \nhowever, there is the risk that inefficiencies and duplication of \neffort could result. Through a variety of committees Congress has \nrequested that NIH and its Office of AIDS Research provide Congress \nwith a ``federal coordination plan'' for research and development in \nthis area, but formal submission of this plan has been repeatedly \ndelayed.\n  A branch dedicated to microbicide research and development at the NIH \nis essential to providing the appropriate staff and funding for the \ncoordination of these activities at the NIH and across agencies.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 859\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION. 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Microbicide Development Act \n     of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) During 2002, AIDS caused the deaths of an estimated \n     3,100,000 people, including 1,200,000 women and 610,000 \n     children under 15 years of age. An estimated 14,000,000 \n     children living today have lost one or both parents due to \n     AIDS.\n       (2) Worldwide, heterosexual transmission is accounting for \n     an increasing share of new HIV infections, with adolescents, \n     women, and disadvantaged people at particular risk.\n       (3) In the United States, for example, African American and \n     Latina women account for 64 percent and 17 percent of all \n     reported HIV cases, respectively, even though they represent \n     only 25 percent of the total United States female population.\n       (4) Half of the 38,600,000 adults living today with HIV/\n     AIDS are women.\n       (5) Biological, cultural, economic, and social factors \n     combine to make women and girls particularly vulnerable to \n     HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (referred to in \n     this section as ``STDs''). In the hardest hit areas of \n     Africa, almost one-quarter of 15 to 19 year-old girls are \n     already infected with HIV, compared to 4 percent of their \n     male peers.\n       (6) In addition to HIV, other STDs can cause serious, \n     costly, even deadly conditions for women and their children, \n     including infertility, pregnancy complications, cervical \n     cancer, infant mortality, and higher risk of contracting HIV. \n     When women become infected with HIV, they risk passing along \n     the infection to their infants, either through pregnancy, \n     childbirth, or breastfeeding.\n       (7) Regrettably, today's HIV prevention methods do not meet \n     the needs of the millions of women worldwide who, for \n     cultural, economic, and social reasons, cannot insist on \n     protective measures such as abstinence, condom use, or mutual \n     monogamy.\n       (8) A large majority of women become infected with HIV with \n     only one partner--their husbands. Women need prevention \n     options that they can use consistently within ongoing, long-\n     term relationships.\n       (9) Microbicides are a promising new technology, \n     complementary to vaccines, that could put the power of \n     prevention into women's hands. Formulated as gels, creams, or \n     films, microbicides inactivate, block, or otherwise interfere \n     with the pathogens that cause HIV/AIDS and other STDs.\n       (10) Even a moderately effective microbicide could have a \n     substantial impact on the HIV epidemic. The London School of \n     Hygiene and Tropical Medicine estimates that a 60 percent \n     efficacious microbicide introduced into the 73 poorest \n     countries could avert 2,500,000 HIV infections in men, women, \n     and children over 3 years.\n       (11) Microbicides would also benefit men, because their \n     protective effect is likely to be bidirectional.\n       (12) Numerous potential microbicides are poised for \n     successful development. Thirteen\n\n[[Page S5184]]\n\n     products are in clinical trials and approximately 50 \n     compounds exist that could be investigated further. There is \n     a backlog in the research and development pipeline, however, \n     so that innovative and promising product concepts are \n     languishing, while infection rates are growing.\n       (13) At present, there is insufficient economic incentive \n     for large pharmaceutical companies to become actively engaged \n     in microbicide research and development, thus, Federal \n     support is crucial. Three Federal agencies--the National \n     Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, and the United States Agency for International \n     Development--have played important roles in progress to date, \n     but strong, effective, well-coordinated, and visible public \n     sector leadership will be essential for the promise of \n     microbicides to be realized.\n       (14) A microbicide could be available within 5 to 7 years \n     if sufficient public sector funding were made available to \n     accelerate research and support the necessary clinical \n     trials.\n       (15) Microbicide research and development currently receive \n     only 2 percent of the AIDS research budget of the National \n     Institutes of Health, not nearly enough to keep pace with \n     public health need and scientific opportunity.\n       (16) The United States Agency for International Development \n     sustains strong partnerships with public and private \n     organizations working on microbicide research, importantly \n     including clinical trials in developing countries where its \n     experience is extensive. The long experience of such Agency \n     in logistics management, service delivery, provider training, \n     and social marketing position it well to prepare for and \n     implement the introduction of microbicides once they are \n     available.\n       (17) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also \n     engages in critical microbicide research and clinical \n     testing, and has a long history of conducting field trials in \n     developing countries.\n       (18) For the microbicide pipeline to advance significantly \n     and the essential clinical trials to be fielded soon, the \n     current amount of Federal investment needs to increase to \n     $130,000,000 in fiscal year 2004 and to $160,000,000 in \n     fiscal year 2005.\n\n   TITLE I--MICROBICIDE RESEARCH AT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH\n\n     SEC. 101.

Mr. President, I am honored to be a cosponsor of the \nMicrobicides Development Act of 2003. The legislation calls for a \nredoubling of the effort at the National Institutes of Health and the \nCenters for Disease Control to develop microbicides, a class of \nproducts that can prevent transmission of HIV and other sexually \ntransmitted diseases in women and their partners.\n  As this Congress continues to fight AIDS, taking tiny steps in \npursuit of a challenge racing away from us, I see the development of \nmicrobicides as another ``tiny'' step forward. I believe microbicides \nare an important addition to the arsenal to fighting AIDS, and indeed \nthe Global AIDS bill I introduced, The Global CARE Act of 2003, S. 250, \nincludes microbicides among the preventative measures the U.S. should \nsupport.\n  I, and the other cosponsors of this important legislation, see a real \nneed and urgency to expand the range of preventive interventions for \nHIV transmission. The ABC options for preventing HIV infection, which \nremain a key part of our response and contribute to the world's ability \nto slow the spread of HIV/AIDS, have not changed since the 1980s: A, \nabstinence when it comes to sexual activity; B, be faithful to one \npartner; C, if you are going to ignore the other two, use a condom. \nDespite the effectiveness of the ABCs in many areas, HIV/AIDS continues \nto spread. We urgently need more prevention options.\n  Microbicides, defined as antimicrobial products that can be applied \ntopically for the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases, STDs, \nincluding HIV, may offer one of the most promising preventive \ninterventions. They could prove to be safe, effective, inexpensive, \nreadily available, and widely acceptable. Microbicides will add to the \nrange of options available. Most importantly, microbicides offer an \nadditional method of prevention that can be controlled by women.\n  Notwithstanding the knowledge of successful HIV prevention \nstrategies--condom use, reduction in the number of sexual partners, \ndiagnosis and treatment of sexually transmitted infections--HIV \ncontinues to spread at an alarming rate especially among women in \ndeveloping countries.\n  In sub-Saharan Africa, the area hardest hit by the pandemic, women \nand girls account for 58 percent of those living with AIDS. Worldwide, \nwomen represent 50 percent of those infected, an increase of 9 percent \nin five years. In some of the hardest hit countries in southern Saharan \nAfrica, HIV prevalence among girls aged 15 to 19 is four to seven times \nhigher than among boys their age. Attitudes, beliefs, and taboos \nsurrounding sex, the status of women and children, and the source and \ncauses of AIDS also complicate attempts to control transmission and \nprovide appropriate prevention and treatment.\n  In the United States, more than 30 percent of newly reported HIV \ncases diagnosed are occurring in women, according to the most recent \ndata collected by the Centers of Disease Control. As in the rest of the \nworld, the majority of these reported HIV infections among U.S. women \nresult from heterosexual transmission, and the data suggest that \nyounger women are disproportionately at risk for acquiring HIV.\n  Microbicides will be particularly attractive to those who do not wish \nto draw attention to the fact that they are using a prevention method. \nUnlike male or female condoms, microbicides are a potential preventive \noption that women can easily control and that does not require the \ncooperation, consent or even knowledge of the partner. Microbicides are \nlikely to be cheaper than condoms and, in the future, microbicides \ncould be used to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV.\n  Microbicides have been under development for more than a decade. Yet, \nit is unlikely that they will be available before 2007, which leads to \nthe general perception that there has been insufficient progress in \nthis area. Three versions are currently in the final stages of clinical \ntrials to determine whether they are safe and effective. Many factors \ncontribute to this slow progress. The National Institutes of Health, \nNIH, reports that microbicide research requires huge and complex \nefficacy and effectiveness studies that must be conducted in areas with \nhigh HIV incidence rates. Such rates occur predominantly in developing \ncountries where the research infrastructure is underdeveloped. Given \nthis dependency on poorer, developing nations, it is not surprising \nthat no large pharmaceutical company is interested in funding \nmicrobicide development. A second obstacle lies in the ethical \nobligation to provide counseling and make condoms available to the \nstudy subjects, which adds to the complexity and\n\n[[Page S5186]]\n\nsize of the trials. As a result, NIH explains, few Phase III efficacy \ntrials have been completed. Of those completed, few have yielded \npromising results.\n  Reflecting on the reality of the global epidemic, United Nations \nSecretary General Kofi Annan stated that the face of the HIV epidemic \nis that of a woman. ``If you want to save Africa,'' Annan says, ``you \nmust save the African woman first. It is they who care for the young, \nthe old, the sick and the dying. It is they who nurture social networks \nthat help societies share burdens.''\n  Lack of access to treatment and care means that for the majority of \nHIV-positive women throughout the world, HIV infection is a death \nsentence. In Haiti, for example, AIDS is now the leading cause of death \nfor women of childbearing age.\n  Microbicides will never become a viable option for prevention unless \na serious amount of money is invested in their development. Senator \nCorzine's legislation will make microbicide research a priority, \ncalling for the expansion and coordination of microbicide activities at \nthe National Institutes of Health and other agencies working in this \nfield. The bill requires the Centers for Disease Control to implement a \n5-year topical research plan and requires the U.S. Agency for \nInternational Development to develop and implement a microbicide \nagenda.\n  I am proud to join Senator Corzine as a cosponsor of this legislation \nand hope that my colleagues will join us as we determine the next steps \nin our battle against AIDS, including the development of prevention \nefforts that may help women take control of their lives and their \nsurvival.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HOLLINGS (for himself, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Kerry, Ms. Snowe, \n        Mr. Inouye, Mr. Reed, Mr. Breaux, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. \n        Biden, Mr. Kennedy, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Cochran, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \n        Corzine, Ms. Collins, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Levin, Mr. Nelson of \n        Florida, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Lieberman, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. \n        Lautenberg, Ms. Cantwell, and Mr. Chafee):\n  S. 861. A bill to authorize the acquisition of interests in \nundeveloped coastal areas in order to better ensure their protection \nfrom development; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague Senator \nGregg to introduce the Coastal and Estuarine Land Protection Act of \n2003. Senator Gregg and I introduced this bill last session, and it was \nreported favorably by the Commerce Committee, but time did not permit \naction to be completed on the bill before the end of the Congress. My \ncolleagues and I will work hard to pass this important piece of \nlegislation during the 108th Congress.\n  I would like to thank our cosponsors, 24 in all, Senators Kerry, \nSnowe, Inouye, Jack Reed, Breaux, DeWine, Sarbanes, Biden, Kennedy, \nMikulski, Cochran, Murray, Corzine, Collins, Dodd, Levin, Bill Nelson, \nWyden, Lieberman, Feinstein, Lautenberg, Cantwell, and Chafee for their \nstrong support of this bill, which marks another important chapter of \nour thirty year effort to put coastal and ocean issues at the forefront \nof environmental policy.\n  I am also proud to say that the bill is strongly supported by The \nTrust for Public Land, Coastal States Organization, The Nature \nConservancy, Land Trust Alliance, International Association of Fish and \nWildlife Agencies, American Sportfishing Association, and the South \nCarolina Wildlife Federation. I understand that the U.S. Commission on \nOcean Policy will also endorse this approach.\n  When I was Governor of South Carolina over 30 years ago, I \nexperienced first hand the need for Federal direction and assistance to \nthe States to enable them to effectively and sustainably manage coastal \ndevelopment. My experiences during a series of coastal hearings and \ncontinued research in the Senate led me to write the Coastal Zone \nManagement Act of 1972, which provided clear policy objectives for \nstates to establish coordinated coastal zone management programs to \nhelp balance coastal development with protection.\n  But we appear to need more tools to help States continue the job we \nstarted in 1972. In the year 2003, as our population grows, more and \nmore people are moving to the coast to enjoy its beauty and \nrecreational opportunities. In fact, by 2010, an estimated 60 percent \nof Americans will live along our coasts, which represent less than 17 \npercent of our land area. More than 3,000 people move to coastal areas \neveryday, and 14 of the Nation's 20 largest cities are on the coast, \nand are five times more densely populated than the interior of the \ncountry. As these good folks move to take advantage of coastal living, \nwe have to be careful that we don't destroy the natural resources and \nquality of life that draw them to our shores. Big changes are coming to \nall of our coastal counties, and we must make some careful and smart \ndecisions if we want to keep the very resources we depend on.\n  In particular, estuaries and wetlands have many unique attributes \nthat make them important to both our natural resources and our economy. \nEstuaries, and the watersheds that flow into them, support fisheries \nand wildlife and contribute immensely to the coastal area economies. \nBut these ecologically and economically important watersheds are also \nunder the most threat from land development and conversion away from \ntheir natural state. Coastal urbanization trends are particularly \nstrong in the southeastern areas. In my State alone, the Forest Service \nhas estimated natural forests of the coastal plain will decrease by 1.9 \nmillion acres in the next 40 years--a 35 percent loss of South \nCarolina's forests. These findings and future trends tell me that for \nthe good of our coastal communities we need some fast, targeted action \nto protect ecologically important coastal areas most threatened with \ndevelopment or conversion.\n  Now more than ever, the pressures of urbanization and pollution along \nour nation's coasts threaten to impair watersheds, impact wildlife \nhabitat and cause irreparable damage to the fragile coastal ecology. \nThe Environmental Protection Agency has reported that some areas of the \ncountry are seeing some improvement from the heavily polluted status of \nthe past, but predicts that the more pristine areas like the Southeast, \nwhich has some of the best water quality in the Nation, will experience \ndegradation of water quality due primarily to runoff of pollutants from \nrapid development in our coastal watersheds. This is very bad news for \nthe shrimpers, oystermen, and recreational users who depend on these \nwaters for their livelihood and quality of life.\n  We see strong signals of what continuing down this path will bring \nus: beach and shellfish closings, fish kills, and human health impacts. \nThe National Research Council reports that over the next 20 years over \n70 percent of our estuaries will experience more low oxygen--or \n``eutrophic''--conditions, such as the Gulf ``Dead Zone.'' If this \ntrend continues, our coastal economies will suffer and perhaps never \nrecover. I know in my state the economy would falter greatly from the \nlack of fishing, shrimping and tourism opportunities, and this is true \nup and down the Atlantic coast, which contains 37 percent of the \nNation's estuarine areas.\n  The good news is that there are ways we can make a difference, and we \nhave some good models we can turn to. I am proud to say my home State \nof South Carolina is a leader in this area. The past decade I have led \nan extensive cooperative conservation effort, bringing together the \nState of South Carolina, private landowners, groups like the Nature \nConservancy, Ducks Unlimited and federal partners like NOAA and the \nFish and Wildlife Service to protect the ACE Basin. It is now the \nlargest pristine estuarine reserve on the East Coast, a 350,000-acre \narea at the convergence of the Edisto, Ashepoo and Combahee Rivers, \nwhich comprises many ecologically important habitats that are home to \nmany fish and bird species, including a number of endangered species. \nAn outcome of these efforts is that the ACE Basin, already home to a \nNational Wildlife Refuge, was declared a National Estuarine Research \nReserve in 1992, and has been growing in size ever since. In building \nthe ACE Basin, the partners worked creatively and in a coordinated \nmanner, and we successfully obtained land acquisition funds through a \nvariety of\n\n[[Page S5187]]\n\nfederal sources, including the Forest Legacy Program.\n  What became clear, however, is that there is no Federal program \nexplicitly setting aside funding for conservation of coastal lands, \nwhere the needs are clearly the greatest. That is exactly what the \nCoastal and Estuarine Land Protection Act of 2003 will do. It \nauthorizes a competitive matching grant program in NOAA to enable \nstates to permanently protect important coastal areas.\n  Under this NOAA program, coastal states can compete for matching \nfunds of up to 75 percent to acquire land or easements for the \nprotection of endangered coastal areas that have considerable \nconservation, recreation, ecological, historical or aesthetic values \nthreatened by development or conversion. The bill also provides funding \nfor a regional watershed demonstration project that can be used as a \nmodel for future watershed-scale programs. The program is authorized at \n$60 million for fiscal year 2004 and beyond, with an additional $5 \nmillion for the regional watershed demonstration project.\n  By establishing a plan for the preservation of our coastal areas, the \nCoastal and Estuarine Land Protection Act will build on the foundation \nlaid down by the CZMA, all in stride with the changing times, growing \nnumber of people, and limited resources available today. When it comes \nto the environment, rules and regulations sometimes can't do it all. \nSometimes cooperative actions work better and we can turn to models \nthat encourage joint conservation projects among folks who all want the \nsame thing--sustainable coasts.\n  Partnership programs among federal government, state agencies, local \ngovernments, private landowners and non-profits, like the ACE Basin \nProject, work and we need to encourage these partnerships in all our \ncoastal areas if we are to prevent degradation of our coastal \nresources. The good news is that we can make a difference today by \nproviding the funding for land conservation partnerships provided for \nby the Coastal and Estuarine Land Protection Act. I am proud to be a \nsponsor of this bill, which will not only improve the quality of the \ncoastal areas and marine life it supports, but also sustain surrounding \ncommunities and their way of life.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 861\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Coastal and Estuarine Land \n     Protection Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Coastal and estuarine areas provide important nursery \n     habitat for two-thirds of the nation's commercial fish and \n     shellfish, provide nesting and foraging habitat for coastal \n     birds, harbor significant natural plant communities, and \n     serve to facilitate coastal flood control and pollutant \n     filtration.\n       (2) The Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1451 \n     et seq.) recognizes the national importance of these areas \n     and their ecological vulnerability to anthropogenic \n     activities by establishing a comprehensive Federal-State \n     partnership for protecting natural reserves and managing \n     growth in these areas.\n       (3) The National Estuarine Research Reserve system \n     established under that Act relies on the protection of \n     pristine designated areas for long-term protection and for \n     the conduct of education and research critical to the \n     protection and conservation of coastal and estuarine \n     resources.\n       (4) Intense development pressures within the coastal zone \n     are driving the need to provide coastal managers with a wider \n     range of tools to protect and conserve important coastal and \n     estuarine areas.\n       (5) Protection of undeveloped coastal lands through the \n     acquisition of interests in property from a willing seller \n     are a cost-effective means of providing these areas with \n     permanent protection from development.\n       (6) Permanent protection of lands in the coastal zone is a \n     necessary component of any program to maintain and enhance \n     coastal and estuarine areas for the benefit of the Nation, \n     including protection of water quality, access to public \n     beachfront, conserving wildlife habitat, and sustaining sport \n     and commercial fisheries.\n       (7) Federal-State-nongovernmental organization pilot land \n     acquisition projects have already substantially contributed \n     to the long-term health and viability of coastal and \n     estuarine systems.\n       (8) Enhanced protection of estuarine and coastal areas can \n     be attained through watershed-based acquisition strategies \n     coordinated through Federal, State, regional, and local \n     efforts.\n\n     SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF COASTAL AND ESTUARINE LAND \n                   PROTECTION PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Commerce shall establish \n     a Coastal and Estuarine Land Protection Program, in \n     cooperation with appropriate State, regional, and other units \n     of government for the purposes of protecting the \n     environmental integrity of important coastal and estuarine \n     areas, including wetlands and forests, that have significant \n     conservation, recreation, ecological, historical, or \n     aesthetic values, and that are threatened by conversion from \n     their natural, undeveloped, or recreational state to other \n     uses. The program shall be administered by the National Ocean \n     Service of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n     Administration through the Office of Ocean and Coastal \n     Resource Management.\n       (b) Property Acquisition Grants.--The Secretary shall make \n     grants under the program to coastal States, except coastal \n     States that have lost less than 1 percent of their wetlands \n     to development or conversion to other land uses by the date \n     of enactment of this Act, with approved coastal zone \n     management plans or National Estuarine Research Reserve units \n     for the purpose of acquiring property or interests in \n     property described in subsection (a) that will further the \n     goals of--\n       (1) a Coastal Zone Management Plan or Program approved \n     under the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1451 \n     et seq.); or\n       (2) a National Estuarine Research Reserve management plan; \n     or\n       (3) a regional or State watershed protection plan involving \n     coastal States with approved coastal zone management plans.\n       (c) Grant Process.--The Secretary shall allocate funds to \n     coastal States or National Estuarine Research Reserves under \n     this section through a competitive grant process in \n     accordance with guidelines that meet the following \n     requirements:\n       (1) The Secretary shall consult with the State's coastal \n     zone management program, any National Estuarine Research \n     Reserve in that State, and the lead agency designated by the \n     Governor for coordinating the establishment and \n     implementation of this Act (if different from the coastal \n     zone management program).\n       (2) Each participating State shall identify priority \n     conservation needs within the State, the values to be \n     protected by inclusion of lands of the program, and the \n     threats to those values that should be avoided.\n       (3) Each participating State shall evaluate how the \n     acquisition of property or easements might impact working \n     waterfront needs.\n       (4) The applicant shall identify the values to be protected \n     by inclusion of the lands in the programs, management \n     activities that are planned and the manner in which they may \n     affect the values identified, and any other information from \n     the landowner relevant to administration and management of \n     the land.\n       (5) Awards shall be based on demonstrated need for \n     protection and ability to successfully leverage funds among \n     participating entities, including Federal programs, regional \n     organizations, State and other governmental units, \n     landowners, corporations, or private organizations.\n       (6) Applications must be determined to be consistent with \n     the State's or territory's approved coastal zone plan, \n     program and policies prior to submittal to the Secretary.\n       (7) Priority shall be given to lands described in \n     subsection (a) that can be effectively managed and protected \n     and that have significant ecological or watershed protection \n     value.\n       (8) In developing guidelines under this section, the \n     Secretary shall consult with other Federal agencies and non-\n     governmental entities expert in land acquisition and \n     conservation procedures.\n       (9) Eligible States or National Estuarine Research Reserves \n     may allocate grants to local governments or agencies eligible \n     for assistance under section 306A(e) of the Coastal Zone \n     Management Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1455a) and may acquire \n     lands in cooperation with nongovernmental entities and \n     Federal agencies.\n       (10) The Secretary shall develop performance measures that \n     will allow periodic evaluation of the program's effectiveness \n     in meeting the purposes of this section and such evaluation \n     shall be reported to Congress.\n       (d) Matching Requirements.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary may not make a grant under \n     the program unless the Federal funds are matched by non-\n     Federal funds in accordance with this subsection.\n       (2) Maximum federal share.--\n       (A) 75 percent federal funds.--No more than 75 percent of \n     the funding for any grant under this section shall be derived \n     from Federal sources, unless such requirement is specifically \n     waived by the Secretary.\n       (B) Waiver of requirement.--The Secretary may grant a \n     waiver of the limitation in subparagraph (A) for underserved \n     communities, communities that have an inability to draw on \n     other sources of funding because of the small population or \n     low income of the community, or for other reasons the \n     Secretary deems appropriate.\n       (3) Other federal funds.--Where financial assistance \n     awarded under this section represents only a portion of the \n     total cost of a project, funding from other Federal sources\n\n[[Page S5188]]\n\n     may be applied to the cost of the project. Each portion shall \n     be subject to match requirements under the applicable \n     provision of law.\n       (4) Source of matching cost share.--For purposes of \n     paragraph (2)(A), the non-Federal cost share for a project \n     may be determined by taking into account the following:\n       (A) Land value may be used as non-Federal match if the \n     lands are identified in project plans and acquired within \n     three years prior to the submission of the project \n     application or after the submission of a project application \n     until the project grant is closed (not to exceed 3 years). \n     The appraised value of the land at the time of project \n     closing will be considered the non-Federal cost share.\n       (B) Costs associated with land acquisition, land management \n     planning, remediation, restoration, and enhancement may be \n     used as non-Federal match if the activities are identified in \n     the plan and expenses are incurred within the period of \n     the grant award. These costs may include either case or \n     in-kind contributions.\n       (e) Regional Watershed Demonstration Project.--The \n     Secretary may provide up to $5,000,000 for a regional \n     watershed protection demonstration project that will meet the \n     requirements of this section, and--\n       (1) leverages land acquisition funding from other Federal \n     land conservation or acquisition programs such that other \n     Federal contributions, at a minimum, equal the amounts \n     provided by the Secretary;\n       (2) involves partnerships from a broad spectrum of Federal, \n     State, and non-governmental entities;\n       (3) provides for the creation of conservation corridors and \n     preservation of unique coastal habitat;\n       (4) protects largely unfragmented habitat under imminent \n     threat of development or conversion;\n       (5) provides water quality protection for areas set aside \n     for research under the National Estuarine Research Reserve \n     program; and\n       (6) provides a model for future regional watershed \n     protection projects.\n       (f) Reservation of Funds for National Estuarine Research \n     Reserve Sites.--No less than 15 percent of funds made \n     available under this section shall be available for \n     acquisitions benefiting National Estuarine Research Reserve \n     acquisitions.\n       (g) Limit on Administrative Costs.--No more than 5 percent \n     of the funds made available to the Secretary under this \n     section shall be used by the Secretary for planning or \n     administration of the program. The Secretary shall provide a \n     report to Congress with an account of all expenditures under \n     this section for fiscal year 2004, fiscal year 2005, and \n     triennially thereafter.\n       (h) Title and Management of Acquired Property.--\n       (1) In general.--If any property is acquired in whole or in \n     part with funds made available through a grant under this \n     section, the grant recipient shall provide such assurances as \n     the Secretary may require that--\n       (A) the title to the property will be held by the grant \n     recipient or other appropriate public agency designated by \n     the recipient in perpetuity;\n       (B) the property will be managed in a manner that is \n     consistent with the purposes for which the land entered into \n     the program and shall not convert such property to other \n     uses; and\n       (C) if the property or interest in land is sold, exchanged, \n     or divested, funds equal to the correct value will be \n     returned to the Secretary, for re-distribution in the grant \n     process.\n       (2) Conservation easement.--In this subsection, the term \n     ``conservation easement'' includes an easement, recorded \n     deed, or interest deed where the grantee acquires all rights, \n     title, and interest in a property, that do not conflict with \n     the goals of this Act except those rights, title, and \n     interests that may run with the land that are expressly \n     reserved by a grantor and are agreed to at the time of \n     purchase.\n       (d) Definitions.--In this section, the term ``coastal \n     State'' has the meaning given that term by section 304(4) of \n     the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1453(4)), \n     and any other term used in this section that is defined in \n     section 304 of that Act has the meaning given that term in \n     that section.\n       (j) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated to the Secretary--\n       (1) $60,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2004 through 2007 \n     to carry out this section (other than subsection (e)); and\n       (2) $5,000,000 for fiscal year 2004 to carry out subsection \n     (e), such sum to remain available without fiscal year \n     limitation.\n\n     SEC. 4. ASSISTANCE FROM OTHER AGENCIES.\n\n       Section 310(a) of the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 \n     (16 U.S.C. 1456c(a)) is amended by striking ``any qualified \n     person for the purposes of carrying out this subsection.'' \n     and inserting ``any other Federal agencies (including \n     interagency financing of Coastal America activities) and any \n     other qualified person for the purposes of carrying out this \n     section.''.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today along with Senator Hollings to \nintroduce the Coastal and Estuarine Land Protection Act. We are \nintroducing this much needed coastal protection act along with Senators \nKerry, Snowe, Inouye, Reed, Breaux, DeWine, Sarbanes, Biden, Kennedy, \nMikulski, Cochran, Murray, Corzine, Collins, Dodd, Levin, Nelson, \nWyden, Lieberman, Feinstein, Lautenberg, Cantwell, and Chafee. In \naddition, this legislation is supported by the Trust for Public Land, \nthe Coastal States Organization, the Nature Conservancy, International \nAssociation of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, American Sportfishing \nAssociation, and the Land Trust Alliance.\n  The Coastal and Estuarine Land Protection Act promotes coordinated \nland acquisition and protection efforts in coastal and estuarine areas \nby fostering partnerships between non-governmental organizations and \nFederal, State, and local governments. With Americans rapidly moving to \nthe coast, pressures to develop critical coastal ecosystems are \nincreasing. There are fewer and fewer undeveloped and pristine areas \nleft in the Nation's coastal and estuarine watersheds. These areas \nprovide important nursery habitat for two-thirds of the Nation's \ncommercial fish and shellfish, provide nesting and foraging habitat for \ncoastal birds, harbor significant natural plant communities, and serve \nto facilitate coastal flood control and pollutant filtration.\n  The Coastal and Estuarine Land Protection Act pairs willing sellers \nthrough community-based initiatives with sources of Federal funds to \nenhance environmental protection. Lands can be acquired in full or \nthrough easements, and none of the lands purchased through this program \nwould be held by the Federal Government. This bill puts land \nconservation initiatives in the hands of state and local communities. \nThis new program, authorized through the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration at $60,000,000 per year, would provide \nFederal matching funds to States with approved coastal management \nprograms or to National Estuarine Research Reserves through a \ncompetitive grant process. Federal matching funds may not exceed 75 \npercent of the cost of a project under this program, and non-Federal \nsources may count in-kind support toward their portion of the cost \nshare.\n  This coastal land protection program provides much needed support for \nlocal coastal conservation initiatives throughout the country. In my \nrole on the Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations Subcommittee, I \nhave been able to secure significant funds for the Great Bay estuary in \nNew Hampshire. This estuary is the jewel of the seacoast region, and is \nhome to a wide variety of plants and animal species that are \nparticularly threatened by encroaching development and environmental \npollutants. By working with local communities to purchase lands or \neasements on these valuable parcels of land, New Hampshire has been \nable to successfully conserve the natural and scenic heritage of this \nvital estuary.\n  Programs like the Coastal and Estuarine Land Protection Program will \nnow enable other States to participate in these community-based \nconservation efforts in coastal areas. This program was modeled after \nthe U.S. Department of Agriculture's successful Forest Legacy Program, \nwhich has conserved millions of acres of productive and ecologically \nsignificant forest land around the country.\n  I welcome the opportunity to offer this important legislation, with \nmy close friend, Senator Hollings. I am thankful for his strong \nleadership on this issue, and look forward to working with him to make \nthe vision for this legislation a reality, and to successfully conserve \nour coastal lands for their ecological, historical, recreational, and \naesthetic values.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself, Mr. DeWine, Ms. Landrieu, Ms. \n        Collins, Mr. Levin, and Mr. Johnson):\n  S. 862. A bill to promote the adoption of children with special \nneeds; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nAdoption Equality Act of 2003. I am proud to have a bipartisan group of \ncosponsors including Senators DeWine, Landrieu, Collins, Levin and \nJohnson. Work on this legislation is based on the bipartisan work of \nthe Senate coalition that supported the 1997 Adoption and Safe Families \nAct, an historic effort to ensure that a child's safety and health are \nparamount, and that every child should have a permanent home.\n\n[[Page S5189]]\n\n  The Adoption and Safe Families Act was the most sweeping and \ncomprehensive piece of child welfare legislation passed in over a \ndecade, and since its enactment, adoptions from our foster care system \nhave nearly doubled. In my State of West Virginia, adoptions have \nnearly tripled. Those adopted children now have a permanent home. But \nthere are still 131,000 in foster care nationwide who have the goal of \nadoption but are still waiting. In West Virginia, we have 520 children \nin foster care waiting for adoption, but only 343 children might \nqualify for support. I believe each child with special needs who is \nwaiting for adoption deserves help but under current law only some do. \nThey are the innocent ones who were victims of abuse and neglect. \nClearly we must do more for those children.\n  Throughout the process of developing the Adoption Act we heard about \nthe challenging circumstances facing children described as having \n``special needs''. These include children who are the most difficult to \nplace into permanent homes, often due to their age, disability or \nstatus as part of a group of siblings needing to be placed together.\n  One of the most significant provisions of ASFA was the assurance of \nongoing health care coverage for all children with special needs who \nmove from foster care to adoption. Parents willing to adopt such \nchildren were promised health care coverage in 1997 which is essential.\n  While all special needs children that are adopted maintain health \ncare coverage, only half are eligible for adoption assistance payments. \nCurrent law provides for the payment of federal adoption subsidies to \nfamilies who adopt only those special needs children whose biological \nfamily would have qualified for welfare benefits under the old 1996 \nAFDC standards. Federal adoption subsidy payments provide essential \nincome support to help families finance the daily basic costs of \nraising these special children, as well as support for special services \nlike therapy, tutoring, or special equipment for disabled children. \nFederal adoption subsidies are a vital link in securing adoptive homes \nfor special needs children who by definition would not be adopted \nwithout support.\n  Under current law, a child's eligibility for these important benefits \nis dependent on the income of his or her biological parents even though \nthese parents' legal rights to the child have been terminated, and \nthese are the parents who either abused or neglected the child. This \nis, simply, wrong. The Adoption Equality Act will eliminate this \nanomaly in Federal law by making all special needs children eligible \nfor Federal adoption subsidies.\n  The Adoption Equality Act is the next logical step to streamline and \npromote adoptions from foster care. The bill is designed to ``level the \nplaying field'' by ensuring that all children with special needs, and \nthe loving families who adopt them, have the support they need to grow \nand develop.\n  First, the bill removes the requirement that an income eligibility \ndetermination be made in regard to the child's biological parents, whom \nthe child is leaving, thereby allowing Federal adoption subsidy to be \npaid to all families who adopt children who meet the definition of \nspecial needs.\n  Second, the bill continues to give states flexibility to determine \nthe definition of a child with special needs, but it is clear that \nadoption subsidies should only be provided if the child could not be \nadopted without such assistance.\n  Third, the bill requires that States reinvest the monies they save as \na result of this bill back into their state child abuse and neglect \nprograms which should help promote prevention and family support.\n  When we talk about how to help abused and neglected children in this \ncountry, many complex questions are raised about what constitutes best \npolicy, and how Federal tax dollars should be spent. Yet, at the heart \nof all the questions are vulnerable children who desperately want a \nsafe, permanent home. The lack of modest financial resources to support \nthese adoptions is often the only barrier that stands between an abused \nchild and a safe, loving and permanent home.\n  Federal adoption subsidies are designed to encourage adoption of \nchildren with special needs--those children who have the hardest time \nfinding permanent, adoptive families. It is an absurd policy to \ndiscriminate against thousands of children with special needs based \nupon the income of their biological, and often abusive, parents. It is \ntime to create a Federal policy that levels the playing field and gives \nall children with special needs an equal and fair chance at being \nadopted.\n  The Adoption Equality Act will treat every special needs child the \nsame. It is designed to encourage adoption and support those admirable \nparents willing to help a child with special needs and a history of \nabuse or neglect. Such children may have physical disabilities, or \nother may have emotional challenges due to past abuse and neglect. Such \nchildren and families often need special counseling or support \nservices, and that is why the adoption assistance payments are key. If \nwe want to truly help our most vulnerable children find a permanent \nhome, this is a wise investment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. EDWARDS (for himself, Mr. Miller, Mr. Bingaman, Ms. \n        Mikulski, and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 863.

A bill to amend the Child Care and Development Block Grant \nAct of 1990 to provide for grants to parents and guardians of certain \nmilitary dependents, in order to assist the parent and guardians in \npaying for the cost of child care services provided to the dependents, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce two important \npieces of legislation that offer a helping hand to the members and \nfamilies of the National Guard, the Reserves, and the regular active-\nduty military.\n  The National Guard and Reserves used to be called ``forces of last \nresort,'' but they have become much more. Between 1945 and 1989, the \nGuard and Reserves were activated four times. Only four times in 45 \nyears. Between 1990 and the present, in less than 15 years, the Guard \nand Reserves were activated six times. They have become a central \nelement of our national defense.\n  We've come to rely on them to fight side-by-side with full-time \nactive duty soldiers. Each time our Nation has needed them, the Guard \nand Reserves members have left their jobs, their homes, and their \nfamilies to serve this nation with pride and distinction. They view \nactivation as an opportunity for service, but the truth is that \nactivation does cause challenges at home. We should do right by them.\n  Over the past few weeks, this body has considered a number of \nimportant measures for the Guard, the Reserves, and our entire \nmilitary. I was pleased to support Senator Landrieu's amendment to \nraise combat and family separation pay and to modernize equipment. I \nalso supported Senator Lincoln's effort to make sure that all members \nof the National Guard and Reserves can participate in the same health \nprogram that's available to full-time soldiers and their families. It's \nhard to believe, but 20 percent of the men and women in the Guard and \nReserves don't even have health insurance.\n  Today, I am introducing two new pieces of legislation to address \nunique difficulties facing Guard and Reserve members and, in fact, \nmembers of the regular military as well. I've traveled around the bases \nin my State and, time and time again, soldiers and their families have \ntold me they need help.\n  My first proposal is for child care. A few weeks ago, I outlined my \nideas for addressing the growing challenges facing working families. \nParents are working longer hours, earning less, and spending less time \nwith their kids. One idea I offered was expanding afterschool programs \nfor kids of working parents.\n  The child care crunch is enormously exacerbated for military \nfamilies. When one parent is called away, the other must take on all \nthe responsibilities around the home. And at the same time, many \nmembers of the Guard and\n\n[[Page S5190]]\n\nReserves take a pay cut, making it more difficult to hire help.\n  Families can get child care on a military base, which is great for \nsome families. But members of the Guard in North Wilkesboro, for \nexample, live 173 miles away from the nearest military installation. \nThose families are totally left out.\n  My National Guard and Reserves Child Care Relief Act would give \nfamilies financial help for child care in their hometown. We would help \nfamilies with a mom or dad called away on active duty. This is a \nconcrete, practical way to make a difference in people's lives.\n  I also have a bill to provide some help paying for education for the \nmen and women who serve our country in the military. Nearly a quarter \nof Guardsmen and Reservists are college students, and many more are \ngraduates with student loans.\n  While these patriots are fighting for their country overseas, we \ncharge them interest on their student loans here at home. This happens \neven if they're serving on the frontlines in Iraq; even if they took a \nhuge pay cut because they're in the Guard or Reserves; even if they \nhave a very low income to begin with.\n  For somebody with an average size loan of $17,000, this can add up to \nas much as $1,400 in interest a year. That's not right. No one should \nreturn to civilian life deeper in debt because they took time off to \nserve their country. We should waive the interest on these Federal \nloans.\n  The Secretary of Education has the authority to waive interest under \nthe HEROES Act of 2001, but he has chosen not to exercise it. My \nFairness for America's Soldiers in Higher Education Act would require \nhim to do just that.\n  It would also permanently end an Education Department policy-\nsuspended during the current conflict--that makes many guardsmen and \nreservists who have to drop college courses when they are activated pay \nback student aid.\n  As we consider trillion-dollar budgets, these are modest ideas, but \nthey would make a real difference in the lives of Americans serving \ntheir country and signal our appreciation for their sacrifice.\n  I urge my colleagues to support these important bills. I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bills be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the texts of the bills were ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 863\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the National Telecommunications and \nInformation Administration Organization Act to facilitate the \nreallocation of spectrum from governmental to commercial users; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am joined by Senators Dorgan, \nBrownback, and Ensign in introducing the Commercial Spectrum \nEnhancement Act. This bill is designed to streamline the process of \nrelocating government users from spectrum reallocated for commercial \nuse.\n  The bill would establish a separate fund on the books of the United \nStates Treasury called the Spectrum Relocation Fund. When spectrum \noccupied by a Federal agency is auctioned, the proceeds from the \nauction would be deposited into the fund. Federal agencies would be \nable to withdraw from the fund the estimated expenses associated with \nthe relocation, with additional expenses being approved by the Office \nof Management and Budget, with notice provided to Congress and the \nGeneral Accounting Office, GAO, as necessary.\n  Currently, when spectrum assigned to a Government agency is \nauctioned, the law requires the agency to negotiate with the winning \nbidder to determine the cost of purchasing or returning new equipment \nnecessary for the agency to transfer out of the spectrum band. These \nnegotiations would be time-consuming and difficult for both parties. \nThis bill would eliminate the need for lengthy negotiations between \nthese parties. Thus it would accelerate the pace of introduction of new \nservices using the spectrum.\n  Spectrum is a critical resource of our armed services. It is \nimportant that any relocation process consider the needs of our \nmilitary operations. I believe that this bill would allow our military \nto have confidence that its relocation costs will be fully and timely \nreimbursed, while providing commercial bidders with certainty regarding \nthe full cost of the right to use the spectrum and the ability to use \nit in a timely fashion.\n  Finally, the bill provides important oversight functions for Congress \nand the GAO to ensure that the fund is used in a manner that is fair \nand justified. In this way, American taxpayers are assured that their \nresources are used most efficiently.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n  (The bill will be printed in a future edition of the Record.)\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Corzine, \n        Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Reed, and Mr. Lautenberg):\n  S. 866. A bill to amend chapter 44 of title 18, United States Code, \nto require the provision of a child safety lock in connection with the \ntransfer of a handgun and provide safety standards for child safety \nlocks; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Child Safety \nLock Act of 2003, on behalf of myself, Senator Durbin, Senator Schumer, \nSenator Corzine, and Senator Feinstein. Our measure will save \nchildren's lives by reducing the senseless tragedies that result when \nchildren get their hands on improperly stored and unlocked handguns.\n  Each year, children and teenagers are involved in more than 10,000 \naccidental shootings in which close to 800 of them die. In addition, \neach year more than 1,000 young people killed themselves with a \nfirearm--that is almost three per day. Safety locks can be effective in \ndeterring or preventing many of these incidents.\n  The sad truth is that we are inviting disaster every time an unlocked \ngun is stored in a place that is still accessible to children. Parents \ntake a number of precautions to ensure their children's safety, from \nequipping them with bike helmets, to securing them in automobiles, to \nchanging smoke detector batteries. Unfortunately, not all parents are \nas safety conscious about child proofing their firearms.\n  Guns are kept in 43 percent of American households with children. In \n23 percent of these households, the guns are kept loaded. And \nalarmingly, in one out of every eight of those homes the loaded guns \nare left unlocked.\n  This is wrong and unacceptable.\n  Such startlingly cold statistics cannot even begin to describe in \nhuman terms the daily tragedies that could be prevented by the use of a \nsafety lock.\n  For example, in January a 21-month-old little boy was fatally shot \nwhen he tipped over a laundry hamper containing a loaded handgun. The \nhandgun did not have a lock. The boy had no supervision. The result was \ntragic. A lock would have also saved the life of a four-year-old in \nFlorida who shot himself playing with his grandfather's gun while the \nrest of his family was sleeping. Last September, a Detroit mother lost \nher son because he accidentally shot himself with a gun she had \nborrowed to protect herself. And, of course, no one will ever forget \nthe Santana High School shooting two years ago, when a high school \nfreshman opened fire on his classmates, killing two and injuring 13 \nothers with a handgun and multiple rounds of ammunition he found at \nhome.\n  Our legislation will help prevent tragedies like these. It is simple, \neffective, and straightforward. It requires that a child safety \ndevice--or trigger lock--be sold with every handgun. These devices vary \nin form, but the most common resemble a padlock that wraps around the \ngun trigger and immobilizes it. Trigger locks can be purchased in \nvirtually any gun store for less than ten dollars. They are already \nused by tens of thousands of responsible gun owners to protect their \nfirearms from unauthorized use and have surely saved many lives.\n  Protection is only as good as the safety lock itself, therefore the \nChild Safety Lock Act of 2003 includes standards for the safety locks. \nStudies by the Consumer Product Safety Commission and recalls by safety \nlock manufacturers conclusively demonstrate the child safety locks are \noften not made well enough. A lock that is easily picked or one that \nbreaks apart with little force defeats the purpose of this bill. We \nwould not use a lock that is less than foolproof to guard our most \nvaluable possessions. We should not use defective locks to protect what \nis most valuable to us--our children.\n  Support for this simple, common sense proposal is widespread. In \n1999, a child safety lock provision passed the Senate by an \noverwhelming vote of 78 to 20 as an amendment during the juvenile \njustice debate. This proposal is as popular with the rest of the \ncountry\n\n[[Page S5192]]\n\nand the law enforcement community as it was with the 106th Senate. \nPolls show that between 75 and 80 percent of the American public, \nincluding gun owners, favor the mandatory sale of child safety locks \nwith guns. When I surveyed almost 500 of Wisconsin's police chiefs and \nsheriffs last summer, 90 percent of respondents agreed that child \nsafety locks should be sold with each gun.\n  During his campaign, President Bush indicated that if Congress passes \na bill making child safety locks mandatory he would sign it into law. \nTwo years ago, Attorney General Ashcroft affirmed the Administration's \nsupport of the mandatory sale of child safety locks during his \nconfirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is necessary to ensure that safety \nlocks are provided with all handguns so that numerous lives are not \nlost in easily preventable accidents. We already protect children by \nrequiring that seat belts be installed in all automobiles and that \nchildproof safety caps be provided on medicine bottles. We should be no \nless vigilant when it comes to gun safety. I hope that the Senate will \nmove to pass the Child Safety Lock Act of 2003 so that further \nunnecessary death and injury can be avoided.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 866\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal \nService located at 710 Wick Lane in Billings, Montana, as the ``Ronald \nReagan Post Office Building''; to the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I would like to introduce a bill which \nnames one of our post offices in Billings, Montana, after one of this \nNation's greatest leaders and true patriot: former President Ronald \nReagan. His legacy extends far beyond his Presidency. I think it's only \nfitting that I introduce this legislation today, since President Reagan \nworked tirelessly to end the Cold War and liberate millions of people, \nand we see the same dedication today to free the people of Iraq. \nPresident Reagan spoke about the threat of Saddam Hussein, and asked, \n``will we be ready to respond?'' He went on to answer this question by \nsaying, ``In the end, it all comes down to leadership. This is what \nthis country is looking for now. It was leadership here at home that \ngave us strong American influence abroad and the collapse of imperial \ncommunism. Great nations have responsibilities to lead and we should \nalways be cautious of those who would lower our profile because they \nmight just wind up lowering our flag.'' He made these comments not two \nweeks ago, and not even two months ago. President Reagan, already \nsensitive to the threat posed by Saddam Hussein, asked this rhetorical \nquestion in 1994. This foresight was evident during President Reagan's \ntenure in the White House. President Reagan played a significant role \nin framing the modern political landscape, and I am proud to do what I \ncan to commemorate his contribution to America and the world. I can \nclearly remember President Reagan's visit to Big Sky Country in 1982 \nfor the Centennial celebration for Billings and Yellowstone County. He \narrived in the Billings Metra Arena, one of the largest venues in the \nState, riding in a stagecoach. He embraced the ideals that Montana \nstood for, and said he was trying to bring a little of it to \nWashington. I feel much the same way as President Reagan did when he \nsaid, ``What we're trying to do in Washington is reawaken the \ngovernment to the very values that you here in Billings represent--\ndetermination, responsibility, confidence, and common sense--the kind \nof common sense that says if it ain't broke, don't fix it. We are \nreintroducing the idea that progress is still an American word and that \noptimism is still an American trait. I believe if we cling to our hopes \nand dreams, I believe the future will flower just as it did for the \nfounders of Billings, Montana.'' Now more than ever, we need to \nremember that ``progress'' and ``optimism'' are part of the American \nvocabulary. The wisdom of President Reagan helped guide us in the right \ndirection, and I am pleased and honored to introduce this legislation \ntoday so that we may dedicate a piece of Montana to a great visionary \nand statesman.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH:\n  S. 868. A bill to amend the Coos, Lower Umpqua, and Siuslaw \nRestoration Act to provide for the cultural restoration and economic \nself-sufficiency of the Confederation Tribes of Coos, Lower Umpqua, and \nSiuslaw Indians of Oregon, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nIndian Affairs.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwill restore to the members of the Confederated Tribes of the Coos, \nLower Umpqua and Siuslaw Indians a small portion of their ancestral \nhomelands.\n  The story of these Tribes' experience is well worth hearing. For many \nof my colleagues, parts of it will sound familiar, as it reflects the \nhistory of the early west. In 1850, gold was discovered at a place \nknown as Eight Dollar Bar, near what we now call Cave Junction, OR. \nWithin months thousands of miners with gold fever moved into the area. \nIndians struggled to protect their land while miners aggressively \npursued their vision of the American dream.\n  In 1855, Joel Palmer, an Indian Agent for the Oregon Territory was \nsent in by the Federal Government to negotiate treaties with Oregon \ntribes. Treaties with the tribes of the Rogue River, Umpqua/Cow Creek, \nand Calapooyas were established, but not the tribes of the central and \nsouthern Oregon coast. Much of this land is now in the Siuslaw National \nForest.\n  The Coos, Lower Umpqua and Siuslaw Indians were not a warring people. \nThey were prepared to share their ancestral homelands, which \napproximated about 1.6 million acres in the coast mountain range, \nliving on a small portion of the land and receiving compensation for \nthe balance. In 1855 and in good faith the tribes signed the Empire \nTreaty with the Federal Government. But, somewhere between Empire, \nOregon and the floor of the U.S. Senate the treaty was lost. No land \nwas allotted for their reservation and no compensation given.\n  In 1856 the Rogue River War began and the Coos, Lower Umpqua and \nSiuslaw Indians were marched north and held prisoner in what was called \nthe Coast Reservation. They were held against their will until the mid-\n1870s. It was during this dark period in their history that over half \ntheir population died.\n  With their release, tribal members returned to their homelands, only \nto find they had neither land nor resources left. At this point, the \nthree tribes formed a Confederation. In 1954, by Presidential order the \nConfederation's tribal status was terminated. These decades were \ndifficult ones for members of this Tribe. Lack of education and \neconomic opportunities in the area, and racism by some of their white \nneighbors took a heavy toll.\n  In 1984, the Oregon congressional delegation sought and achieved \nfederal recognition for the Confederated Tribes of the Coos, Lower \nUmpqua and Siuslaw Indians. At the same time, no reservation lands were \ngranted to the tribe and no compensation offered. The Tribe received a \ndonation of approximately 6 acres in Empire, Oregon. This is now the \nsite of their tribal hall where services are provided to their members \nand tribal council meetings and tribal events are held. Small, \nadditional tracts have been purchased over time.\n  The Indian Self-Determination Act encourages tribes to develop plans \nto achieve the goals of cultural restoration, economic self-sufficiency \nand attain the standard of living enjoyed by other citizens of the \nUnited States. The Confederated Tribes have been working diligently \nsince 1954 to attain those goals.\n  An essential component in this effort is the Reservation Plan and \nForest Land Restoration Proposal. It will provide a long-term source of \nrevenue and lessen dependence on federal funding to operate Tribal \ngovernment programs and to provide economic benefits to local \ncommunities. The Plan will revitalize Tribal culture by reconnecting \nTribal people to their ancestral homelands and it will provide a net \nbenefit to the environment by improving the health of ancestral \nwatersheds.\n  My staff and I began meeting with Tribal members soon after I was \nfirst elected to the Senate. Years of work with local citizens, \ncommunities and governments to gain understanding and support for the \nland restoration proposal have been successful. Hundreds of individual \nmeetings, workshops and open forums have been held by the Tribes. \nDevelopment of the Reservation Plan and Forest Land Restoration \nProposal has led to a clear understanding of what activities can occur \non these lands which is reflected in the legislation that I have \nintroduced today.\n  I am proud to introduce legislation today that will return \napproximately 63,000 acres of their ancestral homeland to the \nConfederated Tribes of the Coos, Lower Umpqua and Siuslaw Indians. \nThese U.S. Forest Service lands encompass a portion of the Siuslaw \nNational Forest. Under the legislation, management of the restored \nlands would be transferred to the Bureau of Indian Affairs with title \nheld in trust by the Secretary of the Interior for the Confederated \nTribes.\n  These lands contain significant cultural sites: encampments, \nspiritual and burial sites. My proposal will allow these people to meet \ntheir cultural goals, and provide economic and environmental benefits \nto all of the citizens of the region. The legislation ensures continued \npublic access to these lands for hunting and fishing, recreation and \ntransportation. Applicable\n\n[[Page S5194]]\n\nState and Federal laws will be followed. Payments to county governments \nwill not be impacted under this proposal. Timber harvested from this \nland will be processed domestically by local mills. Twenty percent of \nthe revenues from the land will be reinvested in watershed management \nactivities to restore habitat. These lands contain some significant \nenvironmental sites. They will be preserved. These lands are not \nsuitable for nor will the laws allow gaming to occur on them.\n  Revenue gained from activities on these lands will help meet the \nself-sufficiency goals of the Confederated Tribes. It will be used to \nassist seniors through elder housing programs, youth through \nscholarships, low income housing for those in need and provide health \ncare benefits for all of the Tribal members.\n  The Confederated Tribes of the Coos, Lower Umpqua and Siuslaw are the \nonly federally recognized tribe in Oregon that has never received any \nland or compensation for the loss of their homeland from the United \nStates Government. This legislation works to right that wrong, to \nrestore a Tribe, to restore a forest, and to restore a very special \nrelationship between the two.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Graham of \n        South Carolina, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Biden, Mr. \n        Specter, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Johnson, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Hollings, \n        Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. Clinton, and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 869. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for enhanced reimbursement under the medicare program for \nscreening and diagnostic mammography services, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President. Today I am introducing legislation, the \nAssure Access to Mammography Act of 2003, on behalf of myself and my \ncolleagues, Senators Snowe, Inouye, Graham of South Carolina, Murray, \nCorzine, Biden, Specter, Landrieu, Johnson, Lincoln, Hollings, \nMikulski, Clinton, and Ms. Collins to ensure women have full and timely \naccess to preventive breast cancer screenings. As you know, the earlier \na woman is diagnosed with breast cancer, the earlier she can begin to \nreceive treatment and the more likely she will survive.\n  Unfortunately, due to inadequate reimbursement rates for mammograms, \nwomen increasingly are having problems getting the mammograms they \nneed. Across the nation, there have been reports of women waiting up to \nsix months for an appointment for this simple procedure. While \nmammograms often cost up to $150 to administer, Medicare's \nreimbursement rate is currently set at about $82, barely over half the \nactual cost of the procedure. This disparity increasingly makes access \na real problem, forcing many private centers to shut down and creating \na shortage of providers willing to provide services significantly below \ncost.\n  The Assure Access to Mammography Act would reverse this growing and \nalarming trend by correcting the two primary causes of the problem. \nFirst, it would increase Medicare reimbursement to radiologists to a \nreasonable level to ensure health care providers are reimbursed fairly \nfor mammography services. Second, the bill would increase the number of \nradiologists by increasing the Graduate Medical Education payments to \nprovide for three additional radiologists in each teaching hospital. \nFinally, the Assure Access to Mammography Act would provide a MEDPAC \nstudy on the Medicare reimbursement structure for gender specific \nmedical procedures so that Congress and CMS have the tools we need to \nmake appropriate health policy decisions.\n  This is an issue that hits close to home for me. Both of my sisters \ndied of breast cancer, at a time when mammograms were not readily \navailable. While imperfect, mammograms are the best-known way to \ndiagnose breast cancer at an early stage in order to reduce mortality. \nAs our society ages, one million additional women each year are needing \nregular mammograms. The Assure Access to Mammography Act will provide \nthe resources our health care system needs to guarantee all women \naccess to the mammograms they need to ensure that breast cancer is \ndetected early enough to apply appropriate treatments effectively. I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues to pass this needed \nbipartisan legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN (for himself, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Hagel, Mr. \n        Domenici, and Mr. Feingold):\n  S. 871. A bill to provide for global pathogen surveillance and \nresponse, to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to re-introduce today the ``Global \nPathogen Surveillance Act''.\n  Last year, this bill passed the Senate by unanimous consent on August \n1st, but died when the House of Representatives failed to take timely \naction.\n  The Global Pathogen Surveillance Act authorizes $150 million over the \nnext two years to help developing nations improve global disease \nsurveillance.\n  That will go a long way to prevent and contain both biological \nweapons attacks, if, God forbid, it happens, and naturally occurring \ninfectious disease outbreaks around the world.\n  I'm happy to announce that Senators Lugar, Kennedy, Hagel, Domenici, \nand Feingold are joining me in co-sponsoring this bill.\n  The mysterious global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, \nor SARS, is an unfortunate reminder of why this bill is so important. \nWe've heard a lot about it. We don't know much about it yet.\n  We know it's a contagious respiratory illness which apparently \noriginated in the Guangdong province of China last November, has \nstricken more than 2600 individuals in 17 countries, taking the lives \nof at least 100 individuals.\n  The World Health Organization is concerned. They've issued a rare \nglobal health alert and discouraged travel to certain nations as \nauthorities struggle to determine the cause of this flu-like illness \nand what viral or infectious agent is involved.\n  The WHO has not ruled out bioterrorism as a potential cause for the \nepidemic, although it is unlikely that a disease with only a 4 to 5 \npercent mortality would be used.\n  What's so scary about this outbreak is that doctors and nurses taking \ncare of sick patients have fallen ill themselves; initial tests have \nnot revealed evidence of infection with any previously known virus or \nbacterial agent; and patients are not being cured by standard \ntreatments, although the vast majority do recover.\n  How would better disease surveillance have helped in dealing with \nthis kind of crisis?\n  Experts suspect this epidemic first originated in the Guangdong \nprovince in southern China in November, but peaked in early February.\n  A comprehensive surveillance network might have picked up the unique \nsymptoms of this epidemic earlier . . . might have led to quicker \ndiagnosis and better containment measures.\n  We would have had a better chance to keep this epidemic contained \nwithin China, before the pathogen spread to neighboring nations, and \nnow to Canada and the United States.\n  Over the last eighteen months, Americans have become all too familiar \nwith the threat of bioterrorism and the army of deadly agents capable \nof spreading death and disease--anthrax, Ebola, and smallpox are only \nthe most sensational examples.\n  We've had to strengthen our homeland defenses--not just against \nterrorists armed with bombs and explosives--but against shadowy figures \ncarrying vials of deadly pathogens.\n  But all in all, this country is making important advances on the \ndomestic front in bioterrorism defense.\n  Last year, the President signed into law the Bioterrorism Prevention \nAct of 2002, a comprehensive domestic initiative co-sponsored by \nSenators Kennedy and Frist.\n  In January, the Centers for Disease Control announced an initiative \nto establish electronic surveillance systems in eight American cities \nas the cornerstone of an eventual national network.\n  In Delaware, we're developing the very first, comprehensive, state-\nwide electronic reporting system for infectious diseases.\n  It'll serve as a prototype for other states by enabling much earlier \ndetection of infectious disease outbreaks.\n  But a domestic defense against biological weapons isn't sufficient \nalone.\n\n[[Page S5195]]\n\n  Biological weapons are a global threat with no respect for borders. A \ndangerous pathogen released on another continent can quickly spread to \nthe United States in a matter of days, if not hours.\n  A terrorist group could launch a biological weapons attacks in Mexico \nin the expectation that the epidemic would quickly spread to the United \nStates.\n  A rogue state might experiment with new disease strains in another \ncountry, intending later to release them here.\n  And international trade, travel, and migration patterns offer \nunlimited opportunities for pathogens to spread across national borders \nand to move from one continent to another.\n  We should make no mistake: in today's world, all infectious disease \nepidemics, wherever they occur and whether they are deliberately \nengineered or are naturally occurring, are a potential threat to all \nnations, including the United States. Such a threat need not begin in \nthe United States to reach our shores.\n  For that reason, our response cannot be limited to the United States \nalone.\n  Global disease surveillance, a systematic approach to tracking \ndisease outbreaks as they occur and evolve around the world, is \nessential to any real international response.\n  Why is disease surveillance so important? A biological weapons attack \nsucceeds partly through the element of surprise.\n  As Dr. Alan P. Zelicoff of the Sandia National Laboratory testified \nbefore the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last spring, early \nwarning of a biological weapons attack can prevent illness and death in \nall but a small fraction of those infected.\n  A cluster of flu-like symptoms in a city or region may be dismissed \nby doctors as just the flu when in fact it may be anthrax, plague, or \nanother biological weapon.\n  But armed with the knowledge that a suspicious epidemic has emerged, \ndoctors and nurses can examine their patients in a different light and, \nin many cases, effectively treat them.\n  Disease surveillance is a fancy phrase for a comprehensive reporting \nsystem to quickly identify and communicate abnormal patterns of \nsymptoms and illnesses that can quickly alert doctors across a region \nthat a suspicious disease outbreak has occurred.\n  Epidemiological specialists can then investigate and combat the \noutbreak.\n  And if it's a new disease or strain, we can begin to develop \ntreatments that much earlier.\n  An effective disease surveillance system helps even in the absence of \nbiological weapons attacks. Bubonic plague is bubonic plague, whether \nit is deliberately engineered or naturally occurring.\n  Just as disease surveillance can help contain a biological weapons \nattack, it can also help contain a naturally occurring outbreak of \ninfectious disease.\n  According to the World Health Organization, thirty new infectious \ndiseases have emerged over the past thirty years; between 1996 and 2001 \nalone, more than 800 infectious disease outbreaks occurred around the \nworld, on every continent.\n  The SARS epidemic is only the most recent such outbreak. With better \nsurveillance, we can do a better job of mitigating the consequences of \nthese disease outbreaks.\n  A good surveillance system requires trained epidemiological \npersonnel, adequate laboratory tools for quick diagnosis, and working \ncommunications equipment to circulate information.\n  Even here, in the most advanced Nation in the world, many States and \ncities rely on old-fashioned pencil and paper methods of tracking \ndisease patterns.\n  Thankfully, the comprehensive bioterrorism legislation enacted into \nlaw last year is beginning to correct that.\n  Now, it is vitally important that we extend these initiatives into \nthe international arena.\n  In 2000, the World Health Organization established the first truly \nglobal disease surveillance system, the Global Alert and Response \nNetwork, to monitor and track infectious disease outbreaks everywhere.\n  The WHO has done an impressive job so far with this initiative, \nworking on a shoestring budget. But this global network is only as good \nas its components--individual nations.\n  Unfortunately, developing nations--those nations most likely to \nexperience rapid disease outbreaks--simply don't have the trained \npersonnel, the laboratory equipment, or the public health \ninfrastructure to do the job. . . to track evolving disease patterns or \ndetect emerging pathogens.\n  According to a January 2000 report by the National Intelligence \nCouncil, developing nations in Africa and Asia have established only \nrudimentary systems, if any at all, for disease surveillance, response, \nand prevention.\n  The World Health Organization reports that more than 60 percent of \nlaboratory equipment in developing countries is either outdated or non-\nfunctioning.\n  This lack of preparedness can lead to tragic results. In August 1994 \nin Surat, a city in western India, a surge of complaints about flea \ninfestation and a growing rat population was followed by a cluster of \nreports about patients exhibiting the symptoms of pneumonic plague.\n  But authorities were unable to connect the dots and warn people until \nthe plague had spread to seven states across India, ultimately killing \n56 people and costing the Indian economy $600 million.\n  Had the Indian authorities possessed better surveillance tools, they \nmay well have contained the epidemic, limited the loss of life, and \navoided the panic that led to economically disastrous embargoes on \ntrade and travel.\n  Thanks to improved surveillance, an outbreak of pneumonic plague in \nIndia last year was detected more quickly and contained with only few \ndeaths--with no costly panic.\n  In short, developing nations are the weak links in any comprehensive \nglobal disease surveillance network.\n  Unless we take action to shore up their capabilities to detect and \ncontain disease outbreaks, we leave the entire world vulnerable to a \ndeliberate biological weapons attack or a virulent natural epidemic.\n  It's for these reasons that I'm reintroducing the Global Pathogen \nSurveillance Act. This bill will authorize $150 million in FY 2004 and \nFY 2005 to strengthen the disease surveillance capabilities of \ndeveloping nations.\n  First, the bill seeks to ensure in developing nations a greater \nnumber of personnel trained in basic epidemiological techniques.\n  It offers enhances in-country training for medical and laboratory \npersonnel and the opportunity for select personnel to come to the \nUnited States to receive training in our Centers for Disease Control \nlaboratories and Master of Public Health programs in American \nuniversities.\n  Second, it provides assistance to developing nations to acquire basic \nlaboratory equipment, including items as basic as microscopes, so they \ncan quickly diagnose pathogens.\n  Third, it enables developing nations to obtain communications \nequipment to quickly transmit data on disease patterns and pathogen \ndiagnoses, both inside a nation and to regional organizations and the \nWHO.\n  Again, we're not talking about fancy high-tech equipment, but basics \nlike fax machines and internet-equipped computers.\n  Finally--to create a real incentive for nations to promptly report \nsuspicious disease outbreaks and offer international health authorities \nprompt access--the bill gives preference to those countries that agree \nto let international health experts investigate any suspicious disease \noutbreaks.\n  If passed, the Global Pathogen Surveillance Act will go a long way in \nensuring that developing nations acquire the basic disease surveillance \ncapabilities to link up effectively with the WHO's global network.\n  It's an inexpensive and common sense solution to a problem of global \nproportions--the dual threat of biological weapons and naturally \noccurring infectious diseases.\n  Make no mistake--this bill will contribute to our homeland security. \nThe funding authorized is only a tiny fraction of what we will spend \ndomestically on bioterrorism defenses, but this investment will pay \nenormous dividends in terms of our national security.\n  In a report released only last month on global infectious disease, \nthe National Academies' Institute of Medicine said, ``The United States \nshould\n\n[[Page S5196]]\n\ntake a leadership role in promoting the implementation of a \ncomprehensive system of surveillance for global infectious diseases \nthat builds on the current global capacity of infectious disease \nmonitoring.'' By introducing this bill, I hope that our nation can \nbegin to assume that mantle of leadership in this critical area.\n  Let me close with an excerpt of testimony from a Foreign Relations \nCommittee hearing held on September 5, 2001. Dr. D.A. Henderson, the \nman who spearheaded the successful international campaign to eradicate \nsmallpox in the 1970's, most recently served as the principal advisor \nto Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy Thompson in organizing \nthe nation's defenses against bioterrorism.\n  Dr. Henderson, who at the time of the hearing was a private citizen, \nwas very clear on the value of global disease surveillance: ``In \ncooperation with the WHO and other countries, we need to strengthen \ngreatly our intelligence gathering capability.\n  A focus on international surveillance and on scientist-to-scientist \ncommunication will be necessary if we are to have an early warning \nabout the possible development and production of biological weapons by \nrogue nations or groups.''\n  Dr. Henderson is exactly right. We cannot leave the rest of the world \nto fend for itself in combating biological weapons and infectious \ndiseases if we are to ensure America's security.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the ``Global Pathogen \nSurveillance Act'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 871\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Global Pathogen Surveillance \n     Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Bioterrorism poses a grave national security threat to \n     the United States. The insidious nature of the threat, the \n     likely delayed recognition in the event of an attack, and the \n     underpreparedness of the domestic public health \n     infrastructure may produce catastrophic consequences \n     following a biological weapons attack upon the United States.\n       (2) A contagious pathogen engineered as a biological weapon \n     and developed, tested, produced, or released in another \n     country can quickly spread to the United States. Given the \n     realities of international travel, trade, and migration \n     patterns, a dangerous pathogen released anywhere in the world \n     can spread to United States territory in a matter of days, \n     before any effective quarantine or isolation measures can be \n     implemented.\n       (3) To effectively combat bioterrorism and ensure that the \n     United States is fully prepared to prevent, diagnose, and \n     contain a biological weapons attack, measures to strengthen \n     the domestic public health infrastructure and improve \n     domestic surveillance and monitoring, while absolutely \n     essential, are not sufficient.\n       (4) The United States should enhance cooperation with the \n     World Health Organization, regional health organizations, and \n     individual countries, including data sharing with appropriate \n     United States departments and agencies, to help detect and \n     quickly contain infectious disease outbreaks or bioterrorism \n     agents before they can spread.\n       (5) The World Health Organization (WHO) has done an \n     impressive job in monitoring infectious disease outbreaks \n     around the world, including the recent emergence of the \n     Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic, \n     particularly with the establishment in April 2000 of the \n     Global Outbreak Alert and Response network.\n       (6) The capabilities of the World Health Organization are \n     inherently limited by the quality of the data and information \n     it receives from member countries, the narrow range of \n     diseases (plague, cholera, and yellow fever) upon which its \n     disease surveillance and monitoring is based, and the \n     consensus process it uses to add new diseases to the list. \n     Developing countries in particular often cannot devote the \n     necessary resources to build and maintain public health \n     infrastructures.\n       (7) In particular, developing countries could benefit \n     from--\n       (A) better trained public health professionals and \n     epidemiologists to recognize disease patterns;\n       (B) appropriate laboratory equipment for diagnosis of \n     pathogens;\n       (C) disease reporting is based on symptoms and signs (known \n     as ``syndrome surveillance''), enabling the earliest possible \n     opportunity to conduct an effective response;\n       (D) a narrowing of the existing technology gap in syndrome \n     surveillance capabilities and real-time information \n     dissemination to public health officials; and\n       (E) appropriate communications equipment and information \n     technology to efficiently transmit information and data \n     within national and regional health networks, including \n     inexpensive, Internet-based Geographic Information Systems \n     (GIS) and relevant telephone-based systems for early \n     recognition and diagnosis of diseases.\n       (8) An effective international capability to monitor and \n     quickly diagnose infectious disease outbreaks will offer \n     dividends not only in the event of biological weapons \n     development, testing, production, and attack, but also in the \n     more likely cases of naturally occurring infectious disease \n     outbreaks that could threaten the United States. Furthermore, \n     a robust surveillance system will serve to deter terrorist \n     use of biological weapons, as early detection will help \n     mitigate the intended effects of such malevolent uses.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n       (1) To enhance the capability and cooperation of the \n     international community, including the World Health \n     Organization and individual countries, through enhanced \n     pathogen surveillance and appropriate data sharing, to \n     detect, identify, and contain infectious disease outbreaks, \n     whether the cause of those outbreaks is intentional human \n     action or natural in origin.\n       (2) To enhance the training of public health professionals \n     and epidemiologists from eligible developing countries in \n     advanced Internet-based and other electronic syndrome \n     surveillance systems, in addition to traditional epidemiology \n     methods, so that they may better detect, diagnose, and \n     contain infectious disease outbreaks, especially those due to \n     pathogens most likely to be used in a biological weapons \n     attack.\n       (3) To provide assistance to developing countries to \n     purchase appropriate public health laboratory equipment \n     necessary for infectious disease surveillance and diagnosis.\n       (4) To provide assistance to developing countries to \n     purchase appropriate communications equipment and information \n     technology, including, as appropriate, relevant computer \n     equipment, Internet connectivity mechanisms, and telephone-\n     based applications to effectively gather, analyze, and \n     transmit public health information for infectious disease \n     surveillance and diagnosis.\n       (5) To make available greater numbers of United States \n     Government public health professionals to international \n     health organizations, regional health networks, and United \n     States diplomatic missions where appropriate.\n       (6) To establish ``lab-to-lab'' cooperative relationships \n     between United States public health laboratories and \n     established foreign counterparts.\n       (7) To expand the training and outreach activities of \n     overseas United States laboratories, including Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention and Department of Defense \n     entities, to enhance the disease surveillance capabilities of \n     developing countries.\n       (8) To provide appropriate technical assistance to existing \n     regional health networks and, where appropriate, seed money \n     for new regional networks.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to authorize funding for catalysis science and \nengineering research and development at the Department of Energy for \nfiscal years 2004 through 2009; and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill \nentitled the Department of Energy Catalysis Research and Development \nAct.\n  Catalysis is at the heart of fuels production in the petroleum and \nchemical industries. Catalytic converters help reduce emissions of \ncars. Catalysis can help reduce carbon dioxide from industrial plants, \nwhich can contribute to global warming. The science of catalysis can \nhelp our pharmaceutical industry by one day mimicking nature's enzymes \nwhich are nature's catalysts. The industries I just mentioned \ncontribute $500 billion to our gross national product; they all rely on \ncatalysis to produce new compounds as efficiently as possible.\n  The catalysis science program is one of the hidden gems at the \nDepartment of Energy's Office of Science. The Department supports over \n60 percent of the catalysis research in the Federal Government. I feel \nit is important that our energy bill highlights its basic research, and \nrecommends a steady increase in funding levels for it.\n  The bill seeks to help the Department meet what it called the ''grand \nchallenge'' in catalytic chemistry. The ``grand challenge'' which this \nbill seeks to address is first, the ability to design, at the atom \nlevel, catalytic structures to control ``catalytic activity'', or the \nrate at which a chemical reaction proceeds. The second part of this \n``grand challenge'' is to control the ``selectivity'' of a catalytic \nreaction, or the ability of a catalytic compound to precisely seek out \nother chemicals through which to start a reaction. To achieve this \n`'grand challenge'', this bill directs the Department to design new \ncatalytic compounds using the latest advancements in scientific \ncomputing. Today's computers are rapidly approaching a point where we \ncan model a chemical reaction by simulating its atom level \nconstituents. This bill directs the Department to utilize its state-of-\nthe-art diagnostic equipment at its national laboratories and \nuniversities to analyze catalytic reactions in real time, and at the \natomic level. These diagnostics will be used to validate computational \nmodels being developed in the advanced scientific computing program. \nThis bill directs the Department to use the emerging field of \nnanoscience to tailor new catalytic compounds atom by atom, so as to \naccelerate reactions to produce clean fuels at rates that far exceed \nwhat we know today. In that regard, I expect the Department to utilize \nits nanoscience facilities to help design these new compounds. If we \nare successful in meeting this grand challenge, we will bring fuels to \nmarket quicker to meet increasing energy demands, while using less \noverall energy to produce them.\n  Finally, the bill directs the Secretary fund these efforts in \nmultidisciplinary teams including computer scientists, chemists, \nbiochemists, materials scientists and physicists. It requires the \nDepartment to transfer its catalysis research to industry so that they \ncan bring to market the full fruits of our Government's advanced energy \nresearch in the shortest time possible.\n  We are currently debating an energy bill in the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee. We plan to shortly mark up the research and \ndevelopment section, and, I think it is vitally important that this \nsection address the topic of catalysis to produce future fuels for our \nNation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 873\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Department of Energy \n     Catalysis Research and Development Act''.\n\n[[Page S5199]]\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that catalysis science is critical to \n     the production of fuels for energy generation, the reduction \n     of toxic waste streams, and the development of compounds to \n     reduce global warming.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Establishment.--The Secretary of Energy, through the \n     Director of the Office of Science of the Department of \n     Energy, shall establish a program of research and development \n     in catalysis science consistent with the Secretary's \n     statutory authorities related to research and development.\n       (b) Scope of the Program.--The program shall include \n     efforts to--\n       (1) enable catalyst design using--\n       (i) combined experimental and mechanistic methodologies, \n     and\n       (ii) computational modeling of catalytic reactions at the \n     molecular level;\n       (2) develop techniques for--\n       (i) high throughout synthesis of catalysts and novel assays \n     for rapid throughout catalyst testing of small quantities of \n     catalysts on diverse processes,\n       (ii) reducing the analytical cycle time by parallel \n     operation and automation,\n       (iii) characterizing catalysts at the 0.1 to 2 nanometer \n     scale, and\n       (iv) characterizing catalysts in-situ under actual \n     operating conditions at high temperature and pressure,\n       (3) synthesize catalysts with specific site architecture,\n       (4) conduct research in the use of precious metals for \n     catalysis (excluding platinum, palladium, and rhodium),\n       (5) translate molecular (picoscale) and nanoscale \n     fundamentals to the design of catalytic compounds.\n       (c) Duties of the Director of the Office of Science.--In \n     carrying out the program under this Act, the Director of the \n     Office of Science shall--\n       (1) support both individual investigators and \n     multidisciplinary teams of investigators that include teams \n     drawing upon the expertise of homogeneous, heterogeneous, and \n     biocatalytic investigators to pioneer new approaches in \n     catalytic design;\n       (2) develop, plan, construct, acquire, share, or operate \n     special equipment or facilities for the use of investigators \n     conducting research and development in catalysis science in \n     collaboration with national user facilities such as \n     nanoscience and engineering centers;\n       (3) support technology transfer activities to benefit \n     industry and other users of catalysis science and \n     engineering; and\n       (4) coordinate research and development activities with \n     industry and other federal agencies.\n       (d) Merit Review Required.-- All grants, contracts, \n     cooperative agreements, or other financial assistance awards \n     under this Act shall be made only after independent merit \n     review.\n       (e) Triennal Assessment.--The National Academy of Sciences \n     shall review the catalysis program every three years to \n     report on gains made in the fundamental science of catalysis \n     and its progress made towards developing new fuels for energy \n     production, material fabrication processes and methods to \n     reduce global warming.\n\n     SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       The following sums are authorized to be appropriated to the \n     Secretary of Energy, to remain available until expended, for \n     the purposes of carrying out this Act:\n       (1) $33,000,000 for fiscal year 2004.\n       (2) $35,000,000 for fiscal year 2005.\n       (3) $36,500,000 for fiscal year 2006.\n       (4) $38,200,000 for fiscal year 2007.\n       (5) $40,100,000 for fiscal year 2008.\n       (6) $42,100,000 for fiscal year 2009.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. TALENT (for himself, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. Graham of South \n        Carolina):\n  S. 874. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \ninclude primary and secondary preventative medical strategies for \nchildren and adults with Sickle Cell Disease as medical assistance \nunder the medicaid program, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, today I rise on behalf of myself and my \ncolleagues, Senators Charles Schumer and Lindsey Graham, in support of \nthe Sickle Cell Treatment Act of 2003, which will help hundreds of \nthousands of people who suffer from Sickle Cell Disease. SCD, a genetic \ndisease that affects red blood cells. This bill has bipartisan and \nbicameral support, as Representatives Danny K. Davis, a Democrat, and \nRichard Burr, a Republican, will introduce the companion bill today.\n  Sickle Cell Disease is an inherited blood disorder that is a major \nhealth problem in the United States, primarily affecting African \nAmericans. People with sickle cell disease have red blood cells that \ncontain an abnormal type of hemoglobin. Sometimes these red blood cells \nbecome sickle-shaped--crescent shaped--and have difficulty passing \nthrough small blood vessels. When sickle-shaped cells block small blood \nvessels, less blood can reach that part of the body. Tissue that does \nnot receive a normal blood flow eventually becomes damaged. This is \nwhat essentially causes the potentially life-threatening complications \nof sickle cell disease. There is currently no cure.\n  More than 2,500,000 Americans, mostly African Americans, have the \nsickle cell trait. Among newborn American infants, SCD occurs in \napproximately 1, in 300 African Americans. The most feared complication \nfor children with SCD is a stroke, which may affect infants as young as \n18 months of age. While some patients can remain without symptoms for \nyears, many others may not survive infancy or early childhood.\n  Many adults with SCD have severe physical problems, such as acute \nlung complications that can result in death. Adults with SCD can also \ndevelop chronic problems, including pulmonary disease, pulmonary \nhypertension, and kidney failure. The average life span for an adult \nwith SCD is the mid-40s. Stroke in the adult SCD population commonly \nresults in both mental and physical disabilities for life.\n  The Sickle Cell Treatment Act of 2003 helps combat SCD by providing \nFederal matching funds for SCD-related services under Medicaid, and by \nallowing States to receive a Federal 50-50 match for nonmedical \nexpenses related to SCD treatment such as genetic counseling. This bill \nalso authorizes a grant program in the amount of $10 million per year \nfor 5 years to fund 40 health centers nationwide. Although I will go \ninto detail about the bill, its focus is to encourage States to partner \nwith SCD providers, who have historically been on the frontlines of \nthis issue, to treat and find a cure for SCD patients.\n  With regard to the Federal matching funds, this bill allows states to \nreimburse SCD services beyond current Medicaid law, which only covers \nphysician and laboratory services. For example, if a State wanted to \nincrease reimbursement rates for SCD blood transfusions, it could do so \nthrough rate setting for the new SCD benefit without having to increase \nreimbursement for all Medicaid blood transfusions, therefore, making it \neasier for a State to reimburse at a higher rate for SCD-related \ntreatment.\n\n  The bill also provides Federal reimbursement for education and other \nservices related to the prevention and treatment of SCD. This will \nallow States to get a Federal 50-50 match for nonmedical, \nadministrative expenses to include outreach and genetic counseling \nabout SCD and its treatment for SCD patients of any age. This is \ncritical to helping this historically underserved population, many of \nwho may not know about SCD or its symptoms until it is too late.\n  This bill also allows hospitals and clinics to do outreach with non-\nmedical personnel to educate high-risk communities about recognizing \nSCD. It would also allow nonmedical personnel like counselors to spend \ntime with SCD families to discuss how to manage the disease. Providing \nthis one-stop shop will centralize SCD-related treatment and counseling \nservices to better serve those with SCD.\n  In addition to the diagnosis and treatment components, this bill \ncreates a grant program for 40 health centers nationally. Specifically, \nthe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is authorized to \ndistribute grants to up to 40 eligible health centers nationwide for $5 \nmillion for the next 5 fiscal years. Grants may be used for purposes \nincluding the education, treatment--i.e., genetic counseling and \ntesting--and continuity of care for individuals with SCD, for training \nhealth professionals, and to identify and secure additional Federal \nfunds to continue SCD treatment.\n  This bill also creates a National Coordinating Center to collect, \nmonitor and distribute information on new and innovative practices to \nprevent and treat SCD, establish a model protocol for the grant \nrecipients to follow as a quality control mechanism, develop \neducational materials regarding the prevention and treatment of SCD, \nand submit a report to Congress to ensure fiscal accountability and \nprovide information of recent developments towards a cure for SCD.\n  The Sickle Cell Treatment Act of 2003 provides tremendous benefits to \nStates. The approach taken in this bill is to add services related to \nSCD to the list of services covered by Medicaid for those people who \nare eligible for Medicaid under current eligibility rules.\n\n[[Page S5200]]\n\nFor example, the bill allows States to use Medicaid funds to work with \nproviders to better serve areas with a high prevalence of SCD in fields \nsuch as education and counseling,which are currently not reimbursed by \nMedicaid. This bill also allows the States to create opportunities to \npartner with providers to determine ``best practices'' to encourage the \nmost effective and efficient use of medical resources toward SCD \ntreatment and education.\n  In introducing the Sickle Cell Treatment Act of 2003, we are trying \nto help thousands of Americans who live with this disease. This \nlegislation will provide many of these patients with access to the \nessential treatments that they need. It has the support of many \nimportant groups representing the SCD, African-American and children's \nhealth care communities as well as the providers and researchers who \nare working to treat and find a cure for this disease. For example, \nAllan Platt, Program Coordinator, The Georgia Comprehensive Sickle Cell \nCenter at Grady Health System in Atlanta, GA has written me the \nfollowing letter, which states in part, ``You did a wonderful thing for \nsickle cell patients and for those who are caring for them. Let us know \nhow we can rally support for this.''\n  I want to offer my appreciation to the Sickle Cell Disease \nAssociation of American Inc., SCDAA, for its vigilant efforts to help \nfind a cure for SCD, and working with my office to help craft this \ncritical piece of legislation. SCDAA President and Chief Operating \nOfficer, Lynda K. Anderson, has provided tireless support on behalf of \nthis effort. Also I would like to acknowledge the efforts of SCDAA \nBoard Member Michael R. DeBaun, M.D., M.P.H, Assistant Professor of \nPediatrics and Biostatistics at the Washington University School of \nMedicine in St. Louis, MO. Lynda and Michael have brought the issues \naddressed in this bill to my attention and helped to bring the \nintroduction of this bill to fruition.\n  The SCDAA was founded in 1971 to provide an effective coordinated \ncommunity-based approach to developing and implementing strategies to \nresolve issues surrounding sickle cell disease. Through three decades, \nSCDAA and its member organizations have demonstrated how community-\nbased organizations and comprehensive health and research centers can \nwork with local, State and Federal agencies in furtherance of national \nhealth care objectives. To this day, SCDAA continues to pursue \nlegislative initiatives to secure additional government funding for \nresearch and community-based services. Moreover, it has demonstrated \nits capacity to provide continued leadership in this area as a \npotential national coordinator center, and I look forward to the \norganization applying for such a designation, once this measure has \nbeen enacted into law. My colleagues and I on both sides of the aisle \nand in both legislative bodies look forward to working with SCDAA to \nfight this good fight and to secure the resources required to address \nthe very unique needs of patients, families and communities affected by \nSCD.\n  I ask that my colleagues in the Senate join Senators Schumer and \nGraham, and Representatives Davis and Burr in helping us to find a cure \nto help the approximately 70,000 Americans who have SCD and the \napproximately 1,800 American babies who are born with this disease each \nyear in supporting the Sickle Cell Treatment Act of 2003.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 874\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Sickle Cell Treatment Act of \n     2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Sickle Cell Disease (in this section referred to as \n     ``SCD'') is an inherited disease of red blood cells that is a \n     major health problem in the United States.\n       (2) Approximately 70,000 Americans have SCD and \n     approximately 1,800 American babies are born with the disease \n     each year. SCD also is a global problem with close to 300,000 \n     babies born annually with the disease.\n       (3) In the United States, SCD is most common in African-\n     Americans and in those of Hispanic, Mediterranean, and Middle \n     Eastern ancestry. Among newborn American infants, SCD occurs \n     in approximately 1 in 300 African-Americans, 1 in 36,000 \n     Hispanics, and 1 in 80,000 Caucasians.\n       (4) More than 2,500,000 Americans, mostly African-\n     Americans, have the sickle cell trait. These Americans are \n     healthy carriers of the sickle cell gene who have inherited \n     the normal hemoglobin gene from 1 parent and the sickle gene \n     from the other parent. A sickle cell trait is not a disease, \n     but when both parents have the sickle cell trait, there is a \n     1 in 4 chance with each pregnancy that the child will be born \n     with SCD.\n       (5) Children with SCD may exhibit frequent pain episodes, \n     entrapment of blood within the spleen, severe anemia, acute \n     lung complications, and priapism. During episodes of severe \n     pain, spleen enlargement, or acute lung complications, life \n     threatening complications can develop rapidly. Children with \n     SCD are also at risk for septicemia, meningitis, and stroke. \n     Children with SCD at highest risk for stroke can be \n     identified and, thus, treated early with regular blood \n     transfusions for stroke prevention.\n       (6) The most feared complication for children with SCD is a \n     stroke (either overt or silent) occurring in 30 percent of \n     the children with sickle cell anemia prior to their 18th \n     birthday and occurring in infants as young as 18 months of \n     age. Students with SCD and silent strokes may not have any \n     physical signs of such disease or strokes but may have a \n     lower educational attainment when compared to children with \n     SCD and no strokes. Approximately 60 percent of students with \n     silent strokes have difficulty in school, require special \n     education, or both.\n       (7) Many adults with SCD have acute problems, such as \n     frequent pain episodes and acute lung complications that can \n     result in death. Adults with SCD can also develop chronic \n     problems, including pulmonary disease, pulmonary \n     hypertension, degenerative changes in the shoulder and hip \n     joints, poor vision, and kidney failure.\n       (8) The average life span for an adult with SCD is the mid-\n     40s. While some patients can remain without symptoms for \n     years, many others may not survive infancy or early \n     childhood. Causes of death include bacterial infection, \n     stroke, and lung, kidney, heart, or liver failure. Bacterial \n     infections and lung injuries are leading causes of death in \n     children and adults with SCD.\n       (9) As a complex disorder with multisystem manifestations, \n     SCD requires specialized comprehensive and continuous care to \n     achieve the best possible outcome. Newborn screening, genetic \n     counseling, and education of patients and family members are \n     critical preventative measures that decrease morbidity and \n     mortality, delaying or preventing complications, in-patient \n     hospital stays, and increased overall costs of care.\n       (10) Stroke in the adult SCD population commonly results in \n     both mental and physical disabilities for life.\n       (11) Currently, one of the most effective treatments to \n     prevent or treat an overt stroke or a silent stroke for a \n     child with SCD is at least monthly blood transfusions \n     throughout childhood for many, and throughout life for some, \n     requiring removal of sickle blood and replacement with normal \n     blood.\n       (12) With acute lung complications, transfusions are \n     usually required and are often the only therapy demonstrated \n     to prevent premature death.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow an \nincome tax credit for the provision of homeownership and community \ndevelopment, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, owning your own home is the \nfoundation of the American dream. It encourages personal \nresponsibility, improves child development, provides economic security \nand gives families a greater stake in the development of their \ncommunities. Communities where homeownership rates are highest have \nlower crime rates, better schools and provide a better quality of life \nfor families to raise their children.\n  However, too many low- and moderate-income families living in urban \nand rural areas across our nation have not been able to share in the \ndream and benefits of homeownership due to the lack of available \nhousing or the high cost of what housing is available.\n  Today, I am introducing the Community Development Homeownership Tax \nCredit Act, along with Senators Santorum, Sarbanes, Allard, Daschle, \nKennedy, Stabenow and Clinton to encourage the construction and \nsubstantial rehabilitation of 500,000 homes over the next ten years for \nlow- and moderate-income families in economically distressed areas.\n  The bill will increase the supply of affordable homes for sale in \ninner-cities, rural areas and low- and moderate-income neighborhoods \nacross the United States. It will bridge the gap that exists today \nbetween the cost of developing-affordable housing and the price at \nwhich these homes can be sold in many low-income neighborhoods by \nproviding investors with a tax credit of up to 50 percent of the cost \nof home construction or rehabilitation.\n  By facing the mounting challenge of producing affordable housing, I \nstrongly believe we can help provide critically needed economic \ndevelopment low- and moderate-income communities across our country and \nprovide an important stimulus in the development of our nation's \neconomy. The production of new homes provided in this legislation will \ncreate both construction and construction-related jobs which will both \nincrease economic growth and lower the unemployment rate. New Economic \nactivity can revitalize many inner-city neighborhoods and rural areas \nwhere unemployment and crime have been a fact of life for too long.\n  Buying a new home also leads to the purchase of new appliances and \nfurnishings. Average new homebuyers spend almost $5,000 on appliances \nand\n\n[[Page S5202]]\n\nfurnishings during the first year of living in their new home. This \nwill help stimulate the manufacturing section of our economy. It is \nclear that building new homes creates jobs and moves our economy \nforward.\n  Over the past decade, we have made substantial progress in increasing \nthe homeownership rate in the United States. In 2000, the U.S. \nhomeownership rate reached a record high of 67.1 percent with some 71 \nmillion U.S. households owning their own home. However, many working \nfamilies have been struggling to find an affordable home in our \nnation's cities. Over the past two generations, many families have \nmoved out of cities and into the suburbs, which has depressed the \ndevelopment of housing in the inner-city. In 1999, the homeownership \nrate in the central-city areas was 50.4 percent, this is more than 20 \npercent lower than the suburban homeownership rate of 73.6 percent.\n  Working families with low- and moderate-income have also had \ndifficulties buying a home. Currently, 83.3 percent of households with \nfamily income higher than the median family income are homeowners, \nwhile only 52.4 percent of households with family income below the \nmedian income are homeowners.\n  Too many communities face a lack of available homes because \ndevelopers are concerned that the new houses may not be sold for the \ncost of construction. Many properties or sites that could be developed \ninto affordable homes now sit vacant, and neighborhoods remain \nundeveloped because the gap between development costs and market prices \nhas not been filled. The lack of affordable single-family homes affect \nmany urban and rural areas where a majority of residents earn less than \nthe median income.\n\n  Today, too many minority families face barriers in their attempts to \nreach the American Dream of homeownership. According to Census data for \nthe fourth quarter of 2002, non-Hispanic whites have a 74.8 percent \nhomeownership rate, while minority groups have just a 55.4 percent \nhomeownership rate. African Americans have only a 47.5 percent \nhomeownership rate, and Hispanics have a 49.5 percent homeownership \nrate in the same study. The gap between white and African American \nhomeownership rates has been approximately 25 percent to 30 percent for \nmost of the last century. These numbers are simply unacceptable.\n  Despite our efforts at the federal level to promote homeownership, \nmany minorities also face higher than average denial rates for mortgage \napplications. A recent study by the University of Massachusetts shows \nthat racial and ethnic lending disparities continue in Boston. For \nexample, African Americans were 2.73 times as likely as whites to be \ndenied in their mortgage applications. Latinos were 2.25 times as \nlikely as whites to be denied in their mortgage applications. Finally, \nAsians were 1.55 times as likely as whites to be denied in their \nmortgage applications.\n  Along with a lack of available homes in urban and rural areas, our \nnation is also facing an affordable rental housing crisis. Thousands of \nlow-income families with children, the disabled, and the elderly are \nfinding it difficult to obtain or afford privately owned affordable \nrental housing units. Recent changes in the housing market have limited \nthe availability of affordable housing across the country, while the \ngrowth in our economy in the last decade has dramatically increased the \ncost of the housing that remains. Constructing new housing will help \nmany families move out of rental housing and help increase the number \nof available rental housing units and help ease the affordable housing \ncrisis we now face.\n  The story of Benjamin and Rita Okafor shows how working families in \nMassachusetts have great difficulty obtaining a decent home of their \nown. For many years, the Okafor's and their two young children were \nforced to live in a one-bedroom apartment. Benjamin Okafor, who worked \nfull time as a cab driver in Boston, spent days and months looking for \na bigger apartment for his family. However, the lack of affordable \nhousing in the Boston area made it impossible for him to find anything \nappropriate. When his wife Rita became pregnant with their third child, \nthe Okafor's knew something had to change in their living situation. \nLuckily, Ben was accepted into the Habitat for Humanity program and \nworked 300 sweat equity hours constructing a house. In August 2000, the \nOkafor family moved into a new home of their own in Dorchester. Ben \nsays that this new home gives them the hope and stability they need. \nYet, there are still far too many working families living a substandard \nhousing and many more families that desperately need assistance to \nbecome homeowners. A new tax incentive for developers to build \naffordable homes in distressed areas will help working families like \nthe Okafor's to afford a home for the first time.\n  The benefits of owning a home can bring families financial rewards \nand personal satisfaction with a deep sense of security. Real estate \nvalues have historically risen over time. Homeowners may deduct \nmortgage interest and property taxes as an expense against income. Real \nestate has generally been seen as marketable, allowing for property to \nbe sold at a predictable price to a dependable group of available \nbuyers.\n  We know that owning a home instead of renting leads to a better \nquality of life for its residents, but we are now learning more and \nmore about the impact homeownership has on the cognitive and behavioral \noutcomes for children. A recent study by Ohio State University shows \nthat children of families who own their home have fewer behavioral \nproblems and are able to learn more effectively. Specifically, a \nchild's cognitive abilities are 9 percent higher in math and 7 percent \nhigher in reading for children living in their own homes. The study \nalso shows that these children also experienced up to 3 percent lower \nbehavioral problems than other children. This study proves that the \nnational goal of homeownership has an added benefit of helping \nAmerica's children learn and behave better, which helps our schools \nproduce better citizens and will help our economy develop in the long \nterm.\n\n  The Community Development Tax Credit Act, which I am introducing \ntoday, bridges the gap between development costs and market value to \nenable the development of new or refurbished homes in urban and rural \nareas to blossom. The tax credit would be available to developers or \ninvestors that build or substantially rehabilitate homes for sale to \nlow- or moderate-income buyers in low-income areas. The credit would \ngenerate equity investment sufficient to cover the gap between the cost \nof development and the price at which the home can be sold to an \neligible buyer.\n  The tax credit volume would be limited to $1.75 per capita for each \nState and allocated by the States themselves. Credits would be claimed \nover 5 years, starting when homes are sold. I believe this legislation \nwill result in approximately 50,000 homes built or refurbished \nannually, assuming about $40,000 per home.\n  The maximum tax credit equals 50 percent of the cost of construction, \nsubstantial rehabilitation, and building acquisition. The eligible cost \nmay not exceed the Federal Housing Administration single-family \nmortgage limits. The minimum rehabilitation costs is $25,000. Eligible \nbuilding acquisition costs are limited to one-half of rehabilitation \ncosts. States will allocate only the level of tax credits necessary for \nfinancial feasibility of individual projects. Ten percent of the \navailable credit will be set aside for nonprofit organizations.\n  The eligible areas for the tax credit are defined as Census Tracts \nwith median income below 80 percent of the area or state median. Rural \nareas that are currently eligible for USDA housing programs will be \neligible for the tax credit. Indian tribal lands will be eligible for \nthe tax credit. State-identified areas of chronic economic distress \nwill also be eligible for tax credit, subject to disapproval by the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development.\n  Those eligible to buy homes built or refurbished using the tax credit \ninclude: individuals with incomes up to 80 percent of the area or state \nmedian and up to 100 percent of area median income in low-income/high-\npoverty Census Tracts.\n  Individual states will write plans to allocate the available tax \ncredits using the following selection criteria: contribution of the \ndevelopment to community stability and revitalization; community and \nlocal government support; need for homeownership development in the \narea; sponsor capability; and the long-term sustainability of the\n\n[[Page S5203]]\n\nproject as owner-occupied residences. Then individual developers along \nwith investors can apply to the state to be awarded a tax credit for \ndeveloping a property in a low- or moderate-income area. If chosen by \nthe state, investors can start to claim the tax credit as the homes are \nsold to eligible buyers. They can continue to claim the tax credit for \nfive years. Investors are not subject to recapture. If the home owner \nsells the residence within five years, a scale would determine the \npercentage of the gain that would be recaptured by the Federal \nGovernment. In the first two years, 100 percent of the gain and 80, 70 \nand 60 percent in the third, fourth, and fifth years, respectively, \nwould be recaptured.\n  The Community Development Homeownership Tax Credit Act that I am \nintroducing today will positively affect the lives for approximately \n500,000 families over the next 10 years, help resolve the affordable \nrental housing crisis we face, and help create jobs and grow our \neconomy. I ask all of my colleagues to help expand the foundation of \nthe American Dream by supporting this new tax incentive to encourage \nthe construction and rehabilitation of homes for low- and moderate-\nincome families in economically distressed areas.\n  This legislation is supported by the U.S. Conference of Mayors, \nFannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the Enterprise Foundation, Local Initiatives \nSupport Coalition, Mortgage Bankers Association of America, National \nAssociation of Home Builders, National Low Income Housing Coalition, \nNational Association of Local Housing Finance Agencies, National \nAssociation of Realtors, National Council of La Raza, National Hispanic \nHousing Conference, Habitat for Humanity International and \nothers.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Ms. Collins, and Mrs. Clinton):\n  S. 876. A bill to require public disclosure of noncompetitive \ncontracting for the reconstruction of the infrastructure of Iraq, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, Senators Collins, Clinton, Byrd, Lieberman \nand I want the rebuilding of Iraq to be done in the best way possible--\nfor the Iraqi people and for the American taxpayers who will foot the \nbill. To ensure that happens, we're introducing bipartisan legislation \ntoday to ensure accountability in the awarding of U.S. contracts to \nrebuild Iraq.\n  Usually in situations like this, open and competitive bidding is used \nto get the best deal for the taxpayers. The same needs to hold true \nhere. Contracts to rebuild Iraq should be awarded in the sunshine--not \nbehind a smokescreen. If the Federal Government chooses not to use free \nmarket competition to get the most reasonable price from the most \nqualified contractor, then, at a minimum, they should have to tell the \nAmerican people why.\n  The bill we're introducing today is called the Sunshine in Iraq \nReconstruction Contracting Act. It's intended to shine light into the \nsecretive practices the United States Agency for International \nDevelopment, USAID, and other Federal agencies are using to hand out in \nIraqi work.\n  There are dollars-and-cents reasons for doing this. The potential \ncost of rebuilding Iraq has been estimated at around $100 billion. \nThat's a lot of taxpayer money. And the U.S. General Accounting Office, \nGAO, reports that sole-source and limited-source contracts aren't \nusually the best buy. Investigator found that Army officials often just \ntook whatever level of services the contractor gave, without ever \nasking if it could be done more efficiently or at a lower cost.\n  Despite that, sole-source and limited-source contracts look like the \nrule, not the exception, for rebuilding Iraq. And these are costing \nsome big cash. Contracts awarded for oil fire fighting and other \nprojects are so-called ``cost-plus'' contracts. They pay a company's \nexpenses, plus a guaranteed profit of one to eight percent. There are \nno limits on total costs, so the more a firm charges in expenses, the \nmore profit it makes. If the Federal Government's going to spend my \nconstituents' money that way, without asking for competitive bids, I \nthink my constituents deserve to know why.\n  Let me give you two concrete examples of the kind of secrecy I'm \ntalking about. A lot of the known details come from press reports. In \nFebruary and March, USAID invited a handful of companies to bid on $1.7 \nbillion in Iraqi projects--rebuilding highways, bridges, schools. \nCompetition for one $600 million contract was limited to seven large \nU.S. engineering firms. USAID apparently put out some bid invitations \nbefore the war even started.\n  On March 24, the Army Corps of Engineers announced a sole-source, \nunlimited contract to two American companies to control Iraqi oil \nfires. The no-bid contract is still classified. Information that should \nbe available to the public was finalized on March 8 but is still under \nwraps. What we know is that other firms that had experience putting out \noil well fires in Kuwait in 1991 were left out of the process \naltogether. And we also know that as early as last fall, the parent \ncompany of these contractors got an exclusive contract to study how to \nsupply oil services during an invasion of Iraq.\n  Anybody looking to find an explanation for this closed-door \ncontracting is likely to come up short. So far the agencies haven't \nsaid much. Last month, USAID announced that it would limit competition \nto companies with demonstrated technical ability, proven accounting \nmechanisms, ability to field a qualified technical team on short \nnotice, and authority to handle classified national security material. \nThe USAID Director told The New York Times that to work in Iraq you \nhave to have a security clearance, and only these few American \ncompanies have that clearance.\n  I sit on the Intelligence Committee, and don't know of any good \nreason why a contractor bidding to rebuild a school, hospital, sewer \nsystem or any other part of Iraq's infrastructure would need a security \nclearance. In any case, four of USAID's eight reconstruction projects \nwill allow subcontracting to companies that don't have to meet the \nsecurity requirements. So that argument doesn't hold up.\n  Our bill has a simple premise to ensure accountability in the \nawarding process. It says that any Federal entity bypassing competitive \nbidding for Iraqi reconstruction projects has to disclose some key \ninformation. Most importantly, that means revealing the documents used \nto justify a sole-source or limited contract. Agencies are already \nrequired by law to prepare this rationale for sole source bidding. Our \nbill just makes the information accessible. We've written provisions to \nprotect classified information, while still giving Congress full \noversight over the billions in taxpayer money that Americans are being \nasked to commit in Iraq.\n  There are too many questions and the stakes are too high for Congress \nnot to demand public disclosure of this information. I am pleased that \nSenators Collins, Clinton, Byrd and Lieberman are joining me in \nintroducing this legislation to bring greater accountability and \nopenness to the contracting for Iraq reconstruction.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of our bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 876\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to regulate interstate commerce by imposing \nlimitations and penalties on the transmission of unsolicited commercial \nelectronic mail via the Internet; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mr. BURNS. Thank you, Mr. President. I rise today to introduce the \nCAN-SPAM bill along with my good friend and colleague Senator Wyden. \nThe CAN-SPAM bill addresses an issue of critical importance to the \nfurther development of commerce on the Internet: how to control the \nexplosion of unsolicited commercial e-mail. I also want to thank the \nadditional original cosponsors of the bill, Senator Stevens, Senator \nBreaux, Senator Thomas, Senator Landrieu and Senator Schumer.\n  While it is obvious to anyone with an e-mail account that the scourge \nof ``spam'' has continued to worsen, the numbers and the trends they \nrepresent paint an even more disturbing picture. According to an \narticle in the Washington Post less than a month ago, spam currently \naccounts for 40 percent of all e-mail traffic. Spam has become more \nthan just an inconvenience that we have learned to live with; it has \nnow become a fundamental part of any e-mail inbox with serious economic \nconsequences. According to one study done by a consulting group, spam \nwill cost U.S. businesses more than $10 billion this year alone.\n  Spam also makes working on the Internet less efficient, by clogging \nup servers on one end and inboxes on the other. I want some \naccountability brought to bear on this issue, and feel that by \nintroducing this legislation today, we have taken an appropriate and \nmeaningful step to tame a horse we can't seem to break just yet. This \nproblem continues to escalate, and experts warn that more than half of \ne-mail traffic will be spam by this summer. This point bears repeating: \nwithin months, you will waste more than half of your time with \nunsolicited e-mail.\n  The CAN-SPAM bill would require e-mail marketers to comply with a \nstraightforward set of workable, common-sense rules designed to give \nconsumers more control over spam. Specifically, the bill would require \na sender of marketing e-mail to include a clear and conspicuous ``opt-\nout'' mechanism so that they could ``unsubscribe'' from further \nunwanted e-mail. Also, the bill would prohibit e-mail marketers from \nusing deceptive headers or subject lines, so that consumers will be \nable to tell who initiated the solicitation.\n  The bill includes strong enforcement provisions to ensure compliance. \nThe Federal Trade Commission would have authority to impose steep civil \nfines of up to $500,000 on spammers. This fine could be tripled if the \nviolation is found to be intentional. In short, this bill provides \nbroad consumer protection against bad actors, while still allowing \nInternet advertising a justified means of flourishing.\n  Spamming is a serious economic problem and I believe it is absolutely \ncritical that we address this now, so that the Internet is allowed to \nreach its full potential. Because of the vast distances in Montana, \nmany of my constituents are forced to pay long-distance charges for \ntheir time on the Internet. Spam makes it nearly impossible for these \npeople to enjoy the experience, and it makes it even harder for them to \nsee how this will help rural America flourish in the 21st century. \nAlso, Internet service providers are bombarded with spam that often \ncorrupts or shuts down their systems. In today's information age where \nbeating the competitor to the next sale is absolutely critical to \nsurvival, these shutdowns can cause real economic damage. We may be in \na downturn in the American economy and especially in the high \ntechnology sector, but the efficiencies created through vast \ninformation sharing are here to stay and will help propel our economy \nto levels beyond our imagination, but in order to reach this potential \nwe must eliminate the bad actors who threaten these efficiencies.\n  The fact that this bill is strongly supported by pillars of the \nInternet age such as Yahoo, America Online and eBay is a testament to \nits common-sense approach. I think these companies for their critical \nexpertise in perfecting this bill which would help to address this \nscourge of the digital age. I also appreciate the numerous valuable \nsuggestions from the many concerned cyber-citizens who want to see this \nPandora's box of digital dreck closed once and for all.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 877\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Controlling the Assault of \n     Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003'', or the \n     ``CAN-SPAM Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND POLICY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) There is a right of free speech on the Internet.\n       (2) The Internet has increasingly become a critical mode of \n     global communication and now presents unprecedented \n     opportunities for the development and growth of global \n     commerce and an integrated worldwide economy.\n       (3) In order for global commerce on the Internet to reach \n     its full potential, individuals and entities using the \n     Internet and other online services should be prevented from \n     engaging in activities that prevent other users and Internet \n     service providers from having a reasonably predictable, \n     efficient, and economical online experience.\n       (4) Unsolicited commercial electronic mail can be a \n     mechanism through which businesses advertise and attract \n     customers in the online environment.\n       (5) The receipt of unsolicited commercial electronic mail \n     may result in costs to recipients who cannot refuse to accept \n     such mail and who incur costs for the storage of such mail, \n     or for the time spent accessing, reviewing, and discarding \n     such mail, or for both.\n       (6) Unsolicited commercial electronic mail may impose \n     significant monetary costs on providers of Internet access \n     services, businesses, and educational and nonprofit \n     institutions that carry and receive such mail, as there is a \n     finite volume of mail that such providers, businesses, and \n     institutions can handle without further investment in \n     infrastructure.\n       (7) Some unsolicited commercial electronic mail contains \n     material that many recipients may consider vulgar or \n     pornographic in nature.\n       (8) While some senders of unsolicited commercial electronic \n     mail messages provide simple and reliable ways for recipients \n     to reject (or ``opt-out'' of) receipt of unsolicited \n     commercial electronic mail from such senders in the future, \n     other senders provide no\n\n[[Page S5205]]\n\n     such ``opt-out'' mechanism, or refuse to honor the requests \n     of recipients not to receive electronic mail from such \n     senders in the future, or both.\n       (9) An increasing number of senders of unsolicited \n     commercial electronic mail purposefully disguise the source \n     of such mail so as to prevent recipients from responding to \n     such mail quickly and easily.\n       (10) An increasing number of senders of unsolicited \n     commercial electronic mail purposefully include misleading \n     information in the message's subject lines in order to induce \n     the recipients to view the messages.\n       (11) In legislating against certain abuses on the Internet, \n     Congress should be very careful to avoid infringing in any \n     way upon constitutionally protected rights, including the \n     rights of assembly, free speech, and privacy.\n       (b) Congressional Determination of Public Policy.--On the \n     basis of the findings in subsection (a), the Congress \n     determines that--\n       (1) there is a substantial government interest in \n     regulation of unsolicited commercial electronic mail;\n       (2) senders of unsolicited commercial electronic mail \n     should not mislead recipients as to the source or content of \n     such mail; and\n       (3) recipients of unsolicited commercial electronic mail \n     have a right to decline to receive additional unsolicited \n     commercial electronic mail from the same source.\n\n     SEC. 3.

and\n       (B) the recipient was, at the time of such transaction or \n     thereafter in the first electronic mail message received from \n     the sender after the effective date of this Act, provided a \n     clear and conspicuous notice of an opportunity not to receive \n     unsolicited commercial electronic mail messages from the \n     sender and has not exercised such opportunity.\n\n     If a sender operates through separate lines of business or \n     divisions and holds itself out to the recipient, both at the \n     time of the transaction described in subparagraph (A) and at \n     the time the notice under subparagraph (B) was provided to \n     the recipient, as that particular line of business or \n     division rather than as the entity of which such line of \n     business or division is a part, then the line of business or \n     the division shall be treated as the sender for purposes of \n     this paragraph.\n       (10) Initiate.--The term ``initiate'', when used with \n     respect to a commercial electronic mail message, means to \n     originate such message or to procure the origination of such \n     message, but shall not include actions that constitute \n     routine conveyance of such message.\n       (11) Internet.--The term ``Internet'' has the meaning given \n     that term in the Internet Tax Freedom Act (47 U.S.C. 151 nt).\n       (12) Internet access service.--The term ``Internet access \n     service'' has the meaning given that term in section \n     231(e)(4) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. \n     231(e)(4)).\n       (13) Protected computer.--The term ``protected computer'' \n     has the meaning given that term in section 1030(e)(2) of \n     title 18, United States Code.\n       (14) Recipient.--The term ``recipient'', when used with \n     respect to a commercial electronic mail message, means an \n     authorized user of the electronic mail address to which the \n     message was sent or delivered. If a recipient of a commercial \n     electronic mail message has 1 or more electronic mail \n     addresses in addition to the address to which the message was \n     sent or delivered, the recipient shall be treated as a \n     separate recipient with respect to each such address. If an \n     electronic mail address is reassigned to a new user, the new \n     user shall not be treated as a recipient of any commercial \n     electronic mail message sent or delivered to that address \n     before it was reassigned.\n       (15) Routine conveyance.--The term ``routine conveyance'' \n     means the transmission, routing, relaying, handling, or \n     storing, through an automatic technical process, of an \n     electronic mail message for which another person has provided \n     and selected the recipient addresses.\n       (16) Sender.--The term ``sender'', when used with respect \n     to a commercial electronic mail message, means a person who \n     initiates such a message and whose product, service, or \n     Internet web site is advertised or promoted by the message.\n       (17) Transactional or relationship messages.--The term \n     ``transactional or relationship message'' means an electronic \n     mail message the primary purpose of which is to facilitate, \n     complete, confirm, provide, or request information \n     concerning--\n       (A) a commercial transaction that the recipient has \n     previously agreed to enter into with the sender;\n       (B) an existing commercial relationship, formed with or \n     without an exchange of consideration, involving the ongoing \n     purchase or use by the recipient of products or services \n     offered by the sender; or\n       (C) an existing employment relationship or related benefit \n     plan.\n       (18) Unsolicited commercial electronic mail message.--The \n     term ``unsolicited commercial electronic mail message'' means \n     any commercial electronic mail message that--\n       (A) is not a transactional or relationship message; and\n       (B) is sent to a recipient without the recipient's prior \n     affirmative or implied consent.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Mr. President, I am pleased today to be teaming up again \nwith my good friend Senator Burns to reintroduce legislation to address \nthe rising tide of unsolicited commercial e-mail, commonly known as \n``spam.''\n  In the last Congress, our anti-spam legislation was approved \nunanimously by the Senate Commerce Committee. Since that time--nearly a \nyear ago now--the problem of spam has been increasing at an alarming \nrate. Roughly\n\n[[Page S5208]]\n\n40 percent of all e-mail traffic in the United States is spam, up from \n8 percent in late 2001 and nearly doubling in the past six months. By \n2004, according to some estimates, a typical company that fails to take \ndefensive action could find that over 50 percent of its e-mail messages \nwill be spam. This isn't just annoying, it's costly: one consulting \ngroup has estimated that spam will cost U.S. organizations more than \n$10 billion this year, due to expenses for anti-spam equipment and \nmanpower and lost productivity.\n  If nothing is done, the situation is only likely to get worse. The \nfundamental problem--and what makes spam different from other types of \nmarketing--is that it is so cheap to send huge volumes of messages. \nWith the stroke of a key, the spammer can let fly a massive torrent of \ne-mails. And since the sender doesn't pay any per-message postage, the \nincentive is to send as many as possible. The cost of all these extra \nmessages is borne by the Internet service providers, ISPs, and the \nrecipients, not by the sender. So as far as the spammer is concerned, \nthe sky is the limit.\n  Anyone who uses e-mail should be deeply concerned about this trend. \nIn a few short years, e-mail quickly went from a novelty to a core \nmedium of communication for millions of Americans. They came to rely on \nit daily, for business and personal communications alike. But just as \nquickly as e-mail rose to prominence, its usefulness could dwindle--\nburied under an avalanche of endless ``Get Rich Quick,'' ``Lose Weight \nFast,'' and offensive pornographic marketing pitches. As consumers grow \nfrustrated with bloated in-boxes, and as ISP networks and e-commerce \nwebsites are slowed by mounting junk e-mail traffic jams, enthusiasm \nfor the entire medium of e-mail and e-commerce could sour.\n  Right now, e-mail users and ISPs are trying to manage the problem as \nbest they can. They use filtering software, or lists of known spammers, \nor sign up for special anti-spam services. But these tactics can be \nburdensome, costly, and only partially effective. The fact is, existing \nlaws do not provide sufficient tools. More help is needed.\n  Many States have moved to address the issue. But e-mail is not a \nmedium that respects, or even recognizes, State borders. Indeed, e-mail \naddresses tell nothing about which State the user is located in, so the \nsender and recipient of an e-mail message may have no clue where the \nother is located. Therefore, this is one area where a State-by-State \npatchwork of rules makes no sense. It is time for a nationwide \napproach.\n  That is why Senator Burns and I are reintroducing the ``Controlling \nthe Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act''--the CAN \nSPAM Act, for short. This bipartisan legislation says that if you want \nto send unsolicited marketing e-mail, you've got to play by a set of \nrules--rules that allow the recipient to see where the messages are \ncoming from, and to tell the sender to stop. The basic goal is simple: \ngive the consumer more control.\n  Specifically, the bill would prohibit the use of falsified or \ndeceptive headers or subject lines, so that consumers will be able to \nidentify the true source of the message. A sender of unsolicited \nmarketing e-mail would also be required to provide the recipient with a \nreturn address or similar mechanism that can be used to tell the \nsender, ``no more.'' And once a consumer says ``no more,'' a sender \nwould be required to honor that request. Senders of unsolicited \ncommercial messages would also be required to include a clear \nnotification that the message is an advertisement or solicitation, and \na valid physical postal address.\n  The bill includes strong enforcement provisions to ensure compliance. \nSpammers that intentionally disguise their identities would be subject \nto misdemeanor criminal penalties. The Federal Trade Commission would \nhave authority to impose civil fines. State attorneys general would be \nable to bring suit on behalf of the citizens of their states. And ISPs \nwould be able to bring suit to keep unlawful spam off their networks. \nIn all cases, particularly high penalties would be available for true \n``bad actors''--the shady, high-volume spammers who have no intention \nof behaving in a lawful and responsible manner.\n  Our goal here is not to discourage legitimate online communications \nbetween businesses and their customers. Senator Burns and I have no \nintention of interfering with a company's ability to use e-mail to \ninform customers of warranty information, provide account holders with \nmonthly account statements, and so forth. Rather, we want to go after \nthose unscrupulous individuals who use e-mail in an annoying and \nmisleading fashion. I believe this bill strikes that important balance.\n  Senator Burns and I have been at this for three years now, and have \nworked with many different groups in shaping the legislation. We \nbelieve we have made real progress in addressing some of the legitimate \nconcerns that were raised about previous versions of the bill. \nNaturally, there are interested parties who have additional ideas for \nmeasures they would like to see. We will be happy to continue to work \nwith them, and I would also point out that the bill calls for a study \nto evaluate this initial Federal step against spam and to determine \nwhether further provisions are needed. But the bill we are introducing \ntoday offers a workable, common-sense approach that should be \npolitically viable this year.\n  I am pleased that Senators Breaux, Landrieu, Schumer, and Thomas are \njoining Senator Burns and me in cosponsoring this legislation. I urge \nthe rest of my Senate colleagues to join with us on moving it forward \nas promptly as possible, so that the Senate won't still be debating the \nissue, with no action taken, several years from now.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. Smith.\n  S. 879. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase \nand extend the special depreciation allowance, and for other purpose; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Economic \nStimulus Act of 2003, legislation that will allow a 50 percent bonus \ndepreciation over a 5 year period. Last year I was proud to introduce \nand pass a 30 percent bonus depreciation incentive as part of \nlegislation signed into law in March 2002. We had great bipartisan \nsupport on this issue and I hope that similar action will take place \nduring consideration of this year's tax bill.\n  I introduce the Economic Stimulus Act of 2003 in order to build on \nlast year's effort by both increasing that bonus to 50 percent and \nextending it through 2008. Our economy clearly needs a boost, and this \nprovision will complement many of the provisions in President Bush's \neconomic growth package.\n  Recently, U.S. Department of Commerce data revealed that private \ninvestment in high tech equipment ended it's decline as this provision \nwent into effect last year and has begun to increase modestly in the \npast year. A significant increase in that bonus along with an extension \nof its effective date can only boost business investment even further. \nBy extending the effective date past next year, businesses will be able \nto better plan for sustained increases in technology investment.\n  This legislation will provide an immediate and broad stimulus to the \nU.S. economy by encouraging business investment. In my own state of \nOregon I can look to both heavy industry and the hi tech sector and see \nthe real return this legislation will have on our economy. Heavy \nindustry in my state will have an ability to save family-wage jobs and \nput additional employees to work in Oregon. For example, the rail \nsupply industry has been hard hit, and though there is a need for \ninvestment, there has been a reluctance to invest significant sums that \nare necessary to sustain this industry. Bonus depreciation provisions \nis an additional incentive that will lead institutional investors, \nleasing companies, shippers and railroads to invest in new rail \nequipment.\n  In Oregon's high-tech sector the strong increase in the first year \ndepreciation amount will have a real and positive impact on the \ninvestment environment for high-tech equipment, such as computer \nhardware, software and broadband network infrastructure. This \nlegislation will definitely stimulate the demand for the software and \nthe whole high-tech sector. In Oregon, the hi-tech sector has been a \nmajor component of economic growth and I am intent that this engine of \ngrowth continue to provide stimulus to the economy.\n\n[[Page S5209]]\n\n  I note that there are a myriad of bonus depreciation proposals out \nthere. Most don't provide enough lead time however to make real and \nsubstantive business decisions. The current downturn is caused in part \nby a decline in business investment. So what kind of investment can be \nstimulated by a year-long depreciation incentive? It probably gives \nbusiness people time to buy a chair and some new wastebaskets.\n  But a year is not enough time to start a major project that could \nemploy thousands of people. It doesn't allow time to build heavy \nequipment, modernize a lumber mill, revamp a corporate computer system, \nrepair a railbed, or construct an airplane. It doesn't allow enough \ntime to obtain building permits, perform environmental reviews, or \ncomplete architectural or engineering studies.\n  We need to create a booming economy not just for today, but for the \nnext several years. So I must emphasize that short depreciation \nproposals lack economic weight.\n  Bonus depreciation is probably the best idea of any stimulus \nproposal. I ask that all my colleagues consider and support the \nEconomic Stimulus Act of 2003. I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthis bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 879\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nestablish a minimum geographic cost-of-practice index value for \nphysicians' services furnished under the Medicare program; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. Bingaman. Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing today \nwith Senators Cochran, Lincoln, Hatch, Jeffords, Landrieu, and Dayton \nentitled the ``Rural Equity Payment Index Reform Act of 2003'' is \ndesigned to reduce the work payment inequity between urban and rural \nlocalities under the Medicare physician fee schedule. This legislation \nis a companion bill to HR 33, introduced by Representative Doug \nBereuter, which now has over 65 House cosponsors.\n  In my own State of New Mexico, recruitment and retention of \nphysicians in rural areas is an ongoing problem, which is contributed \nto, in a part, by inequities in payments these physicians receive in \ncomparison to their urban counterparts. With only 170 physicians per \n100,000 people, New Mexico ranks well behind the national average with \nregard to primary care and specialist physicians.\n  Lack of adequate reimbursement, in the face of increasing costs, is a \ncritical factor leading to the shortage of physician services in my \nstate, and in other rural areas. The State of New Mexico ranks 32nd in \nthe nation in terms of Medicare reimbursement, as defined by the \ngeographic adjustment factor used to set reimbursement rates. Yet, an \noffice visit to a rural physician is no different in time, effort, or \nworkload compared to an office visit to an urban physician. \nGeographically adjusting the quantifiable workload simply makes no \nsense; physician work should be valued equally, irrespective of where a \nphysician works.\n  This inequity unfairly ``punishes'' physicians in non-metropolitan \nareas, where there are often proportionately larger populations of \nMedicare beneficiaries. In effect, the rural areas subsidize healthcare \nin urban areas, while they struggle to attract health care \nprofessionals. Since Medicare beneficiaries pay into the program on the \nbasis of income and wages, and beneficiaries pay the same premium for \npart B services, these inequitable physician fee payments result in \nsubstantial cross-subsidies from people living in low payment States to \npeople living in higher payment States.\n  Targeted efforts to provide relief to rural doctors in low payment \nlocalities with more equitable payments would improve access to primary \nand tertiary services. The bill I am introducing would lessen the \ndisparity that currently exists between rural and urban areas. It \ngradually phases in a floor that upwardly adjusts reimbursement rates \nfor rural providers, without lowering the reimbursement for urban \nproviders, so that the discrepancy will progressively be corrected.\n  This bill would phase-in a floor of 1.000 for the Medicare \n``physician work adjuster'', thereby raising all localities with a work \nadjuster below 1.000 to that level. This proposed change would be put \nin place without regard to the budget neutrality agreement in the \npresent law. The phase-in approach softens the budgetary implications \nby spreading it out over four years.\n  It is estimated that payment rates to New Mexico physicians will \nincrease by 2.8 million dollars over a 4-year period. In my state, this \nrepresents an important increase in reimbursements for physicians, but \nit also represents a tangible acknowledgement of the hard work and \nefforts that our physicians commit to patient care, particularly rural \nbased physicians.\n  Some of the following organizations, which have expressed support for \nthis legislation, include the National Rural Health Association, the \nAmerican College of Physicians/American Society of Internal Medicine, \nand the American Physical Therapy association.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters of support and the text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 881\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Rural \n     Equity Payment Index Reform Act of 2003''.\n\n[[Page S5210]]\n\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Variations in the physician work adjustment factors \n     under section 1848(e) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1395w-4w(e)) result in a physician work payment inequity \n     between urban and rural localities under the medicare \n     physician fee schedule.\n       (2) The amount the medicare program spends on its \n     beneficiaries varies substantially across the country, far \n     more than can be accounted for by differences in the cost of \n     living or differences in health status.\n       (3) Since beneficiaries and others pay into the program on \n     the basis of income and wages and beneficiaries pay the same \n     premium for part B services, these payments result in \n     substantial cross-subsidies from people living in low payment \n     States with conservative practice styles or beneficiary \n     preferences to people living in higher payment States with \n     aggressive practice styles or beneficiary preferences.\n       (4) Congress has been mindful of these variations when it \n     comes to capitation payments made to managed care plans under \n     the Medicare+Choice program and has put in place floors that \n     increase monthly payments by more than one-third in some of \n     the lowest payment counties over what would otherwise occur. \n     But this change addresses only a very small fraction of \n     medicare beneficiaries who are presently enrolled in \n     Medicare+Choice plans operating in low payment counties.\n       (5) Unfortunately, Congress has only begun to address the \n     underlying problem of substantial geographic variations in \n     fee-for-service spending under traditional medicare.\n       (6) Improvements in rural hospital payment systems under \n     the medicare program help to reduce aggregate per capita \n     payment variation as rural hospitals are in large part \n     located in low payment counties.\n       (7) Many rural communities have great difficulty attracting \n     and retaining physicians and other skilled health \n     professionals.\n       (8) Targeted efforts to provide relief to rural doctors in \n     low payment localities would further reduce variation by \n     improving access to primary and tertiary services along with \n     more equitable payment.\n       (9) Geographic adjustment factors in the medicare program's \n     resource-based relative value scale unfairly suppress fee-\n     for-service payments to rural providers.\n       (10) Actual costs are not presently being measured \n     accurately and payments do not reflect the costs of providing \n     care.\n       (11) Unless something is done about medicare payment in \n     rural areas, as the baby boom cohort ages into medicare, the \n     financial demands on rural communities to subsidize care for \n     their aged and disabled medicare beneficiaries will progress \n     from difficult to impossible in another 10 years.\n       (12) The impact on rural health care infrastructure will be \n     first felt in economically depressed rural areas where the \n     ability to shift costs is already limited.\n\n     SEC. 2. PHYSICIAN FEE SCHEDULE WAGE INDEX REVISION.\n\n       Section 1848(e)(1) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1395w-4(e)(1)) is amended--\n       (1) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``subparagraphs (B) \n     and (C)'' and inserting ``subparagraphs (B), (C), and (E)''; \n     and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:\n       ``(E) Floor for work geographic indices.--\n       ``(i) In general.--Notwithstanding the work geographic \n     index otherwise calculated under subparagraph (A)(iii), in no \n     case may the work geographic index applied for payment under \n     this section be less than--\n\n       ``(I) 0.976 for services furnished during 2004;\n       ``(II) 0.987 for services furnished during 2005;\n       ``(III) 0.995 for services furnished during 2006; and\n       ``(IV) 1.000 for services furnished during 2007 and \n     subsequent years.\n\n       ``(ii) Exemption from limitation on annual adjustments.--\n     The increase in expenditures attributable to clause (i) shall \n     not be taken into account in applying subsection \n     (c)(2)(B)(ii)(II).''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               NRHA Supports ``Equal Pay for Equal Work''\n\n       Washington, DC., Jan. 7.--The National Rural Health \n     Association (NRHA) today strongly endorsed legislation \n     introduced by Representative Doug Bereuter (R.-Neb) that \n     would provide rural physicians with Medicare payments closer \n     to those of their urban counterparts. The Rural Equity \n     Payment Index Reform Act addresses the little known fact that \n     the federal government pays rural doctors at a lower rate.\n       ``An office visit to a rural physician is no different than \n     an office visit to an urban physician,'' NRHA President Wayne \n     Myers, M.D., said. ``The idea that physicians are reimbursed \n     for their work and their skills at a lower rate simply on the \n     basis that they choose to practice in a rural area and serve \n     our rural communities is completely ludicrous.''\n       The Bereuter bill would lessen the disparity that currently \n     exists between urban and rural areas. By gradually phasing in \n     a floor that upwardly adjusts reimbursement rates for rural \n     providers, without lowering the reimbursement in urban areas, \n     the discrepancy in payment will progressively be corrected. \n     ``These health care providers put as much or even more time, \n     skill and intensity into a patient visit as their urban \n     counterparts,'' Rep. Bereuter said, ``yet they are paid less \n     for their work under the Medicare program. This is a formula \n     that is punishing non-metropolitan areas.''\n       Under the current Medicare physician payment formula, \n     residents of non-metropolitan areas essentially subsidize the \n     delivery of health care in metropolitan areas. Even though \n     rural areas tend to have larger populations of Medicare \n     beneficiaries, they are subsidizing health care in urban \n     areas, while their own communities are struggling to attract \n     health care professionals.\n       ``This is a top priority issue for the NRHA,'' Myers said. \n     ``In fact, this disparity in health care is among the basic \n     reasons the NRHA exists. ``For far too long, rural American \n     health care has been overlooked in Washington. We applaud \n     Congressman Bereuter for his efforts and look forward to \n     working with him to ensure rural physicians--and rural \n     residents alike--receive an equitable deal.''\n       The NRHA is a national nonprofit membership organization \n     that provides leadership on rural health issues. The \n     association's mission is to improve the health of rural \n     Americans and to provide leadership on rural health issues \n     through advocacy, communications, education and research. The \n     NRHA membership is made up of a diverse collection of \n     individuals and organizations.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                        American Physical Therapy Association,\n\n                                                   March 25, 2003.\n     Hon. Doug Bereuter (R-NE),\n     Rayburn House Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear congressman Bereuter: The American Physical Therapy \n     Association (APTA) would like to express its appreciation for \n     your legislation to correct an inequity in Medicare payments \n     to rural health care providers. APTA strongly supports HR 33, \n     The Rural Equity Payment Index Reform (REPaIR) Act. This \n     legislation is a positive step to ensuring improved access to \n     quality health care services, including those delivered by \n     licensed physical therapists, in rural America. The current \n     inequity of payment to health care providers under the \n     Medicare physician fee schedule and its Geographic Medical \n     Practice Index needs to be corrected to ensure that qualified \n     providers continue to serve the needs of our rural \n     communities.\n       Physical therapists are highly qualified and recognized \n     providers under Medicare who bill for their services under \n     the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule. Your legislation (HR 33) \n     would improve access and payment for appropriate physical \n     therapy services in rural and underserved areas. This \n     legislation would also go a long way to attract and retain \n     physical therapist to consider rural areas for practice and \n     service. Access to qualified health care providers is a \n     growing problem in rural America and your legislation is one \n     of many steps to reverse this trend.\n       We applaud your dedication to rural health and express our \n     support that Congress pass HR 33, The Rural Equity Payment \n     Index Reform (REPaIR) Act in this Congress. If you have \n     questions, please feel free to contact Justin Moore at 703-\n     706-3162 or justinmoore@apta.org.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   G. David Mason,\n                               Vice President, Government Affairs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 882. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nimprovements in tax administration and taxpayer safeguards, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today we are introducing the Tax \nAdministration Good Government Act.\n  The legislation contains five major components. First, it provides \nadditional safeguards for taxpayers. Second, the legislation \nsignificantly simplifies the current interest and penalty regimes. \nThird, the Act also includes the proposals passed out of the Finance \nCommittee on April 2, 2003 and included in a bill introduced by \nSenators Hatch and Breaux to modernize the United States Tax Court.\n  Fourth, our legislation also includes several provisions, some of \nwhich were requested by the Treasury Department and the Joint Committee \non Taxation, to strike an appropriate balance in protecting taxpayer \nconfidentiality through disclosure reforms. Finally, the legislation \ntakes a small, but important step toward simplification of the tax code \nthrough the elimination of obsolete provisions.\n  We have worked closely with the Treasury Department, the Internal \nRevenue Service, the National Taxpayer Advocate and the Joint Committee \non Taxation to develop this package of proposals to promote good \ngovernment in the administration of our tax code.\n  Congress's responsibility for the tax system does not stop after we \npass tax law changes. We have an oversight responsibility to ensure \nthat taxpayer rights are protected, that our tax laws are not \nadministered counter to Congressional intent, that the judicial\n\n[[Page S5211]]\n\nbody with primary jurisdiction over the tax laws has the tools \nnecessary to provide independent review of controversies between \ntaxpayers and the Internal Revenue Service, and to take steps to \nsimplify the tax code whenever possible.\n  It is our intention to pass a package of tax administration good \ngovernment proposals out of the Finance Committee in the coming months. \nWe urge our colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  We also submit for the Record a more detailed description of the \nspecific provisions included in the Tax Administration Good Government \nAct.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and the description \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 882\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

tax administration and establish taxpayer safeguards\n\n     Collection\n       Waiver of user fee for installment agreements using \n     automated withdrawals. The IRS imposes a $43 user fee on \n     taxpayers entering into an installment agreement. The \n     proposal would waive the user fee if the taxpayer agrees to \n     automated withdrawal of installment payments from a bank \n     account. This proposal will help facilitate collection \n     through automated withdrawals.\n       Authorize partial pay installment agreements. The proposal \n     restores authority that the IRS had prior to 1998 to allow \n     IRS to enter into installment agreements with taxpayers that \n     want to resolve their tax liability but cannot afford to make \n     payments large enough to fully pay the liability at the end \n     of the term of the installment agreement. The proposal would \n     permit the collection of taxes from cases that are otherwise \n     placed in the currently not collectible inventory.\n       Terminate installment agreements for failure to file \n     returns and failure to make tax deposits. The proposal would \n     stop the downward spiral where taxpayers owe more and the \n     Government collects less. Although a significant number of \n     taxpayers violate the terms of their installment agreements \n     by failing to timely file their tax returns or make required \n     Federal tax deposits, the IRS is not permitted to terminate \n     installment agreements for these reasons.\n       Remove $50,000 threshold requirement for office of chief \n     counsel review of offers in compromise--IRC section 7122(b). \n     The proposal would remove the dollar threshold and give IRS \n     discretion in determining when a Chief Counsel opinion is \n     necessary. IRS attorneys are presently required to review \n     offers where the tax assessed, including penalties and \n     interest, exceeds $50,000. As a practical matter, IRS lawyer \n     offer little in the way of review and often contribute to the \n     delay in processing OICs.\n       Seven-day threshold on tolling of statute of limitations \n     during National Taxpayer Advocate review. The proposal \n     provides additional time, without tolling the statute of \n     limitations, for review by the National Taxpayer Advocate for \n     taxpayer assistance orders.\n       Increase Penalty for Bad Checks. Proposal would increase \n     penalty for bad checks to $20 or 2 % of amount over $1,000.\n       Allow the Financial Management Service to Retain \n     Transaction Fees from Levied Amounts. Proposal would allow \n     FMS to retain directly a portion of the levied funds as \n     payment of FMS fees. A delinquent taxpayer, however, would \n     receive full credit for the amount levied upon (i.e., the \n     amount credited to a taxpayer's account would not be reduced \n     by FMS's fee). The IRS pays FMS fees out of its own \n     appropriations. The proposal would alter internal government \n     accounting and allow the use of appropriated funds to \n     administer the tax system.\n       Elimination or Restriction on Offsetting Refunds from \n     former residents. The proposal would allow States to offset \n     Federal tax refunds owed by former residents. In 1998, \n     Congress authorized the state refund offset program. However, \n     the provision did not authorize states to offset Federal tax \n     refunds for State tax debts owed by former residents who had \n     subsequently moved to another State. Former residents have \n     the same safeguards as residents in these situations and \n     there is strong precedence that clearly gives States \n     authority to impose and collect taxes on former residents.\n     Processing and Personnel\n       Explanation of Statute of Limitations and Consequences of \n     Failure to Timely File. The proposal would require the IRS to \n     provide taxpayers with an explanation of the consequences of \n     failing to timely file refund claims.\n       Disclosure of tax information to facilitate combined \n     employment tax reporting. The proposal would expand and make \n     permanent the disclosure authority of the IRS to permit \n     disclosures of name, address, taxpayer identification number, \n     and signature to any State entity for purposes of carrying \n     out a combined federal and state employment tax reporting \n     program. Under current law, no tax information may be \n     furnished by the Internal Revenue Service to another agency \n     except as permitted under section 6103 which requires the \n     other agency to establish procedural safeguards satisfactory \n     to the IRS. A pilot program was established in 1997 in the \n     State of Montana to assess the feasibility and desirability \n     of expanding combined reporting. Reports from Montana were \n     very positive about the program.\n       Expansion of declaratory judgment remedy to tax-exempt \n     organizations. The proposal would extend declaratory judgment \n     procedures similar to those currently available only to \n     charities under section 7428 to other section 501(c) \n     determinations. The proposal would limit jurisdiction over \n     controversies involving such determinations to the United \n     States Tax Court. In addition, the proposal would modify the \n     present-law declaratory judgment procedures to provide that \n     an organization is deemed to have exhausted its \n     administrative remedies under the declaratory judgment \n     procedures at the expiration of (1) 270 days after the date \n     on which the request for a determination was made, or (2) in \n     the case of a failure by any office of the IRS to make a \n     determination (other than the office responsible for initial \n     determinations with respect to the issue), 450 days after the \n     date on which the request for a determination was made. \n     The proposal would also require the organization to take, \n     in a timely manner, all reasonable steps to secure such \n     determination.\n       Amendment to Treasury auction reforms. The proposal would \n     permit earlier disclosure upon the release by the Secretary \n     of the minutes of the meeting. Under current law, members of \n     the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee are prohibited from \n     disclosing anything relating to the securities to be \n     auctioned in a midquarter refunding by the Secretary until \n     the Secretary makes a public announcement of the refunding.\n       Revisions relating to termination of employment of IRS \n     employee misconduct. Proposal would modify section 1203 by \n     removing the late filing of refund returns from the list of \n     violations and removing employee versus employee acts (i.e. \n     for violation of an employee's rather than a taxpayer's \n     Constitutional or civil rights) from the list of violations.\n       IRS Oversight Board approval of use of critical pay \n     authority. The proposal would require IRS Oversight Board \n     review and approve the use of critical pay authority. \n     Critical pay allows the IRS to hire employees critical to the \n     mission of the IRS as well as allow the IRS to hire up to 40 \n     individuals for four year terms under streamlined procedures.\n       Low-income taxpayer clinics. The proposal would increase \n     the authorization for low-income taxpayer controversy clinics \n     to $10 million and authorize a similar grant program for low-\n     income taxpayer preparation clinics for $10 million. The \n     proposal would specify that grants may not be used for any \n     purpose other than those specified in the Code (this \n     restriction would be inapplicable to funds from other \n     sources). The proposal would also authorize the IRS to \n     promote the benefits and encourage the use of low-income \n     taxpayer clinics.\n       Enrolled agents. The proposal would add a new section to \n     the Code permitting the Secretary to prescribe regulations to \n     regulate the conduct of enrolled agents in regard to their \n     practice before the IRS and to permit enrolled agents meeting \n     the Secretary's qualifications to use the credentials or \n     designation ``enrolled agent'', ``EA'', or ``E.A.''.\n       Establishment of disaster response team. Proposal would \n     require the IRS to establish a permanent Disaster Response \n     Team which, in coordination with the Federal Emergency \n     Management Agency, is to assist taxpayers in clarifying and \n     resolving tax matters associated with a Presidentially \n     declared disaster or a terroristic or military action. The \n     Team is to be staffed by IRS employees with a relevant \n     knowledge and experience, including a representative from the \n     Office of the Taxpayer Advocate.\n       Accelerated tax refunds. Proposal would require the \n     Secretary of Treasury to study and report to the tax writing \n     committees on options to accelerate tax refunds for taxpayers \n     who maintain the same filing characteristics and elect the \n     direct option for any refund.\n       Study on clarifying record-keeping responsibilities. The \n     proposal would require the Secretary of the Treasury to study \n     the scope of records required to be maintained by taxpayers, \n     the utility of requiring taxpayers to maintain records \n     indefinitely, the taxpayer burden incurred by such \n     requirement given the necessity to upgrade technological \n     storage for outdated records, the number of negotiated \n     records retention agreements requested by taxpayers and the \n     number entered into by the IRS, and proposals regarding \n     taxpayer record-keeping. Under current law, every person \n     liable for any tax imposed by the Code, or for any collection \n     thereof, shall keep such records as the Secretary of the \n     Treasury may from time to time prescribe.\n       Streamline National Taxpayer Advocate Annual Reports. Each \n     year, the National Taxpayer Advocate is required to issue two \n     reports to Congress: (1) an annual report on\n\n[[Page S5229]]\n\n     objectives of the Advocate for the year due June 30 and (2) \n     an annual report on the Advocate's activities including the \n     20 most serious problems confronting taxpayers. The \n     Advocate's office spends an enormous amount of time and \n     effort preparing these reports. The proposal would streamline \n     the reporting process by requiring the Advocate to issue only \n     one report each year.\n       Penalty on failure to report interests in foreign financial \n     accounts. The proposal would establish a $5,000 penalty for \n     non-willful failure to report interest in foreign bank \n     accounts. Under present law there is only a penalty of \n     $25,000 for willful failures.\n       Repeal of personal holding company tax. The proposal would \n     repeal the personal holding company (PHC) tax. Subsequent \n     changes in the tax code resulted in the provisions \n     ineffectiveness as originally intended.\n\n\n           II. Simplification of Interest and Penalty Regimes\n\n       Individual estimated tax. The proposal simplifies the \n     individual estmated tax penalty including, increase the \n     penalty threshold for individuals to $2,000 from $1,000; \n     apply one interest rate per estimated tax underpayment; and \n     adopt 365-day year.\n       Corporate estimated tax. The proposal simplifies the \n     corporate estimated tax penalty by increasing the exception \n     for small amount of tax shown on the return from less than \n     $500 to less than $1,000.\n       Increase in large corporation threshold for estimated tax \n     payments. The proposal simplifies the corporate estimated tax \n     by expanding the safe harbor exception used by small \n     corporations by increasing the threshold from $1 million to \n     $1.5 million of taxable income.\n       Expansion of interest abatement. The proposal would: (1) \n     expand the circumstances in which interest may be abated to \n     include periods attributable to any unreasonable IRS error or \n     delay and (2) allow the abatement of interest to the extent \n     interest is attributable to the taxpayer's reliance on \n     written statement by the IRS.\n       Deposits made to stop the running of interest. Proposal \n     would permit deposits to be made to an interest bearing \n     account within Treasury to cover tax underpayments related to \n     issues potentially subject to dispute with the IRS.\n       Freeze provision regarding suspension of interest where \n     Secretary fails to contact taxpayer. The proposal would \n     repeal current law which requires the suspension of interest \n     on taxes owed until 21 days after the IRS sends a notice of \n     deficiency. The suspension is triggered if the IRS fails to \n     contact the taxpayer within 1 year for taxable years after \n     January 1, 2004 or 18 months for taxable years before January \n     1, 2004. The proposal is unnecessary with expanded interest \n     abatement.\n       Expansion of interest netting. Applies interest netting \n     rules without regard to the 45-day period in which the \n     Secretary may refund an overpayment of tax without the \n     payment of interest.\n       Clarification of application of Federal tax deposit \n     penalty. The proposal would clarify that the 10 percent \n     penalty rate only applies in cases where the failure to \n     deposit extends for more than 15 days.\n       Frivolous tax submissions. The proposal would increase the \n     penalty for frivolous tax returns from $500 to $5,000. In \n     addition, the proposal would permit the IRS to dismiss \n     requests for Collection Due Process hearings, installment \n     agreements, offers-in-compromise, and taxpayer assistance \n     orders if they are based on frivolous arguments or are \n     intended to delay or impede tax administration. Individuals \n     submitting such requests are subject to a $5,000 penalty for \n     repeat behavior or failure to withdraw the request after \n     being given the opportunity to do so.\n\n\n                   iii. u.s. tax court modernization\n\n       Jurisdiction of Tax Court over collection due process \n     cases. Currently, if a taxpayer's underlying tax liability \n     does not relate to income taxes or a type of tax over which \n     the Tax Court normally has deficiency jurisdiction, there is \n     no opportunity for Tax Court review and the taxpayer must \n     file in a District Court to obtain review. This provision \n     consolidates judicial review of collection due process \n     activity in the Tax Court.\n       Authority for special trial judges to hear and decide \n     certain employment status cases. This provision clarifies \n     that the Tax Court may authorize its special trial judges to \n     enter decisions in employment status cases that are subject \n     to small case proceedings under section 7436(c).\n       Confirmation of authority of Tax Court to apply doctrine of \n     equitable recoupment. The common-law principle of equitable \n     recoupment permits a party to asset an otherwise time-barred \n     claim to reduce or defeat an opponent's claim if both claims \n     arise from the same transaction. This provision confirms \n     statutorily that the Tax Court may apply equitable recoupment \n     principles to the same extent as District Court and the Court \n     of Federal Claims.\n       Tax Court filing fee in all cases commenced by filing \n     petition. This provision clarifies, in keeping with current \n     Tax Court procedure, that the Tax Court is authorized to \n     impose a $60 filing fee for all cases commenced by petition. \n     The proposal would eliminate the need to amend section 7451 \n     each time the Tax Court is granted new jurisdiction.\n       Amendments to appoint employees. Currently, the Tax Court \n     has to go to the executive branch, the Office of Personnel \n     Management, to change a position. It is inappropriate to \n     require the Tax Court to seek permission from the executive \n     since that branch is a party (Commissioner of Internal \n     Revenue) before the Tax Court. This change would allow the \n     Tax Court to be independent in fact and perception from the \n     Executive Branch while ensuring that basic employee rights, \n     protections, and remedies are retained or required in an \n     appropriate way (e.g., whistleblower protection, civil \n     rights, merit system principles, etc.).\n       Expanded use of Tax Court practice fee for pro se \n     taxpayers. The Tax Court is authorized to charge \n     practitioners a fee of up to $30 per year and to use these \n     fees to pursue disciplinary matters. The provision expands \n     use of these fees to provide services to pro se taxpayers. \n     Fees could be used for education programs for pro se \n     taxpayers.\n       Annuities for survivors of Tax Court judges who are \n     assassinated. The reality is that many people do not like to \n     pay taxes. there is as much risk of a Tax Court judge being \n     assassinated as any other Federal judge. The proposal would \n     conform the treatment of Tax Court judges to District Court \n     judges.\n       Cost-of-living adjustments for Tax Court judicial survivor \n     annuities. All Federal employees have this provision except \n     the Tax Court. Survivors of Tax Court judges are subject to \n     an obsolete method of indexing.\n       Life insurance coverage for Tax Court judges. This simply \n     codifies current Office of Personnel Management \n     interpretation, as was previously done for District Court \n     judges.\n       Cost of life insurance coverage for Tax Court judges age 65 \n     or over. Congress established the Tax Court in 1969 and \n     required that Tax Court judges receive the same compensation \n     as District Court judges. The District Court judges were \n     given this benefit to ensure that there was no diminution of \n     their compensation (as required by the Constitution). This \n     provision is in keeping with the original intent of Congress.\n       Modification of timing of lump-sum payment of judge's \n     accrued annual leave. District Court judges are allowed to \n     receive a lump-sum payment due to the life-time tenure of \n     Article III judges. Tax Court judges, while they have a 15 \n     year term, effectively have a life-time term because they are \n     always subject to recall.\n       Participation of Tax Court judges in the Thrift Savings \n     Plan. The proposal would allow Tax Court judges to \n     participate in Thrift Savings Plan. Currently, only 19 \n     federal government employees are left out of the Thrift \n     Savings Plan (i.e., Tax Court judges).\n       Exemption of teaching compensation of retired judges for \n     limitation on outside earned income. After retirement, Tax \n     Court judges should have the same ability to teach as \n     District Court judges.\n       General provisions relating to magistrate judges of the Tax \n     Court. ``Magistrate'' is more recognizable to the American \n     public because it is the term used by Article III courts. The \n     provision changes the term ``Special Trial Judge'' to \n     ``Magistrate Judge of the United States Tax Court'' and \n     provides for alignment of term of office and removal \n     applicable to District Court magistrate judges.\n       Annuities to surviving spouses and dependent children of \n     magistrate judges of the Tax Court. This section gives \n     Magistrates/Special Trial Judges the same advantages as Tax \n     Court judges, thus ensuring a greater pool of participants in \n     the fund.\n       Retirement and annuity program for magistrate judges. A \n     retirement and annuity program more aligned with District \n     Court Magistrates and the Tax Court judges is key for \n     attracting and retaining qualified judges.\n       Incumbent magistrate judges of the Tax Court. The provision \n     provides transition rules similar to those given to the \n     District Court magistrate judges.\n       Provisions for recall. Article III judges are ``self-\n     recalling'' (i.e., they decide for themselves whether they \n     are recalled or not). In contrast, Tax Court judges are \n     subject to provisions that authorize mandatory recall by the \n     Chief Judge. These provisions authorize the recall of \n     Magistrates/Special Trial judges in a manner similar to those \n     now applicable to the regular judges of the Court.\n\n\n               iv. confidentiality and disclosure reforms\n\n       Clarification of definition of church tax inquiry. The \n     proposal would clarify that the present-law church tax \n     inquiry procedures do not apply to contacts made by the IRS \n     for the purpose of educating churches with respect to the law \n     governing tax-exempt organizations. For example, the proposal \n     clarifies that the IRS does not violate the church tax \n     inquiry procedures when written materials are provided to a \n     church or churches for the purpose of educating such church \n     or churches with respect to the types of activities that are \n     not permissible under section 501(c)(3).\n       Collection activities with respect to joint return \n     disclosable to either spouse based on oral request. The \n     proposal would eliminate the requirement for former spouses \n     to make a written request for disclosure of collection \n     activities with respect to a joint return. Under present law, \n     section 6103(e)(7) permits the IRS to disclose return \n     information to the same persons who may have access to a \n     return under the other provisions of section 6103(e), thus \n     either spouse may obtain return information regarding a joint \n     return upon oral request.\n       Taxpayer representatives not subject to examination on sole \n     basis of representation of taxpayers. The proposal would \n     clarify that\n\n[[Page S5230]]\n\n     an IRS employee conducting an examination of a taxpayer is \n     not authorized to inspect a taxpayer representative's return \n     or return information solely on the basis of the \n     representative relationship to the taxpayer. Under the \n     proposal, the supervisor of the IRS employee would be \n     required to approve such inspection after making a \n     determination that other grounds justified such an \n     inspection. The proposal would not affect the ability of \n     employees of the IRS Director of Professional Responsibility, \n     or other employees whose assigned duties concern the \n     regulation of practice before the IRS, to access returns and \n     return information of a representative.\n       Prohibition of disclosure of taxpayer identifying number \n     with respect to disclosure of accepted offers-in-compromise. \n     The proposal would prohibit the disclosure of the taxpayer \n     identification number as part of the publicly available \n     summaries of accepted offers in compromise.\n       Compliance by contractors with confidentiality safeguards. \n     The proposal would require that a State or Federal agency \n     conduct on-site reviews of all of its contractors receiving \n     Federal returns and return information every three years. \n     This review is intended to cover secure storage, restricting \n     access, computer security, and other safeguards deemed \n     appropriate by the Secretary. Under the proposal, the State \n     or Federal agency would be required to submit a report of its \n     findings to the IRS and certify annually that all contractors \n     are in compliance with the requirements to safeguard the \n     confidentiality of Federal returns and return information.\n       Higher standards for requests for and consents to \n     disclosure. The proposal would render invalid a consent that \n     does not designate a recipient or is not dated at the time of \n     execution. The person submitting the consent to the IRS would \n     be required to verify under penalties of perjury that the \n     form was complete and dated at the time it was signed by the \n     taxpayer. Inspection or disclosure of a return or return \n     information pursuant to an invalid consent would be \n     unauthorized under section 6103. Thus, a person making such \n     unauthorized disclosure or inspection could be liable for \n     civil damages under section 7431, and criminal penalties \n     under section 7213 or 7213A for willful unauthorized \n     disclosure or inspection.\n       Civil damages for unauthorized inspection or disclosure. \n     The proposal would require the IRS to notify a taxpayer at \n     the point of proposed administrative action as to \n     disciplinary or adverse action against an employee arising \n     from the unauthorized inspection or disclosure of the \n     taxpayer's return or return information.\n       Expanded disclosure in emergency circumstances. The \n     proposal would permit disclosure to local law enforcement \n     authorities emergency situations including suicide threats.\n       Disclosure of taxpayer identity for tax refund purposes.--\n     On April 15, 2002, about 1.7 million people who did not file \n     their 1998 income tax return who lose more than $2.3 billion \n     in tax refunds. When the IRS is unable to find a taxpayer due \n     a refund, present law provides that it may use ``the press or \n     other media'' to notify the taxpayer of the refund. The IRS \n     believes the current statutory framework in Section 6103(m) \n     does not permit disclosure via the Internet. The proposal \n     would allow the IRS to use any means of ``mass \n     communicating,'' including the Internet to notify a taxpayer \n     of an undelivered refund.\n       Disclosure to State officials of proposed actions related \n     to section 501(c) organizations. The proposal provides that \n     upon written request by an appropriate State officer, the \n     Secretary may disclose: (1) a notice of proposed refusal to \n     recognize an organization as a section 501(c)(3) \n     organization; (2) a notice of proposed revocation of tax-\n     exemption of a section 501(c)(3) organization; (3) the \n     issuance of a proposed deficiency of tax imposed under \n     section 507, chapter 41, or chapter 42; (4) the names, \n     addresses, and taxpayer identification numbers of \n     organizations that have applied for recognition as section \n     501(c)(3) organizations; and (5) returns and return \n     information of organizations with respect to which \n     information has been disclosed under (1) through (4) above. \n     Disclosure or inspection is permitted for the purpose of, and \n     only to the extent necessary in, the administration of State \n     laws regulating section 501(c)(3) organizations, such as laws \n     regulating tax-exempt status, charitable trusts, charitable \n     solicitation, and fraud.\n       Treatment of public records. The proposal clarifies that \n     public record data (e.g., press releases re criminal cases) \n     does not retain 6103 protections in the files of the IRS.\n       Investigative disclosures. The proposal permits the IRS \n     Criminal Investigation agents to identify themselves, \n     organizational affiliation, and criminal nature of \n     investigation when contacting third parties in writing or in \n     person.\n       TIN matching. The proposal permits taxpayer identification \n     number (TIN) verification by persons required to provide the \n     information to the IRS (limited to whether information \n     matches) to permit early error resolution and enhance \n     compliance. Under present law, over 30 million information \n     returns are received by the IRS from payors that contain \n     missing or incorrect name and TIN information. However, the \n     IRS is only permitted to disclose the error to the payor at \n     the point at which the payment is subject to backup \n     withholding.\n       Form 8300 disclosures. The proposal ensures that the Form \n     8300 (for reporting transactions in excess of $10,000) can be \n     disclosed to law enforcement in the same manner as financial \n     reporting documents required under the Bank Secrecy Act \n     (under Title 31).\n\n\n    V. SIMPLIFICATION THROUGH ELIMINATION OF INOPERATIVE PROVISIONS\n\n       1. Adjustments in tax tables so that inflation will not \n     result in tax increases. Paragraph (7) of section 1(f) is \n     amended to read as follows: ``(7) Special rule for certain \n     brackets--In prescribing tables under paragraph (1) which \n     apply to taxable years beginning in a calendar year after \n     1994, the cost-of-living adjustment used in making \n     adjustments to the dollar amounts at which the 36 percent \n     bracket begins or at which the 39.6 rate bracket begins shall \n     be determined under paragraph (3) by substituting `1993' for \n     `1992'.''\n       2. Reduced capital gain rates for qualified 5-year gain. \n     Paragraph (2) of section 1(h) is amended by striking ``In the \n     case of taxable years beginning after December 31, 2000, \n     the'' and inserting ``The''.\n       3. Credit for producing fuel from nonconventional source. \n     Section 29 is amended by striking subsection (e).\n       4. Earned income credit. Paragraph (1) of section 32(b) is \n     amended by striking subparagraphs (B) and (C) and by striking \n     ``(A) In General. In the case of taxable years beginning \n     after 1995:''.\n       5. General business credits. Subsection (d) of section 38 \n     is amended by striking paragraph (3).\n       6. Carryback and carryforward of unused credits. Section 39 \n     is amended by striking subsection (d).\n       7. Adjustments based on adjusted current earnings. Clause \n     (ii) of section 56(g)(4)(F) is amended by striking ``In the \n     case of any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1992, \n     clause'' and inserting ``Clause''.\n       8. Items of tax preference; Depletion. Paragraph (1) of \n     section 57(a) is amended by striking ``Effective with respect \n     to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1992, this'' \n     and inserting ``This''.\n       9. Intangible drilling costs. Clause (i) of section \n     57(a)(E) is amended by striking ``In the case of any taxable \n     year beginning after December 31, 1992, this'' and inserting \n     ``This''. Clause (ii) of section 57(a)(2)(E) is amended by \n     striking ``(30 percent in the case of taxable years beginning \n     in 1993''.\n       10. Annuities; certain proceeds of endowment and life \n     insurance contracts. Paragraph (4) of section 72(c) is \n     amended by striking ``under the contract'' and all that \n     follows and inserting'' under the contract.'' Paragraph (3) \n     of section 72(g) is amended by striking ``January 1, 1954, \n     or''.\n       11. Accident and health plans. Section 105(f) is amended by \n     striking ``or (d)''.\n       12. Flexible spending arrangements. Section 106(c)(1) is \n     amended by striking ``Effective on and after January 1, 1997, \n     gross'' and inserting ``Gross''.\n       13. Certain combat zone compensation of members of the \n     Armed Forces. Subsection (c) of section 112 is amended by \n     striking ``(after June 24, 1950)'' in paragraph (2), and \n     striking ``such zone,'' and all that follows in paragraph (3) \n     and inserting ``such zone.''\n       14. Principal residence. Section 121(b)(3) is amended by \n     striking subparagraph (B).\n       15. Certain reduced uniformed services retirement pay. \n     Section 112(b)(1) is amended by striking ``after December 31, \n     1965,''.\n       16. Great plains conservation program. Section 126(a) is \n     amended by striking paragraph (6).\n       17. Mortgage revenue bonds--Federal disaster area \n     modifications. Eliminate special qualified mortgage bond \n     rules or residences located in Federal disaster areas. \n     (utility expired January 1, 1999).\n       18. Interim authority for governors regarding allocation of \n     private activity bond volume limits. Eliminate temporary \n     gubernatorial authority to allocate the volume limit.\n       19. Treble damage payments under the antitrust law. Section \n     162(g) is amended by striking the last sentence.\n       20. State legislators' travel expenses away from home. \n     Paragraph (4) of section 162(h) is amended by striking ``For \n     taxable years beginning after December 31, 1980, this'' and \n     inserting ``This''.\n       21. Interest. Section 163 is amended by striking paragraph \n     (6) of subsection (d) and paragraph (5) of subsection (h). \n     Section 56(b)(1)(C) is amended by striking clause (ii) and by \n     redesignating clauses (iii) and (iv) as clauses (ii) and \n     (iii) respectively.\n       22. Charitable, etc., contributions and gifts. Section 170 \n     is amended by striking subsection (k).\n       23. Amortizable bond premium. Subparagraph (B) of section \n     171(b)(1) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(B)(i) in the case of a bond described in subsection \n     (a)(2), with reference to the amount payable on maturity or \n     earlier call date, and\n       ``(ii) in the case of a bond described in subsection \n     (a)(1), with reference to the amount payable on maturity (or \n     if it results in a smaller amortizable bond premium \n     attributable to the period to earlier call date, with \n     reference to the amount payable on earlier call date), and''\n       24. Net operating loss carrybacks and carryovers.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to apply an \nexcise tax to excessive attorneys fees for legal judgments, \nsettlements, or agreements that operate as a tax; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Intermediate \nSanctions Compensatory Revenue Adjustment Act of 2003, ISCRAA. This \nlegislation will restore to the States billions of dollars in revenue \ndue to them from a massive lawsuit recently conducted on their behalf \nthe tobacco-Related Medicaid expenses litigation. ISCRAA amends an \nexisting provision of the Federal tax code in order to enforce basic, \nuniversally accepted fiduciary standards governing the award of \nattorneys fees. By applying these standards to the attorneys who \nrepresented the states in the tobacco settlement, ISCRAA reasonably can \nbe expected to restore to the states income with a present value of \napproximately $9 billion. I have included at the end of my statement a \nchart detailing how much each state can expect to recover.\n  ISCRAA's tax formula is borrowed from the 1996 Tax Act's Intermediate \nSanctions Tax, IST, which applies a two-step excise tax to any \nexcessive or unreasonable compensation that the managers of a trust pay \nto themselves from the assets of the trust. The IST framework \nencourages the trustee to restore the excessive portion of any fee to \nthe trust--when he does so, the IST's punitive taxes do not apply.\n  ISCRAA extends the IST to another type of trust relationship: that \nbetween a lawyer and his client. ISCRAA applies the IST tax formula to \nany unreasonable or excessive income that a lawyer collects from \nlitigation resulting in a judgment or settlement in excess of $100 \nmillion. To avoid IST taxes, an attorney must restore the excessive \nportion of the fee to the client.\n  As my colleague Senator Cornyn will explain today, the ethical and \nlegal abuses that resulted from the 1998 State tobacco settlement make \nthe need for this legislation manifest. Senator CORNYN also will \ndiscuss the law of attorneys' fiduciary obligations, which establishes \nthat a fee award is the property of the client--and that any unethical \nfee must be restored to the client, regardless of how the fee award is \nstructured.\n  I will discuss today how ISCRAA will affect massive litigations \ngenerally. In order to gauge the reasonableness of a lawyer's fee \naward, ISCRAA adopts and codifies a liberal version of the lodestar-\nmultiplier system. As I will later explain in greater detail, ISCRAA \nallows fee multipliers of up to 500 percent of reasonable hourly rates. \nThis limit is as generous as the most liberal limits adopted by state \ncourts, and considerably more generous than the limits that federal \ncourts have applied in $100 million cases. ISCRAA's fee formula \nguarantees that attorneys' fiduciary obligations will be respected, \nwhile providing plaintiff's lawyers with ample incentive to provide \nhigh-quality legal representation in these types of cases.\n  Federal supervision of fee awards resulting from $100 million \nlitigations is appropriate for several reasons. First, because of their \nsheer size, these types of lawsuits inevitably operate as a tax on the \nconsuming public. Few defendants actually can afford to pay such \njudgments with cash on hand. Instead, the affected industries simply \nwill raise the prices that they charge to their customers.\n  This is exactly what has happened in the State Medicaid tobacco \nsettlement--according to the leading proponents of that litigation. The \nfirst State attorney general to file suit against the tobacco companies \nhas admitted that ``what always happens in these cases is the industry \npasses the costs to the consumer.'' Other commentators agree that this \nhas occurred in the tobacco litigation. As one law-review article \nnotes, ``the [tobacco] settlement * * * is a tax because it's a set of \npayments made by tobacco companies that depend on how many packs they \nsell; in short, it looks like a tax and quacks like a tax.''\n  Because of the way that these massive judgments typically are \nsatisfied, it is particularly important to ensure that attorneys are \npaid in proportion to the services that they provided--rather than \nsolely on the basis of the size of the recovery. Again, the State \ntobacco settlement highlights the nature of the problem. As two of the \nleading academic commentators have noted, it is ``very troubl[ing]'' \nthat under that agreement, ``a group of private citizens [are] getting \npaid a percentage of a tax increase they helped pass.'' The sheer size \nof the tobacco settlement--and the fact that attorneys fees were based \non this size, rather than on the attorneys' actual efforts--has given \nthe fee awards an uncanny resemblance to the medieval practice of tax \nfarming. In all but name, the government has licensed a group of \nprivate individuals to collect a tax from the consuming public.\n  I would emphasize at this point that ISCRAA is not an attack on the \nState tobacco lawsuits. The bill does not pass judgment on the merits \nor the appropriateness of this type of litigation. ISCRAA simply is \ndesigned to ensure that when such lawsuits are brought on the public's \nbehalf, the public receive its fair share of the proceeds. If a State \nchooses to seek compensatory revenue from industry for past harms, then \nthe resulting tax on the public--minus the reasonable value of the \nlegal services actually provided--must go to the State treasury.\n  There are several reasons why $100 million is an appropriate \nthreshold for applying ISCRAA's fee formula. First, the courts \nthemselves have indicated that fee agreements based primarily on the \nsize of the recovery tend to become unreasonable when judgements reach \nthis size. As one court has stated, ``in much smaller cases, a fee \naward of 33 percent does not present the danger of providing the \nplaintiff's counsel with the windfall that would accompany a `megafund' \nsettlement of $100 million or upwards. But it is quite different when \nthe figures hit the really big time.'' Or as the Third Circuit notes, \n``courts have generally decreased the percentage awarded [for attorneys \nfees] as the amount recovered increases, and $100 million seems to be \nthe informal marker of a 'very large' settlement.''\n  The logic of avoiding judgment-based awards in these very large cases \nis straightforward. As one court explains, ``it is not 150 times more \ndifficult to prepare, try, and settle a $150 million case than it is to \ntry a $1 million case, but the application of a percentage comparable \nto that in a smaller case may yield an award 150 times greater.'' Thus, \naccording to another court, ``there is considerable merit'' to \ndisallowing standard percentage awards as the ``size of the [recovery] \nfund increases. In many instances the increase [in the recovery] is \nmerely a factor of the size of the class and has no direct relationship \nto the efforts of counsel.''\n\n[[Page S5238]]\n\n  It also bears mention that because of its $100 million threshold, \nISCRAA applies to a fairly limited universe of cases. As courts have \nremarked, ``there are few so-called `megafund' cases with settlements \nover $100 million.'' In 2001, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third \nCircuit attempted to catalogue all common-fund cases in federal court \nthat resulted in recoveries greater than $100 million. Though such \nlitigations have been more frequent in recent years, the Third Circuit \nidentified only 22 such cases since 1985. See in re Cendant Corp. \nPRIDES Litig., 243 F.3d 722, 737 (3d Cir. 2001).\n  ISCRAA is somewhat broader than the criteria that Cendant Corp. \nemployed to collect cases. ISCRAA is not limited to common-fund cases--\nit also applies to judgments won on behalf of tax-exempt entities or \neven single individuals. ISCRAA also applies to cases brought in State \ncourt, and it aggregates identical claims that are brought against \ncommon defendants in separate actions, in order to prevent evasion of \nits limits through the subdivision of actions. Nevertheless, ISCRAA's \nscope remains fairly narrow. An academic specialist who is familiar \nwith developments in this field has reviewed the bill and concluded \nthat because of its ``relatively high threshold,'' ISCRAA probably \nwould apply only to about 15-20 litigations per year. I will include a \ncopy of this professor's letter to me in the Congressional Record.\n  Finally, a $100 million threshold also is appropriate because it \nlimits ISCRAA's reach to litigations that are a natural subject of \ncongress's authority to regulate interstate commerce. It is well-\nestablished that ``Congress' commerce authority includes the power to \nregulate . . . those [economic] activities that substantially affect \ninterstate commerce.'' United States v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598, 609 \n(2000). See also United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549 (1995). Both the \nexecutive and the legislative branches previously have identified $100 \nmillion as guideline for determining whether a matter has a significant \nimpact on interState commerce. See, e.g. Executive Order 12866; \nCongressional Review Act, 5 U.S.C. Sec. 804(2); Unfunded Mandates Act, \n2 U.S.C. Sec. 1532(a). Because it is limited to litigations of this \nsize, ISCRAA is consistent with congress's power and obligation to \nprotect the flow of commerce between states.\n  Another point that I would like to emphasize today is that ISCRAA is \nnot an anti-plaintiffs' lawyer bill. It is not stingy toward trial \nattorneys. ISCRAA is carefully designed to protect fiduciary interests \nwhile providing plaintiffs' lawyers with ample incentives to provide \nhigh-quality legal representation in large litigations. ISCRAA's fee \nformula is as generous as the limits set by the most liberal State \ncourts that engage in meaningful review of attorneys fees, and is \nconsiderably more generous than the Federal courts' practices in $100 \nmillion cases. Moreover, the multiplier criteria that ISCRAA employs \nuniversally are recognized as legitimate prerequisites for a \ncontingency fee--even by trial lawyers' professional associations.\n  Federal courts primarily rely on two systems for calculating \nattorneys fees in cases, such as class actions, in which they are \nrequired to set ``reasonable fees:'' the percentage method and the \nlodestar-multiplier method. The percentage method, as its name implies, \ncalculates fees as a percentage of the total recovery. The lodestar \nsystem, by contrast, requires a court to first calculate a fee based on \nthe number of hours that the lawyer worked multiplied by prevailing \nhourly rates, the ``lodestar''. The court then multiplies this lodestar \nfee again in order to reward the attorney for the risk of nonpayment of \nfees that he assumed and for any exceptional services that he provided.\n  Over the last thirty years, courts have moved back and forth between \nthese two systems. Only a few courts make lodestar-multipliers the \nexclusive means of awarding attorneys fees. But as one academic \ncommentator has noted, ``lodestar, or hours-based methods, have been \nadopted in every [federal judicial] circuit.''\n  And more importantly, in large-recovery cases, there has been very \nlittle difference between lodestar and percentage systems. This is \nbecause even when courts apply a percentage to calculate fees, and as \njudgements become very large, courts typically also calculate a \nreasonable lodestar in order to determine what constitutes a reasonable \npercentage. Thus, again, as the Third Circuit notes, ``courts have \ngenerally decreased the percentage awarded as the amount recovered \nincreases, and $100 million seems to be the informal marker of a `very \nlarge' settlement.''\n  Courts have been wary of awarding fees based on percentages alone. As \none State supreme court explains: ``to begin the assessment by \narbitrarily picking a percentage amount without any reliance on a \ncognizable structure invites decisions that are nonobjective and \ninconsistent. What constitutes a reasonable percentage may differ from \none judge to another depending on each judge's predilections, \nbackground, and geographical location in the state.''\n  Thus ``courts that employ the percentage approach appear to be \nmotivated in part by a lodestar dynamic. Because courts are reluctant \nto give fee awards totally incommensurate with the efforts of the \nattorneys, percentage awards generally decrease as the amount of the \nrecovery increases.''\n  One result of the cross-use of the lodestar and percentage systems is \nthat even when courts use the percentage system, those awards \noverwhelmingly tend to reflect a reasonable lodestar multiplier. \nTherefore, even percentage-based cases tend to provide evidence of the \nrange of multipliers that the courts consider to be reasonable.\n  In 2001, the Third Circuit ``set forth a chart of fee awards given in \nFederal courts since 1985 in class actions in which the settlement fund \nexceeded $100 million and in which the percentage of recovery method \nwas used.'' Cendant Corp. The court identified 17 such cases. In almost \nevery case, the Third Circuit could calculate the multiplier that was \nused, and ``the lodestar multiplier in those cases never exceeded \n2.99.'' And in the direct lodestar-multiplier cases that court \nidentified, the multiplier ranged from 1.2 to 3.25.\n  Other courts, surveying smaller cases than the $100 million \nrecoveries examined in Cendant Corp., have identified larger \nmultipliers. One Federal district court has ``observe[d] that in \nvirtually every case where the court notes a lodestar but awards fees \nbased upon a percentage, the lodestar multiplier converted from this \npercentage is in the range of 1 to 4.'' Another Federal district court \nhas found that ``the range of lodestar multipliers in large and \ncomplicated class actions runs from a low of 2.26 to a high of 4.5.''\n  By contrast, some courts have declared that they would allow only \nlower multipliers. One Federal court has stated that ``only in the most \nexceptional circumstances would this court award a multiplier of 3 or \ngreater. . . . this court believes that lodestars enhanced by \nmultipliers less than 3 should adequately compensate even the most \ntalented counsel.'' And the Seventh Circuit has suggested that ``it may \nbe that a doubling of the lodestar would provide a sensible ceiling.''\n  On the other hand, the Florida Supreme Court--which is generally \nregarded as one of the more plaintiff-friendly courts in the United \nStates--has announced that: ``we set the maximum multiplier available \nin this common-fund category of cases at 5. . . . [A] multiplier which \nincreases fees to five times the accepted hourly rate is sufficient to \nalleviate the contingency risk factor involved and attract high level \ncounsel to common fund cases while producing a fee that remains within \nthe bounds of reasonableness. We emphasize that 5 is a maximum \nmultiplier.''\n  ISCRAA adopts this more liberal standard. It allows fees as high as \n500 percent of reasonable hourly rates. ISCRAA awards multipliers based \non two criteria: it allows up to 300 percent to be added onto the \namount of reasonable hourly fees if a case that involved a substantial \nrisk of nonrecovery of fees, and allows an additional 100 percent add-\non if the attorney provided exceptional services that improved the \nplaintiff's recovery.\n  The criteria that ISCRAA employs universally are recognized as \nnecessary prerequisites to the legitimacy of a contingency fee. \n``Courts in general have insisted that a contingent fee be\n\n[[Page S5239]]\n\ntruly contingent. The typically elevated fee reflecting the risk to the \nlawyer of receiving no fee will be permitted only if the representation \nindeed involves a significant degree of risk.'' Charles W. Wolfram, \nModern Legal Ethics Sec.  9.4, at 532 (1986). The risk requirement has \nbeen recognized ever since contingency fees first were allowed in the \nUnited States. The American Bar Association even noted at that time \nthat ``a contract for a contingent fee, where sanctioned by law, should \nbe reasonable under all the circumstances of the case, including the \nrisk and uncertainty of the compensation.'' ABA Canons of Professional \nEthics, Canon 13 (1908). Indeed, even the professional associations of \nplaintiffs' attorneys have, at times, acknowledged that contingent fees \nshould be based on an actual contingency. In a guide to its members, \nthe Association of Trial Lawyers of America has ``recommend[ed]'' that \nattorneys ``exercise sound judgment in using a percentage in the \ncontingent fee contract that is commensurate with the risk, cost and \neffort required.'' ATLA, Keys to the Courthouse: Quick Facts on the \nContingency Fee System 13 (1994).\n  The criteria that ISCRAA employs are universally accepted--and the \nlimits that it sets should be universally acceptable. ISCRAA is not \nintended to alter the considered standards of any jurisdiction. Rather, \nit is intended to enforce those standards--and to correct the \noccasional extreme outlier. Because ISCRAA incorporates a fee formula \nthat is substantially more liberal than the usual practices of the \nfederal courts in $100 million cases, we can be confident that high-\nquality legal representation will remain available to plaintiffs in \nthese large litigations. See, e.g. in re Sumitomo Copper Litig., 74 F. \nSupp. 2d 393, S.D.N.Y. 1999, RICO and Commodities Exchange Act case \nresulting in $116 million recovery; attorneys reviewed millions of \npages of documents located throughout the world, many requiring \ntranslation from Japanese; Federal district court awards multiplier of \n250 percent for total fee of $32 million.\n  Another issue that I will address today is the argument--occasionally \nraised in opposition to proposals to limit attorneys fees--that such \nrestrictions violate attorneys' rights to freedom of contract.\n  The first principle to keep in mind when questions of attorneys fees \nare considered is that ``a fiduciary relationship exists as a matter of \nlaw between attorney and client.'' (Illinois Supreme Court.) As one \nacademic commentator has noted: ``[I]t is uncontroverted today that a \nlawyer is a fiduciary for, and therefore has a duty to deal fairly \nwith, the client. . . . Lawyers are fiduciaries because retention of an \nattorney to exercise 'professional judgment' on the client's behalf \nnecessarily involves reposing trust and confidence in the attorney. \nExercising professional judgment requires that the lawyer advance the \nclient's interests as the client would define them if the client were \nwell-informed.''\n  The lawyer's status as fiduciary places limits on his dealings with \nhis client--including with regard to his fee. ``An attorney's freedom \nto contract with a client is subject to the constraints of ethical \nconsiderations.'' New Jersey Supreme Court. ``In setting fees, lawyers \nare fiduciaries who owe their clients greater duties than are owed \nunder the general law of contracts.'' Massachusetts Appeals Court. ``As \na result of lawyers' special role in the legal system, contracts \nbetween lawyer and client receive special scrutiny. . . . While freedom \nof contract is the guiding principle underlying contract law, \ncontractual freedom is muted in the lawyer-client and lawyer-lawyer \ncontexts.'' Joseph M. Perillo, law professor.\n  The unique status of attorney fee contracts has led courts to reject \nanalogies between such agreements and other business or service \ncontracts. Perhaps the fullest exposition is provided by the Arizona \nSupreme Court: ``We realize that business contracts may be enforced \nbetween those in equal bargaining capacities, even though they turn out \nto be unfair, inequitable or harsh. However, a fee agreement between \nlawyer and client is not an ordinary business contract. The profession \nhas both an obligation of public service and duties to clients which \ntranscend ordinary business relationships and prohibit the lawyer from \ntaking advantage of the client. Thus, in fixing and collecting fees the \nprofession must remember that it is a branch of the administration of \njustice and not a mere money getting trade.' ABA Canons of Professional \nEthics, Canon 12.''\n\n  The same principle has been identified by the Florida Supreme Court: \nThere is but little analogy between the elements that control the \ndetermination of a lawyer's fee and those which determine the \ncompensation of skilled craftsmen in other fields. Lawyers are officers \nof the court. The court is an instrument of society for the \nadministration of justice. Justice should be administered economically, \nefficiently, and expeditiously. The attorney's fee is, therefore, a \nvery important factor in the administration of justice, and if it is \nnot determined with proper relation to that fact it results in a \nspecies of social malpractice that undermines the confidence of the \npublic in the bench and bar. It does more than that. It brings the \ncourt into disrepute and destroys its power to perform adequately the \nfunction of its creation.''\n  In order to protect the lawyer's public role and to enforce his \nfiduciary obligations, the courts read a reasonableness requirement \ninto every attorney fee contract. ``[T]he requirement that a fee be \nreasonable in amount overrides the terms of the contract, so that an \n`unreasonable' fee cannot be recovered, even if agreed to by the \nclient.'' G. Hazard, Jr. & W. Hodes, The Law of Lawyering 1. 5:205 Fee \nLitigation and Arbitration 120 (1998 Supp.).\n  As one court has stated, ``[A]n attorney is only entitled to fees \nwhich are fair and just and which adequately compensate him for his \nservices. This is true no matter what fee is specified in the contract, \nbecause an attorney, as a fiduciary, cannot bind his client to pay a \ngreater compensation for his services than the attorney would have the \nright to demand if no contract had been made. Therefore, as a matter of \npublic policy, reasonableness is an implied term in every contract for \nattorney's fees.''\n\n  Finally, when assessing whether a fee is reasonable, courts ask \nwhether the fee is proportional to the services that were actually \nprovided. ``Fees must be reasonably proportional to the services \nrendered and the situation presented.'' (Arizona Supreme Court.) ``If \nan attorney's fee is grossly disproportionate to the services rendered \nand is charged to a client who lacks full information about all of the \nrelevant circumstances, the fee is `clearly excessive' . . . even \nthough the client consented to such fee.'' West Virginia Supreme Court.\n  Because attorneys are fiduciaries, they simply do not have complete \nfreedom of contract in negotiating their fees. An attorney's dealings \nwith his client always must reflect that the client comes to him in a \nposition of trust--and therefore, the attorney's fee always must be \nreasonable. ISCRAA will help ensure that this important obligation is \nrespected.\n  Another subject that I would like to address today is ISCRAA's \neffective date. ISCRAA applies to attorney fee payments received after \nJune 1, 2002. This effective date is appropriate under the \ncircumstances of the State tobacco settlement for several reasons: \nfirst, Congress routinely enacts major tax legislation with effective \ndates that look back much further than does ISCRAA. The Supreme Court \nhas ``repeatedly upheld [such moderately] retroactive tax legislation \nagainst a due process challenge.'' United States v. Carlton, 512 U.S. \n26, 30-31, 1994; see id. at 33, upholding tax whose ``actual \nretroactive effect . . . extended for a period only slightly greater \nthan one year''.\n  Second, ISCRAA is not even truly retroactive. ISCRAA does not change \nthe substantive law governing attorneys fee awards. Rather, it simply \nenforces established, pre-existing fiduciary standards that already \nbind every attorney in every state. The Model Rules of Professional \nConduct, at Rule 1.5(a), contain a clear, direct command that ``a \nlawyer's fee shall be reasonable.'' Similarly, the Model Code of \nProfessional Responsibility, at DR 2-106, directs that an attorney \n``shall not enter into an agreement for, charge, or collect an illegal \nor clearly excessive fee.'' The Model Code further explains that an \nattorneys fee is ``clearly excessive when, after a review of the facts, \na\n\n[[Page S5240]]\n\nlawyer of ordinary prudence would be left with a definite and firm \nconviction that the fee is in excess of a reasonable fee.'' Finally, as \nacademic commentators point out, in addition to the model rules, ``all \nState rules of professional conduct prohibit attorneys from charging \nexcessive fees.''\n  As I described earlier, to enforce fiduciary standards, ISCRAA \ncodifies and applies a very generous version of the fee multiplier \nsystem, allowing attorneys fees as high as 500 percent of reasonable \nhourly rates. This is considerably more generous than what Federal \ncourts typically allow in large-judgment cases. No attorney can be \nheard to complain that he is subjected to a law that is more generous \nthan his existing fiduciary obligations.\n  Further, none of the tobacco-settlement attorneys can reasonably \nmaintain that they have a vested right to see their fiduciary duties to \nthe states go unenforced. Nevertheless, in order to be fair to all \nparties, ISCRAA's excise taxes are applied only to fees that were paid \nafter June 1, 2002. By this date, all of the tobacco lawyers twice had \nreceived notice from George W. Bush that he intended to enact \nlegislation to enforce their fiduciary obligations. In February 2000, \nthen-candidate Bush promised that he would ``extend[] the `excess \nbenefits' provision of the tax code to private lawyers who contract \nwith states and municipalities,'' with ``the reasonableness of the fees \n* * * [to] be determined by the standard judicial `lodestar' method.'' \nAnd as early as February 2001, the current Administration announced \nthat it anticipated providing ``additional public health resources for \nthe States from the President's proposal to extend fiduciary \nresponsibilities to the representatives of States in tobacco \nlawsuits.'' See A Blueprint for New Beginnings: A Responsible Budget \nfor America's Priorities 80, Office of Management and Budget, February \n28, 2001.\n  Under ISCRAA, all of the attorneys who participated in the State \ntobacco settlement still will be very liberally compensated. Because \nISCRAA does not apply to the first three-and-a-half years of fee \npayments under the settlement, it exempts the first two-and-a-half \nbillion dollars that these lawyers received. Every one of the tobacco \nlawyers will have more than enough money left to pay for the yachts, \nluxury cars, and vacation homes that were purchased with the tobacco \nproceeds. ISCRAA might simply be described as the one-yacht-per-lawyer \nrule.\n  But most importantly, because ISCRAA applies to the last year's worth \nof tobacco fee payments, and to all future payments, it will return a \nsubstantial amount of funds to the States--money that already should \nbelong to the States under any reasonable interpretation of fiduciary \nstandards. It is critical that these funds be restored in this time of \nwidespread fiscal crisis. Today a large number of the States face \nmassive budget deficits that threaten their ability to provide health \ncare to the indigent, to fully fund public education, and to guarantee \nadequate and effective law enforcement. When such needs risk going \nunmet, fee abuses that cost the States billions of dollars simply can \nno longer be ignored. The States must receive their fair share of the \ntobacco settlement proceeds--funds that are badly needed to support \nbasic public services.\n  Under the terms of the November 1998 Master Settlement Agreement, \nMSA, between the States and tobacco companies, $500 million in \ncigarette taxes is set aside every year to pay the attorneys who chose \nto have their fees awarded in arbitration. Because extraordinarily high \nfees were awarded by the arbitrators--estimated to total $15 billion--\nthe $500-million-a-year income stream, which is not adjusted for \ninflation, may have to be paid in perpetuity. In addition to this \nannuity, the MSA also sets aside an additional $1.25 billion in \ncigarette taxes to compensate those lawyers who choose to forego \narbitration and negotiate their fees directly with the tobacco \ncompanies.\n  The present value of the $500-million-a-year fee stream--discounting \nall future payments for the time value of money--has been \nconservatively estimated at just over $8 billion. Current and future \npayments from the $1.25 billion fee fund are less certain, since the \ngrants made from that fund and their disbursement schedule have been \nkept obscure from the public. Because ISCRAA's effective date is June \n1, 2002, ISCRAA will probably recoup for the States an additional $1 \nbillion above the present value of future $500 million-a-year payments. \nISCRAA does not affect the first three-and-a-half years of fees paid \nunder the MSA. Because these payments almost certainly are adequate to \npay all reasonable fees incurred in the litigation, ISCRAA would \nrestore to the States virtually all fees paid after its effective date. \nThus the net present value of the sums that ISCRAA would provide to the \nStates can conservatively be estimated at $9 billion.\n  By restoring these excess fee payments to the states' MSA escrow \naccount and returning them to the States on a per capita basis, ISCRAA \nguarantees every State a very substantial recovery. Based on the \nestimates that I have described, even our Nation's smallest State, \nWyoming, would recoup at least $15 million in tobacco fee payments, and \nother small States, such as North Dakota, would receive approximately \n$20 million. On the other hand, our nation's largest State, California, \ncan expect to recoup at least $1 billion. Other large States would also \nsee generous returns: Florida, $511 million; Illinois, $397 million; \nMichigan, $318 million; New York, $607 million; Ohio, $363 million; and \nTexas, $667 million.\n  Here is how much each State can expect to recover:\n\nAlabama....................................................$142,220,272\nAlaska.......................................................20,046,569\nArizona.....................................................164,079,935\nArkansas.....................................................85,496,543\nCalifornia................................................1,083,230,642\nColorado....................................................137,556,275\nConnecticut.................................................108,911,511\nDelaware.....................................................25,059,883\nDistrict of Columbia.........................................18,294,706\nFlorida.....................................................511,123,686\nGeorgia.....................................................261,806,474\nHawaii.......................................................38,745,502\nIdaho........................................................41,381,203\nIllinois....................................................397,174,614\nIndiana.....................................................194,456,664\nIowa.........................................................93,585,167\nKansas.......................................................85,976,825\nKentucky....................................................129,257,603\nLouisiana...................................................142,919,876\nMaine........................................................40,772,615\nMaryland....................................................169,384,021\nMassachusetts...............................................203,046,997\nMichigan....................................................317,835,940\nMinnesota...................................................157,327,166\nMississippi..................................................90,973,451\nMissouri....................................................178,937,382\nMontana......................................................28,852,605\nNebraska.....................................................54,726,966\nNevada.......................................................63,905,164\nNew Hampshire................................................39,520,996\nNew Jersey..................................................269,094,724\nNew Mexico...................................................58,173,915\nNew York....................................................606,875,689\nNorth Carolina..............................................257,420,675\nNorth Dakota.................................................20,537,847\nOhio........................................................363,078,559\nOklahoma....................................................110,353,478\nOregon......................................................109,417,889\nPennsylvania................................................392,753,669\nRhode Island.................................................33,525,716\nSouth Carolina..............................................128,305,961\nSouth Dakota.................................................24,140,253\nTennessee...................................................181,945,847\nTexas.......................................................666,850,647\nUtah.........................................................71,417,756\nVermont......................................................19,470,563\nVirginia....................................................226,374,115\nWashington..................................................188,496,659\nWest Virginia................................................57,831,660\nWisconsin...................................................171,532,756\nWyoming......................................................15,791,372\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and the following \nfour articles be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 887\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Little)\n\n       In 1997 and 1998, the tobacco companies settled with four \n     states who were approaching trial under agreements valued at \n     around $40 billion. This was followed in late 1998 by a \n     Master Settlement Agreement (``MSA'') wherein forty-six \n     states entered into a massive $206 billion settlement \n     agreement with the tobacco companies. In addition, the \n     tobacco companies agreed to contribute $1.5 billion to an \n     anti-smoking ``education and advertising campaign'' and $250 \n     million ``for a foundation dedicated to reducing teen \n     smoking.'' These agreements which total $246 billion are \n     reported to represent the largest privately negotiated \n     redistribution of wealth in world history. MSA further \n     obligates the tobacco companies to pay the private practice \n     attorneys hired by the settling states what has been \n     variously estimated at $8 to $10 billion in net present \n     value. Each state's legislature must pass a ``Qualifying \n     Statute'' to be eligible for the ``damage'' payments. The \n     agreement could not be fully implemented until courts in \n     eighty percent of the states ``in number and aggregate \n     damages'' has approved the settlement. The most significant \n     difference between the settlement with the states and the \n     1997 federal settlement is that the MSA confers no \n     protections on the tobacco companies from suits by smokers.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Economist, February 13, 1999]\n\n                        Knights in Golden Armour\n\n       For Americans, lawyers seem to embody extremes of both \n     heroism and greed, sometimes at the same time. A film \n     currently playing to packed cinemas across the country, ``A \n     Civil Action'', tells the true story of one crusading lawyer \n     (played by John Travolta) who bankrupted himself trying to \n     sue two big companies which had polluted a small town's \n     drinking water. But when they win, even lawyer-heroes expect \n     to be well paid. The small group of contingency-fee lawyers \n     who helped state governments bring the tobacco industry to \n     heel are about to collect fees so colossal that they dwarf \n     even the excesses of Wall Street investment bankers in the \n     mad, bad 1980s.\n       Tobacco remains a bonanza for lawyers in all kinds of ways. \n     On February 10th, a Californian jury awarded $51.5m in \n     damages against Philip Morris to a woman with inoperable lung \n     cancer. The award, by far the largest in a smoking-related \n     lawsuit, was a brusque reminder that, despite last year's \n     settlement with the states, tobacco companies remain \n     vulnerable to suits brought by individuals; and that as long \n     as smokers want compensation, lawyers will reap fortunes.\n       The legal profession is still trying to digest the \n     implications of the staggering $8.1 billion a three-man \n     arbitration panel awarded in December to lawyers for the work \n     they did in helping Florida, Mississippi and Texas win a \n     settlement from the tobacco industry for health-care costs. \n     Over the next six months, the panel is expected to use the \n     same criteria to set fees for the lawyers who represented \n     dozens of other states in the negotiations which led to a \n     national settlement last November. If they do, 250-450 lucky \n     lawyers could collect between $20 billion and $25 billion in \n     fees.\n       ``These amounts are grotesque and absurd,'' says Lester \n     Brickman, a law professor at New York's Cardozo School of \n     Law. ``Most\n\n[[Page S5243]]\n\n     of this money should have gone to the states.'' Mr Brickman, \n     an expert on legal fees, predicts that the flood of cash \n     going to a small group of trial lawyers will finance a wave \n     of mass litigation against other industries, including \n     alcohol and fast food, on similar public-health grounds. This \n     approach is already being pursued by big-city mayors against \n     gun manufacturers and distributors with the help of some of \n     the same law firms which represented the states in their \n     suits against the tobacco companies.\n       The lawyers involved in the tobacco suits insist that the \n     awards are fair, reflecting the risk they ran by taking on \n     the tobacco firms when no one, including the state attorneys-\n     general, thought they had much chance of winning. The lawyers \n     worked without pay, and as part of the settlement have now \n     agreed to submit to arbitration rather than insist on a share \n     of the money the states will receive, which is what the \n     contracts they signed with many state governments would have \n     given them. ``The fees are huge,'' admits Philip Anderson, \n     the president of the American Bar Association. ``But these \n     lawyers were able to do something that governments have never \n     been able to achieve on their own--assemble enough evidence \n     to bring the tobacco industry to account. And the fees were \n     agreed by sophisticated parties on both sides.''\n       Too much sophistication, in fact, may be the problem. \n     Unusually, neither plaintiffs nor defendants in these cases \n     seem to have had much interest in limiting the lawyers' fees. \n     Officially, these fees are being paid by the tobacco firms, \n     which spares the state attorneys-general the politically \n     embarrassing task of having to pay the lawyers huge amounts \n     of money out of their state's share of the settlement. The \n     lawyers agreed to arbitration because they knew that state \n     politicians could never have honoured their contingency \n     contracts, which would themselves have become the subject of \n     prolonged litigation. Most judges would have reduced the \n     amounts the lawyers would get.\n       In any case, the arbitration is a mere fig-leaf. The money \n     going tot he lawyers was clearly part of the overall amount \n     that the tobacco companies were willing to pay to settle the \n     case. Whatever the lawyers get, the states do not.\n       The reaction of the tobacco companies has also been \n     suspiciously muted. Brown & Williamson, one of the firms, \n     called the fee award ``obscene'', but the other companies \n     said little. One reason may be that they do not really care \n     about the size of the total fee award. Their deal with the \n     states caps the amount they must pay all the states' lawyers \n     of $500m a year. This will be divided by the lawyers \n     according to their proportions of the overall fee award. \n     Tobacco companies will also shell out another $1.25 billion \n     over the next five years to pay off those lawyers who do not \n     want to wait years to receive all their money. So the \n     companies' exposure is limited, no matter what the lawyers \n     get.\n       In effect, the lawyers are becoming joint business partners \n     with the states and the tobacco companies in leaving a tax on \n     smokers. The overall settlement has been widely misreported \n     as giving the states $206 billion. But this is only the \n     amount that they will receive in the first 25 years. The \n     settlement actually runs in perpetuity, turning the tobacco \n     firms into permanent tax-collection agencies for the states. \n     The firms have already raised prices by about 50 cents a pack \n     to pay for the settlement. The $500m they will be handing \n     over to the lawyers annually will also be paid for by \n     smokers.\n       If the total fee award to lawyers reaches $25 billion, \n     these annual payments will continue for the next 50 years. If \n     the outstanding fees are inflation-adjusted, as the \n     arbitrators decided they should be in Florida, Mississippi \n     and Texas, the payments to the lawyers and their heirs could \n     go on for ever, because the $500m annual cap will not be \n     inflation-adjusted. The tobacco firms are threatening to \n     challenge the inflation-adjustment provision in the courts \n     because they say it is not part of the national settlement \n     agreement.\n       But inflation-adjusted or not, today's smokers--70% of whom \n     earn less than $40,000 a year--will be paying the lawyers as \n     well as the states, via the tobacco companies, for the rest \n     of their (abbreviated) lives. Tobacco companies' bottom-lines \n     will barely be affected. This is why tobacco shares rose \n     after the settlement with the states was announced in \n     November and barely reacted when the first gigantic fee \n     awards to lawyers were made in December.\n       How the arbitrator came up with such a huge figure is \n     something of a mystery. The awards range from 20-35% of what \n     the three states will receive. But this is far more than the \n     8% fee agreed last May by the lawyers in Minnesota, the only \n     state actually to take its tobacco case all the way to trial.\n                                  ____\n\n\n Morales, Friend Indicted in Texas Tobacco Case--Former AG Has Denied \n            Wrongdoing; Federal Charges Include Tax Evasion\n\n             [From the Dallas Morning News, March 7, 2003]\n\n                          (By George Kuempel)\n\n       Austin.--Former Texas Attorney General Dan Morales and a \n     lawyer friend were indicted on federal charges Thursday, \n     accused of trying to defraud the state of hundreds of \n     millions in legal fees from its suit against the tobacco \n     industry.\n       Mr. Morales, a Democrat who lost a bid for governor last \n     year, also was charged with illegally converting campaign \n     funds to personal use, filing bogus income tax information \n     and falsifying a bank loan application.\n       He and Marc Murr of Houston, who also was indicted, are \n     expected to surrender to the FBI on Friday. They previously \n     have denied wrongdoing.\n       U.S. Attorney Johnny Sutton called it ``a case of an \n     elected official charged with abusing the public trust.''\n       ``This indictment alleges he violated that trust by \n     backdating contracts, forging government records and \n     converting campaign contributions to personal use,'' Mr. \n     Sutton said at the federal courthouse.\n       The 12-count indictment issued by a federal grand jury \n     stemmed from a long-running investigation into payment of \n     legal fees from the state's $17.3 billion settlement with \n     tobacco companies when Mr. Morales was attorney general in \n     1998.\n       It's a case that has been at the center of a political \n     wrangling for several years between Mr. Morales and \n     Republicans. And it comes just weeks after his brother, San \n     Antonio musician Michael Morales, pleaded guilty to \n     attempting to extort $280,000 from Democrat Tony Sanchez \n     during the campaign against Gov. Rick Perry.\n       Dan Morales, now a private lawyer in Austin, is accused of \n     fraudulently trying to secure millions of dollars in fees for \n     Mr. Murr for work on the tobacco case that he did not do by \n     backdating contracts and forging government documents.\n       The indictments of Dan Morales and Marc Murr are another \n     chapter in Texas' landmark $17.3 billion settlement with \n     tobacco companies that has included twists, turns and \n     reversals.\n       Initial debate: Gov. George W. Bush and state Attorney \n     General John Cornyn, both Republicans, complained about $3.3 \n     billion paid to five attorneys for their work on the 1998 \n     settlement. Added intrigue: Mr. Morales said his friend Marc \n     Murr of Houston was also among the state's tobacco lawyers \n     and was due about $500 million. Mr. Morales had publicly \n     hired the five private attorneys and disclosed their \n     contracts; the deal with Mr. Murr was initially secret.\n       The Murr deal: Mr. Morales said Mr. Murr was hired to be a \n     watchdog over the other lawyers and to advise him during the \n     litigation. The other lawyers initially said that they had \n     never heard of Mr. Murr, and later said he did little or no \n     work on the case.\n       The initial inquiries: Mr. Cornyn, who succeeded Mr. \n     Morales as attorney general in 1999, began investigating the \n     Murr contract. Federal investigators started their inquiry \n     into the deals and the documents.\n       The Murr money: In December 1998, Mr. Murr went before a \n     national arbitration panel and was awarded $1 million over 30 \n     years from tobacco companies. Unbeknownst to the other \n     tobacco lawyers, Mr. Morales and Mr. Murr also formed a state \n     arbitration panel in September 1998 that gave Mr. Murr $260 \n     million--an award he contended was binding. He cited a Jan. \n     31, 1997, contract with the state as evidence.\n       Cornyn objects: In May 1999, Mr. Cornyn said that the Jan. \n     31, 1997, contract between Mr. Morales and Mr. Murr was a \n     fake and did not exist when it supposedly was signed.\n       Sudden reversal: In U.S. District Court, Mr. Murr's \n     attorney dropped the $260 million claim on May 6, 1999. Mr. \n     Murr's attorney also told the court that at least one of the \n     contracts signed by his client and Mr. Morales was backdated \n     by as much as a year. Mr. Morales had denied any manipulation \n     of the contract. He said the investigations are spawned by \n     partisan political attacks.\n       Mr. Morales is reported to have hired Mr. Murr without the \n     knowledge of the team of five high-profile trial lawyers he \n     contracted to represent the state in its lawsuit against the \n     big tobacco companies.\n       At one time, Mr. Murr stood to receive $520 million as his \n     share of the $3.3 billion in fees awarded to the lawyers in \n     the case.\n       His share was later reduced to $1 million, but he gave up \n     his claim to the money when allegations arose that he had \n     done no work on the case.\n       According to the indictment, Mr. Morales and Mr. Murr \n     ``fabricated an outside counsel agreement, backdated to \n     January 31, 1997, which purportedly required the State to pay \n     a reasonable fee to Defendant Murr's corporation.''\n       As part of the ``scheme,'' the two men fabricated another \n     outside counsel agreement, backdated to Oct. 17, 1996, which \n     assigned 3 percent of the state's recovery to Mr. Murr's \n     corporation.\n       ``Defendant Morales directed a state employee to type and \n     then backdate the bogus agreement. Three percent of the \n     state's recovery was estimated to be $520 million,'' \n     according to the indictment.\n       In May 1999, two forensic experts hired by The Dallas \n     Morning News said that the Morales-Murr contract shows \n     evidence of ``severe document manipulation.''\n       The private lawyers who handled the tobacco case were John \n     Quinn and John Eddie Williams of Houston, Walter Umphrey and \n     Wayne Reaud of Beaumont, and Harold Nix of Daingerfield. They \n     have defended their actions in the case.\n       Mr. Morales surprised some when he announced plans in 1995 \n     to sue several big tobacco companies to help recover the \n     state's cost of treating patients suffering from tobacco-\n     related illnesses.\n       But questions were raised about the fees by Republicans, \n     including John Cornyn, who became attorney general in 1999 \n     after Mr. Morales decided not to run again.\n\n[[Page S5244]]\n\n       Mr. Cornyn began a state investigation, and Andy Taylor, a \n     former assistant attorney general who headed that said of Mr. \n     Morales: ``He's toast.\n       ``We looked at the computer hard drives and could tell to \n     the second when the backdating on the contracts occurred.''\n       Mr. Taylor, a Houston lawyer, said prosecutors have \n     informed him that he will be called as a witness in the case. \n     He said delays in the indictment probably were because of the \n     lack of a permanent U.S. attorney for months before Mr. \n     Sutton's appointment and confirmation.\n       Mr. Morales had slammed the inquiry as politically \n     motivated. ``There's not one shred of evidence or a single \n     document to support these lurid accusations.'' he said in \n     1999.\n       Micheal Ramsey, an attorney for Mr. Murr, said Thursday of \n     the charges, ``My initial take is that it's unfair.''\n       Both men are accused of conspiracy and mail fraud, which \n     can carry a penalty of up to five years in prison and a \n     $250,000 fine.\n       The indictment also charges that Mr. Morales used $400,000 \n     in campaign donations to buy a $775,000 house in Travis \n     County and he is accused of understating by $400,000 his \n     liabilities in applying for a $600,000 loan in 1999.\n       Making a false application on a loan application is a \n     charge punishable by up to 30 years in prison and a $1 \n     million fine.\n       According to the indictments, Mr. Morales defrauded the \n     state, the Texas Ethics Commission, his contributors and \n     others from 1997 and 1999 by converting political donations \n     to personal use.\n       He is charged in another court with making false statements \n     on his 1998 federal income tax return.\n       The indictment alleges that in his joint return filed with \n     his wife, Mr. Morales listed their taxable income as $39,734 \n     when he knew full well that ``their joint taxable income was \n     substantially in excess'' of that amount.\n\n\n                              THE CHARGES\n\n       Charges against former Attorney General Dan Morales include \n     accusations that he:\n       Fraudulently tried to funnel $260 million in legal fees \n     from the state tobacco case to a friend, who also was \n     indicted.\n       Illegally converted nearly $400,000 in campaign \n     contributions to his personal use.\n       Made false statements to get a $600,000 mortgage for his \n     Travis County house.\n       Filed a false tax return that understated his taxable \n     income for 1998.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, March 10, 2003]\n\n                           Faust in Texas II\n\n       The indictment of former Texas Attorney General Dan Morales \n     lifts the lid ever so slightly over one of the mysteriously \n     ignored scandals of the 1990s. We mean the national tobacco \n     settlement that turned into a $500 million-a-year tax for the \n     benefit of private tort lawyers.\n       That's the amount the tobacco companies agreed to pay in \n     ``fees'' to private attorneys appointed by the state \n     politicos on contingency. Four years later, an itinerant \n     panel of three ``arbitrators'' is still moving from state to \n     state to decide how this revenue stream, roughly a present \n     value of $8 billion, will be divvied up.\n       Texas was crucial to starting the landslide toward a \n     national settlement, and Mr. Morales selected the five \n     lawyers who handled the state's case and would eventually \n     receive an astounding $3.3 billion in fees. How these five \n     were picked, though no part of last week's indictment, is an \n     untold story in itself. Houston lawyer Joe Jamail, who waved \n     off a chance to participate, told a grand jury Mr. Morales \n     had demanded a $1 million gratuity to be named to the case.\n       Never mind. A million bucks would soon appear a hilariously \n     trivial sum compared to the monumental fees the tobacco \n     lawyers would receive. Seeing the sums that were up for grabs \n     after the settlement was reached, Mr. Morales produced out of \n     the blue a friend, lawyer Marc Murr, whom he claimed was \n     entitled to $520 million. Mr. Morales even turned up a \n     document, never seen before, testifying to a fee agreement.\n       The five private lawyers were apoplectic, insisting Mr. \n     Murr had done little work and implying the contract was a \n     forgery. Mr. Morales quickly retreated. He did not seek a \n     third term as attorney general.\n       The Murr episode had not been forgotten, however, and last \n     week the U.S. Attorney's office in Austin brought charges \n     against Mr. Morales for making false statements and \n     concealing documents in an effort to enrich his friend. Mr. \n     Murr was also indicted.\n       Hallelujah. We can only hope this proves a sideshow to the \n     main event. Mr. Jamail's allegations about how Mr. Morales \n     picked the other five attorneys reportedly have been seconded \n     by two other witnesses before a grand jury. Virtually \n     overlooked has been the role of lawyer Walter Umphrey, one of \n     the biggest beneficiaries of the tobacco settlement, in \n     naming the supposedly ``independent'' chairman of the \n     national arbitration panel that is still awarding millions of \n     dollars in fees.\n       A shameful episode, the tobacco settlement essentially \n     enacted a national sales tax outside any legislature and \n     awarded a big chunk of the proceeds to private campaign \n     contributors of the attorneys general who brought the suit. \n     So vast have been the rewards, in publicity and money, that \n     the AGs have now turned themselves into full-time buccaneers-\n     in-arms of the private tort bar, preying on one industry \n     after another in search of more such triumphs.\n       Belated accountability is better than none. We just hope \n     prosecutors and grand juries won't stop with the Murr case.\n                                  ____\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, Senator \nKyl, to introduce today this landmark legislation to clean up our civil \njustice system. This legislation would enact a badly needed reform to \nthe way in which attorneys are paid in some of the Nation's largest \ncases. It is designed to address some of the worst abuses of our civil \njustice system that I have witnessed in my nearly thirty years in the \nlegal profession as a lawyer in private practice, as a state trial and \nappellate judge, and as state attorney general.\n  This legislation, the Intermediate Sanctions Compensatory Revenue \nAdjustment Act of 2003, ISCRAA, will combat the gross abuse of attorney \ncontingent fee agreements, abuses which we have been witnessing at an \nincreasing rate in recent years. The legislation will enforce \nattorneys' fiduciary duties to their clients in a small but important \ncategory of cases--those resulting in judgments greater than $100 \nmillion.\n  Contingent fee agreements can have an important role to play in our \ncivil justice system. Sometimes, when people are injured but cannot \nafford to hire lawyers out of their own pockets, attorneys will accept \nthe case with the expectation that, if their clients prevail, the \nattorney will be paid for his or her services out of the judgment or \nsettlement that the attorney is able to secure for the client. Such \nagreements between attorneys and their clients are called contingent \nfee agreements, because the attorney's fee is contingent on the client \nobtaining a money judgment or settlement. Contingent fee agreements, \nproperly understood and utilized, reward attorneys for their work in \nobtaining monetary recovery for their clients, and the risk that they \ntake that, despite their hard work and best efforts, they are unable to \nobtain any recovery for the client at all.\n  Contingent fees can thus help ensure that plaintiffs with legitimate \nclaims have the opportunity to obtain justice from our courts through \nthe assistance of counsel. But contingent fees also present serious \nethical problems for our legal system--particularly in cases in which \nthe dollar amounts at stake are extraordinary, and result in a \ncontingent fee award that overwhelmingly exceeds the relatively light \nor even negligible effort and risk actually undertaken by the \nattorneys.\n  Under the time-tested traditions of our legal system, clients hire \nattorneys with the understanding and expectation that the attorney is \nethically, legally, and morally obliged to represent their best \ninterests, and that the attorney will use his or her legal skills in \norder to produce the best possible result--not for the attorney, but \nfor the client.\n  Thus, as my colleague has noted, contingent fee agreements are no \nordinary agreements between consumers and businesses. It is a bedrock \nprinciple and well-established tenet of our Anglo-American system of \njustice that attorneys are not ordinary businessmen who can engage in \nhard bargaining with their customers, as courts have made clear on \ncountless occasions. Rather, attorneys are officers of the court who \nbear a fiduciary duty to their clients. As fiduciaries, attorneys \noccupy a position of trust in their dealings with their clients, a \ntrust which attorneys may not lawfully abuse.\n  One obligation that flows from this status as a fiduciary is the \nattorney's obligation not to charge an unreasonable or excessive fee. \nThis obligation is a fundamental part of an attorney's ethical duties, \nuniversally recognized in the ethics rules of all 50 States. Courts \nhave made clear, time and time again, that every attorney fee contract \nautomatically and necessarily includes the requirement that the fee be \na reasonable one, a fundamental and basic duty of all attorneys, and \none that no provision of such agreements may abrogate.\n  ISCRAA affirms and reinforces the longstanding substantive law of \nattorneys' fiduciary duties, by providing a special mechanism to \nenforce those duties in a particularly high risk category of cases--a \ncategory that the courts themselves have singled out as posing special \nrisks of unethical, windfall fees. Courts have noted that allowing \nstandard contingency fee agreements in cases involving judgments of\n\n[[Page S5245]]\n\n$100 million or more have a distinct tendency of grossly \novercompensating attorneys for their actual services rendered.\n  ISCRAA prevents attorneys from evading their obligation to charge a \nreasonable fee in extraordinarily large recovery cases, by effectively \nlimiting awards to a generous multiple of reasonable hourly fees. State \ncourts, Federal courts, and even trial lawyers' themselves have all \nrecognized that a reasonable fee must be proportional to the attorney's \nactual efforts. ISCRAA codifies and enforces this principle, while \ncontinuing to guarantee lawyers ample and generous compensation for \ntheir efforts--using fee multipliers that are as generous as the most \nliberal limits adopted by state courts, and which are considerably more \ngenerous than the limits set by federal courts in $100 million cases.\n  This legislation thus promises to clean up our civil justice system \nand to repudiate the grossest abuses of our legal system. Make no \nmistake: Although all attorneys are supposed to uphold a strict ethical \ncode, under which they are strictly forbidden from charging their \nclients unreasonable or excessive attorney fees, the temptation to \nabuse contingent fee agreements is a strong one, and even more so when \nthe dollar amounts are truly extraordinary--such as in the $100 million \ncases that would be covered by this legislation. And make no mistake: \nthe victim of such attorney fee abuse, and the beneficiary of this \nlegislation, is not the defendant who pays the judgment--after all, the \ndefendant pays the same total amount whether the money goes to the \nattorney or to the client. Rather, the real victim of this abuse, and \nthe real beneficiary of this legislation, is the injured client, whose \nmoney is being taken away from the lawyer through an abusive contingent \nfee arrangement.\n  As my colleague has also noted, ISCRAA is unquestionably an \nappropriate exercise of Congress's power to regulate and protect \ninterstate commerce, considering the large size of the litigations to \nwhich it applies. $100 million is a standard threshold used by the \nfederal government to determine whether an economic transaction \nsignificantly affects interstate commerce.\n\n  But the most important reason for federal intervention in this area I \nhave not yet mentioned, and I would like to take a moment to discuss it \nhere: the gross abuses that we have already witnessed in large \nlitigation fee awards. Recent experience amply demonstrates that, if \nthe Federal Government does not act to prevent unethical and grossly \nabusive fee awards in massive, nationwide lawsuits, no one will. \nMoreover, recent experience further demonstrates that unreasonable fee \npayments in such suits threaten not just the attorneys' fiduciary \nobligations; they also place at risk the integrity of our governmental \ninstitutions. The unwholesome incentives created by windfall, unethical \nfee awards in large-scale litigations have induced some public \nofficials to abandon their civic obligations.\n  The textbook example of the types of abuses that make ISCRAA \nnecessary is the attorney fee arrangement awarded in the State lawsuits \nto recover tobacco-related Medicaid expenses. Individual law firms that \nrepresented the States in that litigation have been given hundreds of \nmillions and sometimes even billions of dollars in fees. To date, \napproximately $15 billion in fees has been awarded to the tobacco \nsettlement lawyers, to be paid out in $500-million-a-year increments. \nAttorneys representing just three of the States--Mississippi, Texas, \nand Florida--were awarded $8.2 billion in fees. In many cases, such \nfees were paid to attorneys who filed duplicate, copycat lawsuits at a \ntime when settlement negotiations had already begun and the risk that \nthe states would not recover any money was negligible. Yet these \nlawyers nevertheless received massive contingency fees, for suits that \ninvolved no real contingency. And for most of the tobacco settlement \nlawyers, the size of the fee awards bears no reasonable relation to the \nactual effort expended or risk involved.\n  There is widespread agreement that the fees awarded in the tobacco \nsettlement are excessive and unreasonable. Perhaps the most damning \nindictments come from those who took the plaintiffs' side in this \nlitigation--including from plaintiff lawyers themselves. For example, \nMichael Ciresi, a pioneer in the tobacco litigation who represented the \nstate of Minnesota in its lawsuit, and who is no doubt familiar with \nwhat these lawsuits actually require, has said that the Texas, Florida, \nand Mississippi lawyers' fee awards ``are far in excess of these \nlawyers' contribution to any of the state results.'' Similarly, former \nFood and Drug Administration Commissioner David Kessler, another leader \nin the fight against tobacco, has said that the states' private lawyers \n``did a real service, but I think the fee is outrageous. All the legal \nfees are out control.'' Washington, D.C. lawyer and tobacco-industry \nopponent John Coale has denounced the fee awards as ``beyond human \ncomprehension'' and stated that ``the work does not justify them.'' \nEven the Association of American Trial Lawyers, the nation's premier \nrepresentative of the plaintiffs bar, has condemned attorney fees \nrequested in the state tobacco settlement. The President of ATLA has \nnoted: ``Common sense suggests that a one billion dollar fee is \nexcessive and unreasonable and certainly should invite the scrutiny, of \nthe courts. ATLA generally refrains from expressing an institutional \nopinion regarding a particular fee in a particular case, but we have a \nstrong negative reaction to reports that at least one attorney on \nbehalf of the plaintiffs in the Florida case is seeking a fee in excess \nof one billion dollars.''\n  This letter, written in 1997, only concerned one of the Florida \nlawyers' request for attorney fees. Ultimately, Florida's private \ncounsel was awarded a total of $3.4 billion in fees. These statements \ndemonstrate beyond all doubt that there is real abuse going on here, \nand that the victim of this abuse is the client, the plaintiff--and not \nthe defendant.\n  Perhaps the best gloss on the tobacco fee awards is that provided by \nProfessor Lester Brickman, a professor of law at Cardozo Law School and \nnoted authority on legal ethics and attorney fees. Professor Brickman \nhas stated:\n  ``Under the rules of legal ethics, promulgated partly as a \njustification for the legal profession's self-governance, fees cannot \nbe `clearly excessive.' Indeed, that standard has now been superseded \nin most States by an even more rigorous standard: fees have to be \n`reasonable.' Are these fees, which in many cases amount to effective \nhourly rates of return of tens of thousands--and even hundreds of \nthousands--of dollars an hour, reasonable? I think to ask the question \nis to answer it.''\n  The attorney fees awarded in the state tobacco settlement are simply \nindefensible. And the process by which the fees were awarded partly \nexplains how they came to be so. Outside counsel fees were determined \nby a private arbitration panel established by the Master Settlement \nAgreement, MSA, that resolved 46 of the states' litigation. Four other \nstates had settled their suits earlier. Their lawyers, however, also \nwere paid out of the accounts created by the MSA. Amazingly, the \nsettlement agreement explicitly immunized all fee awards from judicial \nreview. Even more amazingly, one of the three arbitrators who made the \nawards had a clear conflict of interests: he was the father of a South \nCarolina lawyer whose law firm has received the largest fee awards of \nall, believed to amount to over $2 billion. Another one of the \narbitrators had no background in fee arbitrations or any related \nmatter, and simply ignored the law in order to make outrageous awards, \nusing the salaries of sports stars and entertainers as a basis of \nmeasure. Revealingly, the third arbitrator, a retired Federal judge \nappointed by President Carter, dissented from the key fee decisions.\n  As incredible as the MSA fee awards and the arbitration procedures \nmay seem, even more dubious is the process by which many of the law \nfirms that participated in this lucrative litigation were selected in \nthe first place to represent the states.\n  In my home State of Texas, trial lawyers have accused the then-state \nattorney general of demanding $1 million in campaign contributions in \nexchange for their being hired to represent the state in the tobacco \nlitigation. One prominent lawyer--a former president of the Texas Trial \nLawyers Association--has since said that the attorney general's \nsolicitation was so blatant that ``I knew th[at] instant . . . that I\n\n[[Page S5246]]\n\ncould not be involved in the matter.'' He even later wondered if the \nmeeting had been a ``sting operation.'' Another lawyer simply \ncharacterized his encounter with the attorney general as a bribery \nsolicitation.\n  This former Texas attorney general was recently indicted on Federal \ncharges of attempting to fraudulently divert $260 million in tobacco-\nsettlement legal fees to one of his personal friends. He had given a \nsworn affidavit that this lawyer had served as Texas' ``primary \nadviser'' in its tobacco lawsuit--despite the apparent fact that the \nlawyer had attended no court hearings, depositions, or strategy \nmeetings, wrote no memos or legal briefs about the case, and apparently \nnever even spoke to any of the other attorneys. The attorney general \neven went so far as to forge and fraudulently backdate documents in \norder to win his friend a share of the tobacco settlement fee.\n\n  As for the five law firms that actually did represent Texas in the \ntobacco litigation, they filed relatively late lawsuits that were based \non other lawyers' work--and yet, despite the minimal energy expended on \nthose suits, were awarded $3.3 billion in attorney fees. This award \namounts to compensation that, even assuming that the attorneys worked \nall day every day during the entire period of the litigation, remains \nwell in excess of $100,000 an hour. As one newspaper editorial has \nnoted, for the amount of money that these lawyers were awarded, Texas \ncould hire 10,000 additional teachers or policemen for ten years. \nInstead, four of these firms gave the attorney general $150,000 in \ncampaign contributions in recent years.\n  Texas' experience is not an isolated example. In other states as \nwell, lawyers' participation in the tobacco litigation appears to have \nbeen the product of political favoritism--and to have resulted in \nunfathomable fees that bear no reasonable relation to the services \nprovided. For example: New Jersey: The private in-state lawyers who \nrepresented this state in the tobacco litigation have admitted that \nthey had no mass-tort litigation experience and played no role in the \nstate settlement talks. They have also admitted that all the key work \nin the state's lawsuit was done by out-of-state firms--the in-state \nfirms' principal work was drafting pro hac vice motions to have these \noutside lawyers admitted in New Jersey courts. Any work that the New \nJersey lawyers did was submitted to the outside lawyers, who made all \nof the substantive arguments. Result: these in-state lawyers were \nawarded $350 million in the MSA fee arbitration. Connections: the New \nJersey lawyers were an inside group of past presidents of the New \nJersey trial lawyers' association. The State refused to even consider \nhiring a nonprofit firm to conduct the New Jersey lawsuit.\n  Pennsylvania: Settlement talks had already begun, the states' tobacco \nlitigation was being resolved, and all of the legal theories already \nhad been developed long before the Pennsylvania state suit was filed. \nResult: Pennsylvania's private lawyers were awarded $50 million in the \nMSA arbitration--equivalent to 1000 percent of a reasonable hourly \nrate. As one expert has noted, ``there's not $50 million of work in \nthere.'' Connections: the two law firms that the state Attorney General \nselected to conduct the litigation were among his top campaign \ncontributors. The firms were awarded no-bid contracts. As one \nPennsylvania commentator has noted, ``obviously, it was a political \nkind of thing.''\n  Maryland: Billionaire tort lawyer Peter Angelos demanded a one \nbillion dollar fee for his work on that State's case, even though, \naccording to the State Senate President, the State legislature had \nretroactively ``changed centuries of precedent to ensure [Angelos] a \nwin in the case.'' Angelos ultimately received an accelerated $150 \nmillion payment for this no-risk lawsuit.\n  Louisiana: The private law firms that represented the State in the \ntobacco litigation were awarded $575 million. The MSA arbitration panel \nactually increased this award on the ground that the State government--\nthe lawyers' supposed client--was opposed to suing tobacco companies. \nThe Louisiana fee award amounts to almost $7,000 an hour, based on the \nlawyers' estimate that they worked a total 85,000 hours. Moreover, this \nestimate is unverifiable, because the state's private lawyers kept no \nbilling records--as the attorney general explained, ``I wasn't that big \non hourly or written reports.'' The dissenting member of the \narbitration panel simply noted that the Louisiana fee award ``shocks \nthe conscience'' The single biggest beneficiary of this largesse--\nreceiving $115 million in attorney fees--was a law firm based in Lake \nCharles, the hometown of the state's attorney general. This firm and \nthe next largest fee recipient had donated over $42,000 to the attorney \ngeneral's political campaigns. Together, all of the firms that \nrepresented Louisiana gave more than $100,000 to the attorney general \nin the years before they were selected to participate in the state's \ntobacco team.\n  Ohio: The lawyers representing this State received fees estimated to \nexceed $50,000 per hour, despite the fact that, according to \nindependent observers, ``all of the legal issues were resolved long \nbefore these Ohio lawyers stepped up to the plate.'' The state's \noutside counsel had donated $26,000 in campaign contributions to the \nState attorney general prior to their appointment to the state's \ntobacco team. After the attorney general chose one private lawyer to \nserve as the state's ``lead special counsel,'' that lawyer hired one of \nthe attorney general's top aides for an undisclosed sum in order to--in \nthe lawyer's own words--``help me get acquainted with a technique \ncalled PowerPoint.'' When told that ``there were many people in Ohio \ncapable of doing a PowerPoint presentation,'' the state's outside \ncounsel responded that this particular attorney general's aide ``was \nthe only one I knew of.''\n  Massachusetts: According to other tobacco plaintiffs' lawyers, \nMassachusetts's suit piggybacked on the work of other lawyers and was \nnot pivotal to the outcome of the tobacco litigation. Result: $775 \nmillion was awarded to the Massachusetts lawyers in the MSA \narbitration.\n  New York: When this State's then-attorney general hired private \ncounsel to represent the State in its tobacco lawsuit, tobacco \ncompanies already had paid $15 billion to Florida and Mississippi for \nidentical claims and a national settlement agreement already was under \ndiscussion. As one local anti-tobacco leader has noted, ``these were \ncopycat lawsuits, there wasn't all that much work to do.'' The firms' \nprimary job was to collect New York-specific data in order to calculate \ndamages. Ultimately, the New York firms represented the State for just \n13 months. And they received a fee award of $625 million. This amounts \nto at least $14,000 an hour, for a lawsuit that by all accounts \ninvolved no risk. The dissenting member of the arbitration panel has \ndenounced the award as ``an astronomical sum unrelated to, the \nattorneys', efforts or achievements.'' The New York firms had \ncontributed more than $250,000 to New York politicians and their \ncampaign organizations in the years preceding their selection - and \nanother $200,000 after the State settlement.\n  Wisconsin: The Wisconsin lawyers' tobacco litigation work has been \ndescribed as chiefly consisting of media and public relations efforts \non their own behalf. Their billing records included time spent \nselecting office space and buying furniture. One lawyer effectively \nbilled $3,000 to the State for reading an article in a Madison \nnewspaper. The lawyers also billed the State for limousine rides around \nthe state, trips on private jets, and stays at luxury hotels. Result: \n$75 million was awarded to the Wisconsin lawyers. Based on the law \nfirms' records of the total number of hours they devoted to the case--\nincluding work by paralegals--this fee amounts to $3,000 per hour.\n  Missouri: A State supreme court justice in Missouri resigned his post \nin order to join one of the private law firms expected to receive a \nportion of the MSA arbitrators' fee award. Ultimately, the firms \nrepresenting the State spent just 5 months on the state's lawsuit. They \nreceived a fee award of $111 million. One State leader has described \nthe award as ``the biggest rip-off in the 180-year history of the \nstate.'' The law firms receiving these fees had donated more than \n$500,000 to State politicians and parties in the years leading up to \ntheir selection as the State's outside counsel.\n\n[[Page S5247]]\n\n  These examples are too numerous to dismiss. In State after State, the \ntemptations created by the massive, windfall fees awarded in the \nMedicaid tobacco settlement corrupted not only lawyers involved, but \nthe government as well. The fee awards poisoned everything that they \ntouched. No one who examines these events closely--who surveys the \nobscene fee awards, and the political cronyism that determined who \nbenefited--can disagree that this must never be allowed to happen \nagain.\n  As a final point, I would like to address a question that has been \nraised with regard to remedy. Some have argued that nothing can be done \nto correct the excesses of the tobacco settlement fee awards--even with \nregard to fees that are still being or have yet to be paid. On several \noccasions, State judges who were called upon to approve their State's \ntobacco settlement have also, on their own initiative, inquired into \nthe apparent unreasonableness of the fees awarded. In each case, both \nthe plaintiffs' lawyers--and in some cases, even State officials--have \nchallenged the State courts' authority to act. They have argued that \nthese courts lack jurisdiction to review a national settlement, and \nthat excessive fees cannot be restored to the State. One state's \nattorney general implicated in these events has argued that it is a \n``misconception'' that the tobacco settlement ``attorneys' fees are \ncoming out of the public's pocket. That is not the case. They [sic] \ndefendants have agreed to pay these fees.''\n  Because of the way that the MSA fee payments are structured, no \nlawyer's award comes out of any one particular, identifiable State's \nrecovery. Instead, all of the lawyers are being paid from one of two \nseparate accounts, each of which is funded by the tobacco companies.\n  It is a mistake, however, to contend that, because the MSA fee \npayments are made directly from defendants to plaintiffs' lawyers--\nwithout ever formally or actually passing through the plaintiffs' \nhands--they are immunized against ethical scrutiny or correction. It is \nwell and long established in our law that fee awards originate as the \nproperty of the client regardless of how the fee agreements are \nstructured. The courts have been very clear on this point. As they have \nstated: ``The allowance of attorney fees in a judgment gives the \nattorneys no interest and ownership in the judgment to the extent of \nthe amount of the fee allowed, but the judgment in its entirety is the \nproperty of the client. The award for fees is for the client, not the \nattorney.''\n  ``[A]ttorneys' fee provisions exist for the benefit of parties and \nnot the attorneys. . . . Several jurisdictions have noted that the real \nparty in interest with regard to fees is the client and not the \nattorney.''\n  ``A judgment for costs is a judgment in favor of the party, and not \nof his attorney, and the money represented by the costs is the property \nof the party.''\n  ``[T]he award of attorney fees [is] made not to the attorneys but to \nthe litigant who was personally liable to the attorneys. This is also \nthe view in other states when the courts award attorney fees.''\n  ``An award of attorney's fees belongs to the client and not the \nattorney.''\n  Indeed, an award of attorney fees is generally taxable as income to \nthe client. In a recent case, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth \nCircuit noted that a plaintiff's obligation to compensate the law firm \nthat represented him ``was satisfied by [the defendant]. The payment \nwas therefore to [the client]. The discharge by a third person of an \nobligation to him is equivalent to receipt by the person taxed.'' The \nNinth Circuit emphasized that the fact ``[t]hat [the client] never laid \nhands on the money paid to the lawyers does not obliterate their \nconstructive receipt.'' In other words, the fee award belongs to the \nclient, regardless of how the award is made.\n  The rule that fee awards belong to the client is strongly supported \nby important policy considerations. It is necessary because any other \nrule would be an invitation to collusion and self-dealing between \nplaintiffs' lawyers and defendants. Again, the courts have been very \nclear on this point. As the Third Circuit has noted: ``[A] defendant is \ninterested only in disposing of the total claims asserted against it, \nand the allocation between the [plaintiff's] payment and the attorneys' \nfees is of little or no interest to the defense. Moreover, the \ndivergence in class members' and class counsel's financial incentives \ncreates the danger that the lawyers might urge a class settlement at a \nlow figure or on a less-than-optimal basis in exchange for red-carpet \ntreatment for fees.''\n  The Second Circuit has made the same point, noting: ``Defendants, \nonce the settlement amount has been agreed to, have little interest in \nhow it is distributed and thus no incentive to oppose the [attorneys] \nfee. Indeed, the same dynamic creates incentives for collusion--the \ntemptation for lawyers to agree to a less than optimal settlement in \nexchange for [generous fees].''\n  The Ninth Circuit has also addressed the question of ``whether a \nclass member has standing to appeal class counsel's attorney fee and \ncost award when that award is payable by the defendant independently, \nand not out of the class settlement.'' The court concluded that \n``[e]ven if class counsel's attorney fees are not to be paid from the \nclass settlement . . . , the aggregate amount of the attorney fees and \nthe class settlement payments may be viewed as ``a constructive common \nfund.'' The court reasoned that ``[i]f . . . class counsel agreed to \naccept excessive fees and costs to the detriment of class plaintiffs, \nthen class counsel breached their fiduciary duty to the class. If that \nwere the case, any excessive award could be considered property of the \nclass plaintiffs, and any injury they suffered could be at least \npartially redressed by allocating to them a portion of that award.''\n  As several commentators have noted, the policy considerations \nunderpinning the rule that fee awards belong to the client apply with \nfull force to the State tobacco settlement. Indeed, that settlement \ncould serve as a textbook example for why this rule exists. As \nProfessor Brickman has noted: ``To the tobacco companies, dollars are \ndollars, whether paid to States or paid to lawyers. So the real amount \non the bargaining table was not the $246 billion that the states \nsettled for, but a larger sum, including the amount to be paid to the \nattorneys. . . . Stated simply, because dollars are fungible, the fees \nare coming out of the settlements.''\n  Even foreign commentators have noted that the State tobacco \nsettlement's ``arbitration is a mere figleaf. The money going to the \nlawyers was clearly part of the overall amount that the tobacco \ncompanies were willing to pay to settle the case. Whatever the lawyers \nget, the states do not.''\n  And this point has not been lost upon members of Congress. \nRepresentative Chris Cox, R-CA, has testified on the matter: ``It is \nspecious to argue that, billions of dollars, in fees are not being \ndiverted out of funds available for public health and taxpayers. The \ntobacco industry is willing to pay a certain sum to get rid of these \ncases. That sum is the total cost of the payment to the plaintiffs and \ntheir lawyers. It is a matter of indifference to the industry how that \nsum is divided--75 percent for the plaintiffs and 25 percent for their \nlawyers, or vice versa. That means that every penny paid to the \nplaintiffs' lawyers--whether it is technically ``in'' the settlement or \nnot--is money that the industry could have paid to the state or the \nprivate plaintiffs. Excessive attorneys' fees in this case will not be \na victimless crime.''\n  These authorities and their reasoning should be more than sufficient \nto permanently dispel the notion that an attorney fee agreement can be \nstructured so as to evade the ethical obligation to charge only a \nreasonable fee. The defenders of the MSA fee payments are simply \nmisleading the public and this distinguished body when they assert that \na particular lawyer's award under the settlement does not come out of a \nparticular state's recovery. That fee comes out of all of the State's \nrecoveries. All excessive or unreasonable fees should be restored to \nall 50 of the States.\n  Senator Kyl has already presented estimates of the monetary recovery \neach State can expect if ISCRAA is enacted. I would simply point out \nhere that, according to those estimates, Texas has been charged \nexcessive and unreasonable attorney fees in the amount of $667 million, \nand therefore would recover those funds if this legislation is adopted.\n  ISCRAA's return of unethical tobacco-settlement fee awards to the\n\n[[Page S5248]]\n\nstates is manifestly proper in light of the fact that all fee awards \nare the property of the client, and the attorney is entitled only to a \nreasonable fee. No attorney is above these ethical rules and \nobligations. They cannot be waived or ignored. And in light of our \nexperience with the State tobacco settlement fee awards, and their \neffect on our public officials, these ethical duties must be carried \nout and enforced strictly and fully.\n  Our Federal and State courts generally do a good job of protecting \nconsumers and enforcing the rights of all Americans. But there are \nproblems in our courts that require attention and significant reform. \nClass action abuse not only threatens the integrity and the perception \nof rationality in our nation's courts, it also strongly hinders \neconomic and job growth. Tort reform is badly needed to rescue many \nindustries, especially our health care industry, from abuses of our \nlegal system. The judicial confirmation process at the federal level \nhas become bitter, severe and destructive, and that broken process \nposes a serious threat to judicial independence and the quality and \nefficiency of our courts. And abusive attorney fee arrangements make a \nmockery of our civil justice system, all while enriching a small band \nof unscrupulous litigators at the expense of the real victims, their \nclients.\n  To enforce the longstanding fiduciary duty of all attorneys to charge \nonly a reasonable fee, in a class of cases that poses heightened risks \nof abuse and special significance to the national economy, I urge that \nthis Senate consider expediently, and approve quickly, this important \nmeasure, the Intermediate Sanctions Compensatory Revenue Adjustment Act \nof 2003.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/10/senate-section/article/S5248-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5248]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 118--SUPPORTING THE GOALS OF THE JAPANESE AMERICAN, \n  GERMAN AMERICAN, AND ITALIAN AMERICAN COMMUNITIES IN RECOGNIZING A \nNATIONAL DAY OF REMEMBRANCE TO INCREASE PUBLIC AWARENESS OF THE EVENTS \n SURROUNDING THE RESTRICTION, EXCLUSION, AND INTERNMENT OF INDIVIDUALS \n                    AND FAMILIES DURING WORLD WAR II\n\n  Mrs. BOXER submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, today I am submitting a resolution to \nsupport the goals of the Japanese American, German American and Italian \nAmerican communities in recognizing a ``National Day of Remembrance.'' \nThis resolution will increase public awareness of the events \nsurrounding the restriction, exclusion and internment of individuals \nand families during World War II.\n  On February 11, 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed \nExecutive Order 9066, which authorized the incarceration of over \n120,000 Americans of Japanese, Italian and German ancestry. Not until \n34 years later--on February 19, 1976--was E.O. 9066 formally rescinded \nby President Gerald Ford.\n  Since then, Congress and Presidents Carter, Reagan, and Clinton have \nrecognized the ``fundamental violation of the basic civil liberties and \nconstitutional rights'' of individuals detained and interned under E.O. \n9066. The Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians \nestablished by Congress under President Carter concluded that the \ndecision to issue E.O. 9066 was shaped by ``race prejudice, war \nhysteria, and a failure of political leadership.''\n  In the last half century, organizations, families and individuals all \nover the country have observed a day of remembrance on February 19 to \neducate others of the distinct experiences of Japanese, Italian, and \nGerman Americans during World War II. Congressional recognition of this \n``National Day of Remembrance'' would assist in promoting dialogue and \neducation of Americans on this very important event in our history.\n  We need to recognize and support the efforts to raise awareness of \nthe experiences of interned Americans. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/10/senate-section/article/S5248-2", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5248-S5249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 119--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THERE \n  SHOULD BE PARITY AMONG THE COUNTRIES THAT ARE PARTIES TO THE NORTH \n AMERICAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT WITH RESPECT TO THE PERSONAL EXEMPTION \nALLOWANCE FOR MERCHANDISE PURCHASED ABROAD BY RETURNING RESIDENTS, AND \n                           FOR OTHER PURPOSES\n\n  Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Domenici, and \nMrs. Clinton) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Finance:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce a \nresolution seeking parity among the United States, Canada, and Mexico \nwith respect to the personal exemption allowance for merchandise \npurchased abroad by returning residents. I am especially pleased to be \njoined today by Senators Baucus, Bingaman, Domenici, and Clinton as \noriginal cosponsors.\n  For Maine citizens living near the U.S./Canadian border, moving \nfreely and frequently between the two countries is a way of life. \nCross-border business and family relationships abound. The difference \nin personal exemption allowances, however, puts Maine businesses near \nthe Canadian border at a considerable disadvantage in relation to their \nCanadian counterparts.\n  A United States citizen traveling to Canada for fewer than 24 hours \nis exempt from paying duties on the equivalent of $200 worth of \nCanadian merchandise. For trips over 48 hours, the exemption increases \nto $800 worth of merchandise. This means that a Mainer living in a \nborder community has the option to shop in both the United States and \nin Canada, seeking the best price and products. Under U.S. laws, \nCanadian stores are able to serve both Canadian and American customers, \nand, because of the high exemption level, Americans are able to bring \nhome from Canada a significant amount of merchandise duty free.\n  Unfortunately, these advantages are a one way street. A Canadian \ncitizen is given no dutyfree personal exemption allowance for trips \nunder 24 hours. Canadian Customs is instructed to begin collecting \nduties and taxes on merchandise as long at it can collect three \nCanadian dollars. Canadian duty and sales tax rates range from seven to \nfifteen percent depending on the policies of the Canadian province; \nNova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Newfoundland enforce a 15 percent \nHarmonized Sales Tax, HST on all imports. Assessing a 15 percent \ncombined duty and tax rate, Canadian Customs begins to collect the duty \nand tax on the equivalent of only approximately $14 worth of U.S. \ngoods. Compare this to the $200 limit given to U.S. citizens.\n  This means that a Canadian shopping for the day in Fort Kent, \nMadawaska, or Calais can bring home only $14 worth of merchandise \nbefore a 15 percent duty is imposed. The exemption limit rises to a \nmere $50 for trips between 24 and 48 hours. Restrictions such as these \nare a significant deterrent to Canadians who would otherwise shop in \nMaine communities.\n  In August of 2002, I brought two top Treasury officials to Maine to \nmeet with our affected border communities to hear their concerns about \nthis problem. In the meeting held in Calais, small business owners such \nas Louis Bernardini, owner of the Boston Shoe Store, and Bill Francis, \nowner of Knock on Wood gift shop, explained that Canada's duty barriers \ncost their businesses thousands of dollars in estimated revenue on an \nannual basis. These losses are compounded by other challenges facing \ntheir and other small businesses--an economic recession, the weakness \nof the Canadian dollar, and additional restrictions on border security \nfollowing September 11.\n  This discrepancy in personal exemption allowances gives an enormous \ncompetitive advantage to the Canadian and Mexican retailers in border \ncommunities. It gives the retailers of our neighbors to the north and \nthe south access to the cross-border shoppers while, in effect, denying \nthat same opportunity for American retailers. This is not fair nor free \ntrade.\n  In June 2002, I wrote to the Bush administration requesting that it \nraise the issue with its Canadian counterparts as soon as possible. \nFormer Treasury Secretary O'Neil responded to my request and wrote to \nJohn Manley, the Canadian Minister of Finance and Deputy Prime \nMinister, asking him to adopt ``a more trade-friendly and less \nadministratively burdensome system of personal duty allowances.''\n  I had the opportunity to meet personally with John Manley this week \nregarding border issues. During this meeting, I told him that Canada's \nrestrictive personal exemption policies threaten the economies of its \nneighboring communities. I was encouraged by Minister Manley's \nunderstanding of my concerns and acknowledgment that this issue needs \nto be resolved.\n  Currently, Treasury officials are actively negotiating with Canada to \ntry to resolve the problem. The resolution I am introducing today \nexpresses the Sense that the Secretary of the Treasury and the United \nStates Trade Representative should continue discussions with officials \nof the Governments of Canada and Mexico to achieve parity with respect \nto the personal exemption allowance structure. Passage of this \namendment will send a clear message to these governments that the duty \ndisparity unfairly disadvantages American businesses and must be \ncorrected. I urge my colleagues to support its swift passage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/10/senate-section/article/S5249-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5249-S5250]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 120--COMMEMORATING THE 25th ANNIVERSARY OF VIETNAM \n                          VETERANS OF AMERICA\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I rise today with great pride and \nenthusiasm\n\n[[Page S5250]]\n\nto submit a Senate resolution commemorating the 25th Anniversary of the \nfounding of the Vietnam Veterans of America. The resolution also points \nout that April marks the 23rd Anniversary of the founding of Vietnam \nVeterans of America's first local chapter in my hometown of Rutland, \nVT.\n  The VVA is a Congressionally chartered national veterans service \norganization exclusively dedicated to Vietnam-era veterans and their \nfamilies. In the late 1970s, America had come through its longest and \nmost divisive war. Many of the millions of veterans who served during \nthat period felt that the veteran community and the Federal Government \nfailed to address their specific concerns.\n  In January 1978, Bobby Muller and a small band of Vietnam veterans \ncame to Washington, DC to create an advocacy organization to push for \nFederal action to address the needs of this unique veteran population. \nThe VVA, initially known as the Vietnam Veterans Coalition and then the \nCouncil of Vietnam Veterans, went to work focusing first on the \ndissemination of government information and coordination of relations \nbetween the Federal Government and veterans.\n  In time, it became clear that, like many other organizations, this \none could not survive simply by making a good case for its \ninitiatives--it needed to build a strong membership base in order to \nwield political power. By the summer of 1979, the new Vietnam Veterans \nof America began to focus on building its membership.\n\n  While the growth of the organization was slow initially, a \nbreakthrough came following resolution of the American Hostage Crisis \nin Iran in January 1981. While watching the jubilant homecoming given \nthe American hostages, many Vietnam veterans were poignantly reminded \nof the hostile reception they faced upon their return home. Vietnam \nveterans began to clamor for action in the form of programs that would \nplace the latest generation of wartime veterans on the same footing as \nveterans from previous wars.\n  The strength of the organization grew with the increase in \nmembership. The public also became more willing to deal with the \nneglected veterans issues unique to the Vietnam War. An important \nmanifestation of this increased public awareness was the opening of the \nVietnam Veterans Memorial in November 1982. The activities around the \nMemorial rekindled a sense of camaraderie among the veterans and the \nfeeling of a shared experience too significance to ignore.\n  Since then, the VVA has broadened the scope of services it provides \nto its membership, including the founding of the Vietnam Veterans of \nAmerica Legal Services that provides assistance to veterans seeking \nbenefits and services from the Federal Government. An example of the \ncritical information dissemination function of the VVA is the \npublication of information on the manifestations of Post-Traumatic \nStress Disorder and Agent Orange illnesses, as well treatment and \ncompensation available to veterans.\n  The legislative accomplishments of the VVA through its high-profile \npresence on Capitol Hill have been impressive. Organizations like \nVietnam-era Veterans in Congress have served the overall membership \nwell by supporting the pragmatic agenda of the VVA and championing its \nfounding principle that ``Never again will one generation of veterans \nabandon another.''\n  Today, the VVA has a national membership of 45,000 in more than 600 \nchapters. VVA state councils in 43 states coordinate the activities and \nprograms of its national organization, ensuring that grassroots input \nto Congress continues to ensure that the Federal Government meets its \nobligations to its Vietnam veterans.\n  This resolution expresses the Senate's gratitude to the Vietnam \nVeterans of America for its strong advocacy on behalf of its members \nand wishes it continued success in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/10/senate-section/article/S5250-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5250-S5251]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 35--HONORING THE 129 SAILORS AND CIVILIANS \n   LOST ABOARD THE U.S.S. THRESHER ON APRIL 10, 1963, AND URGING THE \nSECRETARY OF THE ARMY TO ERECT A MEMORIAL TO THIS TRAGEDY IN ARLINGTON \n                           NATIONAL CEMETERY\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU (for himself, Mr. Gregg, Ms. Snowe, and Ms. Collins) \nsubmitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Veterans' Affairs:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 35\n\n       Whereas the U.S.S. Thresher was first launched at \n     Portsmouth Naval Shipyard on July 9, 1960;\n       Whereas the U.S.S. Thresher departed Portsmouth Naval \n     Shipyard for her final voyage on April 9, 1963, with a crew \n     of 16 officers, 96 sailors, and 17 civilians;\n       Whereas the mix of that crew reflects the unity of military \n     and civilian personnel in the naval submarine service, and in \n     the protection of the Nation;\n       Whereas at approximately 7:47 a.m. on April 10, 1963, while \n     in communication with the surface ship U.S.S. Skylark, and \n     approximately 300 miles off the coast of New England, the \n     U.S.S. Thresher began her final descent;\n       Whereas the U.S.S. Thresher was declared lost with all \n     hands on April 10, 1963; and\n       Whereas the crew of the U.S.S. Thresher demonstrated the \n     ``last full measure of devotion'' in service to this Nation, \n     and this devotion characterizes the sacrifices of all \n     submariners, past and present: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) remembers with profound sorrow the loss of the U.S.S. \n     Thresher and her gallant crew of sailors and civilians on \n     April 10, 1963; and\n       (2) urges the Secretary of the Army to erect a memorial in \n     Arlington National Cemetery, to be paid for with private \n     funds, honoring the crew of the U.S.S. Thresher, and to all \n     United States submariners who have lost their lives in the \n     line of duty.\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, last week, the U.S. Senate unanimously \npassed S. Res. 102, a resolution I introduced that pays tribute to the \n129 officers, sailors and civilians who tragically lost their lives \naboard the nuclear submarine, U.S.S. Thresher.\n  Today, on the 40th anniversary of the loss of the Thresher, I once \nagain join with Senators Gregg, Snowe and Collins to introduce \nlegislation which calls on the Secretary of the Army to erect a \nmemorial at Arlington National Cemetery to honor the crew who were lost \non the Thresher as well as other nuclear submariners lost at sea. \nCompanion legislation is being introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives by Congressman Jeb Bradley.\n  As I stated last week, the U.S.S. Thresher was built at the \nPortsmouth Naval Shipyard and commissioned in August of 1961 as the \nlead vessel in a new class of nuclear-powered attack submarines. After \nputting to sea, she was subjected to more than a year of tests along \nthe eastern coast of the United States. In late 1962, the Thresher \nreturned to New England for an overhaul where she remained until the \nspring of 1963.\n  On April 9, 1963, the Thresher departed the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard \nto conduct deep-diving exercises some 200 miles off the coast of New \nEngland. In the morning hours of April 10, 1963, after reaching her \nassigned depth, the U.S.S. Thresher, signaled her companion surface \nship, the U.S.S. Skylark, that it was experiencing difficulties. \nShortly thereafter, the crew of the Skylark realized that something had \ngone wrong as they heard the sound of the Thresher breaking apart.\n  The inquiry following the loss of the Thresher identified the \nprobable cause of the accident as a failure in the piping which led to \na subsequent loss of power and ultimately an inability to blow the \nballast tanks which would have allowed the Thresher to rise. As a \nresult of the inquiry, the Navy initiated key changes aimed at ensuring \nthe safety of future submarines, and by extension, their crews. The \nsafety of today's modern submarine fleet is a direct result of the \nlessons learned following the loss of the Thresher.\n  Those who have served aboard America's submarine fleet over the years \nhave genuine appreciation and gratitude for the sacrifice made by the \ncrew of the Thresher. While modern submariners admire and respect these \nheroes, their sacrifice is largely unknown to many Americans. That is \nwhy I believe a memorial on the hallowed ground of Arlington National \nCemetery to the crew of the U.S.S. Thresher will allow the memory of \nthese 129 brave individuals to be given the honor and respect they are \ndue. In addition to paying tribute to the Thresher, the memorial would \nhonor all nuclear submariners who have lost their lives at sea.\n\n[[Page S5251]]\n\n  Mr. President, I am aware that there are space constraints at \nArlington. However, the memorial we are calling for would encompass a \nlimited area--approximately the size of two burial plots. This would \nallow for enough space to pay proper respect to these American heroes. \nThe legislation we are introducing today urges the Army to locate and \nallocate such space.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join Senators Gregg, Snowe, Collins and \nme in honoring these individuals by supporting this measure, and I ask \nfor its speedy consideration by the Senate.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an editorial from the \nApril 6th edition of Dover, New Hampshire's Foster's Sunday Citizen \ntitled ``Build a Memorial to the Thresher'' be included in the Record \nat the conclusion of my remarks.\n\n                   Build a Memorial To Honor Thresher\n\n       As the most powerful military force ever to navigate the \n     seas, the invincibility of today's United States Navy is the \n     sum of myriad successes and tragic failures throughout its \n     history.\n       The Portsmouth Naval Shipyard has played as big a part--if \n     not bigger--in the Navy's evolution as any other entity. The \n     yard and the residents of our region can be proud of \n     contributions made here over more than two centuries to the \n     evolution of our national defense at sea.\n       That is why it is important for us to preserve the memory \n     of the USS Thresher and her crew, all of whom perished on \n     April 10, 1963, in the deep ocean.\n       The preservation of that memory was the reason why people \n     gathered at the shipyard on Saturday. They wanted to remember \n     the boat and her crew--96 sailors, 16 officers and 17 \n     employees of the shipyard.\n       Besides the New Hampshire and Maine congressional \n     delegations, many in attendance were relatives of those who \n     perished and whose sacrifice resulted in monumental changes \n     to the way submarines after 1963 were constructed for the \n     U.S. Navy.\n       As a result, it is entirely appropriate for the delegation \n     to call for the construction of a memorial to the USS \n     Thresher and her crew at Arlington National Cemetery. Given \n     the magnitude of the Thresher's contributions to submarine \n     safety during the past 40 years, it is difficult not to \n     support such a project.\n       As a result of their sacrifice, the SubSafe program was \n     created. Regulations on hull integrity and pressure-related \n     components for submarines were strengthened. The sinking of \n     the Thresher has resulted in the lives of countless \n     submariners being saved because of safety improvement to the \n     vessels they worked on.\n       Since the Thresher, not one submarine has been lost under \n     similar circumstances.\n       The USS Thresher was the harbinger of the awesome attack \n     submarines we have today to protect our shores and interests \n     abroad. The debt we owe to the crew and civilians who \n     accepted--on our nation's behalf--the hazards of living and \n     working under water cannot be repaid.\n       Building a memorial to preserve their memory and \n     contributions is the best we are able to do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/10/senate-section/article/S5251-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5251]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 529.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Clean Diamond Trade Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Funds derived from the sale of rough diamonds are being \n     used by rebels and state actors to finance military \n     activities, overthrow legitimate governments, subvert \n     international efforts to promote peace and stability, and \n     commit horrifying atrocities against unarmed civilians. \n     During the past decade, more than 6,500,000 people from \n     Sierra Leone, Angola, and the Democratic Republic of the \n     Congo have been driven from their homes by wars waged in \n     large part for control of diamond mining areas. A million of \n     these are refugees eking out a miserable existence in \n     neighboring countries, and tens of thousands have fled to the \n     United States. Approximately 3,700,000 people have died \n     during these wars.\n       (2) The countries caught in this fighting are home to \n     nearly 70,000,000 people whose societies have been torn apart \n     not only by fighting but also by terrible human rights \n     violations.\n       (3) Human rights and humanitarian advocates, the diamond \n     trade as represented by the World Diamond Council, and the \n     United States Government have been working to block the trade \n     in conflict diamonds. Their efforts have helped to build a \n     consensus that action is urgently needed to end the trade in \n     conflict diamonds.\n       (4) The United Nations Security Council has acted at \n     various times under chapter VII of the Charter of the United \n     Nations to address threats to international peace and \n     security posed by conflicts linked to diamonds. Through these \n     actions, it has prohibited all states from exporting weapons \n     to certain countries affected by such conflicts. It has \n     further required all states to prohibit the direct and \n     indirect import of rough diamonds from Sierra Leone unless \n     the diamonds are controlled under specified certificate of \n     origin regimes and to prohibit absolutely the direct and \n     indirect import of rough diamonds from Liberia.\n       (5) In response, the United States implemented sanctions \n     restricting the importation of rough diamonds from Sierra \n     Leone to those diamonds accompanied by specified certificates \n     of origin and fully prohibiting the importation of rough \n     diamonds from Liberia. The United States is now taking \n     further action against trade in conflict diamonds.\n       (6) Without effective action to eliminate trade in conflict \n     diamonds, the trade in legitimate diamonds faces the threat \n     of a consumer backlash that could damage the economies of \n     countries not involved in the trade in conflict diamonds and \n     penalize members of the legitimate trade and the people they \n     employ. To prevent that, South Africa and more than 30 other \n     countries are involved in working, through the ``Kimberley \n     Process'', toward devising a solution to this problem. As the \n     consumer of a majority of the world's supply of diamonds, the \n     United States has an obligation to help sever the link \n     between diamonds and conflict and press for implementation of \n     an effective solution.\n       (7) Failure to curtail the trade in conflict diamonds or to \n     differentiate between the trade in conflict diamonds and the \n     trade in legitimate diamonds could have a severe negative \n     impact on the legitimate diamond trade in countries such as \n     Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, and Tanzania.\n       (8) Initiatives of the United States seek to resolve the \n     regional conflicts in sub-Saharan Africa which facilitate the \n     trade in conflict diamonds.\n       (9) The Interlaken Declaration on the Kimberley Process \n     Certification Scheme for Rough Diamonds of November 5, 2002, \n     states that Participants will ensure that measures taken to \n     implement the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme for \n     Rough Diamonds will be consistent with international trade \n     rules.\n\n     SEC. 3.

The \n     requirement to issue a semiannual report with respect to a \n     country under this subsection shall remain in effect until \n     such time as the country is controlling the importation and \n     exportation of rough diamonds through the Kimberley Process \n     Certification Scheme.\n\n     SEC. 13.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       ``(a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       ``(1) an estimated 26,000,000 individuals in the United \n     States care each year for 1 or more adult family members or \n     friends who are chronically ill, disabled, or terminally ill;\n       ``(2) an estimated 18,000,000 children in the United States \n     have chronic physical, developmental, behavioral, or \n     emotional conditions that demand caregiver monitoring,\n\n[[Page S5255]]\n\n     management, supervision, or treatment beyond that required of \n     children generally;\n       ``(3) nearly 4,000,000 individuals in the United States of \n     all ages who have mental retardation or another developmental \n     disability live with their families;\n       ``(4) almost 25 percent of the Nation's elders experience \n     multiple chronic disabling conditions that make it necessary \n     to rely on others for help in meeting their daily needs;\n       ``(5) every year, approximately 600,000 Americans die at \n     home and many of these individuals rely on extensive family \n     caregiving before their death;\n       ``(6) of all individuals in the United States needing \n     assistance in daily living, 42 percent are under age 65;\n       ``(7) there are insufficient resources to replace family \n     caregivers with paid workers;\n       ``(8) if services provided by family caregivers had to be \n     replaced with paid services, it would cost approximately \n     $200,000,000,000 annually;\n       ``(9) the family caregiver role is personally rewarding but \n     can result in substantial emotional, physical, and financial \n     hardship;\n       ``(10) approximately 75 percent of family caregivers are \n     women;\n       ``(11) family caregivers often do not know where to find \n     information about available respite care or how to access it;\n       ``(12) available respite care programs are insufficient to \n     meet the need and are directed at primarily lower income \n     populations and family caregivers of the elderly, leaving \n     large numbers of family caregivers without adequate support; \n     and\n       ``(13) the limited number of available respite care \n     programs find it difficult to recruit appropriately trained \n     respite workers.\n       ``(b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are--\n       ``(1) to encourage States to establish State and local \n     lifespan respite care programs;\n       ``(2) to improve and coordinate the dissemination of \n     respite care information and resources to family caregivers;\n       ``(3) to provide, supplement, or improve respite care \n     services to family caregivers;\n       ``(4) to promote innovative, flexible, and comprehensive \n     approaches to--\n       ``(A) the delivery of respite care;\n       ``(B) respite care worker and volunteer recruitment and \n     training programs; and\n       ``(C) training programs for family caregivers to assist \n     such family caregivers in making informed decisions about \n     respite care services;\n       ``(5) to support evaluative research to identify effective \n     respite care services that alleviate, reduce, or minimize any \n     negative consequences of caregiving; and\n       ``(6) to promote the dissemination of results, findings, \n     and information from programs and research projects relating \n     to respite care delivery, family caregiver strain, respite \n     care worker and volunteer recruitment and training, and \n     training programs for family caregivers that assist such \n     family caregivers in making informed decisions about respite \n     care services.\n\n     ``SEC. 2902.

RUSSELL NATIONAL SCHOOL LUNCH ACT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. 870, introduced earlier \ntoday by Senators Harkin and Cochran.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will state the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 870) to amend the Richard B. Russell National \n     School Lunch Act to extend the availability of funds to carry \n     out the fruit and vegetable pilot program.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I join my colleague from \nMississippi, the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry, in support of this bill that would keep fresh \nfruits and vegetables going to over 100 schools throughout the Nation.\n\n[[Page S5257]]\n\n  We hear a great deal about the importance of teaching our children \ngood nutrition as well as about the epidemic of obesity and poor eating \nhabits among American children. But for all the talk and concern, we do \nfar too little about it.\n  Last year, I worked with my colleagues to take concrete steps to \naddress these issues. Concerned about the fact that many children today \nhave only minimal experiences with fresh fruits and vegetables, we \ncreated a pilot project that provides fresh fruits and vegetables to \nschools in Iowa, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and to schools on an Indian \nreservation at Zuni, NM.\n  Despite the fact that we know there are many positive benefits \nassociated with the consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables, we \nstill fail to do nearly enough to encourage their consumption through \nour Federal nutrition programs. We must do more to encourage their \npurchase in our schools and to promote their consumption on an \nindividual level.\n  The reports that we are getting back from schools about this program \nare absolutely tremendous. Just last week my staff had a conference \ncall with school administrators, parents, and students at Zuni, NM. \nThey are almost ecstatic in their praise of the program. The children \nwere excited to be able to try foods that they had never had a chance \nto eat before. Parents report that their kids are coming home to them \nand asking them to buy the same fruits and vegetables for the home that \nthey eat at school. And school administrators report healthier diets, \nfewer discipline problems, and buy-in from the entire school community. \nEven the janitors love the program.\n  Dieticians and school officials in Iowa tell me that, because of the \nfruit and vegetable pilot, their work is more fulfilling now than ever \nbefore.\n  This is a program that we need to expand so that all schools are able \nto participate. As the Senate moves forward with the reauthorization of \nour child nutrition programs this year, I'll be looking at ways that we \ncan do this and at ways that we can encourage healthier lifestyles for \nall of our children.\n  In the meantime, the bill that I am introducing today allows us to \nextend the current fruit and vegetable pilot for an additional year. \nBecause of the short timeframe that we had to actually set up the fruit \nand vegetable pilot, many of the schools were not able to begin their \nparticipation in the program as quickly as they had hoped. As a result, \nmany schools will have funds remaining at the end of the school year. \nThey have told me, as has the Department of Agriculture, that they \nwould like to use their carryover funds for an additional year. This \nbill simply extends the authorization of the Department of Agriculture \nto continue the program for another year.\n  This does not provide any new money. It simply allows the schools to \ncarryover current funds into the 2003 school year. The Congressional \nBudget Office has indicated that there is no cost associated with this.\n  As evidenced by the concurrence of Senator Cochran, this is a non-\npartisan, non-controversial bill, and I urge my colleagues to work with \nme to see that this program is extended before its current \nauthorization runs out on June 30 of this year.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask \nunanimous consent that the injunction of secrecy be removed from the \nfollowing treaty transmitted to the Senate on April 10, 2003, by the \nPresident of the United States:\n  Protocols of the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949, on Accession of \nBulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia, \nTreaty Document No. 108-4.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the treaty be considered as \nhaving been read the first time; that it be referred, with accompanying \npapers, to the Committee on Foreign Relations and ordered to be \nprinted; and that the President's message be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The message of the President is as follows:\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  I transmit herewith Protocols to the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 on \nthe accession of Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, \nSlovakia, and Slovenia. These protocols were opened for signature at \nBrussels on March 26, 2003, and signed that day on behalf of the United \nStates and the other parties to the North Atlantic Treaty. I request \nthe advice and consent of the Senate to the ratification of these \ndocuments. I also transmit for the information of the Senate a report \nsubmitted to me by the Secretary of State regarding this matter.\n  The end of communism and the consolidation freedom and democracy in \nCentral and Eastern Europe have been among the great developments of \nhuman history. NATO played a vital role in defending freedom and \npromoting this peaceful change for over 50 years. I am pleased that, \nwith the advice and consent of the Senate, these new democracies can \nsoon join us as members of this great Alliance.\n  As the threats to the Alliance have changed, NATO itself has adapted \nto face them. At the Prague Summit in November 2002, I joined the \nleaders of NATO not only in inviting these nations to join us as \nmembers, but also in calling for a transformation of NATO's military \ncapabilities and structures to meet the threats of the 21st century. \nNATO is proceeding with that agenda. Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, \nLithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia are already making real \ncontributions to the common security of the NATO Allies, including the \nUnited States, and I ask the Senate to join me in advancing the cause \nof freedom and strengthening NATO by providing its prompt advice and \nconsent to these Protocols of Accession. My Administration stands ready \nto assist you as best we can in your deliberations.\nGeorge Bush.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/10/senate-section/article/S5257-3", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5257]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              APPOINTMENT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
