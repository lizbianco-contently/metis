Gathered in this historic chamber are those who, by Your leave \nand by the will of the people, have been chosen to lead this Nation. We \nare a Nation of constitutional ideals; may these Senators lead us \nalways to uphold them. We are a Nation made great by moral conviction; \nmay they not rest until every American has shared in that greatness. We \nare a Nation which exalts freedom; may they never forget that true \nfreedom exists for each of us only when that freedom exists for all of \nus. We are a Nation blessed by extraordinary bounty; may their \ndecisions ultimately prove to be a blessing to people whose lives may \nbe anything but bountiful.\n  Great God, in these days when the red, white, and blue waves proudly \nover our land, may the truths that flag represents take root in the \nhearts of both our leaders and our people. May the red of sacrifice, \nthe white of purity, and the blue of loyalty mark the way these \nSenators lead and the way the American people live; and may we \ncelebrate the fact that truth cannot be killed, love cannot be stopped, \nhope cannot be destroyed, freedom cannot be denied, and God cannot be \ndefeated.

Mr. President, I pay special tribute to a member of the \nstaff of Senator Trent Lott who is going to be leaving his Senate \nresponsibilities and going elsewhere in this city to work in the \nprivate sector. For many years, David Hoppe has worked in various \ncapacities for Senator Lott, most recently as his chief of staff when \nhe was majority leader. He also has worked as his staff director. He \nalso worked for Representative Jack Kemp. He has had positions in the \nHeritage Foundation, as well as working on his own previously. He is a \nspecialist in a variety of areas, including the area of energy policy. \nI think most of us remember David as someone who was always very clear \nheaded, very level headed, and very helpful to all of us, minority and \nmajority, as we worked in the Senate.\n  It can be a very hectic proposition to try to juggle all of the \nthings that have to be juggled on the floor, and it takes a very level-\nheaded person to be able to manage the egos of 100 Senators and deal \nwith the majority leader's responsibilities. David Hoppe always did \nthat with great aplomb, and it will be our loss that he leaves the \nSenate, but I am sure we will not hear the last of David Hoppe. My hat \nis off to him for his many years of service. I wish him the very best \nin his new career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/30/senate-section/article/S1760-5", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1760]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOMINATION OF MIGUEL ESTRADA\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record three separate items. The first, as was mentioned by the \ndistinguished assistant majority leader, concerns the Judiciary \nCommittee that is meeting today to consider the nomination of Miguel \nEstrada for the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. I left that meeting in \norder to be in the Chamber but will be casting my vote in support of \nhis nomination.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an editorial \nappearing in today's Wall Street Journal by Herman Badillo, who \nillustrates some of the reasons why Miguel Estrada should be confirmed \nwhen he is brought before the full Senate.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Jan. 30, 2003]\n\n                            Que Pasa, Chuck?\n\n                          (By Herman Badillo)\n\n       New York.--Nothing makes Democrats more frenzied than when \n     a Hispanic or African-American goes off the reservation. \n     Witness now the opposition that the Puerto Rican Legal \n     Defense Fund and the usual Washington special interests are \n     giving Miguel Estrada, the young Honduran immigrant-turned-\n     New Yorker that President Bush has nominated to the D.C. \n     Circuit Court of Appeals.\n       Congressional Democrats have gone so far as to say that Mr. \n     Estrada is a Hispanic ``in name only.''\n       But if their behavior is outrageous it is also par for the \n     course. Half of the Democrats' energy lately seems focused on \n     corraling the nation's two largest minority groups into an \n     intellectual ghetto. The vitriol we saw most famously \n     directed at Clarence Thomas, and more recently at Condoleezza \n     Rice, demands that blacks and Hispanics toe a political line \n     to have their success acknowledged by their own community.\n       When confirmed by the Senate, Miguel Estrada, a brilliant \n     lawyer with extraordinary credentials, will be the first \n     Hispanic on the second most prestigious court in the land. He \n     will be a role model not just for Hispanics, but for all \n     immigrants and their children. His is the great American \n     success story.\n       But his confirmation by the Senate will come no thanks to \n     Chuck Schumer, his home-state senator. Mr. Schumer has thrown \n     every old booby-trap in Mr. Estrada's way, and invented a few \n     new ones just for him. When the Senate held a hearing for Mr. \n     Estrada last year, Mr. Estrada's mother told Mr. Schumer that \n     she had voted for him and hoped that he would return the \n     favor. He hasn't yet.\n       It is hard to blame Democrats of course. They know how \n     their bread is buttered and by whom--the monied special \n     interest groups that have made a profitable business of \n     opposing the nominations of President Bush. The Hispanic \n     groups that shun Mr. Estrada, including the Congressional \n     Hispanic Caucus, which announced its opposition to his \n     nomination last September, are a different matter. They \n     should be ashamed of themselves.\n       Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah), who heads both the Senate \n     Judiciary and the Senate Republican Hispanic Task force, put \n     it well when he said that these liberal Hispanic groups \n     ``have sold out the aspirations of their people just to sit \n     around schmoozing with the Washington power elite.''\n       Mr. Schumer's one-man campaign against Mr. Estrada has \n     grown tiresome too. Despite the rebuke of every living U.S. \n     solicitor general of both parties dating back four decades, \n     Mr. Schumer continues to make irresponsible demands, never \n     made before for a non-Hispanic nominee, and insists on making \n     backhanded and unfounded insinuations about Mr. Estrada's \n     career and temperament. This treatment of Mr. Estrada is \n     demeaning and unfair, not only to the nominee but also to the \n     confirmation process and the integrity of the Senate.\n       Mr. Schumer's petulance ignores Mr. Estrada's \n     qualifications, intellect, judgment, bipartisan support, and \n     that he received a unanimous ``well qualified'' rating--the \n     highest possible rating--from the American Bar Association. \n     The liberal Hispanic groups that challenge Mr. Estrada's \n     personal identity as a Hispanic ignore his support by non-\n     partisan Hispanic organizations, such as the Hispanic \n     National Bar Association, the League of United Latin American \n     Citizens, and the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.\n       Mr. Schumer and his colleagues are fond of speaking about \n     the need for ``diversity'' on the courts. Apparently that \n     talk does not extend to President Bush's nominees, since the \n     confirmation of Mr. Estrada would provide just such diversity \n     on this important court. It is past time that Mr. Schumer put \n     an end to his embarrassing grandstanding on Mr. Estrada's \n     nomination.\n       One would think that a New York senator would know that, \n     whether Puerto Rican, Dominican or Honduran, Hispanic are \n     most united in one thing--the pride we take in our \n     advancement as Americans regardless of where we started. One \n     suspects that Mr. Schumer may learn this lesson yet, and that \n     Miguel Estrada's name is one that Charles Schumer will hear \n     repeated when he runs for re-election all too soon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/30/senate-section/article/S1760-6", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1760-S1761]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              INCOME TAXES\n\n  Mr. KYL. Secondly, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a \nWall Street Journal editorial dated Monday, January 27, which is \nentitled ``No More Than 30 Percent.'' This complements some comments I \nmade yesterday regarding President Bush's tax plan and makes the point \nthat most Americans, rich or poor, agree that the most any American \nshould ever have to pay in income taxes is 30 percent. In fact, most \npeople believe it should be no higher than 30 percent. So even though \nwe have a lot of Americans who are extraordinarily wealthy, by far and \naway most Americans believe confiscatory taxation violates America's \nsense of fairness.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Jan. 27, 2003]\n\n                            No More Than 30%\n\n       The political class warriors can never seem to figure out \n     why their ``tax cuts for the rich'' mantra fails to sway the \n     American public. In the spirit of educating even our \n     opponents, we'd point them to a recent poll from Fox News.\n       In addition to the usual questions about President Bush's \n     tax cut proposals, the poll asked voters what is the maximum \n     share of income that any American should pay in taxes. More \n     than half think it should be no\n\n[[Page S1761]]\n\n     more than 20%, and another quarter think it should be \n     somewhere between 20% and 30%. So nearly eight of every 10 \n     Americans think that no one, not even Bill Gates, should pay \n     more than 30% to the government.\n       Now, even we'll admit to the sin of thinking once in a \n     while that the world would be better off if a few people (Ted \n     Turner, say, or George Soros) were taxed at confiscatory \n     rates. So how to explain such a poll result? One answer is \n     that Americans put more faith in their aspirations than do \n     the envy specialists of Europe or Brookline, Mass. They \n     appreciate America's class mobility and expect, or at least \n     hope, that someday they too will be rich.\n       But the more fundamental answer may be that confiscatory \n     taxation violates America's sense of fairness. Most Americans \n     simply believe it is wrong, unjust even, for the government \n     to take more than a third (or even a fifth) of the hard-\n     earned income of even the very rich. It is, after all, their \n     money.\n       Honesty compels us to concede, however, that the Fox poll \n     does give America's income redistributionists some reason to \n     hope. About 1% think the government is entitled to take \n     ``whatever'' it wants, presumably 100% if need be. This may \n     be a small socialist cadre, but they are clearly committed.\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/30/senate-section/article/S1761-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1761-S1765]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            STANDING UNITED\n\n  Mr. KYL. Finally, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a \nletter from several international leaders called ``Europe and America \nMust Stand United,'' reprinted from the Wall Street Journal. It is \nsigned by representatives from Spain, Portugal, Italy, the United \nKingdom, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Denmark. It makes the \npoint that other countries in Europe stand with the United States in \nour determination to bring the country of Iraq into compliance with the \nnorms of international behavior and U.N. resolutions that apply to its \nweapons of mass destruction program.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Jan. 30, 2003]\n\n                  Europe and America Must Stand United\n\n       The real bond between the United States and Europe is the \n     values we share: democracy, individual freedom, human rights \n     and the Rule of Law. These values crossed the Atlantic with \n     those who sailed from Europe to help create the USA. Today \n     they are under greater threat than ever.\n       The attacks of 11 September showed just how far \n     terrorists--the enemies of our common values--are prepared to \n     go to destroy them. Those outrages were an attack on all of \n     us. In standing firm in defence of these principles, the \n     governments and people of the United States and Europe have \n     amply demonstrated the strength of their convictions. Today \n     more than ever, the transatlantic bond is a guarantee of our \n     freedom.\n       We in Europe have a relationship with the United States \n     which has stood the test of time. Thanks in large part to \n     American bravery, generosity and far-sightedness, Europe was \n     set free from the two forms of tyranny that devastated our \n     continent in the 20th century: Nazism and Communism. Thanks, \n     too, to the continued cooperation between Europe and the \n     United States we have managed to guarantee peace and freedom \n     on our continent. The transatlantic relationship must not \n     become a casualty of the current Iraqi regime's persistent \n     attempts to threaten world security.\n       In today's world, more than ever before, it is vital that \n     we preserve that unity and cohesion. We know that success in \n     the day-to-day battle against terrorism and the proliferation \n     of weapons of mass destruction demands unwavering \n     determination and firm international cohesion on the part of \n     all countries for whom freedom is precious.\n       The Iraqi regime and its weapons of mass destruction \n     represent a clear threat to world security. This danger has \n     been explicitly recognised by the United Nations. All of us \n     are bound by Security Council Resolution 1441, which was \n     adopted unanimously. We Europeans have since reiterated our \n     backing for Resolution 1441, our wish to pursue the UN route \n     and our support for the Security Council, at the Prague Nato \n     Summit and the Copenhagen European Council.\n       In doing so, we sent a clear, firm and unequivocal message \n     that we would rid the world of the danger posed by Saddam \n     Hussein's weapons of mass destruction. We must remain united \n     in insisting that his regime is disarmed. The solidarity, \n     cohesion and determination of the international community are \n     our best hope of achieving this peacefully. Our strength lies \n     in unity.\n       The combination of weapons of mass destruction and \n     terrorism is a threat of incalculable consequences. It is one \n     at which all of us should feel concerned. Resolution 1441 is \n     Saddam Hussein's last chance to disarm using peaceful means. \n     The opportunity to avoid greater confrontation rests with \n     him. Sadly this week the UN weapons inspectors have confirmed \n     that his long-established pattern of deception, denial and \n     non-compliance with UN Security Council resolutions is \n     continuing.\n       Europe has no quarrel with the Iraqi people. Indeed, they \n     are the first victims of Iraq's current brutal regime. Our \n     goal is to safeguard world peace and security by ensuring \n     that this regime gives up its weapons of mass destruction. \n     Our governments have a common responsibility to face this \n     threat. Failure to do so would be nothing less than negligent \n     to our own citizens and to the wider world.\n       The United Nations Charter charges the Security Council \n     with the task of preserving international peace and security. \n     To do so, the Security Council must maintain its credibility \n     by ensuring full compliance with its resolutions. We cannot \n     allow a dictator to systematically violate those Resolutions. \n     If they are not complied with, the Security Council will lose \n     its credibility and world peace will suffer as a result.\n       We are confident that the Security Council will face up to \n     its responsibilities.\n\n  Mr. KYL. That is the subject I would like to devote the rest of my \ntime to discussing. It is the issue the President addressed in the \nState of the Union speech, an issue we dealt with 3 months ago in the \nSenate when we approved a resolution authorizing the President to use \nforce, if need be, to bring Iraq into compliance with both agreements \nit had signed at the end of the Persian Gulf war 12 years ago and also \nvarious United Nations resolutions.\n  I rise to speak today because there are obviously a lot of legitimate \nconcerns being expressed by various Members of the Congress, including \na long-time Member of the Senate, Senator Kennedy, who recently \nintroduced a resolution calling for the Senate to revisit this issue. I \ndid not have the opportunity to tell Senator Kennedy I would be \nspeaking about his resolution, but I did want to note this has been \ndealt with by the Congress. We have given the President the authority.\n  One could argue with respect to any change in circumstances that \nconditions have only gotten worse, not better, since the President was \ngranted that authority by the Congress and therefore we do not need to \nvote on that resolution again or a new resolution giving the President \nthe authority to act. I make that point because of the submission of \nhis resolution yesterday and because of the remarks he made. I will be \nreferring to those remarks.\n  The point of the President's comments in his State of the Union \nspeech was not to lay out the case for proceeding against Saddam \nHussein but, rather, to begin to create the predicate for action we \nwill have to take. People have asked why President Bush has not been \nmore vocal about the case to be made. I don't know because I have not \ntalked to him, but I suspect that the last thing President Bush wanted \nto do was to be seen as beating the war drums. This is a grave decision \nhe will have to make. It is a decision I know he does not make lightly. \nHe makes it very reluctantly. But in the end, he will have to make a \ndecision. I believe, from the tone and tenor of his remarks on Tuesday \nevening and the fact that he has not been speaking out a lot about this \nin the last several weeks, that is an illustration of the fact that he \ndid not want to be seen as promoting the United States involvement in \nmilitary action in Iraq but rather exactly the opposite: Asking \nSecretary Powell to visit with our allies at the United Nations and \nother nations, as well, and Secretary Rumsfeld and Dr. Rice to go out \nand speak to others to assert their views on the subject and express \nour views on the subject, to try to find some way to avoid having to \nuse military action to enforce these U.N. resolutions.\n  The President has made the point that time is running out, that \nSaddam Hussein has steadfastly, continuously, repeatedly refused to \ncomply with those resolutions and that at some point the international \ncommunity as a whole, the United Nations as a body, and the United \nStates specifically, have to decide whether these international \nagreements are going to be enforced. If they are not, then one could \neasily say they are not worth the paper on which they are written. The \nUnited States would have less moral suasion in the world if it refused \nto act when it had a clear responsibility to do so, and the United \nNations and its Security Council would be deemed increasingly \nirrelevant by virtue of the fact that it has passed no fewer than 16 \nresolutions expressing the fact that Saddam Hussein has remained in \nviolation of his promise to dismantle his weapons of mass destruction \nand has not done so.\n\n[[Page S1762]]\n\n  If we are to rely upon international bodies, multilateral agreements, \nand even treaties and agreements signed by Saddam Hussein, there has to \nbe an ``or else'' if they are not complied with or there is no point in \nentering into them in the first instance. Second, if you do not enforce \nthe agreements, you foster more rogue behavior by nations such as Iraq \nunder Saddam Hussein's leadership because those nations know they can \ncontinue to violate international norms of behavior and get away with \nit because at the end of the day no one is willing to enforce those \nnorms of behavior even when they have been codified in agreements or in \nUnited Nations resolutions.\n  That is why President Bush is right; time is running out, and Saddam \nHussein has a very critical decision to make. Will he finally see the \nhandwriting on the wall that his days and his regime's days are very \nnumbered and comply with the agreement he made, to save his own life, \nto dismantle his weapons of mass destruction under international \nsupervision? That is the term that is used in Resolution 687 of the \nUnited Nations which has been incorporated into the most recent \nResolution 1441.\n  That is the basis for the ability of the United States and the other \nnations of the world to act in this case. Saddam Hussein promised to \ndismantle his weapons of mass destruction under international \nsupervision. He never did that. There was an inventory in 1998 of his \nweapons of mass destruction by the United Nations. He has never fully \nexplained what happened to that inventory. He had a last opportunity to \ndo so in the declaration he was invited to file a couple of months ago. \nA declaration was filed. It contained the same old things he talked \nabout before but no evidence that he had destroyed those weapons of \nmass destruction.\n  Now, why did the United Nations say he had to dismantle these weapons \nunder international supervision? Precisely because we did not want to \nbe in the position of having to go find the needle in the haystack: We \nhave to go find evidence somewhere to prove that he still maintains or \npossesses these weapons of mass destruction. After all of these years \nand the opportunities he has had to hide these weapons, the burden \nshould not be on the United States or the United Nations to go find \nthese weapons but, rather, right where it was when he signed the \nagreements at the end of the gulf war and when the United Nations \nadopted its original resolution saying he had to dismantle these \nweapons under international supervision. We knew that was the only way \nwe would know for sure it had been done, because of his record of lying \nand cheating.\n  Sure enough, over the past 11 years, that record has continued. He \nhas never explained what happened to these weapons. He has never given \nus the evidence that they have been destroyed. We have evidence that \nthey still exist, from the declarations of the United Nations in 1998 \nas well as our own intelligence and some admissions from the Iraqi \nGovernment itself and eye witness accounts. You cannot get better \nevidence than that.\n  Now, some of this evidence, of course, is collected by the \nintelligence agencies and not of the kind that can be released \npublicly. But Secretary Powell is going to visit with our allies and \nothers at the United Nations, hopefully next week, to lay out some \nadditional information we can disclose and, hopefully, persuade these \nnations it is now time to act.\n  The basis of the resolution Senator Kennedy offered was that there \nshould be more time for the inspections to work. I would like to \nconfront that directly because I know that while the concept is well \nmeaning, it is very misplaced. There is nothing in the evidence to \nsuggest Saddam Hussein will change his behavior in the least if he has \nmore time. In fact, quite the opposite is true. The only time Saddam \nHussein has ever come forward and done anything that has even begun to \nsuggest compliance has been when he has been pressured to do so, when \nhe has known the time was short and people were going to enforce the \nagreements he made if he did not do something.\n\n  Ironically, the best way to get him to comply is to make it clear \nthat military action is a very distinct and proximate possibility. That \nis the only basis on which I think there is any hope to avert military \naction--if he understands it is inevitable unless he complies.\n  So I think giving him more time would be seen not only by Saddam \nHussein but other rogue terrorists and terrorist states in the world as \na lack of willingness on the part of the international community to \nenforce these agreements it has gotten Saddam Hussein to sign and the \nresolutions the United Nations adopted.\n  What are the implications of that? If international norms of behavior \nare not enforced and if the free nations of the world cannot muster the \nwill and the ability to enforce them, it merely fosters similar action \nby terrorists and rogue states around the world. The eyes of the world \nare upon us. This is why President Bush has made the commitment to move \nforward if Saddam Hussein does not comply, because he understands that \neveryone is watching, and if the rogue terrorists of the world--rogue \nstates and terrorists decide they can get the United States and the \nUnited Nations to blink, that at the end of the day they are not really \nwilling to enforce these resolutions and agreements, you can see them \nact in ways that very soon will challenge us to military action and \nperhaps at a time when it is more disadvantageous for us to take that \naction.\n  The lesson of Korea is a good lesson. It would have been better if we \ncould have dealt with Korea permanently before it acquired nuclear \nweaponry. Because it has that kind of weaponry today, and longer-range \nmissiles, we are very reluctant to engage North Korea militarily, and \nwith good reason. We cannot afford to wait until countries such as Iraq \nor other rogue states acquire similar weapons, nor to decide it is time \nto deal with them, to get them to comply with these agreements and U.N. \nresolutions. That is why more time is not the answer. More time will \nnot solve the problem. More time will do nothing but exacerbate the \nproblem.\n\n  Confidence is also misplaced to rely on the inspections to produce \nanything. President Bush has made the point, Secretary Powell has made \nthe point--inspections only work if you have a willing, compliant party \non the other side that has demonstrated a desire to dismantle weapons \nand wants the world to verify that has been done.\n  We did this before in Ukraine and Kazakhstan, countries that were \nwilling to dismantle their weapons. Where inspections are able to \nconfirm that, demonstrate that, this is a technique that can work. But \nit can never work, as Secretary Powell said, with a nation such as Iraq \nwhich has as its intention hiding these weapons rather than \ncooperating.\n  The inspectors are not in Iraq--and I repeat this, the inspectors are \nnot in Iraq--to find evidence with which to prosecute Saddam Hussein. \nThat would be an impossible task. They would have to get enormously \nlucky to find anything in that country. In fact, I guess we could say \nthey were lucky, to the extent they found 16 shells which contained \nwarheads suitable for chemical weaponry, warheads that were not \ndeclared by Saddam Hussein in his declaration and therefore were in \nclear violation of the U.N. requirement that he destroy these weapons. \nThey were lucky to find them.\n  People say you need a smoking gun. There is a smoking gun. Why is \nthat not good enough? The bottom line is you cannot put the burden on \nthe inspectors because there is no way in any reasonable period of time \nthat you could expect them to find them all. I have forgotten the exact \nnumber now, but there are in the tens of thousands of these weapons \nthat Saddam Hussein had. We knew he had them and he has never shown he \nhas destroyed them. How are we going to find those? The fact is the \ninspectors are there to verify voluntary compliance. They are not there \nto try to find things that are being deliberately hidden.\n  One of the reasons the document I had printed in the Record, the \nletter signed by European leaders, is so important is because it \nvalidates the notion that the free nations of the world need to be \nunited in enforcing these norms of international behavior. Thus the \nheadline: ``Europe and America Must Stand United.'' The last paragraph \nI will read:\n\n       The United Nations Charter charges the Security Council \n     with the task of preserving\n\n[[Page S1763]]\n\n     international peace and security. To do so, the Security \n     Council must maintain its credibility by ensuring full \n     compliance with its resolutions. We cannot allow a dictator \n     to systematically violate those resolutions. If they are not \n     complied with, the Security Council will lose its credibility \n     and world peace will suffer as a result.\n       We are confident the Security Council will face up to its \n     responsibilities.\n\n  Some of the signatories include Tony Blair, of the United Kingdom, \nSilvio Berlusconi, of Italy, Vaclav Havel, of the Czech Republic, one \nof the real democrats of our era, and others, who make the point that \nwe have to stand united in this effort.\n  The problem they are facing and that President Bush is facing is if \nwe believe we have to get the approval of the Security Council, and any \nof the five permanent members, which could be Russia, China, or France, \nfor example, were to veto another resolution, then our hands would be \ntied. That is why another resolution is not required. Resolution 1441 \nis good enough. President Bush has made that point and Secretary Powell \nmade the point, telling those nations, don't vote for the Resolution \n1441 if you are not going to be prepared to support action when the \ntime comes.\n  Now the time is upon us. What these distinguished leaders are saying \nin this letter is the Security Council needs to step to the plate and \nauthorize the kind of action that is called for here. If not, it can be \ndone unilaterally by the United States and the rest of the coalition of \nwilling partners. We have that legal authority to do so. Obviously, it \nwould be better if the world opinion, expressed through United Nations \nresolutions, backed that action. But that is not necessary.\n  I would argue also in some respects it is not desirable to keep going \nback to the United Nations Security Council for approval. This is the \nreason why. You begin to create the precedent that action is \nillegitimate unless this group has approved it; that unless the \nSecurity Council has given its stamp of approval other nations may not \nact in their self-interest and in the interest of the international \ncommunity of countries.\n  That would be an extraordinarily bad precedent. It would cede the \nsovereignty of the United States to a United Nations body which is not \nsome kind of angelic group of objective judges on high somewhere, \ndeciding what is right, truth, and justice in the world. It is five \ncountries with self-interests, one of which is the United States. All \nof these countries act in their self-interest and there is nothing \nwrong with that. France acts in its self-interest. A lot of French have \nbusiness dealings with the Iraqis. There is nothing wrong with that \nexcept it may violate the sanctions of the United Nations. But they \nhave reasons for perhaps not wanting to confront Iraq.\n  Russia has a lot of money tied up in Iraq in debts that are owed to \nRussia. It wants to see those debts repaid. There is nothing wrong with \nthat. So it is naturally a little bit careful here in the way it is \ndealing with Iraq in this resolution.\n  China has its own issues, as have Great Britain and the United \nStates. All of us approach these issues from the legitimate position of \nour own self-interest as nations. The combination of those five \ncountries represents the permanent members of the Security Council, who \nhave a veto. There are additionally 10 other nations that rotate on and \noff the Security Council.\n  We got a unanimous decision of all 15 nations, including even Syria, \nwith Resolution 1441. So we have the ability to proceed. What I am \nsaying is it is a mistake to have to go to the Security Council again, \nfirst, because you are setting a very bad precedent that is the only \nway you can legitimately act, and, second, because there is some kind \nof suggestion that nations put their self-interests over here on a \nshelf when they deal with questions such as this. They do not. They \nmake decisions based upon their perception of their own self-interest \nand there is nothing wrong with that. But what it can mean is that if \nour interests are divergent enough, we can get into situations where \nsome countries decide to take an action and other countries decide to \nveto that action. If they have a legal veto, then they can preclude \ncountries such as the United States and Great Britain, for example, \nfrom acting in their own self-interest.\n\n  That is why, even though I welcome the debate and would be very \nwilling to spend all of the time our good friend and colleague, Senator \nKennedy, would like to take on the floor of the Senate, debating his \nresolution to have yet another expression of Congress in support of \nmilitary action by the President, it is not necessary. We have already \ncovered that ground. It has already been approved by the Senate. The \nPresident has taken a lot of action in reliance upon the action of the \nSenate back in November.\n  It is kind of like pulling the rug out from under him. I know that is \nnot Senator Kennedy's intent, but it could have that effect because the \nPresident relied on the approval the Senate gave to him to mobilize \ntens of thousands of American troops all over the world. These troops \nare now committed to the theater of Iraq. A great deal depends upon our \nability to combine a military mission with the timing that is required \nto achieve success, and all the other factors that are involved in a \nsuccessful outcome of the enforcement of these U.N. resolutions by the \nUnited States and its committed allies.\n  We can't be getting to the point where there is a herky-jerky, we'll \ngive you the authority, we'll take it back, OK, we'll give you some \nmore, now you can't. The Commander in Chief cannot operate that way. \nThat is why last December we said we will vote to give the authority. \nDon't vote for it if you don't think he should exercise that. Many of \nour colleagues did not, and they have good and sufficient reasons for \nvoting that way. The vote overwhelmingly carried. The President was \ngranted the authority by the Congress. Now, on the eve of his exercise \nof that authority, if he chooses to do so, is not the time to suggest \nthat, well, we didn't really mean it; he has to come to us one more \ntime. That would be an act, I suggest, that would not be worthy of the \nSenate, given our responsibilities to act in concert with the President \nin conducting his responsibilities as Commander in Chief.\n  Even though we know there are sincere questions and concerns about \ntaking military action--and every one of us shares those concerns--we \nalso know leadership is about making decisions when the situation is \nnot clear. All of us have heard about the fog of war. Henry Kissinger \nhas written about the essence of leadership and making a decision when \nalmost everything seems to be in doubt and there is no clear path to a \ndecision. Making the right decision at that time and following through \nis what enables you to succeed, because waiting until everything is \nclear is usually to wait until it is too late. It is the situation I \ndescribed before with North Korea, for example. If we wait until it is \nclear that Saddam Hussein has the nuclear weapon, it will be too late \nto confront him over the use of that weapon or over the fact he \npossesses that weapon.\n  That is why the President has been so insistent that the original \npromise of Saddam Hussein to dismantle under international supervision \nand never having complied with that promise must now be enforced. That \nis the essence of the President's case. While I am sure he will speak \nto the American people and lay this out much more clearly than I have, \nand that he, Secretary Powell, and others will continue to speak with \nour allies so they know fully why we are prepared to act and will feel \ncomfortable in joining us in this action--and even with those actions \nwhich I think we can contemplate in the next several days--I think it \nwould be a big mistake, as I said, for the Senate to assume we need to \nrevisit this issue in a legal way and that the President would not be \nauthorized to act unless we pass some kind of legislation.\n  I welcome the debate, as I said. If our colleagues wish to have that \ndebate here on the Senate floor, I suggest it would be far better for \nus to acknowledge the President's authority and to stand behind him in \nthe decisions he makes, knowing our support for his actions is support \nfor the troops we are sending in harm's way. The best thing we can do \nfor those sons and daughters is not to continue to question and wring \nour hands and express self-doubt about what we are doing but to \nsolemnly weigh all of the factors, make a judgment to support the \nPresident in his judgment, and then support those troops when they are \ncalled upon to\n\n[[Page S1764]]\n\nact. That is the best way we can repay those who are willing to make \nthat supreme sacrifice for that willingness on their part.\n  I solemnly hope as we debate these issues, we can do so in that \nspirit, in the spirit of the sacrifice our troops are willing to make, \nand that the debate be as serious, as analytical, and as nonpartisan as \nmuch as we can make that kind of debate, but when the time comes that \nevery one of us will support the President and our troops.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I want to pick up where the Senator from \nArizona left off.\n  What has changed that would lead us to have another debate on a \nresolution authorizing force? Since the last time we debated this issue \nhere on the Senate floor, I do not know if the Senator from Arizona has \nany thoughts as to what sort of things have changed. The only thing I \ncan think of which has changed is we have had weapons inspectors in the \ncountry and those weapons inspectors have been deceived. We did not \nhave weapons inspectors in the country at the time we were debating \nthis resolution in September of last year. The only thing I can think \nof is the Senator from Massachusetts and others who wanted to debate \nthis issue wanted to make the point that, Well, weapons inspectors \nhaven't found anything, and maybe that has changed. Remember, they \nweren't in the country in the first place.\n  We didn't find anything in the first place when the U.N. took as a \ngiven that he had these weapons of mass destruction. It was simply a \nmatter of what he was going to declare and what he had done with them. \nHe still hasn't.\n  From my perspective, I haven't seen any change. We knew he had these \nweapons. The President detailed them the other night. He hasn't \ndisclosed what he has done with these weapons, which is pretty status \nquo.\n  When we were debating in September, we had had weapons inspectors who \nhad been given the opportunity to determine where these weapons were, \nand Saddam Hussein had not cooperated.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if I could respond to the Senator from \nPennsylvania, I don't want to characterize Senator Kennedy's response \nto that. He made his statement. The essence of one of the things he \nsaid was things have changed since we debated this. From his \nperspective, he said things have changed. One of the things he said was \ninspectors had not been able to find anything.\n  I would respond to that in two quick ways.\n  First of all, the U.N. inspectors have determined Iraq is not \nvoluntarily disarming as required by United Nations Resolution 1441. \nQuoting Hans Blix, head of the inspector team:\n\n       Iraq appears not to have come into genuine acceptance--not \n     even today--of disarmament which was demanded of him and \n     which he needs to carry out to win the confidence of the \n     world and live in peace.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I would say to my colleague that when we \nvoted on this resolution in September there were no weapons inspectors \nin the country. There was not even the prospect of weapons inspectors \nin the country. I keep coming back to what has changed substantively. \nThe fact that weapons inspectors haven't found anything is a fact, but \nit is not relevant to what the debate was back in September when we \npassed this resolution because there was not even the prospect of \nweapons inspectors at that time. The debate was clearly about the fact \nthat Saddam had weapons of mass destruction and he had not come forward \nto date and disclosed them. All we have seen over the past few months \nis more of the same.\n  Mr. KYL. If I could respond to the Senator from Pennsylvania, some of \nthe best evidence of what has changed or what hasn't changed comes from \nSecretary Powell's comments on the United Nations report. Here is what \nhe said:\n\n       Iraq has been and continues to be in material breach of all \n     its earlier obligations. We are giving the resolution one \n     more chance to Iraq. We put a firm list of conditions for \n     Iraq to meet and what they should allow the inspectors to do \n     to assist them in disarmament. Iraq's time for disarmament is \n     fast coming to an end.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. It seems to me what Senator Kennedy put forward is what \nmany in the press have put forward, which is really a change of \nexpectations and putting up, I would argue, the straw man; that is, it \nis our obligation to show Saddam is not in compliance by finding a \nweapon of mass destruction; the fact we haven't found one is somehow a \nbreach on our part, or a problem; and a level of evidence we haven't \nbeen able to meet. Of course, just the opposite is true. As the Senator \nfrom Arizona just read, it is his obligation to prove he is in \ncompliance, not our obligation to prove he is not in compliance.\n  Mr. KYL. If I may further respond to the Senator from Pennsylvania, \nthis is not just our view, Secretary Powell's view, or President Bush's \nview. The letter we saw in today's Wall Street Journal by prestigious \nleaders in countries such as Great Britain, Portugal, Italy, and the \nCzech Republic said this:\n\n       Resolution 1441 is Saddam Hussein's last chance to disarm \n     using peaceful means. The opportunity to avoid greater \n     confrontation rests with him. Sadly, this week, the U.N. \n     weapons inspectors have confirmed that his long established \n     pattern of deception, denial, and noncompliance with U.N. \n     Security Council resolution is continuing. We cannot allow a \n     dictator to systematically violate those resolutions.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Another point that is being made is these inspectors \nare not finding anything, and that there is this undercurrent of \nexpectation that it is their role to be detected or investigated; that \nthey are over there to find the proverbial needle in the haystack; that \nthey are there to be Sherlock Holmes when, of course, that is not their \nmission. Their mission there is not as detectives. They are inspectors. \nI use the example of someone who runs a gas station. Someone from the \nBureau of Weights and Measures comes in and determines whether your \nscales are operating correctly. Are you running a legitimate business? \nYou show them the record of what your pump is pumping out in gas, and \nthey check it to make sure it is valid. That is what these inspectors \nare doing. If you are conducting illegal activities and siphoning off \ngas somewhere, they are not going to find that by checking whether your \npump is working right.\n\n  So that really is the case with these inspectors, is it not, that \nthey are there to check as to what Saddam is telling us where his \nweapons of mass destruction went, if they actually went there, or were \ndestroyed. Since he has not provided us any of that information, it is \nvery hard for them to be able to find any smoking gun or deposit of \nweapons, when their job really isn't to do that; it is just to validate \nwhat he is telling them.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Pennsylvania, that \nis exactly right. The analogy is a good one. It is somewhat similar to \nwhat Secretary Powell has said. If I can find that, I will put it in \nthe Record right here.\n  But it is also interesting that not only is their job not to be a \ndetective but, rather, to verify voluntary compliance. But since the \nresolution, passed by the Senate, authorizing the President to use \nforce if necessary, here is what has happened: The inspectors have not \nhave been able to interview any Iraqis in private. The inspectors have \nstill not received from Iraq a full list of Iraqi personnel involved \nwith the WMD programs. The inspectors have not been able to employ \naerial surveillance. They will not guarantee the safety of the U-2 \nplanes. In fact, they shoot at our pilots every day as we try to \nsurveil their country. Inspectors have caught Iraqis concealing top \nsecret information. Inspectors have evidence that Iraq has moved or \nhidden items at sites just prior to inspection visits. And, of course, \nIraq did not provide a complete declaration of the WMD program as it is \nrequired to do.\n  So as to the question of what has changed with respect to \ninspections, it is all bad news, not good news.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The fact of the matter is, nothing has changed from the \ninspections that occurred prior to the debate here in the Senate back \nin September. So I really question what the motivation is of having \nthis debate again when, on a substantive basis, nothing has changed, \nother than continued and maybe even more explicit deception on the part \nof Saddam Hussein in hiding these weapons of mass destruction.\n  What has changed, I would argue, is the United States and our \ncoalition\n\n[[Page S1765]]\n\npartners have moved forward in a plan of deployment to convince Saddam \nwe are serious, that if he does not comply, and comply quickly and \ncompletely, there will be action taken.\n  As we had this debate on the floor--and one of the reasons many \nMembers here supported this resolution--it was to make sure Saddam knew \nwe were serious, we were going to follow through with what we said we \nwould do, and the President had the support of the American public, \nthereby making it a credible threat, giving--I heard this over and \nover--giving peace the best chance by letting Saddam know the certainty \nof his noncompliance.\n  Mr. KYL. Might I just make one final comment to the Senator from \nPennsylvania?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Please.\n  Mr. KYL. I did find what I was looking for. The Senator has made \nexactly the right point. Inspectors can verify someone who wants to be \nin voluntary compliance, but inspectors cannot find something you are \ntrying to hide. Two comments. Secretary Wolfowitz said, on January 23:\n\n       It is not the job of inspectors to disarm Iraq. It is \n     Iraq's job to disarm itself. What inspectors can do is \n     confirm that a country has willingly disarmed and provide \n     verifiable evidence that it has done so.\n\n  Then Secretary Powell had said this in the Washington Post a week \nago:\n\n       The question isn't how much longer do you need for \n     inspectors to work. Inspections will not work.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Yes. The term I use over and over again is that these \nare inspectors, not investigators. These are not detectives. This \nconcept that inspectors will find a smoking gun is absurd. It is \nabsurd. They will not because they are not looking for a smoking gun. \nIt is not their mission to find a smoking gun. They are there, as the \nSenator from Arizona quoted our people at the Defense Department--Paul \nWolfowitz--they are there to determine whether Saddam is telling us the \ntruth in the information he has given us. Since he has not given us any \ninformation as to what he has done with his weapons of mass \ndestruction, it is very difficult for them to determine whether he is \ntelling the truth.\n  So this whole concept, No. 1, that the burden of proof is on the \nUnited States of America or on the United Nations or on these weapons \ninspectors to find what Saddam has is false. And the expectation that \nthere is some smoking gun we must show Members of the Senate, people in \nAmerica, or people around the world, as some countries have indicated, \nis absurd on its face. Certainly, the countries that are involved in \nthis action and have been involved in these negotiations at the United \nNations know it. They know these inspectors are not there to find a \nsmoking gun, are not there to find weapons of mass destruction. That is \nnot what they are there to do.\n  They happened to stumble onto 16 warheads that could use chemicals, \nthat could contain chemical and biological weapons. They stumbled onto \nthem. It just tells you how many of these things are probably lying \naround where even inspectors who are not looking for them can stumble \nonto them.\n  So the basic point I am trying to make is nothing has fundamentally \nchanged, except two things: No. 1, more of the same; more of the same; \nSaddam Hussein is not disarming and he is not cooperating, which he is \nrequired to do under the United Nations resolution. That has not \nchanged. And the threat to the United States as a result has not \nchanged. That was a threat when we debated this in September. It is a \nthreat today. So those things have not changed.\n  One thing has changed: We have begun, along with our coalition \npartners, to begin to deploy force in the region with the express \npurpose of giving Saddam every opportunity to understand the \nseriousness of our commitment. We should not at this time back down \nfrom that commitment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER.

Mr. President, I have a couple comments. First, on the \nheels of what has been said by our friends on the other side, a little \nmore than 24 hours ago we listened as the President addressed our \nNation and shared with us how he thinks we are doing and how he thinks \nwe could do better.\n  I thought it was, for the most part, a good speech, well delivered. \nThere were a number of aspects of the address I especially welcomed. As \na former Governor of Delaware, who has been a mentor for over 5 years, \nand who went out and recruited 10,000 mentors in our State, I \nespecially appreciated his recognition for the importance of the roles \nof mentors in young people's lives and the call for other Americans to \nmentor children in their own communities.\n  I very much appreciated his, I believe, sincere commitment toward \nrallying the United States to help fight the AIDS epidemic in Africa \nand to put our money where our mouths are.\n  A year or so ago we sat just down the Hall in the House Chamber and \nthe President talked about an axis of evil in which he included North \nKorea, Iraq, and Iran. I had some difference with what he said, \nparticularly dealing with Iran. He simply seemed to lump all the \nIranians together, whether they happen to be the ruling clerics, who \nare squashing human liberties, civil rights in that country, or whether \nthey happen to be many of the younger people, those who have taken to \nthe streets, who have demonstrated, risked their lives in a commitment \nto democracy.\n  I was very pleased when President Bush, in his comments the night \nbefore last, spoke to the situation in Iran and acknowledged there are \ntwo camps. There is a camp whose direction we do not endorse, we do not \nsupport, but strongly differ with. But there are a lot of good people \nin that country who are trying to do the right thing for themselves in \na way we would welcome as they seek to restore civil liberties, human \nliberties, human rights, and to infuse a true democracy in that \ncountry.\n  There are a lot of people in that country who, frankly, like this \ncountry. On the heels on 9/11, and a time or two since, we have heard \nof spontaneous and organized demonstrations there where a number of \npeople have expressed their sympathy with what we have suffered as a \nresult of 9/11.\n  Those are just a few aspects of the President's speech in which I \nfound favor.\n  There were a couple others that I thought were missing. Delaware is a \nState where we have had a remarkably strong economy. Our unemployment \nrate today is about 4 percent, which compares very favorably with other \nparts of America. I am not sure what the situation is in Montana, home \nof our Presiding Officer. Some States have unemployment rates of 6, 7, \nmaybe 8 percent. We have a million or more people who don't have a job \ntoday than we did a year or so ago. I was disappointed in the \nPresident's decision not to acknowledge that these are tough times for \na lot of States financially, that the cumulative deficits faced by the \nStates this year are in the tens of billions of dollars, actually \ngetting bigger, not smaller, as the year goes forward.\n  Some in this body think we should write out a check and provide \nrevenue sharing for the States. I was never a big advocate for revenue \nsharing when I was a Member of the House or as a Governor for 8 years. \nI am not a huge advocate of revenue sharing today. Unfortunately, we \nactually don't have a whole lot of revenues to share these days, given \nthe kind of budget deficits we face. But there are a couple of ways we \nmight want to consider helping the States. I will just mention three. I \nwill certainly pursue those with the administration and my colleagues.\n  No. 1, States are getting killed on Medicaid costs. As unemployment \ngoes up, people are losing health care and more people are showing up \nasking for coverage under Medicaid, health care for low-income and \nunemployed people. There is a formula called the FMAP formula that \nspecifies what percentage of Medicaid is paid by the Federal Government \nand what percentage is paid by the States. It varies from State to \nState. For my State, the Feds pay roughly half and the State pays half \nof Medicaid costs. In some cases, the\n\n[[Page S1766]]\n\nStates pay less, in some cases maybe a bit more.\n  We ought to change that formula for a year or two, as the States try \nto get on their feet and provide a little bit more help--not forever, \nnot permanently, but to make a modification for a year or two in the \nshare of the Medicaid cost we are willing to bear, not by 10, 20 \npercent, but by a couple of percent.\n  Another area where we can help States--and it has a lot to do with \ndoing what is right and also what is in the best long-term economic \ninterest--is making sure we fully fund No Child Left Behind, something \nwe debated at some length just last week. States don't need unfunded \nmandates. As their revenues are dropping, most States have adopted \nbasic standards for math, science, English, and social studies, and \nthey are measuring student progress towards those standards. States are \nunder pressure to cut back on the extra learning time they put in \nplace. They are under pressure to cut back on the funding they are \nproviding for Head Start and early childhood education.\n  It is important for us to make sure we meet our commitment for \nfunding No Child Left Behind, so as the States struggle to come up with \nthe money to pay for a whole host of costs, at least we are meeting our \nside of the bargain for funding education.\n  One other area the President spoke to, at least indirectly, was State \nand local frontline defenders--police, paramedics, fire, and others--\nwhen we have our next terrorist attack. Unfortunately, we probably \nwill. The people who will be confronted with that initiative aren't so \nmuch those of us here in Washington; it is going to be the cop on the \nbeat, the paramedic on duty, the fire station that gets the call; they \nare going to be among the first.\n\n  It is important that we do what we can and need to, working through \nour new Department of Homeland Security and funding the problems we \nhave authorized, listening to the States where they believe their need \nis the greatest, and be responsive to that.\n  Yesterday, the Congressional Budget Office, on the heels of the \nPresident's State of the Union Message, brought up a subject that he \ndid not; that is, the size of our budget deficit. The President did not \nbring up the size of our trade deficit either. The size of the Nation's \ntrade deficit last month was about $40 billion. It wasn't that long \nago, if we had had a trade deficit of $40 billion for 1 year, not 1 \nmonth, people would have been alarmed. A lot of alarms would have gone \noff in this city and around the country. Our trade deficit last month \nwas $40 billion. Our trade deficit last year reached close to $400 \nbillion. It has been a long time since we had a surplus on the trade \nside--far too long. But the numbers are going in the wrong direction. \nWe need to be mindful of that and concerned.\n  The budget deficit numbers are going the wrong way, too. It wasn't \nthat long ago that they were actually going in the right direction. \nStarting in 1998 and 1999, 2000 and 2001, we actually had budget \nsurpluses for the first time since 1969. I don't recall, hearing the \nPresident's State of the Union Message, his mentioning the issue of \nbudget deficits or trade deficits. If he did, I missed it. But to be \nhonest with the American people and ourselves, they are important. They \nare problems. They are concerns. They need to be addressed.\n  The President, in an effort to try to get the economy moving again, \nhas said what we ought to do is cut taxes. He has laid out a proposal \nfor doing that, with getting rid of the double taxation of dividend \nincome. In theory, it is not a bad idea, although his approach is one I \nam not sure is the best. It may make more sense to let businesses \nexpense their dividend payments as they do interest payments, if they \nare interested in getting rid of this imbalance that is favored toward \ndebt by companies. But I don't want to quarrel with that.\n  We have cut taxes two times now: 2001, a large tax cut; 2002, a \nsmaller tax cut bill. It is like the quarterback or the coach who is \ncalling a play. The President called the play in 2001: We have an \neconomy that is not doing well; let's cut taxes. The economy is not \ndoing well; let's cut taxes in 2002. The economy is still not doing \nwell; let's cut taxes again in 2003.\n  As a former Governor, I used to cut taxes fairly regularly in my \nState. We cut them for 7 out of the 8 years I was privileged to be \nGovernor. But we also cut taxes in a way that was consistent with a \nbalanced budget, in a way that was balanced, fair, and equitable. We \ncut taxes in a way that we believed would stimulate the economy, the \neconomic development and creation of jobs. We had a litmus test. A \nsimilar litmus test needs to be applied to this proposal. Will it \nstimulate the economy in the near term? Is it consistent with a \nbalanced budget over the long haul? Is it broad based, equitable? And \nis there anything in there to help the States as a result of passing \nthose tax cuts in 2001 and 2002? because so many State budgets or State \ntax laws piggyback on Federal tax laws. They are interconnected. When \nwe cut Federal taxes, we also cut States taxes. As they are struggling \nto make ends meet, we are prepared to cut taxes again, another $4 or $5 \nbillion added to an already heavy burden for States.\n\n  I have talked of late with a lot of business leaders in my State, and \nthey acknowledge that the idea of eliminating the double taxation of \ndividends is probably the right thing to do. Intellectually, a number \nof them have said--and I agree in the context of overall tax reform--it \nmay make sense. Doing it just on its own to stimulate the economy maybe \ndoesn't. At least it won't have the kind of near-term effect for which \nmany would hope.\n  What a number of people a whole lot smarter than I, who study the \neconomy and economics, study our banking system, and who run companies, \nhave said is, more than a tax cut right now to get our economy moving, \nmore than a spending package to get our economy moving, we need to get \nrid of the uncertainty we face, not so much here at home, although the \nthreat of terrorism is part of it, but around the world.\n  The President spent a lot of time talking about uncertainty--with \nrespect to North Korea, an effort to pursue a diplomatic solution, \nwhich I believe is the right approach, and then with respect to Iraq, \nthe approach he spoke to and which has been discussed here today. For \nmyself, the weapons of mass destruction that Iraq and Saddam Hussein \nhad just a few years ago, in the late 1990s, acknowledged they had a \nfew years ago, I believe they still have. They have them hidden. They \nhave not reported them. They have not destroyed them. I believe they \nhave them.\n  The question is: What do we do to get rid of them? Take them away \nfrom Saddam Hussein, and his ability to deliver them in the region or \noutside that region?\n  On this one, we may have a difference of opinion, although I am not \nsure just how broad those differences are. I heard the President talk \nabout his request of Colin Powell to go to the United Nations on \nFebruary 5 and give an address with respect to what we believe we ought \nto do, given the early results from the inspections, what we should do \nnext at the United Nations, the Security Council, for our country.\n  Sitting in the House Chamber, I heard the President say he is going \nto send the Secretary of State over to the United Nations on February 5 \nto give an address. I wonder if this is going to be like something that \nhappened about 40 years ago when John Kennedy was our President and he \nsent Adlai Stevenson, Ambassador to the United Nations, as we were \nworking on another potential military altercation, this one a very \nserious one between the United States and the Soviet Union, as we \nbelieved the Soviets were introducing intermediate-range ballistic \nmissiles into Cuba which could target the United States. We asserted \nthis was what the Soviets were trying to do. They denied it. We \nattempted to gain intelligence information, which was difficult to come \nby. Finally, we hit pay dirt. Intelligence flights over Cuba captured \nnot only missiles but the site preparation that was on going. Our U.N. \nAmbassador, Adlai Stevenson, presented that information to his \ncolleagues at the U.N. in one of the most famous exchanges I have ever \nheard at the U.N. When the Soviet Ambassador was confronted with these \nphotographs of all this material, larger and larger photographs, he \nsaid he needed more time to understand the translation of the \naccusations coming from our Ambassador. He said he needed more time to \nunderstand what he was hearing through the earphones. Adlai Stevenson \nsaid, ``You\n\n[[Page S1767]]\n\nknow what I am saying, and you know what these pictures say, and I will \nwait until hell freezes over.''\n\n  That is a long time, until hell freezes over. I am not going to \nsuggest we should wait that long for the Iraqis to fess up and turn \nover and enable to be destroyed that which I think they clearly harbor. \nBut I hope, just as the President of 40 years ago chose to continue to \nwork through the U.N., this President will do so as well.\n  Going back to the economy, the best thing we can do to get the \neconomy moving is to eliminate all this uncertainty that flows out of \nIraq--hopefully, peacefully, but in the end, if need be, through war. \nHopefully, we can do it without going to war. If it is necessary, we \nshould be prepared to do that. I have said all along, one of the \nreasons we were so effective in the Persian Gulf war--which I supported \nas a House Member and voted for as a House Member--I think one of the \nreasons we were successful there, and in Afghanistan, is we didn't do \nit by ourselves. It was not just unilaterally, us by ourselves. We led \nan armada of nations. If there is to be a military altercation, our \nchances for success are better enhanced if we do not do it alone and if \nwe have the blessing of the U.N. and if we have broad-based military \nsupport from around the globe. I worry about the human cost to our \nsoldiers, sailors, and airmen in a war. We are going to win and, I \nthink, without a great deal of difficulty. Taking the cities might be a \nlot more dangerous, and we face a threat from the biological and \nchemical weapons he has. Hopefully, we will win without a huge cost in \nlives.\n  The financial cost will be lowered if we have others by our side. \nWhat I am concerned about maybe more than anything is the cost of the \npostwar, the morning after, when we help try to put Humpty-Dumpty back \ntogether in a country that has no democratic memory or institutions, a \nlot of dissenting voices and ethnic groups--pulling them together and \ntrying to help them become a democracy. It is going to take time, \nmoney, and a lot of patience. I don't want the U.S. to be doing that by \nitself.\n  How does all this fit into the economy? We can offer businesses all \nkinds of tax incentives to make investments and other decisions. When \nthey are faced with uncertainty, they are not going to make the kind of \ninvestments we want them to make and they ought to be making. The \nsooner we can resolve--hopefully peacefully and, if not, through the \nuse of force--the situation in the Middle East, I think that probably \naugurs better for the economy.\n  Having said that, let's be careful in our rush to judgment and keep \nin mind that our chances for early success, and for reducing the loss \nof life to Americans, and our chances for reducing out-of-pocket costs \nfor the war and the postwar occupation are diminished if we have a lot \nof others with us. Especially in the next few weeks, we need to \ncontinue to be patient and share our intelligence with the inspectors \nand give them the best information for them to do their job on the \nground.\n  I thank the Chair for the time. I look forward to yielding back \nwhatever time I have and hearing from my friend and colleague from New \nMexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as I understood the President in his \nState of the Union speech earlier this week, it is his intention to \nbegin military action against Iraq sometime in the near future. That \nstated intention of the President causes me some grave concern, and I \nwanted to come to the Senate floor today and express that concern.\n  Let me begin by stating the propositions with which we all agree. \nFirst, I think we all agree Saddam Hussein is a brutal despot who has \nterrorized his own people and has threatened his neighboring States for \nmany years. Second, whether or not Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass \ndestruction in a readily usable form at this time, we must assume that \ngiven the opportunity he will obtain those weapons. Third, it is very \nmuch in our interest as a Nation, and in the interest of our allies, \nthat Saddam Hussein be prevented from acquiring or maintaining those \nweapons.\n  But the question before the country today is narrower than these \npropositions. The question before the country is whether we should cut \nshort the inspection process that is currently underway. The U.N. \ninspection process is a process that we rightly insisted upon in our \nearlier deliberations with the Security Council. So the question is \nwhether we should cut short that inspection process and begin a \nmilitary action to remove Saddam Hussein and his regime from power.\n  The President has moved aggressively to prepare this Nation for war. \nThe total number of personnel who have been either ordered to deploy, \nor who have been put on alert to do so, is roughly 148,000. There are \nroughly 23,000 marines en route to the Persian Gulf aboard three major \ntask forces. There are roughly 25,000 sailors and aviators attached to \nthe various carrier battle groups and amphibious task forces that are \neither en route to the region, on standby, or are on surge status. \nThese forces include some 175 aircraft of all types and over 1,000 VLS \nlaunch tubes carrying nearly 500 cruise missiles.\n  So steps have been taken to prepare us militarily for war. Today, we \nare, simply put, on the brink of war. But while these military \npreparations have occurred, there has also been a parallel effort going \non through the U.N. to ascertain what weapons of mass destruction \nSaddam Hussein holds, where those weapons are located, and what threat \nthose weapons pose to his neighbors and to other free nations.\n  We have come to a difficult decision point. The Pentagon is advising \nthe President that military preparations are nearly complete. The \nPresident must decide whether this country should proceed militarily in \nthe next few weeks or whether we should continue to support the efforts \nof U.N. inspectors to carry out the instructions that were given them \nby the U.N. Security Council, on which we sit.\n  In my view, the President should allow the U.N. inspectors to \ncontinue their work. If they are denied access to sites they wish to \ninspect, then the use of military force will be justified. If they find \nsubstantial evidence of a weapons program that threatens Iraq's \nneighbors, then we should join with those neighbors in eliminating that \nthreat. But up until this date, up until today, neither of these \ncircumstances prevails. The inspectors themselves have so stated, and \nthey have asked for additional time to complete their work.\n  The decision the President makes on going to war with Iraq will be \nthe first test of the new National Security Strategy that was issued by \nthe White House in September of last year. In that document, the \nPresident acknowledges that the legitimacy of preemptive military \naction depends ``on the existence of an imminent threat.''\n  Right after that statement appears in this document, however, the \ndocument speaks of ``adapting the concept of imminent threat.'' How \nmuch adaptation of that concept is wise? How much adaptation of that \nconcept makes sense for ourselves and our allies as a precedent for the \nfuture?\n  This National Security Strategy document that the administration \nissued in September of last year goes on to talk about our willingness \nas a nation to take military action to preempt emerging threats. Here \nthe President is contemplating, in the circumstance before us today, \nmilitary action not to meet a specific identified military threat but \nto depose a hostile government, even though no imminent military threat \nhas been identified.\n  In his State of the Union Address, the President framed the issue as \nbeing whether ``war is forced upon us.'' He stated that, ``If war is \nforced upon us, we will fight with the full force and might of the U.S. \nmilitary--and we will prevail.'' I, and I am sure most Americans, agree \nwith that statement. But in my view, as of this date, war has not been \nforced upon us. It is not credible for us to assert as a nation that \nwar has been forced upon us.\n  The U.N. inspection process proceeds. If there is evidence of an \nimminent threat that requires us to take preemptive military action, I \nhave not seen\n\n[[Page S1768]]\n\nthat evidence. Many Americans and many of our allies also have been \nunpersuaded by the evidence they have seen.\n  The more willing we are to assert the right to start a war to change \nthe government of a sovereign state, the more we risk encouraging \npreemptive action by other nations against governments they wish to \ndepose. And the less we need to identify an imminent threat before \nbeginning a war, the more we undermine efforts to avoid unprovoked \nconflict in the future.\n  The President was right to go to the United Nations and to insist \nthat U.N. inspectors return to Iraq. His latest decision to send \nSecretary Powell to the Security Council to present evidence of the \nthreat posed by Iraq is also proper, and I look forward to hearing what \nthat evidence is. But unless that evidence demonstrates a threat that \nrequires military action now, the wise course is for us to hold off on \nthat military action and allow the U.N. inspectors to do their work.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise to share with my colleagues my \nvery great concern over ties between Iraq's probable possession of \nbiological and chemical weapons and the potentially catastrophic \nactions taken by the Reagan and Bush, Sr., administrations, including \nthe active assistance of then ``special envoy'' and now Secretary of \nDefense Donald Rumsfeld. This arming of Saddam Hussein with weapons of \nmass destruction by the Reagan and Bush, Sr., administrations has now \nbeen disclosed from what were previously classified documents, as \nreported recently by the Washington Post.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Washington Post article be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Dec. 30, 2002]\n\n   U.S. Had Key Role in Iraq Buildup; Trade in Chemical Arms Allowed \n                  Despite Their Use on Iranians, Kurds\n\n                           (By Michael Dobbs)\n\n       High on the Bush administration's list of justifications \n     for war against Iraq are President Saddam Hussein's use of \n     chemical weapons, nuclear and biological programs, and his \n     contacts with international terrorists. What U.S. officials \n     rarely acknowledge is that these offenses date back to a \n     period when Hussein was seen in Washington as a valued ally.\n       Among the people instrumental in tilting U.S. policy toward \n     Baghdad during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war was Donald H. \n     Rumsfeld, now defense secretary, whose December 1983 meeting \n     with Hussein as a special presidential envoy paved the way \n     for normalization of U.S.-Iraqi relations. Declassified \n     documents show that Rumsfeld traveled to Baghdad at a time \n     when Iraq was using chemical weapons on an ``almost daily'' \n     basis in defiance of international conventions.\n       The story of U.S. involvement with Saddam Hussein in the \n     years before his 1990 attack on Kuwait--which included large-\n     scale intelligence sharing, supply of cluster bombs through a \n     Chilean front company, and facilitating Iraq's acquisition of \n     chemical and biological precursors--is a topical example of \n     the underside of U.S. foreign policy. It is a world in which \n     deals can be struck with dictators, human rights violations \n     sometimes overlooked, and accommodations made with arms \n     proliferators, all on the principle that the ``enemy of my \n     enemy is my friend.'' Throughout the 1980s, Hussein's Iraq \n     was the sworn enemy of Iran, then still in the throes of an \n     Islamic revolution. U.S. officials saw Baghdad as a bulwark \n     against militant Shiite extremism and the fall of pro-\n     American states such as Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and even \n     Jordan--a Middle East version of the ``domino theory'' in \n     Southeast Asia. That was enough to turn Hussein into a \n     strategic partner and for U.S. diplomats in Baghdad to \n     routinely refer to Iraqi forces as ``the good guys,'' in \n     contrast to the Iranians, who were depicted as ``the bad \n     guys.''\n       A review of thousands of declassified government documents \n     and interviews with former policymakers shows that U.S. \n     intelligence and logistical and support a crucial role in \n     shoring up Iraqi defenses against the ``human wave'' attacks \n     by suicidal Iranian troops. The administrations of Ronald \n     Reagan and George H.W. Bush authorized the sale to Iraq of \n     numerous items that had both military and civilian \n     applications, including poisonous chemicals and deadly \n     biological viruses, such as anthrax and bubonic plague.\n       Opinions differ among Middle East experts and former \n     government officials about the pre-Iraqi tilt, and whether \n     Washington could have done more to stop the flow to Baghdad \n     of technology for building weapons of mass destruction.\n       ``It was a horrible mistake then, but we have got it right \n     now,'' says Kenneth M. Pollack, a former CIA military analyst \n     and author of ``The Threatening Storm,'' which makes the case \n     for war with Iraq. ``My fellow [CIA] analysts and I were \n     warning at the time that Hussein was a very nasty character. \n     We were constantly fighting the State Department.''\n       ``Fundamentally, the policy was justified,'' argues David \n     Newton, a former U.S. ambassador to Baghdad, who runs an \n     anti-Hussein radio station in Prague. ``We were concerned \n     that Iraq should not lose the war with Iran, because that \n     would have threatened Saudi Arabia and the Gulf. Our long-\n     term hope was that Hussein's government would become less \n     repressive and more responsible.''\n       What makes present-day Hussein different from the Hussein \n     of the 1980s, say Middle East experts, is the mellowing of \n     the Iranian revolution and the August 1990 invasion of Kuwait \n     that transformed the Iraqi dictator, almost overnight, from \n     awkward ally into mortal enemy. In addition, the United \n     States itself has changed. As a result of the Sept. 11, 2001 \n     terrorist attacks on New York and Washington, U.S. \n     policymakers take a much more alarmist view of the threat \n     posed by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\n       When the Iran-Iraq war began in September 1980, with an \n     Iraqi attack across the Shatt al Arab waterway that leads to \n     the Persian Gulf, the United States was a bystander. The \n     United States did not have diplomatic relations with either \n     Baghdad or Teheran. U.S. officials had almost as little \n     sympathy for Hussein's dictatorial brand of Arab nationalism \n     as for the Islamic fundamentalism espoused by Iran's \n     Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. As long as the two countries \n     fought their way to a stalemate, nobody in Washington was \n     disposed to intervene.\n       By the summer of 1982, however, the strategic picture had \n     changed dramatically. After its initial gains, Iraq was on \n     the defensive, and Iranian troops had advanced to within a \n     few miles of Basra, Iraq's second largest city. U.S. \n     intelligence information suggested the Iranians might achieve \n     a breakthrough on the Basra front, destabilizing Kuwait, the \n     Gulf states, and even Saudi Arabia, thereby threatening U.S. \n     oil supplies.\n       ``You have to understand the geostrategic context, which \n     was very different from where we are now,'' said Howard \n     Teicher, a former National Security Council official, who \n     worked on Iraqi policy during the Reagan administration. \n     ``Realpolitik dictated that we act to prevent the situation \n     from getting worse.''\n       To prevent an Iraqi collapse, the Reagan administration \n     supplied battlefield intelligence on Iranian troop buildups \n     to the Iraqis, sometimes through third parties such as Saudi \n     Arabia. The U.S. tilt toward Iraq was enshrined in National \n     Security Decision Directive 114 of Nov. 26, 1983, one of the \n     few important Reagan era foreign policy decisions that still \n     remains classified. According to former U.S. officials, the \n     directive stated that the United States would do ``whatever \n     was necessary and legal'' to prevent Iraq from losing the war \n     with Iran.\n       The presidential directive was issued amid a flurry of \n     reports that Iraqi forces were using chemical weapons in \n     their attempts to hold back the Iranians. In principle, \n     Washington was strongly opposed to chemical warfare, a \n     practice outlawed by the 1925 Geneva Protocol. In practice, \n     U.S. condemnation of Iraqi use of chemical weapons ranked \n     relatively low on the scale of administration priorities, \n     particularly compared with the all-important goal of \n     preventing an Iranian victory.\n       Thus, on Nov. 1, 1983, a senior State Department official, \n     Jonathan T. Howe, told Secretary of State George P. Shultz \n     that intelligence reports showed that Iraqi troops were \n     resorting to ``almost daily use of CW'' against the Iranians. \n     But the Reagan administration had already committed itself to \n     a large-scale diplomatic and political overture to Baghdad, \n     culminating in several visits by the president's recently \n     appointed special envoy to the Middle East, Donald H. \n     Rumsfeld.\n       Secret talking points prepared for the first Rumsfeld visit \n     to Baghdad enshrined some of the language from NSDD 114, \n     including the statement that the United States would regard \n     ``any major reversal of Iraq's fortunes as a strategic defeat \n     for the West.'' When Rumsfeld finally met with Hussein on \n     Dec. 20, he told the Iraqi leader that Washington was ready \n     for a resumption of full diplomatic relations, according to a \n     State Department report of the conversation. Iraqi leaders \n     later described themselves as ``extremely pleased'' with the \n     Rumsfeld visit, which had ``elevated U.S.-Iraqi relations to \n     a new level.''\n       In a September interview with CNN, Rumsfeld said he \n     ``cautioned'' Hussein about the use of chemical weapons, a \n     claim at odds with declassified State Department notes of his \n     90-minute meeting with the Iraqi leader. A Pentagon \n     spokesman, Brian Whitman, now says that Rumsfeld raised the \n     issue not with Hussein, but with Iraqi foreign minister Tariq \n     Aziz. The State Department notes show that he mentioned it \n     largely in passing as one of several matters that \n     ``inhibited'' U.S. efforts to assist Iraq.\n       Rumsfeld has also said he had ``nothing to do'' with \n     helping Iraq in its war against Iran. Although former U.S. \n     officials agree that Rumsfeld was not one of the architects \n     of the Reagan administration's tilt toward Iraq--he was a \n     private citizen when he was appointed Middle East envoy--the \n     documents show that his visits to Baghdad led to\n\n[[Page S1769]]\n\n     closer U.S.-Iraqi cooperation on a wide variety of fronts. \n     Washington was willing to resume diplomatic relations \n     immediately, but Hussein insisted on delaying such a step \n     until the following year.\n       As part of its opening to Baghdad, the Reagan \n     administration removed Iraq from the State Department \n     terrorism list in February 1982, despite heated objections \n     from Congress. Without such a move, Teicher says, it would \n     have been ``impossible to take even the modest steps we were \n     contemplating'' to channel assistance to Baghdad. Iraq--along \n     with Syria, Libya and South Yemen--was one of four original \n     countries on the list, which was first drawn up in 1979.\n       Some former U.S. officials say that removing Iraq from the \n     terrorism list provided an incentive to Hussein to expel the \n     Palestinian guerrilla leader Abu Nidal from Baghdad in 1983. \n     On the other hand, Iraq continued to play host to alleged \n     terrorists throughout the '80s. The most notable was Abu \n     Abbas, leader of the Palestine Liberation Front, who found \n     refuge in Baghdad after being expelled from Tunis for \n     masterminding the 1985 hijacking of the cruise ship Achille \n     Lauro, which resulted in the killing of an elderly American \n     tourist.\n       While Rumsfeld was talking to Hussein and Aziz in Baghdad, \n     Iraqi diplomats and weapons merchants were fanning out across \n     Western capitals for a diplomatic charm offensive-cum-arms \n     buying spree. In Washington, the key figure was the Iraqi \n     charg d'affaires, Nizar Hamdoon, a fluent English speaker who \n     impressed Reagan administration officials as one of the most \n     skillful lobbyists in town.\n       ``He arrived with a blue shirt and a white tie, straight \n     out of the mafia,'' recalled Geoffrey Kemp, a Middle East \n     specialist in the Reagan White House. ``Within six months, he \n     was hosting suave dinner parties at his residence, which he \n     parlayed into a formidable lobbying effort. He was \n     particularly effective with the American Jewish community.''\n       One of Hamdoon's favorite props, says Kemp, was a green \n     Islamic scarf allegedly found on the body of an Iranian \n     soldier. The scarf was decorated with a map of the Middle \n     East showing a series of arrows pointing toward Jerusalem. \n     Hamdoon used to ``parade the scarf'' to conferences and \n     congressional hearings as proof that an Iranian victory over \n     Iraq would result in ``Israel becoming a victim along with \n     the Arabs.''\n       According to a sworn court affidavit prepared by Teicher in \n     1995, the United States ``actively supported the Iraqi war \n     effort by supplying the Iraqis with billions of dollars of \n     credits, by providing military intelligence and advice to the \n     Iraqis, and by closely monitoring third country arms sales to \n     Iraq to make sure Iraq had the military weaponry required.'' \n     Teicher said in the affidavit that former CIA director \n     William Casey used a Chilean company, Cardoen, to supply Iraq \n     with cluster bombs that could be used to disrupt the Iranian \n     human wave attacks. Teicher refuses to discuss the affidavit.\n       At the same time the Reagan administration was facilitating \n     the supply of weapons and military components to Baghdad, it \n     was attempting to cut off supplies to Iran under ``Operation \n     Staunch.'' Those efforts were largely successful, despite the \n     glaring anomaly of the 1986 Iran-contra scandal when the \n     White House publicly admitted trading arms for hostages, in \n     violation of the policy that the United States was trying to \n     impose on the rest of the world.\n       Although U.S. arms manufacturers were not as deeply \n     involved as German or British companies in selling weaponry \n     to Iraq, the Reagan administration effectively turned a blind \n     eye to the export of ``dual use'' items such as chemical \n     precursors and steel tubes that can have military and \n     civilian applications. According to several former officials, \n     the State and Commerce departments promoted trade in such \n     items as a way to boost U.S. exports and acquire political \n     leverage over Hussein.\n       When United Nations weapons inspectors were allowed into \n     Iraq after the 1991 Gulf War, they compiled long lists of \n     chemicals, missile components, and computers from American \n     suppliers, including such household names as Union Carbide \n     and Honeywell, which were being used for military purposes.\n       A 1994 investigation by the Senate Banking Committee turned \n     up dozens of biological agents shipped to Iraq during the \n     mid-'80s under license from the Commerce Department, \n     including various strains of anthrax, subsequently identified \n     by the Pentagon as a key component of the Iraqi biological \n     warfare program. The Commerce Department also approved the \n     export of insecticides to Iraq, despite widespread suspicions \n     that they were being used for chemical warfare.\n       The fact that Iraq was using chemical weapons was hardly a \n     secret. In February 1984, an Iraqi military spokesman \n     effectively acknowledged their use by issuing a chilling \n     warning to Iran. ``The invaders should know that for ever \n     harmful insect, there is an insecticide capable of \n     annihilating it . . . and Iraq possesses this annihilation \n     insecticide.''\n       In late 1987, the Iraqi air force began using chemical \n     agents against Kurdish resistance forces in northern Iraq \n     that had formed a loose alliance with Iran, according to \n     State Department reports. The attacks, which were part of a \n     ``scorched earth'' strategy to eliminate rebel-controlled \n     villages, provoked outrage on Capitol Hill and renewed \n     demands for sanctions against Iraq. The State Department and \n     White House were also outraged--but not to the point of doing \n     anything that might seriously damage relations with Baghdad.\n       ``The U.S.-Iraqi relationship is . . . important to our \n     long-term political and economic objectives,'' \n     Assistant Secretary of State Richard W. Murphy wrote in a \n     September 1988 memorandum that addressed the chemical \n     weapons question. ``We believe that economic sanctions \n     will be useless or counterproductive to influence the \n     Iraqis.''\n       Bush administration spokesmen have cited Hussein's use of \n     chemical weapons ``against his own people''--and particularly \n     the March 1988 attack on the Kurdish village of Halabjah--to \n     bolster their argument that his regime presents a ``grave and \n     gathering danger'' to the United States.\n       The Iraqis continued to use chemical weapons against the \n     Iranians until the end of the Iran-Iraq war. A U.S. air force \n     intelligence officer, Rick Francona, reported finding \n     widespread use of Iraqi nerve gas when he toured the Al Faw \n     peninsula in southern Iraq in the summer of 1988, after its \n     recapture by the Iraqi army. The battlefield was littered \n     with atropine injectors used by panicky Iranian troops as an \n     antidote against Iraqi nerve gas attacks.\n       Far from declining, the supply of U.S. military \n     intelligence to Iraq actually expanded in 1988, according to \n     a 1999 book by Francna, ``Ally to Adversary: an Eyewitness \n     Account of Iraq's Fall from Grace,'' Informed sources said \n     much of the battlefield intelligence was channeled to the \n     Iraqis by the CIA office in Baghdad.\n       Altough U.S. export controls to Iraq were tightened up in \n     the late 1980s, thee were still many loopholes. In December \n     1988, Dow Chemical sold $1.5 million of pesticides to Iraq, \n     despite U.S. government concerns that they could be used as \n     chemical warfare agents. An Export-Import Bank official \n     reported in a memorandum that he could find ``no reason'' to \n     stop the sale, despite evidence that the pesticides were \n     ``highly toxic'' to humans and would cause death ``from \n     asphyxiation.''\n       The U.S. policy of cultivating Hussein as a moderate and \n     reasonable Arab leader continued right up until he invaded \n     Kuwait in August 1990, documents show. When the then-U.S. \n     ambassador to Baghdad, April Glaspie, met with Hussein on \n     July 25, 1990, a week before the Iraqi attack on Kuwait, she \n     assured him that Bush ``wanted better and deeper relations,'' \n     according to an Iraqi transcript of the conversation. \n     ``President Bush is an intelligent man,'' the ambassador told \n     Hussein, referring to the father of the current president. \n     ``He is not going to declare an economic war against Iraq.''\n       ``Everybody was wrong in their assessment of Saddam,'' said \n     Joe Wilson, Glaspie's former deputy at the U.S. embassy in \n     Baghdad, and the last U.S. official to meet with Hussein. \n     ``Everybody in the Arab world told us that the best way to \n     deal with Saddam was to develop a set of economic and \n     commercial relationships that would have the effect of \n     moderating his behavior. History will demonstrate that this \n     was a miscalculation.''\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, my concern today is not to lay blame for \npast decisions which now place every American family, every American \ncommunity in very real jeopardy from these weapons of mass destruction \nand which now give rise to the clear possibility, if not great \nlikelihood, of war in Iraq with its attendant costs in lives of \ncombatants and innocent civilians alike. Rather, it is my concern that \nthis Senate and this Nation clearly understand how we arrived at this \npoint so that we might learn from our Nation's past tragic mistakes.\n  As Mr. Michael Dobbs of the Washington Post writes:\n\n       The story of U.S. involvement with Saddam Hussein in the \n     years before his 1990 attack on Kuwait--which included large-\n     scale intelligence sharing, supply of cluster bombs through a \n     Chilean front company, and facilitating Iraq's acquisition of \n     chemical and biological precursors--is a topical example of \n     the underside of U.S. foreign policy. It is a world in which \n     deals can be struck with dictators, human rights violations \n     sometimes overlooked, and accommodations made with arms \n     proliferators. . . .\n\n  The United States also provided billions of dollars in credits to \nhelp arm Iraq, ostensibly to assist with its war at that time against \nIran.\n  The review of declassified documents and interviews with former \npolicymakers:\n\n     reveals that the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George \n     H. W. Bush authorized the sale to Iraq of numerous items that \n     had both military and civilian applications, including \n     poisonous chemicals and deadly biological viruses, such as \n     anthrax and bubonic plague.\n\n  Anthrax and bubonic plague from the United States to Iraq.\n\n       The Reagan administration removed Iraq from the State \n     Department terrorism list in 1982 over the strong objections \n     of Congress. Despite this delisting, Iraq continued \n     throughout the 1980s to harbor terrorists, including even Abu \n     Abbas, leader of the Palestinian Liberation Front.\n       The Reagan administration effectively turned a blind eye to \n     the export of dual use items such as chemical precursors and \n     steel\n\n[[Page S1770]]\n\n     tubes that can have military and civilian applications. . . . \n     When United Nations weapons inspectors were allowed into Iraq \n     after the 1991 Gulf war, they compiled long lists of \n     chemicals, missile components, and computers from American \n     suppliers.\n\n  Mr. President, sadly, there is no new precedent in our Government \nusing our citizens' tax dollars to finance the purchase of weaponry for \nantidemocratic, antihuman rights, and unstable foreign nations only to \nsee their short-term friendship disappear and to have them become \nenemies to the United States and the Western World. What is truly \nshocking here, however, is that the very possession of chemical and \nbiological weapons of mass destruction, which is the justification for \na new war in Iraq and which places in jeopardy the safety of American \nfamilies, American communities, and American military personnel, is, in \nlarge measure, the consequence of decisions made by the Reagan and Bush \nadministrations.\n  As we speak, tens of thousands of U.S. gulf war veterans continue to \nsuffer from exposure to chemical agents over a decade ago. We in \nCongress debate whether and how to inoculate hundreds of thousands, if \nnot millions, of Americans to protect them from biological weapons that \ntheir own Government helped create in Iraq.\n  It is one thing that our Nation would have provided cluster bombs and \nconventional weaponry to Saddam Hussein--it no doubt seemed important \nand strategically helpful to the purpose of stabilizing the Middle East \nduring the 1980's. But how can members of this Senate look members of \nour military in the eye--and I include my own son, a sergeant in the \n101st Airborne and a veteran of Bosnia, Kosovo and Afghanistan--and \nacknowledge that these past administrations, albeit without \ncongressional knowledge or consent, allowed Iraq to acquire the \nanthrax, and bubonic plague viruses?\n  The circumstance our Nation now faces, from the threats of Iraqi \nweapons of mass destruction as well as the possibility that these \nweapons have or will fall into the hands of Al-Qaida or other non-state \nterrorist organizations, are to a great degree, circumstances of our \nown making. Obviously, no American administration has ever supported \nterrorism against our own people, though interfering with Iraq's use of \nthese weapons against many of its own people was apparently not a \nmatter of first concern to the U.S.\n  The lesson should be clear--to the extent that the U.S. arms the \nworld, it undertakes a risk that those weapons could be used against \nour own citizens. While helping proven democratic allies to defend \nthemselves will always be a legitimate role for the U.S., it is hard to \nimagine a lesson driven home more profoundly than we find today that \narming non-democracies is a much greater risk, and arming non-\ndemocracies with weapons of chemical and biological warfare capability \nis an outrageous and utterly unacceptable risk to the U.S. and the \nworld. It may be impossible for our Nation to avoid reaping what is has \nsown in the past, but this administration, this Congress and the \nAmerican people must be united now in committing never again to be even \na unwitting instrument of chemical, biological or nuclear terror in the \nworld.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today I will address a \ndifferent subject than has been addressed this morning. The Senate \nrecently passed a disaster assistance package consisting of $3.1 \nbillion to aid those affected by the worst drought since the Dust Bowl \nyears of the 1930s. Some have referred to this package as drought \ndisaster relief. I cannot quite call it drought relief because it does \nnot really provide drought relief. It may provide some arid condition \nrelief and some oasis assistance, but I cannot bring myself to call it \nreal drought relief, for two reasons: No. 1, because $3.1 billion is \ninadequate. It is not enough. No. 2, it does not do enough for farmers \nand ranchers who are actually suffering the losses due to the \ndevastating drought.\n  I decided to give the drought a name, and I gave it the name \n``David'' to give it an identity like other natural disasters and to \nshow that this drought, the same as a hurricane, required immediate \nemergency Federal assistance.\n  Several of my colleagues wore Drought David ribbons that I \ndistributed to them to remind all Senators of the severe impact of the \ndrought, and I thank those who proudly wore them. Back home, the \nnewspaper Journal Star in Lincoln thought my proposal to name the \ndrought was worth asking readers to submit their suggestions, and many \ncreative suggestions were submitted but one stood out.\n  For Shannon Sutherland of Lincoln, the drought summons up thoughts of \nthe devil in hell. Among her suggestions was ``The Devil's Bull's Eye'' \nin reference to the drought maps looking like a bull's eye right over \nNebraska. The Journal Star reported that on Monday.\n  Shannon Sutherland is absolutely right. The Drought Monitor maps do \nresemble a target with Nebraska in the crosshairs, but our neighboring \nStates share the target, unfortunately.\n  If we go look at this chart, if that is not a bull's eye, I do not \nknow what a bull's eye would look like. Unfortunately, that bull's eye \nis right over my hometown of McCook, NE. As we can see, that area has \nsuffered the worst drought conditions in the State of Nebraska.\n  We are not alone. The darkest brown is where the worst conditions are \nbeing experienced, and even though this disaster assistance was passed \nlast week and is now over in the House, the drought continues. I think \nwe have a tendency at times to think when we have passed something, \nthat takes care of it. Well, first, it was inadequate to take care of \nthe past needs, and it certainly is not going to be adequate to take \ncare of the additional needs.\n  Yet despite my efforts to raise awareness--and others who have \nattempted to raise awareness--of this drought, the Senate still could \nnot manage to provide comprehensive drought assistance. I have come \ntoday to give my fellow Senators another opportunity to hear a message \nI received from one of my constituents, Bill Lueck of Arcadia, NE, in \nthe central part of the State. His words came in over the weekend. I \nspoke to him yesterday. His words are a powerful reminder of how the \nrecent drought relief bill fell short. He said:\n\n       I have some concerns over the current disaster portion of \n     the omnibus appropriations bill. According to the information \n     I got from the farm bureau, they're considering 42 percent of \n     AMTA payments to farmers. In our area here we have irrigated \n     producers who haven't suffered a loss, who are going to get \n     an additional payment and in the western part of the State \n     our cattle producers out here are hanging on by their \n     fingers. I assumed when they didn't consider the $6 \n     billion anymore and went to the $3.1 billion for \n     agriculture disaster aid that would go more to livestock \n     producers. We've got breeding stock on wholesale bull sale \n     that are down $1,000 average per bull around here.\n\n  To Bill Lueck, I say thank you. I could not have said it better \nmyself. I\n\n[[Page S1771]]\n\ncould not have drawn the focus more narrowly than he did. A $3.1 \nbillion drought package to address the devastation of a drought this \nextensive inevitably leaves out people who need help to make it through \nthe disaster.\n  The State of Nebraska will possibly receive about 8 percent of what \nwe need. We asked for $6 billion; we got $3.1 billion. The way in which \nit is being distributed to those who have severe needs and those who \nmay have some needs but in a uniform manner robs those who really are \nmost affected because they are going to be left with virtually nothing \ncompared to what they need.\n  Richard and Cecelia Carnes of Marquette, NE, which is very close to \nSargent, in the middle part of the State as well, also wrote to me \nregarding true drought assistance. These two truly represent the family \nfarmer. They have been in the farming business for the last 40 years, \nwith some of their land having been in the family for over 100 years.\n  Richard and Cecelia are afraid of losing their farm because of the \ndrought. They are going to sell half of their cow herd to pay for the \nexpenses they incurred during the drought last summer. The expenses are \nongoing, even though the income is not forthcoming. They have even gone \nso far as to invest their retirement savings into keeping their farm \nafloat, but without significant Federal assistance they cannot prevail, \neither in the short term or in the long term.\n  In their letter, they made a particularly good point that I will \nexpress at this time:\n\n       This drought is affecting everyone in the country. Whenever \n     there is a disaster for flooding, hurricanes, tornados, and \n     snowstorms the Government is there helping right away. A \n     drought is much worse since the farmer is the one producing \n     the food for the country.\n\n  People might take issue with whether a drought is worse than other \ndisasters, but I do not think anybody would disagree that a drought \nthat adversely affects the output of food is a disaster that we can ill \nafford.\n  They concluded the letter by saying that everyone needs to try \nfarming to truly understand what it is like. The Senate needs to \nrealize the seriousness of the problem and put themselves in the shoes \nof family farmers and ranchers like Richard and Cecelia. Perhaps then \nwe could provide real and substantial drought relief.\n  Yesterday, I spoke with my good friend and colleague Tom Osborne \nabout some concerns raised by House members on the fairness of the \ndrought package passed by the Senate. The Chairman of the House \nAgriculture Committee indicated that the Senate plan would provide \n``relief'' to farmers and ranchers who suffered no losses. The package \ntreats equally farmers and ranchers who did and did not suffer losses.\n  That's right. In a time of budget deficits and fiscal calamity, the \nSenate package squanders scarce resources and provides assistance to \nthose who actually need it. Farmers and ranchers in my State of \nNebraska are not pleased. Nebraska, perhaps, is one of the States hit \nhardest by Drought David. For two years, we have suffered under dry \nconditions and dwindling herds and crops. Some estimates say 20,000 of \nthe remaining 55,000 Nebraska family farms are likely to go under this \nyear because of the drought. The drought is a crisis--like a tornado, a \nhurricane, a flood, or a fire--and the climatologists indicate there is \nno relief in sight and it may be moving in an easterly direction.\n  Congressman Osborne has worked tirelessly to provide comprehensive \ndrought assistance. He left no stone unturned in his effort to find \nadequate funding. He knocked on every door, he made every phone call, \ndid everything that could be required of someone in his position. But \nthe message he received in return was that farmers and ranchers \nsuffering from drought needed a budgetary offset to receive Federal \nassistance. In the end, the Senate version found an offset, but didn't \nfind enough.\n  But we are practical people in Nebraska and around the country--$3.1 \nbillion is better than nothing; but it is not enough. Ask the people of \nthis country; people such as Bill Lueck and Richard and Cecelia Carnes, \nwho have seen this drought dry up their livelihood, and they will tell \nyou it is not enough. I hope my fellow Senator will join me in seeking \nto provide comprehensive drought relief in this Congress.\n  Nebraska State climatologists recently predicted we are about to face \na perfect drought this summer, sort of an oxymoron, but I think it \nrequires an explanation. It is the worst of all factors converging. If \nour family farmers and ranchers are going to survive this perfect \ndrought, we must provide better comprehensive drought relief now to \ntake care of the past losses and prepare them for the bump ahead they \nare going to face.\n  I have sent a letter to the House Agriculture Committee, Chairman \nGoodlatte, encouraging him to revisit the drought package. I know he is \nlooking very carefully at it. I would love to see the House pass a \nbetter drought assistance bill, devoid of special interests, set-\nasides, devoid of wasteful payments to those who need it least, and one \nthat provides real and comprehensive drought assistance to farmers and \nranchers who are teetering on the brink of disappearing forever, never \nto return. We need to provide the most assistance to those who need it \nmost.\n  In the State of the Union Address on Tuesday, the President delivered \na speech of 5,050 words. In that speech the word agriculture never \nappeared. I know he had a lot to say and he could not say everything.\n  He made a strong case in his remarks for the need to stimulate the \neconomy, both with short-term and long-term implications with tax cuts \nand other economic incentives. I am sure I will be supporting a number \nof those. How can we give a tax cut to farmers and ranchers with no \nincome? How can we stand by and watch the agricultural sector of the \neconomy wither under drought conditions? The best economic stimulus for \na rural state such as Nebraska and many other States right now is a \ncomprehensive rural development program coupled with real emergency \ndrought relief. Anything short of that will be a failure to our \nfarmers, our ranchers, and our Nation.\n  When it comes to making decisions, I will come down on the side of \nNebraska every time. If I have to choose between the White House and \nthe farmhouse, I choose the farmhouse. If I have to choose between the \nWhite House and the Statehouse, I choose the Statehouse. If I have to \nchoose between the White House and the schoolhouse, I will choose the \nschoolhouse. If I have to choose between the White House and the \naverage family house in Nebraska and throughout our country, I choose \nthe house of each and every Nebraskan and each and every American every \ntime.\n  My point is the Congress is here to make decisions, not just accept \nwhat is dictated as appropriate from the administration. The case of \nagriculture could not be a better example. Every Member in the Senate \nknows very well, better than any bureaucrat in the Office of Management \nand Budget, what is right for our States, our communities, and our \nconstituents.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/30/senate-section/article/S1771-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1771-S1775]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        COMMEMORATING DAVE HOPPE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today marks the last day in Congress of \none of the most remarkable people I have had the pleasure of meeting in \nmy entire life, one of the most decent, clearly one of the most \noutstanding individuals, and that is Dave Hoppe, who will be leaving \nCongress to go on to some other line of work after today.\n  We all got to know Dave as chief of staff of Senator Lott. He has \nlabored in the vineyards of the Senate and the House for 27 years. \nWithout ego, without a desire to go out and seek public office, like \nmany of us have done, Dave Hoppe devoted himself to improving America \nand to advancing the causes in which he believed by working through \nelected officials.\n  Dave is originally from Wisconsin. He graduated from Notre Dame in \n1973. By the way, his birthplace was Baraboo, Wisconsin, which also \nhappens to be the place where the Ringling Brothers Barnum and Bailey \ncircus began.\n  Dave came to Washington after graduating from Notre Dame to have an \nimpact on his country. As he ends his public service today, there is no \nquestion that he has had an enormous impact on the lives of all \nAmericans\n\n[[Page S1772]]\n\nthrough his work both in the House and the Senate.\n  There was a fascinating article in USA Today back in 1997 about the \nimpact Dave had on the reauthorization of the IDEA legislation that \nyear. He had a particular interest in it because his son, Gregory, \nsuffers from a disability. Dave, raising that son and living with the \ndisability his son had, had a particular awareness of how to adapt that \nlegislation to the needs of not only his son but a lot of other \nyoungsters who found themselves in the same dilemma.\n  This is a quote from Dave in the article:\n\n       Every night when I came home and every morning when I got \n     up, I saw who it could help.\n\n  He was talking about the IDEA reauthorization.\n  Referring to his son:\n\n       I know his horizons are not unlimited, but I want them to \n     be as great as they can be.\n\n  What a marvelous way to put Dave's hopes and aspirations for his son. \nDave and his wife, Karen, met in a carpool 21 years ago as conservative \nidealists. He worked for the House Republican study committee and she \nfor the Heritage Foundation. They were engaged 3 weeks after their \nfirst date and married December 30th, 1976--a truly remarkable family.\n  I expect others might want to include this USA Today article, but it \nis so interesting and so important I ask unanimous consent it be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From USA Today, June 27, 1997]\n\n                     A Law That Transcends Politics\n\n                           (By Richard Wolf)\n\n       Washington.--Six-year-old Gregory Hoppe climbs up on the \n     bench installed for him in his father's office and peers out \n     on the nation's capital.\n       But this isn't just any office. It's for the chief of staff \n     to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, perhaps the USA's most \n     powerful Republican.\n       And Gregory isn't just any child. The framed Senate roll-\n     call vote that hangs over his bench attests to that. Still \n     two weeks shy of his 7th birthday, Gregory already has played \n     a quiet but crucial role in overhauling the law that guides \n     special-education policy for 5.6 million disabled children in \n     America's public schools.\n       His father, David Hoppe, was the one who worked out the \n     final agreement between Congress and the Clinton \n     administration last month. But Gregory, born with Down \n     syndrome, was the new law's guiding light.\n       Call it Gregory's Law.\n       ``You had somebody who brought a deep life experience to \n     the whole process,'' says Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind. ``It's a \n     piece of legislation with a lot of heart in it.''\n       The roles played by David and Gregory Hoppe demonstrate the \n     powerful influence of private lives in public policy. Their \n     impact on the nation's special-education law is emblematic of \n     how elected and even non-elected officials work behind the \n     scenes here, using personal experiences to set the \n     legislative agenda and guide the political process.\n       And David Hoppe's role was significant for another reason: \n     at a time of public dismay over how Washington works--or \n     doesn't--in the glare of partisan politics and harsh \n     publicity, he became the rare individual to emerge heralded \n     by all sides.\n       ``This was a fair, decent, caring soul who was not going to \n     sell anybody down the river,'' says Robert Silverstein, the \n     Senate's top Democratic expert on disability issues.\n       But without Gregory's disability and his dad's doggedness, \n     President Clinton and Congress still might be embroiled in \n     emotional debate over the Individuals with Disabilities \n     Education Act (IDEA), signed into law earlier this month.\n       For two years, the bill had been caught between two \n     seemingly immovable forces: Leaders of the Republican \n     revolution, who wanted to help schools cut costs and curtail \n     classroom disruptions caused by disabled students, and \n     advocates for the disabled, who wanted expanded educational \n     opportunities.\n       It took a deeply religious, conservative Republican and a \n     highly motivated advocate for the disabled to bring the two \n     sides together. David Hoppe was both of those. And Gregory \n     was his inspiration.\n       ``Every night when I cam home and every morning when I got \n     up, I saw who is could help,'' Hoppe says of his son. ``I \n     know his horizons are not unlimited, but I want them to be as \n     great as they can be.''\n       Says Paul Marchand, director of The Arc, which represents \n     the mentally retarded: ``He might have been thinking, \n     `Everything that I do here may someday affect my child, and \n     if not my child, hundreds of thousands like him.' ''\n\n\n                  a strong family that weathers crisis\n\n       David and Karen Hoppe met in a car pool 21 years ago as \n     conservative idealists. He worked for the House Republican \n     Study Committee, she for the Heritage Foundation think tank. \n     They were engaged three weeks after their first date and \n     married Dec. 30, 1976. He would go on to work for a future \n     vice presidential nominee, Jack Kemp; she would go on to work \n     for a future vice president, Dan Quayle.\n       David rose through the Capitol Hill ranks, but Karen quit \n     when their first child, Katie, was born in 1981. Geoffrey \n     arrived two years later. The Hoppes--David is 45, Karen, 44--\n     are devoted parents to both ``big kids,'' as they call them \n     now. But it was Gregory's arrival in 1990 that gave the \n     suburban Burke, VA., couple a whole new outlook on life.\n       The night before Gregory's birth, the Hoppes happened to \n     pick up a copy of a Sesame Street parents guide featuring a \n     story on Down syndrome. ``I remember sitting on the edge of \n     the bed and saying, `I hope we don't have to deal with \n     anything like this,' ``Karen Hoppe says. They had forgone \n     pre-natal testing that could have determined Gregory's \n     disability, caused by an extra chromosome, because they do \n     not believe in abortion.\n       The next night, the Sesame Street story came to life. ``He \n     was four minutes old,'' she recalls. ``They came and told me \n     right away that they thought he had Down syndrome.''\n       Those first few minutes in Fairfax Hospital are etched in \n     the Hoppes' minds. With doctors buzzing around Gregory, the \n     couple made hasty plans to baptize him, in case he died. But \n     Gregory was tough; he overcame many of the complications \n     that accompany Down syndrome births.\n       Karen reacted emotionally, but her husband was then what he \n     has been ever since--a rock. ``I got one tear out of David,'' \n     she says, ``and that was it.''\n       Sen. Coats, Hoppe's boss at the time, recalls getting the \n     call from the hospital concerning Gregory's obvious \n     disability. ``I think the birth of Gregory was one of those \n     defining, life-changing experiences that open people's eyes \n     to a whole other world,'' he says. ``I don't think unless you \n     experience that, you can fully identify with that world.''\n       Today, the pain of that first realization is overwhelmed by \n     two other emotions common to families of disabled children--\n     exhaustion and achievement. The physical and mental \n     challenges can seem never-ending. Gregory didn't walk until \n     age 2\\1/2\\, didn't run until last summer, and only now is \n     learning to jump. Typical of children with Down syndrome, his \n     cognitive and language skills are significantly delayed.\n       But just as distinctive is his unconditional love for his \n     family. While his father helps run the country, Gregory rules \n     the roost at home. He's a ham, singing and dancing to his \n     favorite videos. Ask a question, and he taps his temple as if \n     deep in thought. He speaks in two- and three-world bursts \n     packed with meaning: ``Throw the ball!'' ``My turn!'' And the \n     every-welcome, ``Thank you, Mommy.''\n       Says Karen, ``I wouldn't have missed this for the world.''\n\n\n                   personal lives, professional lives\n\n       For David Hoppe, plunging into the middle of a two-year-old \n     battle over the IDEA law was a deeply personal crusade that \n     made use of his education, experience, philosophy, Catholic \n     faith and fatherhood.\n       The law was first enacted in 1975 to guarantee disabled \n     students equal access to public schools, no matter how \n     profound their afflictions.\n       Over the past 20 years, the number of students classified \n     as disabled has soared to 12.4% of the public-school \n     population of 44.7 million, including those with behavioral \n     and emotional problems. About 70% of them are taught in \n     regular classrooms, alongside non-disabled kids.\n       The costs are high: more than $32 billion, only $4 billion \n     of which comes from the federal government.\n       Since taking control of Congress in 1995, Republicans had \n     tried to change the law, motivated partly by anecdotes about \n     students with disabilities causing harm to others. One \n     teacher in West Virginia wound up in an emergency room; \n     another in North Carolina broke an arm.\n       But during the 104th Congress, a deal proved elusive. Not \n     even Bob Dole, a disability-rights advocate and master deal-\n     maker, could do it. On his final day as Senate GOP leader \n     before resigning to run for president last June, Dole \n     implored his colleagues to pass an IDEA bill.\n       ``Some issues transcend politics, foster a bipartisan \n     spirit and result in legislation that makes a real and \n     lasting difference,'' Dole said on the Senate floor. \n     ``Disability has always been one of those issues.'' But not \n     in 1996.\n       Enter David Hoppe. Already one of the busiest staffers on \n     Capitol Hill as Lott's top deputy, he saw the chance to break \n     the logjam over a law that will guide his son's education \n     into the next century and ``give kids born 20 years from now \n     even more opportunities than Greg has.''\n       Hoppe came with a rare advantage: knowledge of how to write \n     laws, drawn from 21 years on Capitol Hill, and knowledge of \n     how to help the disabled, drawn from nearly seven years as \n     Gregory's dad.\n       ``I was uniquely placed. I was a conservative, and I had a \n     child with a disability,'' he says. ``I looked at everything \n     . . . through a parent's eye: `Let's put Greg in this \n     situation.' ''\n       That was easy. In many cases, Gregory already had been \n     there.\n       ``I was at the meeting where Gregory was given his label,'' \n     Hoppe recalls, with a rare, small show of emotion. That was \n     in 1995,\n\n[[Page S1773]]\n\n     when Gregory was 4 and aging out of preschool. He was labeled \n     ``MR,'' for mild retardation. His father, who knew it was \n     coming, still took the official designation hard. ``This is a \n     landmark,'' he says, ``and I knew it was.''\n       Hoppe's familiarity with the world of the disabled helped \n     turn theoretical debates into practical ones.\n       ``He made people think about the long-term and child-\n     specific implications of the policies,'' says Katherine Beh \n     Neas, senior government relations specialist at the National \n     Easter Seals Society.\n       Occasionally during the closed-door negotiations and open \n     town meetings he organized, Hoppe would mention the \n     bureaucratic hoops he and Karen had to jump through to get \n     services for their son. Several times, he interrupted \n     meetings to take calls from his family--at least once from \n     Gregory, who wondered when Dad was coming home.\n       ``The perspective of a parent (with a disabled child) would \n     have been completely missing'' without Hoppe, says Rep. \n     Matthew Martinez, D-Calif.\n       Adds Bruce Hunter, director of public affairs for the \n     American Association of School Administrators: ``Nobody could \n     say to him the way they could say to other Republicans, `Oh, \n     you guys just don't care.'''\n\n\n                  understanding differing perspectives\n\n       What Hoppe found as he waded into the legislative thicket \n     were school administrators who feared soaring costs, \n     educators who feared for their safety and advocates for the \n     disabled who feared losing hard-won rights. ``It was fairly \n     obvious how emotionally charged the issue was,'' he says. \n     ``You're dealing with vulnerable people.''\n       The flash point was discipline. Teachers, principals and \n     school administrators wanted more flexibility to punish \n     disabled students in much the same way they did others, even \n     if it meant segregating them or stopping their education. \n     Advocates for the disabled refused to go along.\n       Hoppe did not play the Gregory card to sway the \n     negotiations.\n       ``I'm sure that everybody in that room knew that David had \n     a disabled kid,'' says Judith Heumann, the Education \n     Department's assistant secretary of special education and \n     rehabilitative services. ``But he didn't wear it on his \n     sleeve.''\n       Where he wore it was on his computer. When other parents of \n     disabled children first came to Lott's office last fall to \n     voice their concerns, they had no idea of his personal \n     interest. Then they noticed the image of Gregory on his \n     computer screen.\n       ``I looked over and saw on the screen his little one,'' \n     recounts Madeleine Will, mother of a 25-year-old son with \n     Down syndrome and a disability activist. She figured she was \n     imagining things. ``I thought, I'm overtired here and \n     distraught, but . . . I'm seeing the face of a child with \n     Down syndrome on that computer.''\n       Despite his advocacy on behalf of Gregory's interests, \n     Hoppe never forgot the interests of his other children. \n     Katie, 16, and Geoff, 13, attend public schools in Virginia \n     and know well the other side of the disability coin, when \n     students with behavioral problems disrupt classes or won't \n     leave them alone. They think disabled students should be \n     disciplined--but not blamed for all that goes wrong.\n       ``I just don't see the point of people complaining that all \n     disabilities ruin class,'' says Geoff. Adds Katie: ``The more \n     we integrate these kids, the more accepting and understanding \n     people will become with them.''\n       Out of this stew of colliding interests emerges David \n     Hoppe's philosophy: ``I believe in limited government,'' he \n     says. ``But I think government is there to protect rights and \n     opportunities.''\n       The IDEA law attempts to do that. The overhaul makes it \n     easier for schools to discipline disabled students, but \n     doesn't let states cut off their education. The law also \n     upgrades teacher training, gives parents a greater role and \n     improves planning and mediation.\n       Everyone had to compromise.\n       ``We kind of held our noses and supported it,'' says Sally \n     McConnell of the National Association of Elementary School \n     Principals, which wanted the measure to go farther. But, she \n     adds, ``Emotions run high on this issue, and I think he did a \n     really good job.''\n       Ironically, Gregory won't use all his rights. Despite the \n     law's goal of educating disabled children in the least \n     restrictive setting, the Hoppes aren't seeking full inclusion \n     just yet.\n       Beginning this fall, Gregory will be in a self-contained \n     first-grade class for academic subjects with other mildly \n     retarded kids. He will be mainstreamed a half-hour each \n     morning and also for art, music and gym. Demanding inclusion \n     when it might not be best for their child isn't what the law \n     intends, they say.\n       Their hopes for Gregory are high. ``I want him to be able \n     to live by himself, to have a job that he likes, to be able \n     to go to that job by himself, to sit and have conversations \n     with people who work where he works . . . to have him \n     involved with his church,'' Hoppe says. ``My big dreams for \n     him are things that seem very normal.''\n       But his value won't be defined by his achievements. Says \n     Karen Hoppe: ``Greg is a worthwhile individual right now, \n     just the way he is.''\n\n\n                      Celebrating a success story\n\n       Gregory Hoppe was heard about but not seen until the Senate \n     voted 98-1 on May 14 to send the bill to President Clinton. \n     Then it was time for this coming-out party.\n        From his vantage point in the vice president's office off \n     the Senate floor while the votes were being cast, Thomas \n     Hehir, director of the federal Office of Special Education \n     Programs, looked outside and saw a child with Down syndrome \n     walking into the Capitol with his mother.\n       Only after the vote, when Hehir joined a celebration in \n     Hoppe's office featuring chocolate-chip cookies made by Karen \n     and Gregory, did he figure out who that special child was.\n       ``To me, it was kind of symbolic,'' Hehir recalls thinking \n     at the time.\n       Three weeks later, the Hoppe family was in the audience on \n     the White House's South Lawn to watch President Clinton sign \n     the bill into law.\n       At Secretary of Education Richard Riley's suggestion, \n     Clinton invited Hoppe up to the front; he brought Gregory. \n     Photographs show the two of them just behind Clinton, amid \n     the usual assortment of politicians. ``Staffers never get in \n     those kinds of photographs,'' marvels Erik Smulson, an aide \n     to Sen. James Jeffords, R-Vt., who worked on the new law.\n       In this case, however, even the lawmakers say it was \n     justified. ``He was the hero of the ultimate passage of the \n     bill,'' says Sen. William Frist, R-Tenn. ``He was uniquely \n     placed, uniquely committed.''\n       Hoppe sums it up as a dad: ``I think I did something good \n     for Greg.''\n\n\n             Laws get passed when the politics is personal\n\n       Major changes in policy have come about because lawmakers \n     were affected personally.\n       Take the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, among the \n     most far-reaching civil rights laws. Former congressman Tony \n     Coelho, a California Democrat, says it was easy to win \n     converts.\n       ``I didn't have any trouble,'' recalls Coelho, whose \n     epilepsy made him a leading advocate. People ``were already \n     on board because of personal experiences.''\n       The same was true last year when three senators with family \n     stories of mental illness--Pete Domenici, R-N.M., Alan \n     Simpson, R-Wyo., and Paul Wellstone, D-Minn.--tried to \n     improve mental health insurance coverage.\n       The personal touch can be key in turning legislation into \n     law, personal cause into public crusade:\n       Vice President Gore has used his sister's death from lung \n     cancer to push for tobacco regulation.\n       Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., whose sister is mentally \n     retarded and whose son lost a leg to cancer, has been a \n     leader in health and disability issues.\n       Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, voted against increasing highway \n     speed limits after his 22-year-old daughter died in a car \n     crash.\n       Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., sponsored an alcohol labeling \n     bill after losing his daughter, 22, to a drunk driver.\n       ``All of us are touched by different circumstances.'' says \n     Kennedy. ``It heightens your sensitivity and your awareness \n     of the issue and how it impacts people.''\n  Mr. McCONNELL. We will miss Dave Hoppe. Senators come and go. Members \nof the staff come and go. Frankly, about most of us, I expect it will \nbe said we did not in the end have footprints that lasted very long. \nBut having watched Dave Hoppe and his extraordinary accomplishments \nover the years I have known him, I would say he has made an enormous \ndifference in the life of the Senate and in the life of our Nation.\n  So, Dave, we wish you well and hope we continue to see you in the \nfuture in whatever capacity you may choose to serve. You are the best, \nthe most kind, decent, honorable person many of us ever had the chance \nto meet.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to say thank you to the \ndistinguished assistant majority leader for his comments about my good \nfriend and our loyal servant over so many years, both in the House and \nin the Senate, in the person of Dave Hoppe. The Senator from Kentucky \nhas had a chance to watch him in our leadership meetings, to hear him \nand work with him, and get to know him as a human being. He is quite a \nguy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na resume of Dave Hoppe's accomplishments. It is a very interesting \nrecord of not only achievement, but sacrifice for his country as well.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            John David Hoppe\n\n       Professional experience: Chief of Staff Senate Republican \n     Leader, Trent Lott (R-MS) June 2001-Present; Chief of Staff \n     Senate Majority Leader, Trent Lott (R-MS) June 1996-2001; \n     Staff Director Senate Majority Whip, Trent Lott (R-MS) \n     January 1995-June 1996;\n\n[[Page S1774]]\n\n     Staff Director Republican Conference Secretary, Trent Lott \n     (R-MS); January 1993-December 1994; Administrative Assistant, \n     Senator Dan Coats (R-IN) January 1989-December 1992; Vice \n     President, Government Relations, Heritage Foundation, \n     September 1988-December 1988; Administrative Assistant, \n     Honorable Jack Kemp, October 1984-June 1987; Administrative \n     Assistant, House Republican Whit, Trent Lott (R-MS) January \n     1981-October 1984; Republican Platform Committee Assistant to \n     Chairman Trent Lott, January 1984-August 1984; Executive \n     Director, House Republican Research Committee, January 1979-\n     December 1980; Republican Platform Committee Assistant to \n     Vice Chairman Trent Lott, January 1980-July 1980; Consultant, \n     Hoppe & Associates (political research firm specializing in \n     tax issues), September 1978-November 1978; Contracted by \n     National Republican Congressional Committee to provide \n     special tax research package to over 50-targeted candidates; \n     and Energy & Environmental Specialist, House Republican Study \n     Committee, January 1976-August 1978.\n       Education: The Johns Hopkins School of Advanced \n     International Studies, Washington, DC (1973-1976)--Masters \n     degree, International Relations (May 1976); The Bologna \n     Center, the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International \n     Studies, Bologna, Italy (1973-1974)--Certificate; University \n     of Notre Dame, South Bend, Indiana (1969-1973)--BA., \n     Government, Cum Laude (Concentration in International \n     Relations); and University Laval, Quebec City, Canada (July-\n     August 1975)--Masters course work for foreign language \n     requirement.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Also, I want to call attention to a 1997 USA Today article \non Dave Hoppe which correctly called Dave the critical architect behind \ngetting the reauthorization of the Individuals with Disabilities in \nEducation (IDEA) Act passed in 1997. The article recounts how much that \nact meant personally to Dave and his family, and particularly to his \nyoungest son, who will benefit from this law in large part because he \nwas also an inspiration for it. Gregory Hoppe is a special person, and \nthe USA Today article, which Senator McConnell has already asked to be \nprinted into the Record, recounts Gregory and Dave's and their family's \nremarkable story.\n  First, let me just comment on some interesting facts about Dave. \nWhile Dave Hoppe has worked for me off and on for over 27 years in the \nHouse and the Senate, he is not from Mississippi as you might expect. \nNo, he is from Baraboo, WI, which happens to be the birthplace of the \nRingling Brothers & Barnum and Bailey Circus and we have never let Dave \nforget that over the years.\n  He is a graduate of Notre Dame, class of 1973, which has made for \nsome interesting kidding over the years about athletics, football, \nbasketball, and bragging rights. But that is just the beginning of his \nimpressive resume. He went on to study at the Johns Hopkins School of \nAdvanced International Studies and received a master's degree in \nInternational Relations. As part of the Johns Hopkins Program in \nAdvanced International Studies Dave spent the better part of a year in \nItaly. He also did foreign language coursework in Quebec City, Canada, \nunder the auspices of the University of Laval.\n  Over his almost three decades in Washington, Dave has served several \ndifferent Congressmen, Senators, and organizations, going way back to \nwhen he first came to Washington. From 1976 to 1978 he worked for the \nRepublican Study Committee in the House of Representatives. He \nactually, for a while, had his own firm doing political research called \nHoppe & Associates. Then he started his public service career in \nWashington that has covered an amazing number of professional \nexperiences.\n  He returned to Capitol Hill in 1979 as the executive director of the \nHouse Republican Research Committee. Later he moved up to be \nadministrative assistant to the Republican whip in the House when I had \nthe pleasure of serving in that position. He also worked for me as the \ndirector of the Republican Platform Committee efforts in 1984 when I \nwas chairman of the Platform Committee. In 1984 he went to work in the \noffice of Congressman Jack Kemp as the chief of staff and of course was \ninvolved in his Presidential campaign in 1988. Dave then joined the \nHeritage Foundation where he served as a vice president. And then went \nto work in the Senate as the chief of staff for Senator Dan Coats of \nIndiana. In 1994, I was able to tempt him away from Senator Coats to \nwork for me again as the chief of staff in my position as the Senate \nmajority whip, then as the majority leader, and finally as the \nRepublican leader.\n  In all, this outstanding individual and person has devoted 27 years \nto Congress and the American people.\n  Now, admittedly with some degree of trepidation I suspect, Dave is \ngoing out into the private sector--the real world--to provide for his \ntwo oldest children who are presently attending Notre Dame and for \nGregory who I mentioned earlier. Anyone would be a little anxious about \nnot knowing exactly what their new role will entail--and after the \nfinancial sacrifices over 27 years he probably will not know what to do \nwith the extra money he will be earning in the private sector.\n  But I predict, as in everything else in his life, Dave will be more \nthan successful, he will be superb at whatever endeavor he takes up \nnext.\n  Far too often here, Senators take long, deep bows for our great \npublic policy achievements and forget all the people who helped us get \nto that point: Our wives--in the case of Dave Hoppe, a wonderful lady \nnamed Karen--our families and mothers and fathers who helped raise us; \nour constituents who put us on their shoulders and turned an ugly frog \ninto a prince; the elevator operators, the pages, the floor staff; and \nour personal staffs who work long and hard, helping write the speeches, \nhelping draft the amendments, helping us regain our composure when we \nget a little out of control. Then, when they do move on, we forget to \nsay just a simple thank you and to remind them that they made a \ndifference in the course of history and in the course of America--in \nmany cases, just as surely as any Senator ever did.\n  Dave Hoppe certainly can rest assured that he has made a great \ndifference in this Government, in the Congress, the House, the Senate, \nin politics, in the study of government, and in America. But the best \nthing about Dave Hoppe is he believes strongly in his principles, his \nideals, and his faith--in fact, that is how he met his wife Karen. They \nwere carpooling, and as they were going to work, they found they shared \na lot of common values and views of government and life. Three weeks \nlater, they were engaged, and then married, and have had three \nwonderful children over the years.\n  So, yes, the best thing about Dave Hoppe is not his educational \nbackground, not his expertise, not his knowledge of the Senate, not all \nthe things he has worked on--the best thing about Dave is the kind of \nhuman being he is. He is a man who cares deeply about his family and \nhis country, and he has sacrificed mightily to help make a difference \nfor his family and for the people of America.\n  I just wanted to take a few minutes, as Dave enters his last day or \ntwo in the Senate, to express my appreciation for his dedicated service \nand for all he has done, and to wish him great success in the future. \nBut especially, I thank Karen and Katie, Geoffrey, and Gregory for \nsharing him with me and the country, and for the work they have done to \nhelp their father do the tireless work Dave has done in turn to make \nthis nation a better place for all of us. I am delighted to have had an \nopportunity to ensure his efforts over the past three decades are \nproperly recognized before he turns this page and enters the next \nchapter of his life.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I will be glad to yield to Senator Reid.\n  Mr. REID. I was in my office and heard the Senator begin his remarks. \nI came here as quickly as I could to tell Senator Lott, the \ndistinguished Senator from Mississippi, what a tremendous person Dave \nHoppe is and has been.\n  I believe in making deals. I say that in a positive sense. \nLegislation is the art of compromise. You have to build a consensus and \nmake deals. That is not a negative term. And David Hoppe was wonderful \nto work with.\n  I say to the Senator from Mississippi, for the things we were able to \naccomplish in the Senate, we always had to go to Dave Hoppe. He was the \ngo-to guy. I say to the Senator from Mississippi, he had really good \njudgment and showed a lot of wisdom by hiring Dave Hoppe. He not only \nserved the people of the State of Mississippi and this institution but \nthe country.\n  I commend the Senator from Mississippi for coming to the floor and \nacknowledging another fine public servant. Washington has a lot of \npeople\n\n[[Page S1775]]\n\nwho do good work. But Dave Hoppe is one who does work that is at the \ntop of the list.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Senator from Nevada for his comments. He is \nright. At those countless meetings we had in the back of the Chamber, \nthe center aisle, the cloakroom, or in our offices, Dave Hoppe was \nalways there, committed to his philosophy and principles, but always \nequally committed to getting results for the Senate and for the nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, others have spoken of their impressions and \nreflections on Dave Hoppe today, and I would like to take a moment to \nadd my thoughts.\n  While our constituents rely on us as their voice and advocate here in \nWashington, we rely on our staff to be our voice and advocate. Under \nour guidance our staff investigate and learn about the many issues that \nconfront us; they work with a wide variety of people in all branches of \nthe government; they give us their best counsel and advice; and they \nhelp us perform a myriad of tasks that are vital to ensuring the \ninstitution of the Senate works well and effectively, and that we give \nour best on behalf of the people we serve. Our staffs amplify our work \nwith our colleagues, our counterparts in the House, the executive \nbranch, and our constituents.\n  For over a decade now, Dave has worked for all Senate Republicans in \na variety of positions, in our conference secretary's office, the \nmajority whip's office, and, for the past 6 years, as chief of staff in \nthe Republican leader's office. This specialized role isn't for the \nfaint of heart, and requires a unique blend of skills and attributes.\n  Dave's commitment, dedication, and hard work have generated quiet \nappreciation and deep respect from many different Members in the Senate \nand House over the years. His ability to faithfully and tirelessly \nrepresent our shared Republican ideas and ideals, working with all \nmembers of our conference to knit them together, is impressive. From \nthe most major issues of war or impeachment, to the most mundane of \nhaggling out unanimous consent agreements, his involvement and advice \nand leadership on countless issues over his tenure has served all of us \nwell.\n  While unflinching in his core beliefs and principles, his willingness \nto work with the Democratic counterparts is also noteworthy, for in the \nSenate, so often it is partnership, not partisanship, that ensures we \nmake progress on behalf of the American people. For example, across the \naisle, across the rotunda, and across various ideologies, he took a \nmajor leadership role in improving one of the flagship Federal programs \nfor disable children. With round-the-clock work, good humor, and grace, \nhe spearheaded a nearly unanimous Congress to make a program with \nworthy goals much more effective and consequential in the lives of \nparents and children around the country.\n  Through all challenges and controversies, though, what strikes me as \nadmirable about Dave is his deep and authentic humility. Informed by \nhis faith and essential humanity, Dave has never expressed a sense of \nentitlement or arrogance. He has never sought a limelight. He is quick \nto share credit, and always willing to take responsibility. Throughout \nhis 27 years on Capital Hill, over and over again, his example his \ninspired not just fellow staffers, but House and Senate Members as \nwell.\n  We have all profited from Dave's work here in Congress. His public \nservice is in the finest tradition expected by our Founding Fathers. \nThe Senate is a better place for his time here, and I wish him and his \nfamily well as he moves to new opportunities.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I wanted to take a moment to pay my \nrespects to Dave Hoppe, whose last day in the Senate is today. Dave has \nbeen a friend and counselor to many of us in the Senate, and we will \nmiss him.\n  It would be fair to say that Dave Hoppe has been the consummate \nSenate staffer. While a strong partisan, he has always been fair. He is \ndecent. He is respectful and considerate of everyone with whom he comes \nin contact, and of the institution as a whole. He understands and \npractices the comity that is invaluable in the Senate.\n  When I look back on the service of Dave Hoppe, I see him as the still \ncenter of the maelstrom. While the chaos that is, on occasion, the \nSenate swirled and howled around him, he was calm; his voice never \nhurried, never rose. His counsel was sound, very sound; sometimes \ntinged with humor, good humor; never malicious or mean spirited. Always \ntimely, always mindful of the institution, always aware of the \npossibilities and the consequences of its actions.\n  David knows that the Senate, immutable as it is, will go on even \nthough he is no longer a part of its daily operations. However, those \nof us who have worked with him, and will continue to work with him, \nknow the imprint he has left on the institution, the national policies \nhe has helped shape, and the example he has set for all in the Senate \nto follow.\n  I join my colleagues in recognizing Dave Hoppe for his achievements \nand contributions to the Senate, and sending my best wishes to him and \nhis family as they begin the next chapter of a remarkable life.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I have had the good fortune of knowing and \nworking with Dave Hoppe for the last 9 years. He has been a vital part \nof this institution and he will be sorely missed. I first had the \nopportunity to know him as chief of staff for Senator Dan Coats. \nSenator Coats unfortunately lost Dave when Dave moved over to be chief \nof staff for Senator Lott's Republican conference secretary's office, \nthen his majority whip office and then his majority leader's office.\n  I had the opportunity to work closely with Dave on an issue that we \nboth feel passionately about: special education. After 2 years of \nfailed negotiations, Dave Hoppe almost single-handedly managed to get \nthis critical legislation authorized. The manner in which Dave \napproached this reauthorization and his ultimate success provides a \nwonderful example on why Dave was so successful in the Senate. He \nmanaged to bring Republicans and Democrats together by working in a \nstraightforward, open, and honest manner which allowed Members to feel \nconfident that their concerns were being thoroughly considered. Dave \nhas served in both the majority and the minority--always representing \nhis boss effectively, while also working to ensure that the Senate \naccomplished its work.\n  Dave is esteemed in the Senate for more than the passion and \nprinciples he brought to bear on issues. He is respected first and \nforemost for his character as a person and as a leader.\n  This is an institution that is built on trust. Dave is a person whose \nword is his bond. He has been so effective as the leader's chief of \nstaff for precisely that reason. Members on both sides of the aisle \nalways knew they could depend on the promises that he gave and relied \non his word without reservation.\n  It is also remarkable that he wielded such enormous influence without \nany trace of pretension or pride. He was accessible to members and \nstaff alike, serving with grace, good humor and sound counsel.\n  I will personally miss Dave. He ranks among those men and women of \nhonor who have shaped the best qualities of the Senate. He made it a \nbetter institution through his service and his character, and we owe \nhim our gratitude.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak \nfor up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/30/senate-section/article/S1775-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1775-S1781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIP TO EUROPE AND THE MIDEAST\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to report on a \ntrip I made to Europe and the Mideast from December 23 until January 7.\n  The information I found bears on the current problems of the Mideast \npeace process and the Israeli-Palestinian issues, but also on the \nopinions of a variety of the countries we visited on the\n\n[[Page S1776]]\n\nissue of Iraq and Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction. In \nGreat Britain, in talking to executive branch officials, we heard there \nwould be an effort made on the Mideast peace process to bring in the \nPalestinians in mid-January in advance of the Israeli elections in late \nJanuary to try to keep the peace process stimulated.\n  We learned that in a recent trip which had been made by Syrian \nPresident Bashar al-Assad, who is married to a woman raised in England, \nand we heard obviously considerable talk about the Iraq issue.\n  Prime Minister Tony Blair has been one of the strongest allies of the \nUnited States and has stated his willingness to partner with the United \nStates to see to it that Saddam does not maintain weapons of mass \ndestruction regardless of what the United Nations does. We heard talk \nthat Prime Minister Blair had taken credit for the United States going \nto the United Nations--or at least partial credit. And that was very \nwell received by the British populous. But there remains a general \nfeeling in Great Britain of opposition to a war against Iraq unless it \nis sanctioned by the United Nations.\n  We heard pretty much the same sentiment in Germany where we met with \nmembers of the Bundestag and officials in the executive branch, and \nwith German and U.S. businessmen and women on the Chamber of Commerce \nthere.\n  The situation in Germany is surprising to the extent that we heard \nrepeated talk that it is politically incorrect to say, ``I am proud to \nbe a German.'' I found that surprising. It is a result of perhaps \nGerman instigation in two wars in the 20th century. In a country where \nwe are so proud to be Americans, I found it surprising the people would \nnot say, ``I am proud to be a German.'' The Germans won't say that. \nChancellor Schroder, we are told, referred to the ``German way,'' and \nit drew criticism and the abandoning of that kind of expression. The \nsentiment in Germany seems to be pretty solidly against a war with \nIraq. The members of the Bundestag with whom we met urged the U.S. to \ngo back for a second resolution to authorize the use of force. I asked \nhim if such a resolution was obtained would that make a difference to \nGermany on joining in. He said no it wouldn't; that there was a feeling \nof pacifism against war as a result of what happened in World War II \nand the predecessor war, and that the Germans were just opposed to it. \nChancellor Schroder had problems within his own party when they changed \nparty strength if he would deviate from the political position he took \nto win reelection--really running against, in effect, the United States \nand U.S. policy on taking action against Saddam Hussein.\n  In the Mideast we met with Egyptian President Mubarak who expressed \ngreat concern about what the reaction would be in the Mideast and in \nArab countries to a war against Iraq. President Mubarak thought some \ncountries would have trouble containing the people in the streets. He \nfelt confident he could but was worried about other countries. He \nthought U.S. installations would be at risk where the Arab sentiments \nrun so strongly against the United States.\n  In Syria, I had an extensive talk with Syrian President Bashar al-\nAssad and Foreign Minister al-Shara. The view there was that they are \nvery much opposed to military action against Iraq. We noted that Syria \nhad joined in the unanimous Security Council Resolution on 1441. But \nthat, of course, fell short of the use of military force.\n  On January 6 I attended a session of the United States-Syrian dialog \nwhich had been initiated by the James Baker Institute last May in \nHouston, TX. There was an effort made to bring the Syrian and U.S. \nofficials together to talk about problems of mutual concern. The \nprincipal area was the question of Syria playing host to terrorist \norganizations. I raised that issue in a meeting with President Assad \nand told him that if he wanted to get off the terrorist list there \nwould have to be something done about that, the terrorist groups would \nhave to leave Syria. He declined, saying that they were representatives \nof the Palestinians, and they were carrying out a political agenda and \nhe would not ask them to depart from Damascus.\n  In the U.S.-Syrian dialog, and in talks with President Assad, we \ndiscussed the support of Syria and Iran for Hezbollah and the rockets \nwhich are pointed at the Israelis. I had conveyed to President Assad \nPrime Minister Sharon's willingness to meet with Syrian officials on a \nsecond peace track. When we met with Prime Minister Sharon in Israel, \nthe subject came up of the possibility of Israeli-Syrian peace \ntalks. And Prime Minister Sharon said he favors that. I asked him if he \nwould mind if I passed that message on to President Assad, and he said: \nYou are authorized to do that. President Assad responded that he \nthought peace talks would be a good idea. He said he would not want to \nfinish them before the Israeli-Palestinian talks were concluded, but we \ntalked about the negotiations which had been brokered by President \nClinton in the mid-1990s where they came very close to a peace \nagreement between Prime Minister Rabin and President Hafez al-Assad.\n\n  Candidly, I do not expect things to blossom in that direction, but I \ndo think it would be useful, always, to keep the conversations going \nand to see if peace could be attained.\n  Hearing the sentiments in Great Britain, in Germany, in Egypt and in \nSyria as to the general concerns about a military confrontation without \nexplicit United Nations authorization, it is my hope that authorization \nwill yet be obtained.\n  I thought the President's speech on Tuesday night was right on the \nmark, right on target, laid down the gauntlet in a very clear way. It \nis a different world after September 11, when we learned a bitter \nlesson by not taking action against Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida after \nwe had ample warning to do so.\n  We cannot ignore imminent threats. There is a basis in international \nlaw, as I said when we discussed the resolution authorizing the use of \nforce, to take action, sanctified by international law where there is \nan imminent threat.\n  I was encouraged by President Bush's statement that he was going to \nsend Secretary of State Powell back to the United Nations to produce \nspecific evidence. I believe there is evidence to show that Saddam \nHussein has not complied with Resolution 1441.\n  When there is all this talk about a smoking gun, I think that \nmetaphor misses the point. You do not need a smoking gun to get a \nconviction. In fact, you do not even need a gun to get a conviction \nwhere you have other evidence. I believe the evidence is very strong, \nas Hans Blix and the other U.N. inspectors have said in their \npreliminary report, that Saddam has not accounted for the weapons of \nmass destruction which we knew he had when the U.N. inspectors were \nkicked out in December of 1998.\n  I believe there is other evidence. And the word is the decisions are \nnow being made as to how much of that information can be transmitted to \nthe United Nations without tipping Saddam off so he will move his \nweapons of mass destruction, which are mobile, or so that we will \ncompromise sources and methods.\n  The media reported earlier this week that Britain was in support of a \nGerman plan to have a second interim report on February 14. If that \ndoes come about, it will give the U.N. inspectors a little additional \ntime, perhaps, to act on additional information which Secretary of \nState Colin Powell can provide.\n  As I said on the floor of the Senate when we discussed the resolution \nfor the authorization for the use of force, I think the hand of the \nUnited States would be much stronger if a second U.N. resolution is \nobtained. I believe there is a considerable body of evidence on the \nrecord at the present time to warrant a second United Nations \nresolution, which would authorize the use of force. But there is no \ndoubt there is resistance from France and Germany.\n  I think the President is absolutely correct, we cannot allow our \nnational interests and our national policy to be determined by anybody \nbut the United States, and we cannot be subjected to a French veto.\n  It is my thinking that the French may be satisfied. If they are, I \nthink the Russians will not veto nor will the Chinese, and we can move \nahead for a second United Nations resolution.\n  The President has emphasized his hope to avoid a war. If the Iraqis \nand Saddam Hussein face a united United Nations, perhaps that is \npossible.\n\n[[Page S1777]]\n\n  Back in January of 1990, Senator Shelby and I had an opportunity to \nmeet with Saddam Hussein for about an hour and a quarter. And although \nhe is brutal--he has a record for using chemicals on his own people, \nthe Kurds, in the Iran-Iraq war--and is venal, I think it may be \naccurate to say he is not suicidal. I believe that if he sees the noose \naround him, perhaps there is some opportunity he may step aside or that \nthe military or others in Iraq may take action to dislodge him from a \nleadership position.\n  If war can be avoided, obviously, that is in the interests of \neveryone, to avoid putting our fighting forces in harm's way and to \navoid casualties of the Iraqi civilian population and the Iraqi \nmilitary population.\n  In essence, the trip to Europe and the Mideast showed me a state of \nsubstantial unrest. People are uneasy about a prospective war for many \nreasons. If the United Nations were to authorize it, I think that would \nallay a great many concerns and might even present the setting for \ndeposing Saddam Hussein without the necessity of war.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my report on foreign \ntravel to Europe and the Middle East and op-ed pieces which I have \npublished in the Pittsburgh Post Gazette and the Harrisburg Patriot be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           CODEL Trip Report\n\n       In accordance with my custom of reporting on my foreign \n     travel, this is a brief summary of my trip from December 23, \n     2002-January 7, 2003 to England, Lithuania, Germany, Israel, \n     Egypt, and Syria.\n\n\n                                ENGLAND\n\n       On December 24th, our first full day in London, in the \n     company of Charge Morton Dworkin, we met with William Ehrman, \n     Director General of Defense and International Affairs, and \n     Edward Chaplin, Director of Middle East Affairs, and former \n     Ambassador to Jordan. We discussed the Israeli/Palestinian \n     issues and the British position that it was preferable to \n     follow the road map adopted by the so-called quartet which \n     consisted of the United States, the UN, the EU, and Russia. \n     Mr. Chaplin pointed out that Great Britain was holding a \n     meeting in January with the Palestinians to try to move along \n     the peace process in the interim before the Israeli elections \n     scheduled for January. He expressed the opinion that Chairman \n     Arafat should not be deposed because it will make him a \n     martyr and strengthen him.\n       We discussed the efforts by Egyptian President Mubarak to \n     persuade Hamas and Islam Jihad to accept a cease-fire. It was \n     pointed out that Syrian President Bashar had been in England \n     for several days visiting the parents of his wife who is \n     British.\n       As to Iraq, our British hosts agreed that Saddam definitely \n     had weapons of mass destruction and that he had not \n     adequately explained what happened to such weapons after the \n     UN inspectors had been ousted in 1998. It was noted that \n     public opinion in Great Britain opposes military action \n     against Saddam unless it is sanctioned by the UN and, even \n     then, there are many dissenters. Prime Minister Tony Blair \n     had taken credit for persuading President Bush to go to the \n     UN for Resolution 1441. It was further observed that \n     sentiment in Great Britain favors another UN resolution \n     authorizing force before a military confrontation occurs with \n     Iraq.\n       On December 26th, we received another supplemental team \n     briefing by Charge Dworkin including an intelligence \n     briefing.\n\n\n                               LITHUANIA\n\n       We arrived at the Vilnius International Airport on the \n     afternoon of Friday, December 27. We were greeted by \n     Ambassador John Tefft, Marilyn Ereshefsky, and Randolph Flay \n     of the United States Embassy. From the airport we drove to \n     the U.S. Embassy for a Country Team briefing. During the \n     drive from the airport, the Ambassador provided us with a \n     brief background of the Country. He began his summary of \n     Lithuania's history at the thirteenth century when it was the \n     largest state of Central and Eastern Europe. In 1795 \n     Lithuania was incorporated into the Russian Empire and \n     remained that way until gaining their independence in 1918. \n     In 1940 the country was occupied and annexed by the Soviet \n     Union where it remained under Soviet control until 1990 when \n     it again rejoined the community of free and democratic states \n     after the fall of the Soviet Union.\n       Upon arrival at the embassy, Ambassador Tefft introduced us \n     to his core team which included Marilyn Ereshefsky, the \n     Section Chief, Randolf Flay, Political Officer, Michael \n     Sessums, Economic Officer, Brent Barker, Attache, and Ruta \n     Eluikis, Consul. Ambassador Tefft opened the meeting by \n     informing us that we were visiting Lithuania at a special \n     time in history as Lithuanians were still basking in the glow \n     of the recent visit by President Bush and the acceptance into \n     NATO and the European Union (EU). Ambassador Tefft recounted \n     President Bush's very moving speech given in the heart of \n     Vilnius where he said ``an enemy of Lithuania is now an enemy \n     of the United States.''\n       I inquired about the attitude of the Russians toward \n     Lithuanian acceptance into NATO and was informed that \n     Russians were tolerant but not particularly happy about the \n     expansion. Ambassador Tefft then commented to me that \n     Lithuania had been independent in their past and very much \n     wants to continue in that tradition as they look toward the \n     future. However, there are still many remnants of the Soviet-\n     era throughout the Country. For example, a Chernobyl-style \n     nuclear power station is responsible for producing eighty \n     percent of Lithuania's energy. As a condition of acceptance \n     into the EU and after pressure from the international \n     community, Lithuania has agreed to terminate the plant \n     between 2005 and 2009.\n       Our conversation then turned to the economy. I was pleased \n     to learn that the economy in Lithuania is undergoing a boom \n     of sorts. Since independence, Lithuania has made substantial \n     progress in economic reform. The GDP has risen from 5.9 \n     percent in 2001 to 6.9 percent in 2002. According to the \n     Ambassador, Lithuania is the only European country where the \n     economy is significantly growing. He further advised that the \n     majority of the EU economy is flat which poses large problems \n     from Germany to the United Kingdom. Although unemployment in \n     Lithuania is still a serious issue, it is not as bad as \n     neighboring countries. The challenge now is to encourage a \n     movement from agricultural jobs to more productive employment \n     for many Lithuanians. Whereas twenty percent of the \n     population is agricultural, these are mainly small family run \n     farms and they account for only seven percent of the Gross \n     Domestic Product. There is still considerable poverty in the \n     rural areas.\n       Lithuania produces products for export for companies such \n     as the furniture maker Ikea, textiles for Oscar de la Renta, \n     and cheese for many U.S. frozen food manufacturers. They also \n     have a growing high-tech sector which produces software for \n     such U.S. companies as Kemper Insurance. Consumer goods are \n     also doing well. The biggest U.S. investors in Lithuania are \n     Phillip Morris and Kraft foods. Currently, U.S. companies \n     invest almost $350 million in Lithuania each year. Where \n     Lithuania has made great strides economically since gaining \n     their independence in the early nineties, they still have \n     major economic challenges ahead.\n       The discussion the moved to the population of Lithuania. \n     Currently Lithuania has 3.7 million people living here. \n     Largely, they are Roman Catholic. I inquired about the size \n     of the Jewish population and was told there are currently \n     about 5,000 Jews living in Lithuania. Lithuania's Jews can be \n     traced back to the 13th century. By the 18th century, Vilnius \n     had become the world capital of traditional--Talmudic, \n     learning, often referred to as the Jerusalem of the North \n     with over 250,000 Jews living in the Country. Tragically, 94 \n     percent of the population, including 80,000 Jews living in \n     Vilnius perished in the Holocaust, the highest percentage of \n     genocide in Europe. Almost no Jewish cultural sites or homes \n     of renowned Jewish personalities are remembered.\n       On Saturday, December 28th, we took a walking tour of the \n     Old Town of the Lithuanian capital which is one of the \n     largest in Eastern and Middle Europe. In the ancient part of \n     Vilnius we could see the fusion of nature and architecture \n     and the overlapping of cultures and traditions. Throughout \n     Vilnius' history, inhabitants built synagogues, mosques, and \n     Catholic churches next to one another.\n       Following our tour we proceeded to the Presidential Palace \n     for a meeting with Valdas Adamkus, the President of \n     Lithuania. President Adamkus, a former U.S. citizen and \n     Administrator at the Environmental Protection Agency for the \n     Great Lakes Region is in the middle of his second \n     Presidential campaign. He faced 16 opponents in the \n     general election on December 22 and now has a run-off \n     which will take place on January 5th. Although President \n     Adamkus was expected to win, his run-off opponent has made \n     his age of 76 years an issue.\n       Our conversation then turned to Lithuania's acceptance into \n     NATO and the Russian attitude toward expansion. President \n     Adamkus said that Russia does not pose a significant threat \n     to any of the Baltic countries and that President Vladimir \n     Putin has become milder over the years. I asked about the \n     mission of NATO now that the threat is gone. President \n     Adamkus said that NATO provides an internal European security \n     structure. Although he agreed with me that the role has \n     changed, it is nonetheless important to all member countries \n     including the United States.\n       Economically, the President said, NATO membership provides \n     almost instant foreign investment increase. He is confident \n     that an additional $5 billion in revenue will come into \n     Lithuania in the next three years and by the end of the \n     decade Lithuania will look completely different. President \n     Adamkus is determined to bring the standard of living up \n     throughout the country. He feels there is still too much \n     poverty, particularly in rural areas.\n       We then discussed the state of the current Judicial system. \n     The President indicated that the country has significantly \n     restructured the Judiciary in the past several years, \n     particularly the past six months, but there is still a long \n     way to go. He is proud of the fact that a large number of \n     young, western educated Judges were recently sworn in but \n     acknowledged that there are still many Judges\n\n[[Page S1778]]\n\n     left over from the fifty years of the Soviet occupation. The \n     Supreme Court however, is free from Judges from that era.\n       I then inquired about the position of Lithuania on Iraq and \n     Saddam Hussein and where Lithuania would stand if it is \n     proven that Iraq has reestablished a program of weapons of \n     mass destruction. President Adamkus believes that it is \n     inevitable that Hussein is lying and that Lithuania will \n     stand by its allies and will be part of the overall effort if \n     it comes to that point. President Adamkus then reminded me \n     that Lithuania has been exchanging small groups of officers \n     with the United States for training exercises. He then noted \n     to me that the Pennsylvania National Guard recently sent \n     seventy troops to Lithuania to perform a joint training \n     missions with our troops.\n       After our meeting with the President, we departed for a \n     meeting with Foreign Affairs Minister, Antana Valionis. Our \n     conversation focused on Lithuania's invitation to join the \n     NATO alliance at the recent summit in Prague and the European \n     Commission report that included Lithuania on a list of ten \n     countries expected to join the EU in 2004. Lithuania has made \n     great strides, politically and economically, over the past \n     decade and their invitation to join both NATO and the EU are \n     a reflection of those efforts.\n       We discussed Lithuania's support for the War on Terrorism. \n     They have deployed a 40-man Special Operations force to \n     Afghanistan and have committed a medical support unit to the \n     International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). It should be \n     noted that Lithuania also contributed to operations in \n     Bonsia-Herzegovina and Kosovo and currently have over fifty \n     troops in the area. That evening I attended the opera Aida, \n     at the Russian built Opera house. Following the Opera, I \n     departed for the U.S. Marine Barracks to watch the \n     Philadelphia Eagles play the New York Giants on the Armed \n     Forces channel.\n       On the morning of Sunday, December 29th, we departed for a \n     tour of Zydu, the Jewish section of Vilnius with our guide \n     Yulik Gurvitch. This area was once a thriving spot for \n     Jewish culture, but was desecrated by the Nazis occupation \n     and later torn down by the Soviets. The area served as a \n     prison camp for 60,000 Jews, of which most perished in the \n     neighboring Paneriai forest. Vilnius was also home to the \n     famed Yiddish Institute for Higher Learning and the \n     Strashum Library which housed the world's largest \n     collection of Yiddish-language books. It was known \n     throughout the world for its thriving Yiddish-language \n     theaters and libraries and schools and was coined the \n     Jerusalem of the north.\n       I was pleased to learn of Lithuania's commitment to deal \n     with its difficult past as it pertains to the Jewish faith. \n     In 2002, the government returned hundreds of Torah scrolls to \n     Jewish groups and announced its plan to restore and \n     revitalize the Jewish Quarter. A program to educate its \n     soldiers and students about the Holocaust is also in place. \n     We departed Lithuania around mid-day bound for Germany.\n\n\n                                germany\n\n       On the afternoon of Sunday, December 29th, we arrived in \n     Berlin, Germany and were met by Franz Seitz, our control \n     officer at the U.S. Embassy. He notified us that former \n     Senator Dan Coats, who now serves as Ambassador to Germany, \n     was back home in the United States celebrating the birth of \n     his grandchild. From the airport, we drove through Berlin \n     toward our hotel. It was gratifying to see first-hand \n     Berlin's progress since the infamous fall of the Berlin Wall \n     on November 9, 1989. Berlin is a modern city embracing the \n     21st century while maintaining a sense of its rich history.\n       Monday morning, December 30th, we met with members of the \n     Country Team at the U.S. Embassy including Terry Snell, the \n     Deputy Chief of Mission, John Lister, Deputy Counselor for \n     Political affairs, and Franz Seitz. The briefing began with \n     discussions of the poor state of relations between Germany \n     and the United States which has reached its lowest level in \n     decades. Relations between the two countries soured in \n     September 2002 when, during the German election campaign, Mr. \n     Schroeder repeatedly voiced his opposition to military action \n     against Iraq--a position which angered the U.S. The \n     Administration was also infuriated by comments from former \n     German Justice Minister Herta Daeubler-Gmelin, who likened \n     President Bush to Adolf Hitler. Although Chancellor Schroeder \n     eventually apologized and fired the Justice Minister, the \n     comment significantly strained the relationship between our \n     two countries.\n       After the election took place, the German people were \n     incensed to learn that the Chancellor had painted a false \n     picture of the state of the German economy. He inflated the \n     status of the fiscal situation of the Germany only to release \n     data after the election indicating the deficit was \n     significantly larger than previously indicated. In fact, they \n     are facing a terrible recession and have the slowest economy \n     in Europe.\n       I then questioned the team on anti-Semitism in Germany and \n     was discouraged to hear that it is on the rise in certain \n     areas particularly among young people. One argument for the \n     increase in anti-Semitic attitudes among young people is the \n     simple fact that because of the economy there are very few \n     activities or jobs for youth in Germany. Right wing, anti-\n     Semitic, anti-foreigner, anti-American groups host events for \n     young teens and provide entertainment as well as a social \n     setting while instilling these troubling ideas. These groups \n     are also closely allied to the ``skinhead'' movement. The \n     embassy also indicated that there is a rise in anti-Semitic \n     contact in German media reports.\n       I than explored the idea of whether there was any concern \n     that Germany could go back to the ways of World War I or II. \n     The country team seemed confident that this could never \n     happen because there is no political energy to increase \n     the size or strength of the military or return to a \n     militaristic society. I was further explained to me that \n     Germans are morally horrified by what happened in this \n     country during World War II and have a moral revulsion to \n     much of their past. The Germans are making a conscientious \n     effort to teach the holocaust in their text books and \n     classrooms and are facing their history head on. They make \n     no effort to hide the atrocities committed in the past.\n       The current German attitude was illustrated by the \n     sentiment that in Germany today it is politically incorrect \n     to make the statement that you are proud to be a German. The \n     German people are well-aware of how they are perceived by the \n     world for their actions of yesterday and are very cautious \n     about perpetuating the idea that they are becoming too \n     nationalistic or militaristic. For example, last year a \n     cabinet minister almost lost his job for saying those words. \n     Further, Chancellor Schroeder used the phrase ``the German \n     way'' in a campaign statement last year and was so widely \n     criticized he was forced to stop using the statement. It \n     appears that because of Germans instigation of World War I \n     and II that the most pervasive attitude in Germany is \n     passivism.\n       After the country team briefing, we met with Wolfgang \n     Bosbach, a member of the Bundestag, who is the Chair of the \n     Domestic and Legal Affairs Committee and member of the \n     Christian Democratic Union, the opposition party. Bosbach as \n     been a vocal supporter of U.S. initiatives in the war of \n     terrorism. Our discussion centered on U.S. German relations \n     and the issue of Iraq. I asked him if the United Nations has \n     a second resolution authorizing the use of force where will \n     the Germans stand. He felt there would still be no change of \n     opinion in Germany. For Schroeder, there is no way back, he \n     was extremely vocal in his opposition to a war in Iraq \n     throughout the campaign and he will not change course now. He \n     continued on to say that the majority of Germans were also \n     opposed to action in Afghanistan, but Schroeder was able to \n     proceed there by calling for a vote of confidence on the \n     coalition. He did feel, however, that Germany would be active \n     in any reconstruction efforts in Iraq.\n       Bosbach felt that Schroeder made two critical mistakes in \n     dealing with the United States. First, he said that the U.S. \n     and Germany are friends and that friends don't speak publicly \n     against one another in any circumstance. He felt that \n     Schroeder handled the situation of his Justice Minister's \n     comments very poorly. Secondly, he felt that Schroeder should \n     have never come out publicly against action in Iraq without \n     having had a private conversation with President Bush first.\n       As a member of the opposition party, Mr. Bosbach is \n     convinced that the German government hasn't done enough in \n     the war on terror. As an example, he believes that in \n     Germany, if the government has adequate proof that an \n     individual belongs to a terrorist organization, they should \n     automatically lose their citizenship. Germans cannot expel or \n     deport anybody and with German citizenship, an individual can \n     pass freely into many countries. Last year alone Germany \n     issued three hundred and forty thousand visas to individuals \n     from rogue states. Mr. Bosbach believes there is a network of \n     terrorists in Germany as three of the September 11th pilots \n     had lived in Germany.\n       After our meeting with Mr. Bosbach, we headed for a \n     luncheon hosted by the Berlin chapter of the American Chamber \n     of Commerce. The Chamber members in attendance were both \n     Germans and Americans. I was interested to learn that there \n     are over two thousand American Companies in Germany which \n     have invested one hundred billion dollars and employ over \n     eight hundred thousand people.\n       I inquired about the overall attitude of the group \n     regarding the U.S.-German relationship. There was widespread \n     agreement that the members were disappointed about the \n     position the German government took during the election. As \n     one member put it, the relationship which took fifty years to \n     rebuild was destroyed in five seconds. However, many in the \n     group felt that a majority of Germans are not anti-American. \n     When I asked if they thought Germany would go along with a \n     United Nations resolution against Iraqi if there was \n     sufficient proof that Saddam is lying, it was clear nobody \n     thought the government would support action in Iraq.\n       I expressed surprise that the economy was in the difficult \n     situation it is today as I have always had a great respect \n     for German ingenuity, efficiency, and technology. Many of the \n     group were keenly interested in how the international \n     situation and the relationship of our two counties was going \n     to affect future business and trade. I believe that business \n     people still want to do business regardless of any comments \n     made by Chancellor Schroeder.\n\n[[Page S1779]]\n\n       In the afternoon, we arrived at the German Federal Ministry \n     of the Interior for a meeting with Reinhardt Peters the \n     Minister-Director in the Police Bureau. Mr. Peters informed \n     me that he is responsible for coordinating police responses \n     to major crime including terrorism, and plays a key role in \n     cooperative law enforcement efforts within the EU and with \n     other nations. He is also involved with Germany's lead-nation \n     role in building an Afghan national police force. We \n     discussed such subjects as the death penalty, which Germany \n     does not have and how the Germans are prepared to deal with \n     terrorism.\n       Following the Ministry of Interior meeting we proceeded to \n     the Federal Ministry of Justice for a meeting with Minister-\n     Director for Criminal Law, Christian Lehmann. Earlier this \n     month, the German government agreed to provide evidence \n     requested by the U.S. pertaining to suspected ``20th \n     hijacker'' Zacarias Moussaoui. Germany had initially refused \n     to provide the evidence, arguing that its constitution \n     forbids providing evidence that could lead to enforcement of \n     a death sentence. The U.S. Justice Department agreed to use \n     the evidence only during the guilt determination portion of \n     the trial, and not the sentencing portion of the trial. Given \n     its original reluctance in the Moussaoui case, it is not \n     clear how much cooperation Germany is providing in other \n     terrorist investigations relating to September 11th and any \n     other al-Qaeda investigation. Germany is currently \n     prosecuting Mounir el-Motassadeq for his alleged involvement \n     with the Hamburg terrorist cell connected with the September \n     11th attacks, having charged him with ``aiding and abetting'' \n     the murder of the over thousand victims of September 11th.\n       The following day we had the opportunity to attend a lunch \n     meeting at the offices of the American Jewish Committee \n     (AJC). Lunch was hosted by the managing director, Deidre \n     Berger and Greg Caplan, the assistant director of the AJC in \n     Berlin. Our discussion primarily focused on the attitudes of \n     Germans toward Jews. They were encouraging on many fronts. \n     First, they were confident that the majority of young people \n     are interested in maintaining memory of the holocaust and \n     lessons of their dark past are widely taught in German \n     schools today. Further, the AJC commended the German \n     government for their willingness to teach about racism and \n     tolerance and their cooperation with the AJC on this front. \n     Less positive however, were the results from their recent \n     survey indicating that negative attitudes toward Jews are \n     widespread in German society today. Sixty percent of Germans \n     acknowledge that anti-Semitism is currently a problem in \n     Germany according to the survey.\n       Keeping with the theme of the day, we headed to the Jewish \n     Museum which had an exhibit of 2000 years of German-Jewish \n     history. On New Years Day, 2003, we departed Berlin for \n     Israel.\n\n\n                                 ISRAEL\n\n       Thursday, January 2nd provided us the chance to meet with \n     representatives of the Palestinian Authority and Israeli \n     leaders. In the morning we met with United States Ambassador \n     Daniel Kurtzer, and Salam Fayyad, the new Minister of Finance \n     for the Palestinian National Authority. Mr. Fayyad was \n     certainly a breath of fresh air in the Palestinian Authority. \n     Mr. Fayyad, who was raised in the West Bank has worked with \n     the International Monetary Fund and the Federal Reserve in \n     St. Louis. He received his Ph.D in Texas and has spent time \n     living in Washington, DC.\n       At the time of our meeting, he had just submitted the 2003 \n     Palestinian Budget proposal. This is the first publicly \n     disclosed budget of the Palestinian Authority. He identified \n     significant reforms that he has instituted. First, he has \n     centralized the Treasury. This means that all revenues will \n     now be going directly to the department of the Treasury. \n     Prior to his reform, Palestinian finances went into many \n     different accounts with no centralized control. This enabled \n     monies to be used for such purposes as arms purchases and \n     terrorism financing. Second, Mr. Fayyad took control of \n     public hiring. In the past, there was no management of the \n     public payroll. There were literally hundreds of people \n     within the system who could hire government employees. This \n     encouraged corruption and patronage leading to more violence. \n     Now, under Mr. Fayyad, no additions to the payroll can be \n     made without the express permission of the Ministry of \n     Finance. He also took control of the internal auditing \n     system.\n       I then met with Foreign Minister Netanyahu and we discussed \n     a number of subjects including the peace process, Iraq, and \n     the issue of the prosecution of criminals for terrorist acts \n     committed against Americans abroad. I expressed an interest \n     to extradite to the United States terrorists whom we know are \n     responsible for the death of Americans. I provided the \n     Foreign Minister with a list of several known assassins, some \n     of which were either currently in Israeli prisons or whom \n     Israel had adequate knowledge of their whereabouts. I \n     encouraged the Israelis to work with the United States \n     Justice Department in prosecuting these terrorists.\n       During a lunch meeting with Saeb Erakat, we discussed \n     Chairman Yasser Arafat's leadership abilities and my opinion \n     of the need for the Chairman to step aside. I told him I \n     thought it unrealistic to rely upon Chairman Arafat in the \n     peace process because of the evidence implicating him in \n     terrorism. It had been established that he knew about the \n     shipment of arms from Iran early last year and his \n     handwriting was on documents funding terrorism. I raised the \n     possibility that Chairman Arafat might be regulated to a \n     titular position. Mr. Erakat said that he believes there is \n     no other alternative to Chairman Arafat and that he was \n     working to promote peace and he even gave a recent speech \n     calling for a cease fire. He then went on to say that \n     Chairman Arafat was one of the first leaders to call for a \n     dialogue. Mr. Erakat stated that there is no trust on either \n     side and that under those circumstances it will be almost \n     impossible to begin the process of a recovery.\n       When I asked if he thought there was a chance for the \n     suicide bombings to stop, he said he hoped it was possible, \n     but it will be very difficult because all a person needs is a \n     ``mind-void of hope'' and two hundred dollars to bring about \n     terror. He said that the circumstance on the ground in the \n     Palestinian territories was hopeless for so many.\n       I then went on to meet with the Israeli Attorney General, \n     Elyakim Rubenstein. I further probed the topic of extradition \n     of terrorists accused of killing Americans in Israel and \n     further solicited the cooperation of the Israeli Government \n     in an effort that would support a U.S. prosecution of these \n     terrorists. I noted that I had spoken with Foreign Minister \n     Netanyahu regarding this issue and provided him with a list \n     of suspects. He said that he generally agreed with this idea \n     and pledged full cooperation and willingness to work with the \n     U.S. Justice Department. We acknowledged that it is a high \n     priority for both of our governments to ensure that \n     perpetrators are brought to justice. I responded that I \n     recognize Israel's sovereign right to prosecute terrorists \n     who attack and murder its citizens, but pointed out that \n     there is a valid role for the U.S. Government to play when \n     Americans are killed.\n       Following my meeting in Jerusalem with the Attorney \n     General, I proceeded to Tel Aviv to meet with Prime Minister \n     Ariel Sharon where we discussed a wide range of topics \n     including Palestinian terrorism, Israeli military response, \n     Iraq, and Yasser Arafat. Prime Minister Sharon complained \n     about the ten thousand Hizballah rockets in Lebanon which are \n     pointed toward Israel. He said Damascus was the center and \n     headquarters for the most radical terrorist groups and said \n     they should immediately be dismantled. In context of his \n     focus on Syria, I then asked the Prime Minister if he would \n     be willing to go to Syria to discuss this. He said he was \n     interested in going to Damascus and would be willing to sit \n     down at the negotiating table with President Bashar al-Assad \n     of Syria so long as there were no preconditions. I asked if \n     he would object if I conveyed that message to President Assad \n     when I was in Damascus and he said no.\n       I then went on to meet with former Prime Minister Ehud \n     Barak at his private office in Tel Aviv. Mr. Barak was in \n     good spirits and we had a conversation covering many subjects \n     including the peace process, Lebanon, Iran, and Iraq. Mr. \n     Barak indicated that he supported the efforts the Bush \n     Administration is making toward trying to achieve a lasting \n     peace in the area and believes it represents a very good \n     opportunity. We also discussed the effort that Prime Minister \n     Tony Blair was making by meeting with President Assad and \n     others in the region.\n       Our final meeting of the day was with former Prime Minister \n     Shimon Peres. My first observation was that he didn't age. I \n     asked him about this and he advised me that his philosophy of \n     life keeps him young--he is an optimist. Our meeting was \n     brief as the hour was late and he had another appointment \n     that day. We spoke about Chairman Arafat and the possibility \n     of his moving into a position of less power within the \n     Palestinian Authority. He doubted that would happen.\n       We then discussed his approach to peace discussions. He \n     believes the process should move forward in several \n     directions at once, as opposed to the widely discussed \n     strategy of achieving individual milestones. He compared it \n     to sending a fleet out instead of a train. On the topic of \n     Syria, Mr. Peres did not discount the idea of peace \n     negotiations, but expressed his feeling that Israel should \n     not lose sight of the Palestinian issue, the matter of prime \n     importance.\n\n\n                                 EGYPT\n\n       We arrived at Cairo International Airport on Friday, \n     January 3rd where we were met by our control officer Steven \n     Bondy. From the airport we immediately went to tour the \n     impressive Egyptian Museum where we toured King Tut's tomb \n     and other historical artifacts.\n       Following the Museum, we went to the U.S. embassy where I \n     had the opportunity sit down with a group of Egyptian \n     reporters for a roundtable discussion of current affairs.\n       I then proceeded to the Foreign Ministry for a meeting with \n     Minister Ahmed Maher and U.S. Ambassador David Welch. We \n     discussed my upcoming trip to Damascus for the U.S.-Syrian \n     dialogue. Mr. Maher encouraged my participation and expressed \n     praise for the initiative by the James A. Baker III Institute \n     for Public Policy at Rice University. We discussed Syria in \n     some detail afterward and Mr. Maher's support for President \n     Assad. We then discussed the issue of violence in the \n     Palestinian territories and Mr. Maher expressed his \n     disappointment and view that seemingly eveyday there is \n     another ``incursion'' by Israeli forces. On the\n\n[[Page S1780]]\n\n     upside, he noted that there were forces on both sides \n     amenable to change.\n       The following day we flew to Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt to meet \n     with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. As usual, President \n     Mubarak was a gracious host. We met in his private office and \n     then were invited to join him for brunch. We discussed his \n     recent visit by Prime Minister Tony Blair and his view on \n     prospects for peace. President Mubarak noted that the world \n     has changed very much since our first visit with one another \n     in 1982 but one thing that hasn't changed is that he is still \n     willing to answer any question. I asked him if he thought it \n     was possible for the violence to stop and he said he \n     continued to work for a ``cease-fire'' by all parties. He \n     indicated that he is willing to do whatever he can to help, \n     but that the United States has to be in the center of any \n     deal that is worked out. He said the same was true for a \n     Syrian-Israeli deal as well. We went on to discuss Iran and \n     Iraq and their individual relationships with the United \n     States and Egypt and the reaction of the Egyptian people if \n     President Bush returns to the United Nations for another \n     resolution. He said there was great concern in the Arab world \n     about a war with Iraq. He indicated that there would likely \n     be protests in the street and although he could handle that \n     in Egypt it would be difficult for other Arab leaders. \n     President Mubarak commented that the war with Iraq will have \n     a negative effect on the Egyptian economy and the economics \n     in the region generally.\n       Finally, on the local Pennsylvania scene, I urged President \n     Mubarak to finalize a $100 million deal with Norfolk \n     Southern, which has agreed to rehabilitate 100 Egyptian \n     locomotives. Norfolk Southern is still negotiating the terms \n     of the contract, but it is my hope that the deal can be \n     worked quickly. President Mubarak responded that if the \n     funding was in the pipeline from USAID it would be completed. \n     I offered my thanks to President Mubarak for Egyptian support \n     for the war on terrorism.\n\n\n                                 SYRIA\n\n       On Saturday, January 3rd, we left Egypt and arrived in \n     Damascus, Syria where we were met by Ambassador Theodore H. \n     Kattouf and our Control Officer, Jen Rasamimanana. Ambassador \n     Kattouf is a native of Altoona, Pennsylvania and a graduate \n     of Pennsylvania State University. After attaining the rank of \n     Captain in the United States Army, he began a distinguished \n     career in the foreign service including assignments in \n     Kuwait, Tunis, Beirut, and Baghdad.\n       The following morning I met with Syrian President Bashar \n     al-Assad. President Assad has been meeting with many of my \n     House and senate colleagues in recent months and I \n     complimented him for his willingness to have a dialogue with \n     the different groups. I told him how useful I think it is for \n     Members to have these meetings and how useful I thought it \n     could be for him.\n       W discussed my trip to Israel and my meeting with Prime \n     Minister Ariel Sharon where he indicated his willingness to \n     discuss peace. President Assad said anytime is a good time \n     for peace, but that he believes the United States needs to be \n     involved in any negotiations. I asked him if he thought \n     negotiations could take place prior to an Israeli-Palestinian \n     negotiation. He commented that he thought negotiations could \n     get started, but likely no agreement could occur until the \n     Palestinian issue is resolved. I told President Assad that \n     the U.S. remains committed to resolving the conflict.\n       I then raised the issue which has been brought up by Prime \n     Minister Sharon in Israel regarding terror organizations \n     residing in Syria. I asked that his country work to eliminate \n     groups with Syria's borders who continue to fan the fire in \n     the region. President Assad asserted that these groups, \n     including Hizballah and Hamas, do not conduct terrorist \n     operations out of Syria and that they represent thousands of \n     Palestinians whom he would have to dislocate. He said he was \n     unwilling to do so. I responded that if Syria wanted to be \n     removed from the U.S. terrorist list, Syria would have to \n     oust those terrorist groups from Syria and end support for \n     Hizballah.\n       With regard to Israel we also discussed Prime Minister \n     Sharon's complaint that Syria controlled over ten thousands \n     Katyusha rockets, which were pointed toward Israel. President \n     Assad said these would not be used against the Israeli \n     people.\n       President Assad emphasized Syria's desire to be removed \n     from the U.S. Department of State's list of state sponsors of \n     terrorism and his unhappiness about the Syrian Accountability \n     Act which was introduced in the last Congress and signed by \n     over 45 of my colleagues. I told President Assad if the \n     terrorist groups were to leave Syria, it would go a long way \n     toward their legislative goals in the United States.\n       I commended President Assad on Syria's willingness to \n     support renewed weapons inspections in Iraq and sanctions \n     aimed at disallowing that country's re-armament, which are \n     steps in the right direction. I asked that Syria continue to \n     cooperate with the U.S. against al-Qaeda.\n       I raised with President Assad the issue of an American, \n     Mrs. Liz Henry Murad of New York, who has requested \n     assistance in locating her children who are believed to be in \n     Damascus. Her children were forcibly kidnaped by their \n     father, Mr. Ruwayn Murad, and reportedly taken to Syria. \n     After alerting President Assad, Foreign Minister Farouk at-\n     Shara, and Rustom al-Zoubi, Syrian Ambassador to the United \n     States, of this abduction in separate letters dated February \n     8, 2002, I raised the case with President Assad personally \n     during my previous visit to Damascus in March 2002. Then, on \n     April 4, 2002, I wrote to President Assad and Major General \n     Ali Houri, the Syrian Minister of Interior, requesting that \n     Syrian officials pursue a Lebanese warrant for Mr. Murad. In \n     this meeting with President Assad, he indicated he was \n     willing to work with the Lebanese Government to resolve this \n     case.\n       I also asked President Assad about Guy Hever, a missing \n     Israeli soldier, who is believed by his family to be a \n     prisoner in a Syrian jail. Mr. Hever was last seen on the \n     Golan Heights near the Syrian border on August 17, 1997, I \n     met with the mother of Mr. Hever in my Washington, DC office \n     on November 6, 2002 to hear of her son's mysterious \n     disappearance. Thereafter, I wrote to President Assad \n     asking him to order an inquiry into Mr. Hever's \n     whereabouts and pursued the subject in our meeting. \n     President Assad said he would have the matter \n     investigated.\n       We spent most of the day Monday, January 6th at a U.S.-\n     Syrian dialogue, which was a continuation of the event that \n     took place last May at the Baker Institute at Rice University \n     in Texas. The event was attended by many experts on U.S.-\n     Syrian relations including former U.S. ambassador Edward P. \n     Djerejian, former Ambassador Richard Murphy, Syrian Deputy \n     Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, Buthayna Shaaban, head of \n     the Foreign Ministry's foreign media and public relations \n     department, Riad Ismet, director of the state radio and \n     television service, and Mohammad Aziz Shukri, a professor of \n     international law at state-run Damascus University.\n       The dialog focused on Iraq as well as the Israeli/\n     Palestinian issues. The Syrian interlocutors were adamant in \n     opposition to war against Iraq although they condemned Saddam \n     Hussein's conduct. The Syrians welcomed my opinion, even \n     though I emphasized it was President Bush's ultimate \n     decision, that the U.S. should return to the UN for another \n     resolution supporting the use of force before acting.\n       Notwithstanding the heated comments and diverse points of \n     view, the exchanges were constructive. The Syrians left with \n     a better understanding of our revulsion to suicide bombings \n     targeting civilians after our own experience of 9/11. Both \n     sides agreed that the killing of Israeli and Palestinian non-\n     combatants had to be stopped. The only real agreement came on \n     the utility of ``dialogue'' even in the absence of any \n     agreement on any proposed solution.\n       With the opportunity presented by a new young, British \n     educated President in Damascus, we should accelerate our \n     efforts to improve U.S./Syrian relations, persuade the \n     Syrians on our views on terrorism and strive for an Israeli/\n     Syrian Peace Treaty.\n       We left Syria on the afternoon of January 6th, made an \n     overnight stop in London to change planes, and headed back to \n     Washington, DC on January 7th to begin a new session of \n     Congress.\n\n           [From the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Jan. 15, 2003]\n\n A Tour Through Europe and the Mideast Reveals the Lack of Enthusiasm \n                   for a U.S. Military Attack On Iraq\n\n       My ten-day fact finding visit to Europe and the Mid-East in \n     late December and early January found little support for a \n     U.S. war against Iraq. The Germans were outspoken in \n     opposition. British Prime Minister Tony Blair, personally a \n     strong supporter of President Bush, appeared to be a leader \n     without many followers on this issue.\n       The strongest opposition and most dire warnings came from \n     nations in the Mid-East with the exception of Israel. Egypt's \n     President Mubarak, a solid U.S. ally for more than two \n     decades, predicted violence against U.S. interests in the \n     region if Iraq is attacked. U.S. Embassy personnel in Syria \n     are on alert to evacuate in advance of any war.\n       Recollections are still fresh on the Syrian mob which \n     ransacked our Ambassador's residence in Damascus in December \n     1998 following a U.S. missile attack on Bagdad. Ambassador \n     Ryan Crocker's wife was rescued just before the mob \n     threatened to break through the steel door in the so-called \n     ``safe haven''. The bricks and mortar of the residence have \n     been repaired, but the psychological damage lingers on.\n       I was in Damascus on that night in December 1998 when that \n     attack occurred and was awakened at 2 A.M. to watch CNN's \n     coverage of the missiles striking Bagdad. Leaving Syria on \n     schedule at 6:30 that morning, I then traveled to Egypt and \n     Jordan and heard strong Arab protests on the U.S. military \n     action which was minuscule compared to what is now planned.\n       On January 6th in Damascus, the ``US/Syrian Dialogue'', a \n     forum initiated by the Baker Public Policy Institute in \n     Houston last May, focused on Iraq as well as the Israeli/\n     Palestinian issues. The Syrian interlocutors were adamant in \n     opposition to war against Iraq although they condemned Saddam \n     Hussein's conduct. The Syrians welcomed my opinion, even \n     though I emphasized it was President Bush's ultimate \n     decision, that the U.S. should return to the UN for another \n     resolution supporting the use of force before acting.\n       In a separate meeting, President Bashar al Assad and \n     Foreign Minister Shara complained to me about the UN's \n     refusal to give all members of the Security Council the full\n\n[[Page S1781]]\n\n     12,000 pages turned over by Iraq after Syria and all the \n     other 14 nations had voted unanimously for Iraq to comply \n     with its obligation to disarm. I agreed that all member \n     nations, which are asked to vote for sanctions including UN \n     military action, are entitled to all the Iraqi documents and \n     whatever data the U.S. can supply establishing Iraq's non-\n     compliance.\n       While the Syrians strongly favored a second UN resolution, \n     they left no doubt they would not join in any UN military \n     action as they had in 1991. They emphasized their 1991 \n     joinder was based on Iraq's attack of Kuwait, another Arab \n     nation, which was not present now.\n       German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's opposition to war \n     against Iraq was echoed in our January 2nd meeting with \n     Wolfgang Busbach, a member of the Bundestag. He explained \n     that his country's experience in two 21st century wars had \n     made Germans irreversibly pacifists. Even though he persisted \n     in asserting Germany would not participate in military action \n     even if the UN voted for it, he hoped the U.S. would seek \n     another resolution before acting.\n       I was surprised to hear so much sentiment that it was \n     politically incorrect for Germans to express pride in being \n     German. Chancellor Schroeder was criticized for referring to \n     the ``German Way'' in their recent election and stopped using \n     that phrase. That attitude indicates Germany's reluctance to \n     participate in any military action which might revive \n     international sentiment against German nationalism.\n       These meetings confirmed my strong sense that the U.S. \n     position would be greatly strengthened by a second UN \n     resolution. UN Inspector Hans Blix has already noted Iraq is \n     in default in not explaining what happened to the weapons of \n     mass destruction which it had in 1998 before the UN was \n     ousted. Perhaps the U.S. will be able to bolster the case \n     showing Saddam's falsification from testimony from Iraq's \n     scientists or evidence from U.S. Intelligence sources which \n     can be disclosed without compromising sources or methods.\n       The final determinant on whether there will be war may be \n     the vague and unpredictable state of Saddam's mind. Is he \n     suicidal?\n       While the evidence is overwhelming on his venality and \n     brutality, my 75 minute meeting with him in January 1990 \n     persuaded me he was not a madman. Saddam has surprised many \n     by submitting to UN inspections, even opening up his palaces, \n     apologizing to Kuwait and making his scientists available for \n     interrogation. Perhaps he has a surprise ending in mind.\n\n                 [From the Patriot-News, Jan. 21, 2003]\n\n                Young Syrian Could Provide Mideast Hope\n\n       A suicide bombing at a Tel Aviv bus terminal murdering 23 \n     more civilians on January 5th cast a pall over discussions on \n     the Mid-East peace process which I had last week with Prime \n     Minister Sharon in Israel, President Mubarak in Egypt and \n     President Assad in Syria.\n       In Israel, Prime Minister Sharon insisted that negotiations \n     could not be conducted with Chairman Arafat because of his \n     proved complicity in supporting Palestinian terrorists. When \n     I suggested to Sa'ab-Erekat, Arafat's chief negotiator, that \n     the Chairman step aside to a titular position without power, \n     Erekat responded that Arafat was determined to stay on as the \n     duly elected leader. Egypt's President Mubarak and Syrian \n     President Bashar al Assad agreed there was no one else on the \n     scene to speak for the Palestinians although neither would \n     vouch for Arafat's word or his non-involvement in terrorism.\n       So, the stalemate continues with no sign of the tunnel let \n     alone a light at the end of the tunnel. The Arabs, who \n     vociferously argue that Prime Minister Sharon does not want \n     peace, must know that this January suicide bombing \n     strengthens his appeal in elections scheduled for later this \n     month. Those who oppose peace, while perhaps not more \n     numerous, appear to be more effective than those who favor \n     peace.\n       Our Mid-East visits did produce some bright spots. The new \n     Palestinian Finance Minister offers real hope that \n     transparency may be forthcoming and corruption may be \n     restrained. A University of Texas Ph.D. in economics and a \n     former official at both the IMF and the Federal Revenue, \n     Salam Fayyad, a native Palestinian, returned to his homeland \n     after living in the U.S. from 1987 to 1995. In our meeting at \n     the U.S. consulate in Jerusalem, Minister Fayyad outlined \n     impressive reforms: (1) requiring all revenues to be paid to \n     the Ministry of Finance eliminating the potential for \n     diversion for corruption or terrorism; (2) consolidating all \n     hiring in his department to eliminate patronage and \n     kickbacks; and (3) activating both internal and external \n     audits. His just released January 2003 budget was the first \n     public budget in the history of the Palestinian Authority.\n       If corruption and violence could be eliminated, or at least \n     curtailed, the stage could be set for resumption of \n     contributions by the donor nations to rebuild the Palestinian \n     Authority infrastructure and compensate Israel for its \n     losses. In a relaxed setting in the resort town of Sharm el-\n     Sheik, President Mubarak reiterated his longstanding efforts \n     to broker a ``cease fire''. With Hamas and Islam Jihad \n     continuing to claim credit for suicide bombings and evidence \n     linking Chairman Arafat personally to supporting terrorists, \n     such a ``cease fire'' appears remote, but worth the \n     continuing effort.\n       After Prime Minister Sharon denounced Syria's harboring \n     terrorist organizations in Damascus and supporting Hezbollah \n     in southern Lebanon, I asked him if he would be willing to \n     enter into peace negotiations with Syria as Prime Minister \n     Rabin had in the mid-1990s which were brokered by President \n     Clinton. He said he would providing there were no pre-\n     conditions and asked me to convey that offer to President \n     Assad which I did three days later in Damascus.\n       President Assad said he was willing to open peace talks \n     with Israel. He said he did not think it appropriate to \n     conclude a treaty before Israel and the Palestinian Authority \n     had reached a final settlement, but that Syrian/Israeli talks \n     could proceed on separate tracks. I do not expect Syria and \n     Israel to immediately activate such discussions, but the \n     reactions were more positive than I heard in many visits to \n     Damascus and Jerusalem a decade earlier.\n       I then asked President Assad about Hezbollah and terrorist \n     organizations in Damascus both in terms of Prime Minister \n     Sharon's complaints and Syria being on the U.S. terrorist \n     list. He responded that the organizations in Damascus were \n     not involved in terrorism in Israel, but represented \n     thousands of Palestinians who lived in Syria. As to \n     Hezbollah, President Assad insisted that the Lebanese/Israeli \n     border had been quiet, except for one or two skirmishes, \n     since April 1986 when Secretary of State Warren Christopher \n     worked out an agreement between the parties.\n       Notwithstanding those responses, I urged him to do more to \n     satisfy the demands of our State Department for Syria's \n     removal from the terrorist list. I remind him that the Syrian \n     Accountability Act in the 107th Congress had obtained 35 co-\n     sponsors in the Senate which represented real concern on the \n     terrorism issue even though opposed by the Bush \n     Administration. Should it become law, it would probably cause \n     a downgrading of relations even to the possible extent of \n     withdrawing ambassadors.\n       At the conclusion of my trip, I attended the opening of the \n     second U.S./Syrian Dialogue on January 6th in Damascus. The \n     first ``Dialogue'' was held last May in Houston under the co-\n     sponsorship of the Government of Syria and the James Baker \n     Institute of Public Policy. The ``Dialogue'' focused on the \n     Israeli/Palestinian controversies and Iraq. Notwithstanding \n     the heated comments and diverse points of view, the exchanges \n     were constructive. The Syrians left with a better \n     understanding of our revulsion to suicide bombings targeting \n     civilians after our own experience of 9/11. Both sides agreed \n     that the killing of Israeli and Palestinian non-combatants \n     had to be stopped.

Mr. President, this Tuesday we heard the President of the \nUnited States in his State of the Union Address once again appeal to \nthe American people to support sending United States troops into a \npreemptive war against Iraq. In support of his appeal, he did not tell \nus anything we have not heard before.\n  A majority of the American people remain unconvinced that the United \nStates, only 3 months after sponsoring a U.N. Security Council \nresolution calling on Iraq to disarm, should now, without the support \nof the Security Council, abandon the U.N. inspections process and \nlaunch a unilateral military invasion.\n  On January 18, in my home State of Vermont, over 3,000 Vermonters \ngathered in front of the Vermont State House in Montpelier, in freezing \nweather--in fact, some of the coldest weather we have had in years--to \nexpress their opposition to a war with Iraq. It is a privilege to \nrepresent a State whose citizens have always been among the most \nthoughtful voices and sometimes the most outspoken voices.\n  Those Vermonters were of all ages and from all walks of life. They \nwere not alone. Hundreds of thousands of Americans, including many \nVermonters, traveled to Washington to brave the subfreezing \ntemperatures here. And there were protests in other cities and towns \nacross the country.\n  These demonstrations convey the growing recognition of many Americans \nthat the administration is preparing to invade Iraq, despite the \nopposing views of many allies and irrespective of any decision by the \nU.N. Security Council.\n  The situation in Iraq is not a simple black-and-white issue. I have \nsaid this over and over. We saw how the Reagan administration and the \nformer Bush administration often facilitated and frequently ignored \nSaddam Hussein's development of weapons of mass destruction, until he \nextended his territorial claims to Kuwait's oil fields. We all know \nthere is abundant evidence that Saddam Hussein is a deceitful, \nmurderous villain. No one ignores that.\n  Still, there are times in history when circumstances compel us to \nspeak out, and this is one of those times.\n  Several Senators have spoken eloquently--Senator Kerry, Senator \nBiden, Senator Kennedy, and others--and I associate myself with many of \ntheir remarks.\n  Mr. President, the White House and Pentagon are fueling the belief \nthat war with Iraq is inevitable. That was the President's message in \nthe State of the Union Address, although no new evidence was offered. \nMany in the White House are eager, even impatient, for war to begin. \nThey view Iraq as the first step in a fundamental reshaping of the \ngeopolitical alignment of the Middle East. It reminds me of when I \nfirst started serving in the Senate, and the White House political \nthinkers at that time were obsessed with theories about falling \ndominos.\n  I, like many here, and like many in the White House who are the most \nvocal advocates of a preemptive, unilateral invasion of Iraq, have been \nblessed with never having faced military combat.\n  I take to heart the wise words of my friend, Senator Chuck Hagel:\n\n       Many of those who want to rush this country into war and \n     think it would be so quick and easy don't know anything about \n     war. They come at it from an intellectual perspective versus \n     having sat in jungles or foxholes and watched their friends \n     get their heads blown off.\n\n  These same administration officials have also studiously avoided \ntalking about what is inevitable in any war--American lives will be \nlost and the lives of innocent civilians, overwhelmingly, will be lost. \nPeople will die on both sides. And they give short shrift to the risks \nwar with Iraq poses to building broad support for peace in the Middle \nEast and, most important, to our efforts to thwart international \nterrorism.\n  The saber rattling in Washington--and the steady deployment of tens \nof thousands of U.S. troops, planes, and ships to the Persian Gulf--is \ncausing alarm and fear both here and abroad. But world opinion, \nincluding so many of our allies, is squarely in favor of exhausting \nevery effort to avoid war.\n  The people of Vermont gave me, as a member of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee in the spring of 1975, the opportunity to cast a \ntie-breaking vote against continued funding of the Vietnam war. I \nrecall so well how over 30 years ago, even before focus groups, mass \npolling, and the hyperbole of midterm elections, White House politics--\njoined unfortunately by both parties--not the need to protect the \nAmerican people, caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people in \nthat unnecessary war in Vietnam. I am as proud of that vote as any I \nhave cast since--and I have cast well over 10,000 votes in this body--\nand I will bring Vermonters' voices to the Iraq debate today.\n  It has been only 60 days since the U.N. weapons inspectors returned \nto Iraq. They are just reaching full capacity. I and others here urged \nPresident Bush to go to the United Nations and seek a resolution \ncalling on Iraq to disarm, and I applauded the President when he did \nthat. It was one of the finest speeches of his career, and he secured a \nunanimous vote in the Security Council for that resolution.\n\n  Now, however, the White House is wrong to dismiss the inspections as \nhaving failed so soon when the chief U.N. inspector says he is \nexpanding his team and plans to work at least into March. The British, \nFrench, and German governments have all said the U.N. should be given \nmore time, especially as long as the Iraqis give the inspectors access \nthroughout the country.\n  This is the type of common sense that should be guiding our policy, \nnot a knee-jerk, trigger-happy approach that alienates our friends and \nallies. We should work closely with the United Nations. We should \nremember that far more of Iraq's weapons were discovered and destroyed \nby the inspectors after the Gulf War than were destroyed by our troops \nduring the Gulf War.\n  I have no doubt Saddam Hussein is lying. He has lied countless times \nbefore. He is likely hiding weapons, including chemical and biological \nweapons. The U.N. inspectors' report leaves little doubt of that.\n  The Iraqis have not explained what happened to thousands of tons of \nchemical weapons material, and other biological munitions they had in \ntheir possession 5 years ago. There have been discoveries of empty \nchemical weapons shells and documents they had not disclosed. These are \nserious discrepancies by a regime that is among the world's most \ndangerous, deceptive, and brutal.\n  There may also be other evidence of Saddam Hussein's deception that \nthe administration has not yet revealed. But the inspectors are \ncontinuing their work, and the results so far do not justify abandoning \nthe inspections process and sending thousands of American men and women \ninto a war costing hundreds of billions of dollars, that will cost \nAmerican lives, and the lives of innocent civilians, and could trigger \na wider conflict in the Middle East, while creating more enemies and \nterrorists over the long run.\n  If Saddam Hussein is removed from power, we will all celebrate. He \nhas terrorized the Iraqi people for decades. His security agents have \nsadistically tortured, even summarily executed, many thousands of \npeople. But far more is at stake here than getting rid of Saddam \nHussein. At stake is the justification for sending Americans into war \nabsent an imminent threat to the security of the United States, the \nmost powerful Nation on Earth.\n  We have heard a lot of strong rhetoric, but we have not heard a \ncompelling case that the use of military force is the only alternative \nto disarm Iraq.\n  Last year, our President pointed to ``evidence'' that Iraq was \ndeveloping nuclear weapons. Today, that evidence seems to be \ndisappearing. Despite a rush to judgment by some White House officials, \nU.S. intelligence experts remain deeply divided on this question. The \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency says there is no evidence that Iraq \nhas resumed its quest for nuclear weapons.\n  In response, the White House claims there is proof Iraq is hiding \nchemical and biological weapons. That proof may well exist. If it does, \nthe administration should immediately take it to the Security Council \nto help convince skeptical friends and allies and to assist the \ninspectors in their disarmament work.\n  I remember when I was a student here in Washington at Georgetown \nUniversity Law School at the time of the\n\n[[Page S1783]]\n\nCuban missile crisis. President Kennedy sent his Ambassador, Adlai \nStevenson, to the chambers of the United Nations. He held up \nirrefutable proof of the missiles being put in Cuba by the then Soviet \nUnion. With that proof, the world rallied around the United States.\n\n  We have to remember how missteps can create more problems. The \nsituation in North Korea today illustrates how a dangerous situation \ncan quickly escalate unnecessarily. By taking options off the table, we \nare worse off today than we were a few months ago. After backing the \nUnited States into a corner, the White House is now discussing \ndonations of food and fuel, an approach they ridiculed just a short \ntime ago. We have to be more consistent.\n  Today, there are no U.N. inspectors monitoring the North Korean \nnuclear facilities. Tensions have dramatically increased, and we have \nserious disagreements with our Japanese and South Korean allies. Let us \nnot make the same mistake in Iraq that history, both decades ago and \nmore recently, has tried to teach us.\n  Saddam Hussein must be disarmed to the point that he is no longer a \nthreat to his neighbors. U.N. resolutions must be respected and \nenforced. But these are matters of concern to the world, not just to \nthe United States. We are part of the world, but we are not the whole \nworld.\n  The U.N. inspectors need time to complete their work. It is divisive \nand damaging for the United States, having secured a Security Council \nresolution, two months later to short-circuit the U.N. process in the \nname of enforcing that same U.N. resolution.\n  To those officials in the White House and the Pentagon who would use \nthe U.N. inspections as a mere excuse to justify unilateral military \naction, I say the same things as when I opposed the resolution \nauthorizing the use of force that passed the Senate back in September: \nThis Vermonter never has and never will give a blank check to this \nPresident or to any President to wage war.\n  The next weeks and months will be decisive. Let's hope the Iraqi \nGovernment fulfills its obligations and the inspectors finish the job \nin a manner that gives credibility to their conclusions, whatever those \nconclusions may be. Let's work with the U.N. Security Council and our \nallies to find a way forward.\n  Unlike his father a decade ago, this President has not built a broad \ncoalition for military action. If diplomacy fails, I am confident we \ncan win a military victory. After all, we have the most powerful \nmilitary in the world. But acting unilaterally would be extremely \ncostly. It would lead to a prolonged U.S. military occupation of Iraq, \nthe expenditure of tens, even hundreds, of billions of dollars. It \nwould damage our relations with key allies, and it would further \ninflame the anti-American extremism that is growing throughout the \nMuslim world, extremism that threatens us more than anything else \ntoday.\n  It threatens us because even today terrorists plan their attacks \nwithin the United States, not in the Persian Gulf. We need the world to \nbe with us. A broad-based coalition is indispensable for achieving \nlong-term peace in the Persian Gulf and the Middle East, as well as our \ncontinuing efforts against international terrorism.\n  This war is not inevitable. We should not talk or act as if it is. \nBut if war does come, let the United States be able to say we did \neverything we could to try to solve this another way; that we worked in \nconcert with the United Nations; and that the U.N. was strengthened in \nthe process. We must be convinced that war is justified; that the \nsacrifice of American lives can be justified; that America taking this \nstep of a preemptive war can be justified not only today but, in \nhistory's eyes, decades from now.\n  I do not believe that threshold has yet been reached. So many of the \nAmerican people do not. Our allies do not.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, following the attacks of September 11, \nmany Americans found themselves feeling, perhaps for the first time, a \nsense of vulnerability. Terrorists had successfully infiltrated our \ncountry, hijacked four of our jetliners, and committed mass suicide. \nUsing simple tactics and superb coordination, they singlehandedly \nchanged the American mindset in a matter of minutes.\n  President Bush recognized that our way of life changed drastically on \nSeptember 11. During an address to a joint session of Congress and the \nAmerican people 9 days after the attacks, President Bush said the \nfollowing:\n\n       On September 11, enemies of freedom committed an act of war \n     against our country. Americans have known wars--but for the \n     past 136 years, they have been wars on foreign soil, except \n     for one Sunday in 1941. Americans have known the casualties \n     of war--but not at the center of a great city on a peaceful \n     morning. Americans have known surprise attacks--but never \n     before on thousands of civilians. All of this brought upon us \n     in a single day--and night fell on a different world, a world \n     where freedom itself is under attack.\n\n  For nearly 10 years prior to that, our country enjoyed unprecedented \npeace and prosperity. The economy grew at an unbelievable rate. We were \nat peace with our neighbors. We focused on health-care, welfare, \neducation, and other domestic priorities. The fall of the Soviet Union \neliminated the threat to our Nation. Our defense budget shrank; our \nintelligence resources dwindled; and our homeland defenses remained \nvirtually nonexistent. The biggest problem our military faced was not \nhow best to invade Iraq, but how to keep enlisted families off food \nstamps.\n  Our mind simply was elsewhere. A number of blue-ribbon commissions \ntried to get our attention. The Bremer Commission pointed out the \ndeficiencies of our intelligence collection efforts. The Gilmore \nCommission revealed how disconnected, disparate, and dysfunctional our \nhomeland security efforts were. And, the Hart-Rudman Commission \ndiscussed how much our Federal Government needed to be restructured to \nbetter combat terrorism. Yet many of the recommendations from these \ncommissions were pushed aside as being impractical, too expensive, or \nunnecessary. As it turns out, they were right, and on September 11, we \npaid the price.\n  Since that dreadful day, we have made considerable progress. We have \nrid Afghanistan of its terrorists-run government, disrupted terrorist \noperations around the world, and taken steps to improve our homeland \ndefenses. I was pleased last November when the Congress, after 3 months \nof debate, approved legislation to create the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. This Department will pull together 22 agencies and nearly \n200,000 Federal employees. It will not be an easy task. Tom Ridge, the \nnew Secretary of the Department, will have his hands full for many \nyears to come.\n  The Department of Defense has also taken a number of measures to \nimprove our homeland defense. The establishment of Northern Command was \na significant organizational step toward fighting terrorism at our \nborders. The new commander, Air Force Gen. Ed Eberhart, will be \nresponsible for the defense of the United States, including land, \naerospace and sea defenses. NORTHCOM will also provide military \nassistance to civil authorities, including crisis and subsequent \nconsequence management operations should such assistance be necessary.\n  This past year the Congress went further when it created a new \nAssistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland Security within Department \nof Defense. The assistant secretary will be responsible for providing \nguidance and planning assistance to the various combatant commands, \nincluding NORTHCOM. The Senate Armed Services Committee, of which I am \na member, held a hearing today on the President's nominee, Paul McHale, \nfor this position.\n  Despite our efforts to build stronger homeland defenses, our country \nfinds itself confronted by numerous threats on several different \nfronts. As we\n\n[[Page S1784]]\n\nspeak, thousands of U.S. soldiers, sailors, and marines are being \ndeployed around the globe in such remote places as Southeast Asia, the \nPersian Gulf, and the Horn of Africa. Just last week, 4,000 soldiers \nfrom Fort Carson, CO, were given orders to deploy overseas.\n  The war against global terrorism continues to require substantial \nresources and considerable foreign cooperation. The administration has \nmade enormous progress in this area, but more remains to be done. Many \nal-Qaida operatives are at large, and several nations continue to \nsupport terror groups. We must remain vigilant and proactive if we are \nto prevent future terror attacks.\n  With regard to Iraq, as the President said during his state of the \nunion address, Saddam Hussein continues to hide his weapons programs, \ndespite an aggressive weapons inspection regime. To many, the 12,000 \npage Iraqi declaration given to the United Nations last December was \nduplicative of previous declarations and revealed little of value. It \nonly served to highlight Saddam Hussein's determination to retain his \nweapons of mass destruction.\n  The reports earlier this week by the U.N.'s chief weapons inspectors. \nHans Blix and Mohamed ElBaradei, further demonstrated that Iraq remains \nunwilling to give up its weapons programs. In his statement to the \nUnited Nation's Security Council, Hans Blix emphasized this point. He \nsaid,\n\n       Unlike South Africa, which decided on its own to eliminate \n     its nuclear weapons and welcomed the inspection as a means of \n     creating confidence in its disarmament, Iraq appears not to \n     have come to a genuine acceptance, not even today, of the \n     disarmament which was demanded of it and which it needs to \n     carry out to win the confidence of the world and to live in \n     peace.\n\n  Iraq has hedged, delayed, and avoided complete disarmament for over a \ndecade. There comes a time when diplomacy and sanctions become \nexercises in futility. There come a time when only military action will \nsucceed where negotiations have repeatedly failed. There comes a time \nwhen the President of the United States, as leader of the free world, \nmust say enough is enough.\n  Several press reports indicate that some U.S. allies, most notably \nFrance and Germany, may oppose military action against Iraq at this \ntime. We should certainly take their thoughts into consideration. Our \nalliances should be both respected and preserved. At the same time, \nthough, the President has an obligation to our country to do what is \nbest for the United States--his primary responsibility is the safety \nand security of the American people. It is my hope that our friends and \nallies will recognize our determination to eliminate the threat posed \nby Iraq's weapons programs and support our efforts in the Persian Gulf.\n  Just as we prepare to confront Iraq's growing arsenal of destruction, \nwe cannot ignore the threat posed by North Korea's nuclear and \nballistic missile programs. The Bush administration has sought to form \na global consensus to deal with North Korea's WMD ambitions. Press \nreports indicate that the President wants the United Nations Security \nCouncil to deal with this threat to East Asia. I think this is a good \nfirst step.\n  In many ways, the North Korean issue is different from the situation \ninvolving Iraq. There haven't been any U.N. resolutions calling for the \ndisarmament of North Korea, nor have North Korea's allies, China and \nRussia, shown much interest in resolving this issue. A global consensus \nis now beginning to form. Our allies in the region, South Korea and \nJapan, are only starting to realize the danger North Korea's WMD \nefforts pose to the region.\n  Five years ago, North Korea test-launched a three-stage ballistic \nmissile over Japan that could have reached parts of the United States.\n  I think that is worth repeating.\n  Five years ago, North Korea test-launched a three-stage ballistic \nmissile over Japan that could have reached parts of the United States.\n  This test ended a debate as to whether our country was vulnerable to \nballistic missile attacks from countries of concern. It became of \nquestion of what we were going to do about it. Finally, after much \ndebate, the Congress authorized in 1999 the development and deployment \nof a national missile defense system ``as soon as it was \ntechnologically feasible.''\n  Since President Bush's election in 2000, the Department of Defense \nhas made considerable progress on a missile defense system. With \nadditional funding and less restrictions, the Missile Defense Agency \nhas launched a broad effort to evaluate all potential options for \nmissile defense, including ground-based, sea-based, and even space-\nbased defenses. The MDA now has a number of high-profile missile \ndefense systems in development and is making progress in developing \nsophisticated sensors capable of detecting incoming missiles.\n  As the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on \nStrategic Programs and Operations, including missile defense, I have \nassisted the President in developing these systems. Last year, the \nCongress provided nearly $8 billion for missile defense.\n  I am pleased that a number of projects are now nearing completion. \nThe PAC-3, an enhanced version of the Patriot missile used during the \ngulf war capable of intercepting short and medium-range ballistic \nmissiles, has entered into production. The Army's Theater High-Altitude \nAir Defense--THAAD--a system to counter medium-range ballistic \nmissiles, is nearing production. And, perhaps most significantly, the \nground-based mid-course interceptor system, which provides the United \nStates with a limited defense against ICBMs, is scheduled to be \ndeployed in 2004, as announced by President Bush on December 17 of this \npast year.\n  Missile defense is not the only program that has received increased \nattention since President Bush's election. The DOD budget as a whole \nhas grown substantially over the past 2 years. Last year, the Congress \nauthorized over $390 billion in funding the department, an increase of \nnearly $40 billion from the year before. While much of this increase \nwent to support our military operations overseas, some of this money \nwas used to shore up our counter-terrorism efforts, improve our \nintelligence capabilities, and develop new technologies to counter the \ngrowing threats to our Nation. The department is expected to request \nsimilar funding for the upcoming fiscal year.\n  The President and the Congress have worked hard over the past 2 years \nto reduce the threats to our Nation and prevent future attacks. It has \nnot been easy. Partisan politics, divergent personalities, and \nconflicting perspectives frequently interrupt the process.\n  I believe the President deserves much of the credit for this \nprogress. He has stepped up and led our country in a very difficult \ntime. His message has clearly resonated with the American people. \nIncreased vigilance and enhanced security are essential in a time of \nuncertainty and perceived vulnerability. I share this message and will \ncontinue to work in the Senate to see that measures that are enacted \nactually increase the security of the American people.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I recognize there has been a good deal of \ndiscussion in the last day or two with respect to Iraq; much of it, of \ncourse, as a result of the President's State of the Union Message the \nother evening, and, of course, it is a legitimate discussion about \nwhere we are with respect to Iraq and terrorism.\n  I believe the President's message was very complete. I thought he \nspelled out exactly what his plans are and the reasons for them. I \nthink he has pursued the proper course over a period of time.\n  Certainly, there is no one here who wants to have to go to war. No \none here wants active military intervention if that can be avoided. On \nthe other hand, this is a progressive situation that has to be \nresolved, which started back in 1991, and has not yet been resolved. So\n\n[[Page S1785]]\n\nI think the only legitimate, reasonable course for us is to go through \nall we can to avoid military action, but if we do not get the results \nthat need to be had, then that is our alternative.\n  I think we have been on the right course. And we are not finished. \nCertainly we are not finished. There is all kinds of evidence that \nthings that were promised or ordered to be done have not been done.\n  I think one of the things we need to consider is times have changed. \nTimes have changed since September 11. Years ago, when there were \nthreats of war, what it involved, of course, was tanks and divisions \nlanding and all kinds of very obvious military activities. Now the real \nthreat is not that, it is terrorism; it is for things that could happen \nin this country similar to what happened on September 11--without all \nthat preparation, without all that warning. It just happened in very \nterrible kinds of incidents. So I think in protecting our country, we \nneed to understand the situation is quite different than it was.\n  There has been a great deal of talk about smoking guns. Frankly, I do \nnot believe you need to see a smoking gun if you go back to the \nbeginning of this whole enterprise. Go back to 1991, when there was a \ncease-fire arrangement after the gulf war, after Saddam had been driven \nout of the country he had invaded. And there was a legal basis for it. \nThere was a cease-fire, an agreement, and a succeeding U.N. resolution \nwhich was the sound basis for our action in Iraq.\n  The Council Resolution 687 was adopted in 1991. At the heart of it \nwas a disarmament obligation from Iraq. Then you remember we had \ninspectors there up until 1998. There was very little cooperation \nduring all that time, and the evidence they had accumulated then is \nstill available. This was all done under international supervision. But \nnothing was completed. There was not success in forcing Saddam to \ndisarm. So that is where we are at this time.\n  I think the policy we have to take takes into account what should \nhave been done, what has not been done--this irresponsible activity on \nthe part of Iraq's leadership--and, therefore, we are in the position \nto have to be prepared to do whatever is necessary to make that happen.\n\n  I certainly hope that can happen. And I presume there is going to be \nsome more time for inspectors. Hopefully, based now on another U.N. \nresolution, which, of course, was done in November of last year, we can \nput on more pressure to have him comply with that resolution.\n  The key to this situation, I hope everyone remembers, is to disarm--\nnot necessarily to attack, not to go into Iraq if we can get \ndisarmament. That, obviously, is the thing we are set up to do.\n  I believe we ought to continue to follow the vote we took in the \nSenate. I think it was 77 votes supporting the President to do what he \nhas to do.\n  Now there are suggestions of having to go back and do that again. I \ndo not understand that, frankly. The basis for that vote is still the \nbasis for where we are today. The authority there is the authority to \nfinish the job that is very threatening to everyone and, indeed, must \nbe completed.\n  I certainly support the President and his team in terms of trying to \ncome to a resolution on this situation, being prepared to do what we \nhave to do--hopefully, not having to do it--but to be sure we do \neverything we can to protect Americans, to protect the world, to \nestablish the responsibility that countries have with respect to the \nU.N. If we are going to have a U.N., if we are going to have U.N. \nresolutions, then they should be enforced, and they should be expected \nto comply.\n  I believe that is where we are. All of us hope for the best and \ncontinue, I hope, to support the President to do what is necessary to \nprotect us from another September 11.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \ngo into executive session and the Committee on Governmental Affairs is \ndischarged from further consideration of the following nomination which \nthe clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Gordon England, of \nTexas, to be Deputy Secretary, Department of Homeland Security.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there are now 20 \nminutes evenly divided on the nomination.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the Presiding Officer had the misfortune \nlast night to be presiding when I presented the qualifications of \nSecretary Gordon England to be the Deputy Secretary of the new \nDepartment of Homeland Security. Unfortunately for the Presiding \nOfficer, the vote did not occur last night, so he is going to once \nagain hear a little bit more about Secretary England. But since Gordon \nEngland is such an unusually well qualified candidate for this \nposition, I will beg the indulgence of the Presiding Officer as I \noutline for my colleagues who were not here last evening his \nqualifications for this important post.\n  Last Wednesday, the Senate voted unanimously to confirm Tom Ridge to \nbe the first Secretary of Homeland Security. Today, I am confident that \nthe Senate will unanimously confirm Gordon England to be Secretary \nRidge's Deputy at his side at the helm of this critical new Department.\n  The Department of Homeland Security opened its doors last Friday. \nTogether, Secretary Ridge and Deputy Secretary England make a \nformidable team to chart the new Department on a course to protecting \nour Nation from the threat of terrorist attacks.\n  As President Bush has said:\n\n       Our enemy is smart and resolute, [but] we are smarter and \n     more resolute.\n\n  Part of our resolve must be to place the best possible leaders in \ncharge of the new Department of Homeland Security. Gordon England is \nsuch a leader. The Committee on Governmental Affairs, which I have the \nhonor of chairing, thoroughly considered his nomination. We held a \nhearing last Friday. The nominee also responded to extensive prehearing \nquestions. And yesterday the committee unanimously agreed to discharge \nthe nomination to expedite floor consideration.\n  Gordon England is extraordinarily well qualified for this important \npost. He currently serves as Secretary of the Navy, a position he has \nheld since May 2001. Moreover, he came to the Navy with an impressive \nportfolio of management experience. He served as executive vice \npresident of General Dynamics and he was responsible for two major \nsectors of the corporation: Information systems, and international \naffairs.\n  Earlier in his career, he served in various executive capacities at a \nnumber of divisions of General Dynamics. But as preparation for \nbecoming the Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security, it would be \ndifficult to beat a tour as the Secretary of the Department of the \nNavy. As Secretary, Gordon England headed a department with a budget of \nover $100 billion and consisting of 462,000 sailors and 212,000 \nmarines.\n  The Department of Homeland Security, which we often describe as a \nmassive new Department, will bring together a civilian workforce of \nabout 170,000 individuals. The Secretary of the Navy not only had many \nmore military employees to supervise, but he had a civilian workforce \nof 190,000 employees.\n  Secretary England's extensive experience in managing large complex \noperations in both the private and public sectors will serve him well \nas the Deputy Secretary of the new Department.\n\n[[Page S1786]]\n\n  Moreover, Secretary England brings a complete understanding of the \nDepartment of Defense which will prove invaluable in developing the \nappropriate communications links and levels of coordination between the \nDepartment of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security.\n  The Department of Defense recently established the U.S. Northern \nCommand, or NORCOM, to oversee and further develop land, aerospace, and \nsea-based military defenses of our homeland. It has also established a \nnew Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security. So it will be critical \nfor the Department of Homeland Security to have a good relationship \nwith the Department of Defense and very good coordination between the \ntwo Departments as each performs its mission in defense of our \nhomeland.\n  Secretary England's knowledge will help ensure that the two \nDepartments work as a team and not at cross-purposes. In short, I \nbelieve Secretary England is uniquely qualified for this important job. \nWe are extremely fortunate as a nation to have two such highly \nqualified individuals as Secretary Tom Ridge and Deputy Secretary \nGordon England at the helm of this critical new Department.\n  I urge my colleagues to join in supporting this important nomination.\n  Seeing no one seeking the floor, I suggest the absence of a quorum \nand ask unanimous consent that the time be assigned equally to each \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nnomination of Secretary Gordon England to the position of Deputy \nSecretary of the Department of Homeland Security. Secretary England has \nearned my appreciation and respect as Secretary of the Navy. We have \nmet in oversight hearings conducted by the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee on which I serve, and by the Airland Subcommittee I have been \nprivileged to chair.\n  Based on that experience, I have no doubt but that Secretary England \nwill make a highly honorable and effective Deputy Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity. His qualifications are not in question, nor is his \ndedication. Throughout his entire professional career, Secretary \nEngland has demonstrated a unique readiness, willingness, and ability \nto help make America safer.\n  However, as I have said repeatedly, it will not be enough for this \nDepartment to be led by public servants with good judgment, strong \nexperience, and in-depth expertise in homeland security. Of course, \nthat helps tremendously. But more important than the quality of the \nofficers is the quality of the orders, and in my view, since September \n11, the Bush administration has not proven itself bold enough, \naggressive enough, or visionary enough to make America significantly \nsafer.\n  Let me give you three quick examples.\n  First, intelligence. This administration's failure to confront, much \nless fix, the fundamental problems that plague our intelligence \ncommunity has been discouraging, disappointing, and I believe \npotentially dangerous.\n  I am, of course pleased that the President, in his State of the Union \naddress, announced his support for the creation of a Terrorism Threat \nInformation Center. For many months now, I and other members of the \nSenate have been proposing a similar analysis center as a way of \naddressing one of the most glaring weaknesses in our domestic defenses \nexposed by the September 11 terrorist attacks. This new center will be \nthe place where the dots are connected, to give our Government a better \nchance of uncovering terrorist threats and preventing attacks. I am \nglad that the Administration has finally agreed this is critical to our \nability to better protect the American people, though I must admit my \nfrustration that it has taken this long for the President to awaken to \nthe wisdom of this solution.\n  During the debate over the Department of Homeland Security, I \nproposed creation of an independent Intelligence Directorate, under the \nSecretary of Homeland Security, to be staffed by analysts on loan from \nthe FBI, CIA, and other intelligence agencies, and given maximum access \nto the information about all terrorist threats collected by those \nagencies. Its purpose would be clear, to connect the dots and overcome \nthe failures to share intelligence that surely contributed to the \nsuccessful terrorist attacks on our country.\n  Unfortunately, the President opposed that approach. Instead, the \nadministration insisted on focusing the Department's intelligence \ncenter on protecting critical infrastructure, rather than on performing \nanalysis primarily designed to preempt and disrupt attacks before they \noccur. In the end, a compromise was reached; creating a single \ndirectorate that would analyze all terrorist threats as well as assess \nvulnerabilities to the infrastructure. However, until the President's \nState of the Union Address, the administration has insisted on \nimplementing its original concept of infrastructure protection.\n  But there is still serious reason for concern. The President said \nTuesday night the new analysis center would answer to the Director of \nCentral Intelligence and would be composed of analytical units from the \nFBI and the CIA. But Congress's clear intent was that he should create \na strong Directorate to ``connect the dots'' within the Department of \nHomeland Security. Historic rivalries among the CIA, FBI, and other \nintelligence agencies are a major problem we must overcome. Placing \nthis fusion center in the new Department would ensure analysis from an \nindependent entity outside of the existing rivalries. The President's \napproach perpetuates a major part of the problem. Though I am glad he \nhas finally agreed that we need a single Terrorist Threat Information \nCenter, the President has been altogether too reluctant to challenge \nthe status quo in the intelligence community and the FBI.\n  Second, the role of the military. As Secretary England understands \nwell, our armed forces have tremendous resources. There are 1.3 million \npeople on active military duty, most of them in the United States, and \nabout 900,000 members of our Reserves and Guard. That's 2.2 million \ndefense personnel. We expect the Department of Homeland Security to \nemploy about 170,000 people.\n  Taxpayers will invest almost $393 billion this year, money well \nspent, in their Department of Defense. The new homeland defense \ndepartment will probably have a budget, and total resources, about one \ntenth that.\n  Now, of course, our military's principal activities will be and must \nbe outside our borders. As we are learning in the effort to disarm \nIraq, we need our forces to be strong. We need them to be flexible. We \nneed them to be ready at any time.\n  But I believe at the same time we can and must use some of our \ndefense assets more effectively here at home. Our Department of Defense \nhas trained, disciplined, cohesive units with more experience in \nresponding to crisis, more technology, and more expertise in dealing \nwith chemical, biological, nuclear, and radiological weapons, than \nanybody else in government. It has created a new northern command to \ndefend the United States. In this new kind of war taking place on a \nhomeland battlefield, we must use all those resources optimally.\n  I've put forward some ideas on how to do that, primarily by applying \nsome of the expertise and experience of our National Guard. I hope the \nadministration engages in this discussion and comes forward with some \nideas of its own. Secretary England's experience will make him an \ninvaluable contributor to this discussion.\n\n  Third, let me briefly discuss the role of the private sector.\n  ``United we stand, divided we fall'' is not a cliche. In the case of \nthe war against terrorism, it is a truism, and a warning for us all to \nheed. This war cannot be won by Government alone. We must be one Nation \nunder collaboration, one Nation under cooperation. I hope Secretary \nEngland, who has extensive experience as an engineer and executive in \nthe aerospace industry, is ready to think creatively about how best to \nengage private industry to better protect us from terrorism, because\n\n[[Page S1787]]\n\nin the past 16 months, the Bush administration has been far too passive \non this front.\n  We are paying a price for that passivity. According to a report \nissued by the Council on Competitiveness in December, the vast majority \nof U.S. corporate executives do not see their companies as potential \ntargets of terrorism. Only 53 percent of survey respondents indicated \nthat they had made any increased security investments between 2001 and \n2002.\n  And most of the security changes in the past year in the private \nsector have focused on ``guards, gates and guns'', in other words, on \nprotecting the physical security of buildings alone. Despite 80 percent \nof the respondents to the Council's survey indicating they had \nconducted vulnerability assessments related to their physical plants, \nbarely half have studied the vulnerabilities in their telephone and \nshipping networks, electric power supplies, and supplier companies, and \neven fewer companies had made any changes based on these assessments.\n  With 85 percent of our critical infrastructure owned by the private \nsector, this slow action ought to be a national concern, and correcting \nit ought to be a national priority.\n  Another area I believe we should instantly expect more productive \npublic-private partnerships is in vaccine development. I am pleased \nthat the President has now acknowledged the need to build new shields \nto protect ourselves from the deadly bioterror arrows that our enemies \nmay use against us. This is an urgent priority that our Government has \nlet languish for far too long.\n  Unfortunately, the administration's approach to developing medicines \nto protect us against a bioterror attack has been too narrow, too \nconventional, too slow, and too small to rise to this urgent challenge. \nRespectfully, the new initiative announced by the President, what we \nknow about it today, seems to be more of the same. So far, the \nadministration has addressed this problem by providing funding for \nbasic research by academics. But that is not the only thing we need to \ndo to swiftly develop breakthrough new medicines that we can stockpile \nand deploy.\n  To do this the right way, we also need to engage our ingenious \nprivate sector, the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, which \nhave so far shown no interest in this research. Today, even if the \nacademic scientists find a promising lead, there is no company ready to \nmove that antidote or medicine from concept to product, from laboratory \nto bedside.\n  Back in December of 2001 I introduced legislation, now cosponsored by \nSenator Hatch, S. 3148, to provide incentives to private companies to \ntake up and accelerate this vital research.\n  The BioShield program apparently adopts one of the ideas from our \nbill, to provide a guaranteed purchase fund for needed medicines. That \nis good news, and I am glad the President has seen the wisdom of this \napproach. I have said for more than a year that we can't expect these \nprivate companies to commit themselves to this R if they cannot \ndetermine the scope and terms of the market that might await them.\n  But based on the details the White House has released to date, \nBioShield does not incorporate any of the other incentives I have \nproposed, no tax incentives, no intellectual property protections, no \nliability protections, no incentives to develop research tools or \nconstruct manufacturing facilities. It is a bare and belated beginning \non what we have to do to engage the private sector in this research.\n  We are in grave danger. The Defense Science Board estimated in 2000 \nthat we have only 1 of the 57 diagnostics, vaccines and drugs we need \nto deal with the top 19 bioterror threats. In other words, if you do \nthe math, we were less than 2 percent prepared. No progress has been \nmade since then. The DSB said if we were to launch a major industrial \ndevelopment effort, we might be able to develop twenty of these \ncountermeasures in 5 years and thirty in 10 years. The President's \nannouncement of $600 million in funding over 10 years won't begin to \naddress this massive and threatening gap.\n  The administration's failure on this front is, in my view, part of a \ngeneral myopia. The President seems unwilling to enlist every sector \nand segment of society to do its part to help us win the war against \nterrorism. But Americans want to contribute. They want to know what \nthey can do for their country. This would have been the perfect place \nfor the President to pave the way to a new, productive partnership \nbetween Government and the private sector. But, regrettably, he has \nmissed the opportunity.\n  I have put forward a comprehensive proposal to ignite private \ndevelopment of the countermeasures we will need to protect ourselves \nfrom the dozens and dozens of bioterror agents that might be used \nagainst us. Those medicines, antidotes, and vaccines won't materialize \nby accident. Getting that done will take leadership from Washington.\n  Let me conclude by saying that I appreciate Secretary England's \ncommitment to serve. The country appreciates his public and private \nservice over the course of the last 40 years, and values his \nexperience, expertise, and management skill which will be focused on \nthis urgent new challenge.\n  I look forward to partnering with soon to be Deputy Secretary England \nand Secretary Ridge, but I also look forward to pushing and prodding \nthis administration, which has so far moved too slowly and cautiously \nin closing our dramatic homeland security vulnerabilities.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent--I know we have \nthe vote ordered for 2:50 p.m.--that the Senator from Virginia have 2 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, I have an airplane to \ncatch. Can the Senator withhold until after the vote?\n  Mr. WARNER. I will withhold until after the vote.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I so appreciate that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Gordon England, of Texas, to be Deputy \nSecretary of the Department of Homeland Security?\n  Ms. COLLINS.

Without objection, the motion to reconsider is \nlaid upon the table.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the President for \nthe selection of Gordon England for the post to which the Senate will \nconfirm him soon in the newly created Department of Homeland Security.\n  I have had the privilege of working with Mr. England for some time \nnow. Since he assumed the duties of Secretary of the Navy, we \nimmediately became friends--because we had known\n\n[[Page S1788]]\n\neach other while he was in the private sector, but, of course, I having \nhad the privilege of serving as Secretary of the Navy some many years \nbefore, we were sort of a band of brothers--those of us who are \nprivileged to serve in the greatest Navy in the world, and particularly \nin the post as a civilian boss. We have worked together these many \nyears.\n  I want the record to reflect the extraordinary qualifications of this \nnominee. The Navy will miss him. But duty calls so often. It did in \nthis instance because the President and Secretary Ridge wanted to draw \non someone who had a proven record of management capabilities. Gordon \nEngland exhibited that record while he was Secretary of the Navy. He \nwill exhibit it as the hands-on operator of the management decisions in \nassisting the distinguished Secretary, Mr. Ridge.\n  I am very pleased with this nomination.\n  I want to mention just a few things about the distinguished career of \nthis fine person.\n  He began his career with Honeywell Corporation working as an engineer \non the Gemini space program before joining General Dynamics in 1966 as \nan avionics design engineer in the Fort Worth aircraft division. He \nalso worked as a program manager with Litton Industries on the Navy's \nE-2C Hawkeye aircraft.\n  By coincidence, these are programs I worked on somewhat when I was \nSecretary, Under Secretary, and then, of course, while I have been here \nin the Senate serving now 25 years on the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee.\n  He served as executive vice president of General Dynamics Corporation \nfrom 1997 until 2001 and was responsible for two major sectors of the \ncorporation--first, information systems, and international.\n  Previously, he served as executive vice president of the Combat \nSystems Group, president of General Dynamics Fort Worth aircraft \ncompany. Before that, he served as president of General Dynamics land \nsystems company producing land combat vehicles.\n  He has had this management experience, particularly in high-tech \nareas. Much of the Homeland Defense Department function will be going \nto the private sector, encouraging that private sector to design state-\nof-the-art and beyond--I stress ``beyond''--technology to meet the many \nunknowns with which our Nation and other nations are confronted in this \nbattle against worldwide terrorism.\n  Mr. England is a native of Baltimore. He graduated from the \nUniversity of Maryland in 1961 with a bachelor's degree in electrical \nengineering. In 1975, he earned a master's degree in business \nadministration from the M.J. Neeley School of Business at Texas \nChristian University. He served as a member of the Defense Science \nBoard and was vice chairman of the National Research Council Committee \non the Future of the U.S. Aerospace Industry.\n  It is an extraordinary record.\n  If I may say with the greatest respect to our President and to the \nnew Secretary that his first Deputy, Gordon England, in the Department \nof Homeland Security, I think, can help avert what could come about as \na tug of war between the Department of Homeland Security and the \nDepartment of Defense as it regards budget matters. Both have the \nhighest priorities, properly accorded by our President, and indeed I \nthink the Congress. Homeland defense is just starting. As their cash \nflow and appropriations come in, I hope they will be adequate to meet \nthe needs of this new Department. If they are not, I hope we can find \nother means by which to finance those requirements. They should be \ngiven top priority financially and support-wise because they will guard \nus here at home--augmenting what is in place already by way of the \nNational Guard, the North Command and the other commands of the \nDepartment of Defense--many other things that are in place in bringing \ntogether the various and disparate agencies and departments and put \nthem under this one head.\n\n  I am going to be ever watchful--and I think my good friend, Gordon \nEngland, likewise--to advise the Secretary of Defense and to advise the \nSecretary of Homeland Security. We cannot ever witness a budget war \nbetween these two strong and powerful and vitally needed Departments. \nGordon England is eminently qualified to see that doesn't happen. \nHomeland defense starts beyond our shores in the forward-deployed \npositions of the men and women of the Armed Forces all over the world.\n  For example, on the battlefields of Afghanistan, we have made great \nprogress.\n  I had the privilege just this morning of meeting with General Franks \nto talk about the progress he has made and the challenges that remain \nin Afghanistan. But he has, in large measure, achieved a goal of \nstemming the flow of terrorism from that troubled piece of land to \nother places in the world and will continue to fight that battle.\n  That is the clearest example I can give right now of where we have to \nstop terrorism before it comes to our borders. Hopefully, it can be \ninterdicted there and certainly interdicted before it gets into \nhometowns in America.\n  Those two Departments must be adequately funded because they will \nwork together to protect this great Nation.\n  I wish my old friend good luck, fair winds, and flowing seas, as we \nsay in the Navy. He is eminently qualified to take on this position.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/30/senate-section/article/S1788-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1788]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, during his State of the Union speech, \nPresident Bush said that he has,\n\n       sent to us [Congress] his Clear Skies legislation that \n     mandates a 70 percent cut in air pollution from power plants \n     over the next 15 years.\n\n  What he did not say is that the present Clean Air Act, according to \nEPA, will do a better and faster job of reducing emissions than his \nproposal. It will do all that without eliminating vital air quality \nprotections as proposed in the President's Clear Skies bill.\n  What he did not say is that the proposal's timeline does not work \nwith the Clean Air Act's. It stalls and delays present State and \ngeneral efforts to achieve air quality standards and it also ignores \nglobal warming.\n  Worse yet, the President's proposal would contribute to the premature \ndeath of tens of thousands of people who we could otherwise save by \nfull and faithful implementation of the present Clean Air Act. Under \nhis plan, there will be more areas struggling longer to achieve \nattainment of air quality standards.\n  In 2001, large power plants were responsible for emissions of 10.6 \nmillion tons of sulfur dioxide, SOX and 4.1 million tons of \nnitrogen oxides, NOX. That is 33 percent and 25 percent \nless, respectively, from 1990 levels. But that is still far too much \npollution going into our air, our lungs and falling onto our land.\n  These acid rain and smog causing pollutants contribute heavily to \npremature mortality, asthma and lung disease. They also continue the \nacidification of ecosystems in New England and elsewhere.\n  In 2001, EPA advised industry that the Clean Air Act at full \nimplementation would likely require an 80 percent reduction in \nSOX and a 70 percent reduction in NOX from \ntoday's pollution levels. EPA also said that mercury, a potent \nneurotoxic pollutant, would have to be reduced by 90 percent.\n  EPA said these reductions would have to occur in 2008 for mercury, \n2010 for NOX, and 2012 for SOX. The President's \nproposal hits none of these marks, and still takes 6 more years to even \nget close to the necessary reductions.\n  The proposal falls significantly short of Clean Air Act requirements. \nSenators can see a comparison outlined in this chart.\n  The President's proposal also falls short by approximately 1.4 \nbillion tons\n\n[[Page S1789]]\n\nof carbon dioxide. That's the amount that should be reduced by the \nelectric utility sector under our treaty commitment to try to reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels. Clearly, we have failed.\n  Perhaps these shortfalls are why no Senators cosponsored the \nPresident's Clear Skies proposal when it was finally introduced last \nyear. Perhaps the elimination of important State and local air \nprotection authorities kept senators from supporting it.\n  Whatever the reason, the President's proposal had little or no public \nsupport. Yet, since January 20, 2001, the administration has had every \nopportunity to constructively engage with us and promote his Clear \nSkies proposal.\n  But, they did little or nothing. They certainly did not respond in a \ntimely, helpful way to legitimate inquiries on its effects.\n  Instead, they spent their time figuring out ways to deregulate and to \nrollback air quality protections under the cloak and shadow of their \nthree-pollutant initiative.\n  Perhaps now, as the 2004 elections get nearer and the administration \nas yet has no tangible and positive environmental achievements of its \nown, we can work together, I urge us to work together to make progress.\n  But, unless the Administration agrees to cooperate on information \nsharing and problem solving, we are going to get nowhere even faster. \nWe cannot afford to change and we should not change the Clean Air Act \nwithout knowing the likely outcome of our actions.\n  Let's assume for a moment that we all want the same things. We want \nto stop acid rain. We want to reduce mercury-related fish contamination \nand birth defects. We want to start dealing with manmade global \nwarming. Most importantly, we want cleaner, clearer air as soon as we \ncan get it.\n  We can achieve all those goals in a four-pollutant bill. We can do \neven better than the Clean Air Act at full implementation if we have \nthe will and the courage. But doing less than the Clean Air Act would \nprovide is simply backsliding.\n  I will soon be introducing an alternative to the President's proposal \nwith Senators Collins, Lieberman and others. This legislation is a \nbetter and much more accurate response to the environmental and public \nhealth problems that our Nation faces.\n  In the coming days and weeks, I will take to the floor to discuss the \nneed for strong legislation.\n  I will continue my efforts to obtain information that the \nadministration continues to withhold. This regards the legal, public \nhealth and environmental effects of their deregulation efforts as well \nas their three-pollutant approach.\n  A detailed chronology of correspondence on our New Source Review \nrequests appears in the Record of January 21st.\n  On Tuesday evening, the EPA Administrator called to tell me the \nPresident would speak on the Clear Skies proposal in the State of the \nUnion. She said she hopes we can work together. I don't doubt Governor \nWhitman's sincerity. But, so far, ``working together'' on environmental \npolicy has been an alien concept for this White House. Instead, they \nhave left Congress, the States, the environmentalists, and the people, \nin a public relations haze.\n  Progress will be much easier and swifter if we can really work \ntogether honestly and without all the smoke and mirrors. That is the \nonly way to approach these severe public health and environmental \nproblems. That is why a four-pollutant bill is necessary.\n  I point to the chart and urge people to look at this chart which \ndemonstrates very clearly what would happen if we leave things the way \nwe are or if we put the ``Clear Skies'' in. We are much better off to \nleave the Clean Air Act where it is than we are to do anything. But we \nwill be producing and bringing forward at a future time our four-\npollutant bill, again, which will do even more than the present Clean \nAir Act and does not degrade or lessen the Clean Air Act.\n  I urge everyone to be very alert about what is going on in the \nenvironmental legislation because it could get better and save lives or \nit could knock it out.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/30/senate-section/article/S1789-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1789]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              DAVID HOPPE\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to join many of \nmy colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to thank Dave Hoppe for his \nservice to the Senate and to wish him well as he continues to pursue \nnew opportunities.\n  One of the reasons we will miss Dave is because he exemplifies the \nbest of the Senate--a place where we can find compromise, a place where \nwe can disagree passionately, but one where we can do so honestly, and \namicably.\n  From personal experience, I can tell you that Dave is a gifted \nnegotiator, and, when necessary, a tough adversary.\n  But I can also tell you that much of what I admire about him--much of \nwhat we all admire about him--transcends his political skill, and his \nlegislative prowess. It is his decency.\n  In 1997, Dave drew on his personal experience, and became integral in \nbringing the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act into being. In \ntalking about the issue of disability in our society, Bob Dole once \nsaid, ``some issues transcend politics, foster a bipartisan spirit, and \nresult in legislation that makes a real and lasting difference.''\n  Because of Dave, disability education is one of those issues.\n  And, as Dave leaves, I think we could modify Bob Dole's words. There \nare some people who transcend politics, foster a bipartisan spirit, and \nmake a real and lasting difference. Dave is one of those people.\n  So, Dave, I want to thank you, congratulate you, and wish you and \nKaren--and Katie and Geoffrey and Gregory--all the best in the years \nahead.\n  Mr. ALLARD.

SNOW\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, pursuant to that unanimous consent \nrequest, I would like to take the floor for a few moments and then \nyield to my friend Senator Harkin.\n  This evening, we are considering the nomination of John Snow to be \nthe Secretary of the Treasury. It is a very important position, one of \nthe most important in the President's Cabinet. I have had the \nopportunity on two occasions now to sit down with Mr. Snow and discuss \nwith him a number of issues, but in particular one that I would address \nthis evening. After these conversations, I am happy to report I will be \nsupporting his nomination as Secretary of the Treasury. He will have an \nawesome responsibility in this post. I hope he can rise to that \nchallenge. His resume shows that he can and that he will serve our \nNation with pride.\n\n  The particular issue which drew us together last night and again this \nevening is one that Senator Harkin has been the leader on for many \nyears. Literally millions of Americans have pension plans which they \nhave worked long and hard to maintain in their place of employment. The \ntraditional defined-benefit plan is one where someone works for a \ncompany for a certain number of years and the company promised that at \nretirement they would pay them a certain amount of money. That is the \nretirement plan with which most people are familiar. That is the basic \nand traditional approach. But over the years retirement plans have \nchanged. They have become more like 401(k)s or savings plans or \ninvestment plans, and those are known\n\n[[Page S1790]]\n\nas cash-benefit plans. Some companies have decided to go with defined-\nbenefit plans and some with cash-benefit plans. But many employees have \nbeen caught in the middle. Some started working for a company thinking \nthey had a defined-benefit plan. Then the company at a later date says \nfor a variety of reasons we are going to move to this other cash-\nbalance plan. For some employees, it is a good choice. If you are a \nyoung worker in a company, and they come in and say, Listen, you don't \nknow if you are going to be at this place the rest of your life; you \nmay pick up and move to another job; would you rather have something \nlike a cash-balance plan where you know how much money is there? It is \ninvested. You can build it up over the years and move it with you from \njob to job. A lot of younger workers said, That is exactly what I want.\n  But the worker who has been on that job for longer periods of time \nhas built up benefits under the defined-benefit plan may say, Wait a \nminute. Don't change the rules at this point. I am nearing retirement. \nI know what I was supposed to receive. I don't want to change the \nbenefit plan at all.\n  Therein lies the dilemma. Some corporations have said to employees, \nYou make the decision. Decide what is best for you. Stick with the old \ndefined-benefit plan or move to the cash-balance plan. But it is your \nchoice.\n  Frankly, from my point of view and Senator Harkin's point of view, \nthat is fair. Let the employee decide his fate. Let the employee decide \nwhat is best for him, for his family, and for his future. That is what \nwe would like to see.\n  Frankly, that really was the law and the rule for so long, thanks to \nthe hard work of Senator Harkin of Iowa protecting the rights of \nemployees.\n  A month ago, there was a shocking rule issued by the Treasury \nDepartment which basically said the corporations could wipe out \ndefined-benefit plans and say to that employee of many years, Guess \nwhat. We have changed the rules. You are now in a cash plan.\n  I was at a press conference and met with some former IBM employees \nwho went through that experience. It is really heartbreaking to hear \nwhat it meant to their families, and where they expected to end up \ngenerating some $4,000 a month in retirement income is now going to \ngenerate about $2,000. It means, frankly, the survivor benefits are \nsacrificed and a quality of life has been lost.\n  Senator Harkin, myself, Congressman George Miller of California, and \nCongressman Bernie Sanders of Vermont have really tried to dramatize \nthis issue and this new proposed rule, and to say to the Treasury \nDepartment, For goodness sakes, treat these workers fairly. Don't force \nthem into a plan that is going disadvantage them or their families.\n\n  We gathered together some signatures--I don't take any credit for it; \nthe work was done primarily by the two House leaders I just mentioned--\nover 226 signatures of Members of Congress in both the House and the \nSenate, saying to the President and the Treasury Department, Don't \nchange the rules in midstream. Protect these employees.\n  Along comes the President's nominee for the Treasury Department, John \nSnow. Of course, he will be the man to make the ultimate decision on \nthe rule and whether it will be fair to employees. Senator Harkin and I \nsat down with him this evening and had a lengthy and very positive \nconversation.\n  John Snow comes to us from a career in private business where he has \nbeen a CEO of the CSX Railroad. He explained to us when his railroad \ndecided to change pension plans, they left it up to the employees to \ndecide. He thought that was a fair thing to do with his railroad. We \nthink it is a fair thing to do for every company. He talked about other \nbusinesses he worked with where the same thing occurred.\n  He said to us he was going to be fair and objective, and he was going \nto take the rights of the worker into account for any rule related to \nfuture pension plans.\n  We talked about the fact that when it comes to Members of Congress, \nthat is exactly the standard we followed when it came to our \nretirement. I guess it was 10, 12 years ago we decided to change the \nretirement plan. We went to individual Members of Congress and said, \nWhat do you choose? What is best for you and your family? That was our \nway. Should it not be the right of every American worker?\n  In a meeting with Senator Harkin and myself, we decided to let this \nnominee go forward to give Mr. Snow an opportunity to become the \nTreasury Department Secretary and to use his values and corporate \nexperience which he brings to the job not only to serve the Nation but \nto treat American workers and retirees fairly.\n  I want to especially thank Senator Harkin. This is not the kind of \nissue likely to be on the front page of any newspaper, but it is the \nkind of issue that is likely to be front and center on the dining room \ntable of American families who are genuinely concerned about their \nfuture. He fought a long and lonely battle on this issue. I was happy \nto support him. But he deserves credit for his leadership. The meeting \nwith the new Treasury Secretary today points us in the right direction. \nWe want to work with this Treasury Department and with this Secretary \nto be fair to workers across America.\n  I will support the nomination of John Snow for Treasury Secretary \nbecause I believe he brings the right values and the right corporate \nexperience to this job. I am sure I am going to disagree with him on \nmany issues. But on this particular issue, the assurances which he gave \nus this evening are the basis for us to go forward and approve his \nnomination.\n  At this point, I would like to yield to my leader on this issue, my \ncolleague from Iowa, Senator Harkin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nacross the Mississippi River in Illinois, Senator Durbin, for the very \nkind and overly generous words. More than that, I thank him for his \ndiligence and for his hard work on this issue which means so much to \nthe average working person in America.\n  I will just say at the outset that Senator Durbin has, I believe, \ncorrectly laid out the meeting we had with Mr. Snow earlier this \nevening, and has also correctly portrayed the assurances we got from \nMr. Snow regarding this issue and how he would approach it as the new \nSecretary of the Treasury.\n  Again, I want to make it clear that the actions of this Senator \nearlier today and yesterday in wanting to have a bit of time here to \ntalk about this before we voted on this nomination had nothing to do \nwith Mr. Snow. I said that earlier this evening. This is nothing \npersonal at all. He has a very distinguished career in the business \ncommunity. He was head of the CSX Railroad, I guess for well over 20-\nsome years, if I am not mistaken, and has served well on boards of \nschools, universities, John Hopkins, and others. In other words, he has \nbeen both a business leader and a community leader.\n  Again, I want to compliment him and commend him for his distinguished \ncareer and for his service both to his company and to our country.\n  I congratulate Mr. Snow on his nomination for Secretary of the \nTreasury and will join with my colleagues in supporting that \nnomination.\n  I feel, as Senator Durbin said, that he gave us assurances on this \nissue--and I will talk more about this issue in a minute--dealing with \npensions and workers' rights; that he will assure the fairness and \nequity as the rule. In fact, I wrote down exactly what Mr. Snow said. \nHe said:\n\n       I believe we should protect the basic rights of workers. \n     And, if a rule doesn't meet that test, it won't move forward. \n     Fundamental fairness will be at the center of any policy.\n\n  I compliment Mr. Snow for that. As Senator Durbin pointed out, as the \nCEO of the CSX Railroad, when they changed their plan over from a \ndefined-benefit plan to a cash-balance plan, they left in place for \nolder workers the defined-benefit plan. In other words, they could stay \nwith that plan. Newer, younger workers could go with cash balance \nplans. To me, that really makes sense. That is really the way we ought \nto be going in this country when we talk about our pensions and \nprotecting our pensions.\n\n  So my actions here yesterday and today have not been about Mr. Snow. \nThey have been about this issue. It is an issue of fundamental fairness \nfor people who work hard, play by the rules, and then find out--after \nworking\n\n[[Page S1791]]\n\n20 or 30 years--that what they thought they were going to get has been \ntaken away. So that is what this is about.\n  Over the last several days, I have been reading a book that was given \nto me last year. I had not gotten to it. I have now been reading it. I \nam almost finished with it. I recommend it highly. It is a book by \nKevin Phillips called ``Wealth and Democracy.''\n  I remember in one part of the book he pointed out that over the last \n30 years--I think from 1970 to about the year 2000--the difference in \nthe compensation for our CEOs and the people who work on the shop \nfloor, so to speak, has been that in 1972, the average CEO salary was \nabout 42 times that of the average worker in that corporation. That was \n1970--42 times; by the year 2000, that gap had widened to 417 times. In \nother words, today, the average CEO is getting 417 times the \ncompensation of the average worker in that corporation. So that gap has \nwidened tremendously.\n  Also what has happened is that we see, time and time and time again, \nthat when CEOs of these large corporations hit a rough spot--the \ncompany maybe has a rough spot, the CEOs leave the corporation--they \nget wonderful golden parachutes. They get wonderful retirement \nprograms. We have to have that same kind of fairness for the average \nworkers.\n  In 2001, we passed numerous pension provisions that had wide support. \nMany provisions favored those making more than $200,000 a year. I am \nnot saying those provisions are bad, but we need some balance.\n  In the early 1990s, U.S. companies began a process of switching from \ndefined benefit pension plans to cash balance plans. I am not going to \nget into the esoteric descriptions of defined benefits plans and cash \nbalance plans, but only to say that many workers who affected by these \nchanges had no idea what was happening to their pensions.\n  You might ask: Why has this all of a sudden come to the forefront in \nthe year 2003? Well, it did not. I first drafted legislation in 1999, \nbecause by that time workers whose pensions had been changed in the \nearly and mid-1990s, and who were now really facing retirement, all of \na sudden woke up and found out that they did not have what they thought \nthey would, and they had no recourse.\n  So, in 1999, I introduced a bill to make it illegal for corporations \nwear away the benefits of older workers during cash balance \nconversions. We had a vote on that bill in the Senate. I offered it as \nan amendment to the reconciliation bill, and a point of order was \nraised, so we had to vote to waive the point of order. 48 Senators, \nincluding 3 Republicans, voted to waive the budget point of order so we \ncould consider this amendment. Obviously, we did not have enough votes.\n  After that, more and more stories came out about how many workers \nwere losing their pensions. In April of 2000, I offered a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution to stop this practice, and it passed the Senate \nunanimously. The Secretary of the Treasury put a moratorium on \nconversions from defined benefit plans to a cash balance plans. That \nmoratorium has been in effect now for over three years.\n\n  Last month, a rule was proposed by the Treasury Department--a rule \nthat would turn the clock back, undo the moratorium, and allow \ncompanies to once again engage in the practice of switching from \ndefined benefit plans to cash balance plans and wear away the benefits \nof older workers.\n  So that is why I wanted to utilize this time and this nomination of \nMr. Snow to be Secretary of the Treasury, to raise this issue once \nagain and to talk with Mr. Snow about it as the incoming Secretary of \nthe Treasury. We cannot permit this rule to just go forward. I think it \nwas clear here in the Senate, in 2000, that we did not want that \npractice to continue. So I wanted to take this time to bring this issue \nto the forefront.\n  What are we talking about when we talk about how much people are \nlosing in this? This morning, we had a press conference. We had a man \nthere by the name of Larry Cutrone. He was one of thousands robbed of \nthe full value of their earned pensions. He said that before AT \nconverted his pension, it was valued at $350,000. After the conversion, \nin July 1997, the value dropped to $138,000. The calculation period for \nhis pension was frozen at 1994-1996 salaries, so no value to his \nretirement account was added for any years he worked after the \nconversion.\n  So he said:\n\n       In September 2001, I was ``downsized'' out of AT and \n     decided to take my pension. I discovered that it translated \n     into an annual income of just $23,444 instead of the $47,303 \n     income under the old plan.\n       When these plans were changed over, workers were not \n     informed that this could happen. They woke up one day and \n     found out: they have less than 50 percent of what they \n     thought they were going to get in their retirement.\n\n  Is that fair? Is that equitable?\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this statement of Larry \nCutrone that he gave this morning be printed in its entirety in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record,  as follows:\n\n                       Statement of Larry Cutrone\n\n       My name is Larry Cutrone, one of thousands robbed of the \n     full value of their earned pensions due to the ``Cash \n     Balance'' pension conversion. Before AT converted my \n     pension it was valued at $350,000 and after the conversion in \n     July 1997, the value dropped to $138,000. Even with AT's \n     ``Special Update'' enhancement to my account, the value only \n     rose to $150,000. The calculation period for my pension was \n     frozen at 1994-1996 salaries, so no value to my retirement \n     account was added for any years I worked after the \n     conversion.\n       In September 2001, I was ``downsized'' out of AT and \n     decided to take my pension. I discovered that it translated \n     into an annual income of just $23,444 instead of the $47,303 \n     income under the old plan. This seems meager after 31 loyal \n     years of service to the company. As a result, my wife was \n     forced to waive her rights to the survivor benefits of my \n     pension in the event I predecease her. Invoking these rights \n     would have meant between 8% and 20% less per month. While my \n     pension was reduced by more than half, my monthly \n     contribution for medical benefits was increased five times \n     this year.\n       As representatives of ``AT Concerned Employees Council on \n     Retirement Protection'' (ACE CORP), we are willing to \n     publicize our personal situation in order to bring to the \n     forefront the negative impact of the forced cash balance \n     pension on the older worker. We urge President Bush to \n     support Congressman Sanders, Miller, Senator Harkin, and \n     their fellow representatives to revise his proposal to the \n     IRS by including protection for the older worker and \n     preventing them from becoming ``Pension Challenged'' by \n     ``Cash Imbalance''!\n       In President Bush's radio address this past Sunday he \n     states ``In 2003, we must work to strengthen our economy; \n     improve access to affordable, high quality health care for \n     all our seniors . . .'' In his State of the Union Address, he \n     urged Congress to pass his plan ``. . . to strengthen our \n     economy and help more Americans find jobs.'' (Assuming he \n     makes these comments in his State of the Union Address on \n     Tuesday.) We hope our efforts will convince President Bush \n     that his IRS Proposal and the affect of the cash balance \n     pension on the older worker further reduces consumer \n     spending, and reduces tax revenue while causing our economy \n     to continue suffering. We are aware of any negative impact to \n     the corporations who convert to cash balance pension plans. \n     Should the loyal worker and subsequently America's economy be \n     penalized?\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, 189 Members of the House of \nRepresentatives and 25 Senators signed a letter that was sent today to \nPresident Bush, asking that we do not reopen the floodgates, that we \nwithdraw this rule and promulgate a rule that is fair and equitable. As \nwe said in our letter:\n\n       We are writing to strongly urge you to withdraw proposed \n     Treasury Department regulations regarding cash balance \n     pension plans and to issue new regulations that will prohibit \n     profitable companies from reducing the pension benefits of \n     existing employees or retirees by converting to age-\n     discriminatory cash balance plans.\n       The recently proposed regulations would create an incentive \n     for thousands of companies to convert to cash balance plans \n     by providing legal protection against claims of age bias by \n     older employees.\n\n  Often when companies switch from defined benefit plans to cash \nbalance plans, a worker can work for 20 or 25 years, but the employer \nmay not pay anything into your pension plan for several years. But they \nwill contribute to a younger worker who has only been there for 2 \nyears.\n  So let's understand this. You have two workers work for the same \ncompany, doing the same job. One gets extra wages in the form of a \nbenefit of money put into a cash balance account. The other worker, who \nhas been there 20 or 25 years, does not get it. That is age \ndiscrimination, pure and simple, in violation of Federal law. The only \nreason the one person is not getting it is because they have been there \nlonger.\n\n[[Page S1792]]\n\n  The younger worker gets the money; the older worker does not. That is \nage discrimination, pure and simple.\n  As we said in our letter:\n\n       [The proposed] regulations [from Treasury] would result in \n     millions of older employees losing a significant portion of \n     the annual pension they had been promised by their employer \n     and had come to rely upon as part of their retirement \n     planning.\n\n  That is what happened to Larry Cutrone.\n  We write:\n\n       We urge you to direct the Treasury Department to \n     immediately withdraw these proposed regulations and instead \n     issue regulations that provide for the protection of older \n     employees pensions.\n       At a time when millions of employees are still reeling from \n     significant losses to their 401(k) retirement plans because \n     of corporate scandals and the ongoing weakness in the stock \n     market, we believe these regulations represent another \n     serious blow to the retirement security of hard working \n     Americans who have played by the rules in their companies \n     only to see the rules of the game . . . change midway through \n     their careers.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent this letter, signed by 189 Members of the \nHouse and 25 Senators, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 30, 2003.\n     The Hon. George W. Bush,\n     President of the United States,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear President Bush: We are writing to strongly urge you to \n     withdraw proposed Treasury Department regulations regarding \n     cash balance pension plans and to issue new regulations that \n     will prohibit profitable companies from reducing the pension \n     benefits of existing employees or retirees by converting to \n     age-discriminatory cash balance plans. (Federal Register, \n     December 11, 2002, Internal Revenue Service, 26 CFR Part 1, \n     REG-209500-86, REG-164464-02, RIN 1545-BA10, 1545-BB79.)\n       According to the General Accounting Office, annual pension \n     benefits of older employees can drop by as much as 50 percent \n     after a company converts from a traditional defined benefit \n     plan to a cash balance plan. Large companies favor the \n     conversion because they can save hundreds of millions of \n     dollars a year in pension costs. Delta Airlines, for example, \n     recently announced it would save $500 million per year by \n     switching to a cash balance plan. In the late 1990s, IBM \n     initially estimated it would save $200 million per year by \n     switching to a cash balance plan. IBM, AT, and Verizon are \n     among the 300 to 700 large companies that have already \n     converted to a cash balance pension plan. An additional 300 \n     companies had been waiting for IRS approval of their \n     conversion plans even before the regulatory change was \n     announced. Thousands of companies employing millions of \n     people would be eligible to convert their pension plans under \n     the proposed regulations.\n       Switching to a cash balance plan in mid-stream has the \n     greatest negative effect on older employees who have worked \n     for many years with one company and plan to continue to work \n     for additional years for the same employer.\n       As you know, in September 1999, the IRS issued a moratorium \n     on issuing letters of approval to companies for pension plan \n     conversions because of age discrimination concerns. There are \n     over 800 age discrimination complaints currently pending \n     before the EEOC based on cash balance conversions. The 1999 \n     moratorium has nearly stopped the flow of companies \n     converting to cash balance plans.\n       The recently proposed regulations would create an incentive \n     for thousands of companies to convert to cash balance plans \n     by providing legal protection against claims of age bias by \n     older employees. The regulations would result in millions of \n     older employees losing a significant portion of the annual \n     pension they had been promised by their employer and had come \n     to rely upon as part of their retirement planning.\n       We urge you to direct the Treasury Department to \n     immediately withdraw these proposed regulations and instead \n     issue regulations that provide for the protection of older \n     employees' pensions.\n       At a time when millions of employees are still reeling from \n     significant losses to their 401(k) retirement plans because \n     of corporate scandals and the ongoing weakness in the stock \n     market, we believe these regulations represent another \n     serious blow to the retirement security of hard working \n     Americans who have played by the rules in their companies \n     only to see the rules of the game for rank and file employees \n     change midway through their careers.\n       Re-opening the floodgates for cash balance conversions will \n     destroy what is left of our private pension retirement \n     system. This is a devastating step that your Administration \n     need not and should not allow.\n       We deeply appreciate your attention to the concerns that we \n     are expressing on behalf of the millions of employees who \n     will depend on their pensions for a secure retirement. We \n     look forward to working with you to protect the pension \n     security of America's workers.\n           Sincerely,\n          Bernard Sanders, George Miller, Tom Harkin, Barbara \n           Boxer, Tom Daschle, Nancy Pelosi, Edward Kennedy, Paul \n           Sarbanes, Carl Levin, Christopher Dodd, Charles \n           Schumer, Dianne Feinstein, Jon Corzine, James Jeffords, \n           Mark Dayton, Patrick Leahy, Barbara Mikulski, Russell \n           Feingold, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Maurice Hinchey, John \n           McHugh, John Dingell, David Obey, Barney Frank, Tom \n           Lantos, Paul Kanjorski, Lloyd Doggett, Robert Andrews, \n           Jane Harman, David Price, Gene Green, Lucille Roybal-\n           Allard, Rodney Alexander, James Clyburn, David Scott, \n           Ike Skelton, Ed Pastor, Adam Smith, Gil Gutknecht, Ron \n           Kind, James T.

We have right now over 1,000 cases pending before the \nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission, over 1,000 cases regarding age \ndiscrimination. These are cases of people who have had their retirement \npensions, what they were promised, reduced like Larry Cutrone; 1,000 \ncases filed under age discrimination. I believe these cases have merit. \nThey are going to go forward. They are going to go into Federal courts.\n  I want to make it very clear: I am not opposed to cash balance plans. \nSome cash balance plans can be very good. What I am opposed to is the \nunilateral decision of a company being able to change their plans and \nstop contributing to an employee's pension without their knowledge. \nThat is what I am opposed to.\n  That is what this issue is all about. It is fairness. It is equity. I \nknow sometimes when you get into pension laws, things like that, it \nsounds very convoluted. In essence, what some of these companies have \nbeen doing to these workers is nothing less than sheer thievery. They \nare able to save millions, in some cases hundreds of millions of \ndollars, by converting these\n\n[[Page S1793]]\n\nplans over, robbing--yes, I use the word ``robbing''--their workers who \nhave been loyal and hard working, robbing them of their rightful claims \non future benefits, taking that money and giving it in higher benefits \nto the CEOs and the corporate executives, golden parachutes. It is not \nright. It is not fair.\n  There is one thing that has distinguished the American workplace from \nothers around the world. We have valued loyalty. If you are hard \nworking and loyal, companies value that. At least they used to. That is \none of the reasons we had pension plans--the longer you worked there, \nthe more benefit you had in your pension program. Obviously, the longer \nyou work someplace, the better you do your job, the more you learn \nabout it, the more productive you are. We valued that loyalty.\n  If companies are able to just change these plans, what kind of a \nsignal does that send to the workers? It sends this signal: Don't be \nloyal. You are a fool if you are loyal because if you work here for 20 \nor 25 years, we can just change the rules of the game, and break our \npromise.\n  What it says to younger workers is: It would be crazy to work for \nthis company for a long time. I will work here a couple years; I will \nmove on.\n  It destroys the kind of work ethic we have come to value and that we \nknow built this country. I also thought we valued fairness when it \ncomes to workers. A deal is a deal. Let's say I wanted to hire you. I \nsaid: I will hire you for 5 years, pay you $50,000 a year. But if you \nstay with me for 5 years, I will give you a $50,000 bonus.\n  You say, OK, that is good. So now you work for me 3 years and you are \nthinking you have 2 more years to go and you will get that $50,000 \nbonus. But at the end of the third year I come to you and say: Do you \nremember the deal we made where I said if you work for me for 5 years \nyou will get that $50,000 bonus? Well, the deal is off.\n  Well, now you have 3 years invested there. If you had known that the \ndeal was going to be off, maybe you would not have gone to work for me. \nMaybe you would have gone to work someplace else. Is that the way we \nwant to treat workers in this country, where I have all the cards and \nyou have none, and I can make whatever deal I want, but I can change \nthe rules any time I want to and take away your pension? That is what \nthis is about.\n  Well, as Senator Durbin said, I thought we had a good meeting with \nMr. Snow. I am encouraged by the fact that, as a CEO of his \ncorporation, when they changed their plans over, they left a choice for \nworkers. That is the right and honorable way to do things. I compliment \nMr. Snow for having done that. I am also assured that the rules of the \ngame won't be changed in the middle. In other words, there is a \nmoratorium on right now, and I am assured that the moratorium will stay \non at least until a final rule is promulgated.\n  Mr. Snow has said he would agree to meet with people--employers, \nrepresentatives of labor groups, representatives of elderly groups--to \nget their input on this approach and, hopefully, on perhaps having a \nnew rule.\n  I want to make it clear this Senator will continue to press for the \nTreasury Department--when Mr. Snow gets confirmed and sworn in--to \nwithdraw that rule. He has the power to do it as Secretary of the \nTreasury--withdraw the proposed rule and come out with a new one that \nmore closely reflects what he had done as a CEO of a corporation \nearlier on when they changed their plans over. That is the fair way to \ndo it. This is an issue that is not going to go away. Again, I think \nmore and more working Americans are beginning to find out their hard \nwork and loyalty is being taken away and they have no voice. Well, that \nis what we are here for, to help protect these people, and to make sure \ntheir voice is heard and to make sure the pensions they have built up \nover a long period of time over their working years is not unilaterally \ntaken away by the companies for whom they worked.\n  Again, I have no intention of holding up Mr. Snow's nomination at \nall. As I said, my only intention in doing this was to raise this issue \nup, to make sure Mr. Snow understood the depth of our feelings about \nit, the history in the Senate that we had passed a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution unanimously in 2000, and that there are a lot of strong \nfeelings nationally--just witness the 1,000 cases now pending before \nthe EEOC, plus the fact that there are now about 300 filings right now \nbefore the IRS, Internal Revenue Service, by companies wanting to \nengage in this practice--change from defined benefit plans, to cash \nbalance plans, without protecting the rights of the workers. I have \nestimated, roughly, that this represents several hundred thousand \nworkers in this country who would be affected by this.\n  We need to send a clear and strong signal that we are not going to \nallow this to happen. If companies want to change plans, fine; but give \nthe workers the choice to stick with the plan they have had or to take \nthe new one. That is all we are asking for.\n  Mr. President, again, I congratulate Mr. Snow on his selection to be \nSecretary of the Treasury. I look forward to working with him. I thank \nhim for his distinguished career, and I hope he is able to bring to the \nposition that he will assume shortly the philosophy he had when he was \nthe CEO of CSX Rail, and the kind of implementation of the change in \ntheir pension plans will be the kind of philosophy that we will have \nnow at the Department of the Treasury.\n  Every worker in this country ought to have the right to choose just \nlike the workers at CSX had under Mr. Snow. Again, I look forward to \nworking with Mr. Snow on this issue. I hope we can get a fair \nresolution of this in the days and weeks to come.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, for a few moments before closing tonight--\nand we have had a very productive day and we will make the more formal \nannouncements in about 15 minutes or so--I take a few moments \naddressing an issue that means a lot to me, personally, and to take a \nmoment to reflect upon an announcement that the President made at the \nState of the Union two nights ago.\n  It has to do with a little virus, called HIV/AIDS virus, and the \ndevastation it has wrought on individuals, most importantly, but also \ncommunities and villages and counties and States and countries and \ncontinents and, indeed, the whole world.\n  Once a year I have a wonderful opportunity to travel to Africa as \npart of a medical mission team. I travel not as a Senator, but I have \nthe opportunity to travel as a physician. Last January, on one of these \nmedical mission trips, I treated patients in villages and in clinics \nand a number of countries in Africa, including the Sudan, Uganda, \nTanzania, and Kenya. Many of the patients I dealt with were infected \nwith HIV/AIDS virus. This little tiny virus, a microorganism, causes \nthis disease we all know as AIDS.\n  I think back to a number of patients. In Arusha, in the slums, \nconditions are crowded, but as you walk through these very crowded \nslums, the people there are very proud. While there, I visited with a \nyoung woman by the name of Tabu. She lived in a small--by small I mean \none room, probably 8 feet by 8 feet--stick-framed mud hut. I remember \nwalking in there, as my eyes adjusted, and seeing a very beautiful \nwoman, 28 years old, sitting on the edge of the bed--a human smile. And \non the walls behind her, to keep moisture out, were newspapers \nplastered on the walls. Again, things neat and clean, but a very small \nhut which was her home--a woman with a broad smile who was obviously \nsick, and very sick, meaning she would die in the next week to 2 weeks.\n\n  She lived in this, her home, with her 11-year-old daughter, Adija, \nwhom I also met, although her other children\n\n[[Page S1794]]\n\ndid not live with them in that hut because Tabu was so ill and so sick \nthat she simply couldn't physically manage having the other children \nthere. As she explained her story to me--again, I was the physician \nfrom America who came to be with her--her story was one she was a \nlittle bit embarrassed about because she literally had to send her \nchildren away because of her disability--her physical disability, due \nto this little tiny virus--to send them away to live with her mother \nwho could take care of her children.\n  I mentioned her smile. As my eyes adjusted, I saw that she was indeed \nwasted, thin and sick, but her eyes and her smile were full of hope. \nThat smile in many ways hid the pain of that illness, the pain of \nhaving to send her children away. The next day, she left her hut and \nshe was going to go live with her mother for the last few days of her \nlife, to die in her childhood home.\n  Tabu told me she was one of four sisters, all of whom had HIV/AIDS. \nAll had been infected with the virus. Musuli, a sister 20 years old, \nwho lived with her mom; Zbidanya, 15 years of age; and an older sister, \nOmeut, who had already died.\n  Tabu died the next week. But she didn't have to. If we do our job and \nif we follow the bold leadership as spelled out by the President of the \nUnited States, we can cure this disease, a disease that is destroying \nnations--indeed, destroying a continent, and mercilessly and \nrelentlessly spreading throughout the world--Russia and China and the \nCaribbean.\n  That face of Tabu, there in Arusha, in that home, is indeed the face \nof AIDS in Africa and in nations around the world.\n  The little tiny virus is not all that different from the viruses I am \nquite accustomed to treating in the population I treated before coming \nto the Senate, that can tear apart individuals, but this virus is \ndifferent in that it is smarter. It is more cagey than other viruses. \nBut it is still just a little microorganism that is wiping out these \ncontinents, a little tiny virus. It is ravaging families. It is causing \nmass destruction, this little tiny virus. It is ravaging societies. It \nis ravaging economies. It is ravaging countries. And, indeed, it is \nravaging whole continents. To my mind, there is no greater challenge, \nmorally or physically, facing the global health community today than \nthis global health crisis.\n  The other interesting thing about it is, it is new. Usually if you \nhave something this devastating, you think it has a long history and \nhas grown over the years and over the centuries. But it is new. When I \nwas in medical school, we had never heard of an HIV virus; we had never \nheard of the disease called AIDS. I am not that old; 1981 was the first \ntime in this country we were smart enough to figure out that there is \nthis little HIV virus that causes AIDS--1981. That is 22 years ago.\n  But since that pandemic--epidemic means a disease spreading in one \npart of the world. A pandemic is just that, it is spreading all over \nthe world. That is where the ``pan'' in pandemic comes from. Since \n1981, more than 60 million people have been infected with this little \nvirus that wasn't around 23 years ago. That is basically the population \nof the great State of New York times 3. Twenty-three million people \nhave died from this little tiny virus. And we are losing the battle. We \nare fighting it, but it is a battle we are losing as we go forward.\n  For every one person who has died since I was in medical school, say, \nsince 1981 when we first discovered it in this country, for every one \nperson who has died in the last 20 years, in the best of all worlds, if \nwe do everything perfectly, we do everything right, for every one \nperson who died in the last 20 years, two people are going to die in \nthe next 20. That is in the best of all worlds.\n  Why is that? Because there is no cure for this virus. People hear me \ntalk on this floor a lot about vaccines, saying we need to protect the \ninfrastructure and fight bioterrorism with these vaccines. We do not \nhave a vaccine for this little tiny virus. So we have no cure. We have \nno vaccine to prevent it. As I said earlier, this little virus is \nsmart. Whenever we have a therapy that works pretty well, the little \nvirus changes itself--probably 1,000 times faster than other viruses--\nso it will defy that treatment. Every time we get a treatment, it \nchanges itself. It is a cagey virus.\n  The virus causes AIDS. AIDS is the disease, the manifestation. Tabu, \nbeing wasted and thin--the virus itself is what causes it. What do we \nknow about the disease itself? Whom does it hit? Put aside perceptions, \nthe stigma of AIDS. Put them aside. Let me tell you about the virus. \nThe virus hits young people. Eight hundred thousand children were \ninfected in 2002. Young people account for 60 percent of the new HIV \ninfections each year. Worldwide, 13 million people have been orphaned \nby AIDS. Most of them are, indeed, in Africa. When you are orphaned by \nAIDS; you are left without mentors; you are left without parents; you \nare left without a supportive structure; you are left without the \nsupport we have in other, more advantaged, countries.\n  As I go to Africa on these mission trips--again, I go down as a \nphysician--you have the opportunity to go walking through villages. \nNothing really can prepare you for walking through a village and \nlooking at the people in the homes. You see very old people--not very \nold, but old for the society there--people in their seventies, sixties, \nfifties. Then you see just little kids running around. What you do not \nsee are people 20 years of age, to 35, to 40 years of age. It is almost \nlike this whole segment of the population has been wiped out--old \npeople and young people, but nobody in their productive years.\n  That is what you see if you go to Nairobi and you walk through the \nKibera slums, which go on, it seems, forever. When you walk through the \nslums, you don't see people in their most productive years.\n  Entire generations are being wiped out, and kids are growing up in \nthe streets with no parents and no mentors. And that all translates \ndown into no hope.\n  What is fascinating is that we have the power to bring them hope. \nThat is why I get excited when the President thinks big. And he \narticulated that in the State of the Union speech. It is thinking big \nbecause we have the power to bring them hope. We must ask ourselves, \nHow can we, since we have that power, not use that power?\n  Most people do not realize the disease of AIDS caused by the virus is \ntoday a disease of predominantly women. It is just not part of what we \nhistorically have pictured what this disease is all about. More than \nhalf of all the people now infected with AIDS are women.\n  With AIDS on a rampage through the villages of sub-Saharan Africa, \nlife expectancy in Africa is now 47 years of age. I wouldn't be alive \nat 47 years of age.\n  What is interesting is, what increment is due to this little, tiny \nvirus? If the HIV virus had never appeared over the last 20 years, \ninstead of living 47 years you would live 62 years--just because of \nthis little virus.\n  If you are born in Botswana, you are not going to live to 47 years, \nor 45, or 43, or 42, or 41. You may live to the age of 38. Average life \nexpectancy, if you are born in Botswana today, is 38 years of age \nbecause of this single little virus wiping out people, destroying \npeople, killing people in their most productive years.\n  In 2005, in Zimbabwe, 20 percent of its workforce will be wiped out \ndue to AIDS. Death is tragic enough. Taking this productive segment of \nsociety, very quickly you have to ask yourself, with that productive \nsegment as parents and with the infrastructure of civil society \ndisappearing, what happens to the children who are left behind? Who \nwill feed the children? Who will mentor those children?\n  Law enforcement is being wiped out, and teachers are being wiped out. \nKenya has reported in recent years as many as 75 percent of the deaths \nin law enforcement, in its police force, are AIDS-related. In civil \nsociety the potential for disruption is obvious.\n  If you look at what this little tiny virus incrementally does to the \neconomy of these countries, we see we can give unlimited aid and money, \nbut unless we defeat this little virus, the economies are not going to \ngrow; they are going to diminish. If you look at those countries where \nthe prevalent rates are about 20 percent or so--which is, in medical \nterms, significant penetration, but not unusual for Africa--the economy \ndoesn't grow but drops\n\n[[Page S1795]]\n\n2.6 percent a year because of the HIV/AIDS virus. Why? Because you wipe \nout the most productive people in that society. We see poor countries \ngrowing poorer because of the virus, not just financially, which is how \nwe measure gross domestic product, but spiritually. The hopelessness, \nthe helplessness that comes from this little virus, all of a sudden \nbecomes the norm.\n  What is the role of the United States of America, especially in light \nof the President's pronouncement the other night? Historically we have \nmuch to be proud of. I think we need to add that, because we read about \npeople from other countries and people associated with the United \nStates who have never stepped to the plate. I want to disabuse my \ncolleagues and people who are listening. The United States has already \ndone much to combat global HIV/AIDS in terms of research, and in terms \nof financial investment, both unilaterally and bilaterally. You hear \nabout the Global Fund on AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria--an important \nfund, a new fund, that hasn't yet been proven. But it becomes sort of \nthe marker in many people's minds of what we are contributing. In \ntruth, it is one part of a huge battle--a lot of resources that were \nactually invested in fighting AIDS, but in terms of that Global Fund on \nAIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the United States was the first donor \nunder President Bush. In a second round of financing, we once again \nwere the first donor to that fund. Before the President's announcement, \nwe were that global fund's largest donor. We placed $500 million, more \nthan any other nation. That is a quarter of all the pledges. The next \nclosest country hasn't even matched half of our commitment.\n\n  I say that because I am offended when people say the United States \nsimply has not stepped to the plate.\n  Just as impressive is the speed with which we have addressed this \nissue historically. We ramped up funding dramatically in both direct \naid, bilateral aid, and global fund money.\n  Total funding in 1999 was $154 million. Remember, the President two \nnights ago was talking about billions of dollars. Just 4 years ago we \nspent totally $159 million. In the last 4 years, there has been an \neightfold increase, up to about $1.2 billion. Indeed, the United States \nis today leading--even before the President's announcement--the global \nfight against HIV/AIDS. I think we can be proud of that. But--and is \nwhere the President's announcement came--we can do more. I believe in \nsupport of what the President has said from a moral standpoint, we can \nand should and will do more.\n  I mentioned we are losing the battle. Every 10 seconds somebody dies \nof the infection. But in that same 10 seconds there are two new \ninfections. Remember that we have no cure. That is right now. That \nshows there is so much to be done. Each death and each new infection is \none more tragic battle lost in the war against this killer virus.\n  I think, I know, that we have a moral obligation and a human \nrequirement to provide more resources to fully enter the big war to win \nthe battle one person at a time. Those resources must be managed and \nmonitored so they get to those people who we intend to help. The \nprocess must be transparent. I know that the President, because he has \ntold me personally and in meetings many times, wants to invest that \nmoney making sure we get results; that the money is used wisely with \nfocus, that it is used transparently, and that we measure the results \nwe set out to achieve.\n  I think also we in this body need to summon the commitment of all \nAmericans to be soldiers in this war in whatever way they possibly can. \nI say that only because as elected officials, although we know it is \nthe right thing to do and morally the most powerful thing to do, some \nconstituents around the country ask, Why in the world are you investing \nin a disease that, yes, affects the world but is predominantly a \ncontinent so far away?\n  One of the reasons I am carrying on this discussion tonight is \nbecause I think each of us has an obligation--has an opportunity but \nalso an obligation--to help educate not just our colleagues and people \nin Congress but people all across America. We need to do that every day \nin speeches--every time I go back to Tennessee or my colleagues go back \nto Nevada or South Dakota or Georgia or California. We have made a lot \nof progress in the last couple of years. With the President's \nannouncement in the State of the Union Address, I believe we are on the \ncusp of a truly historic leaf that I believe can turn the tide of this \ndevastating disease, if we will start saving lives and also instilling \nhope.\n\n  Over the past 2 years, Senator Kerry and I, with a bipartisan group \nof Senators, have constructed and put together what I believe is a \nsignificant bill that addresses this little, tiny virus--this cagey \nvirus that is causing this mass destruction--and which addresses the \nmoral challenge this virus represents. The legislation will be \ndiscussed in the Foreign Relations Committee next week, led by the \nSenator from Indiana, chairman of that committee, Senator Lugar. I hope \nthis bill becomes the legislative counterpart to President Bush's bold \ninitiative.\n  The President has pledged more resources, significantly more \nresources, a tripling in funding. He has proposed an emergency plan, \nand he has used--this may be the most significant thing--the bully \npulpit to rally a great Nation to this noble cause. He sets the gold \nstandard for humanitarian efforts for the United States but also for \nthe world. I know he has personally committed to achieving results. His \nproposal, once our bill is acted upon, will prevent 7 million of these \nnew infections, will provide the antiretroviral drugs for 2 million \nHIV-infected people, will care for 10 million HIV-infected individuals \nand AIDS orphans, and will provide $15 billion--$15 billion--in funding \nover the next 5 years.\n\n  I should also add that, as a government, we cannot do it alone. Even \nsingle leaders cannot do it alone. Even what this body does cannot do \nit alone.\n  It is truly remarkable, as I have been addressing this particular \nissue over the last 8 years, to see this new intersection, this new \ncoalition of partners that heretofore just has not existed. It has not \nexisted. By that I am talking about the pharmaceutical companies. At \nthe end of the day, it is going to be the research of the \npharmaceutical companies--in developing vaccines, in figuring out why \nthis virus changes--that will give much of the answer. The \npharmaceutical companies, the faith-based community--the churches, the \nspiritual community--the academies, and the universities all across \nthis great Nation are coming together at this intersection, along with \nGovernment and along with, I should add, the private sector and \nfoundations.\n  I mention the foundations because we just saw an announcement last \nweek by Bill Gates. It is significant, with big numbers, huge numbers \ngoing to global health. We have seen nothing like this in the history \nof the world. It comes from a foundation that, in truth, moves a lot \nfaster than Government can move. We have been working on the HIV/AIDS \nissue for years and years and years. Bill Gates basically said: Listen, \nI see the problem. I am going to go out and do my best to lick the \nproblem. Indeed, he announced this past week a remarkable $200 million \ngrant to establish what is called the Grand Challenges in Global Health \ninitiative. This is going to be a major new effort and a partnership \nwith our NIH, our National Institutes of Health, which will accelerate \nresearch on the most difficult scientific barriers in global health.\n  Today, only 10 percent of medical research in this country--only 10 \npercent--is devoted to the diseases which account for 90 percent of the \nhealth burden in the world. Mr. Gates said: It doesn't make sense. For \n90 percent of the health burden in the world, we are only spending 10 \npercent of our research dollars. Let's do something about it. He is in \na position to do just that. Through his foundation, he will change just \nthat.\n  The Gates initiative will provide grants to support the collaborative \nefforts of the most creative and innovative scientists and researchers \nin the world. The initiative will draw attention to these urgent global \nhealth research needs. And it will stimulate where I think the real \nanswer is going to be; that is, the public-private partnerships--the \npartnerships with the academies, with the churches, with the \npharmaceutical companies, with the leadership, yes, of the United \nStates and other of the wealthier countries, but also the leadership of \nthe disadvantaged countries, the countries that are\n\n[[Page S1796]]\n\nbeing subjected to the ravages of HIV/AIDS.\n  I would not have said this 4 years ago, but we will defeat this \nlittle virus. When I close my eyes, that is what I see: this little \nvirus--and all the death and destruction--but this little tiny virus, \nin part because I am a doctor. When I think of disease, I always look \nat the cause of it. But it is that little virus. We will defeat it. Let \nme repeat that: We will. It will be with the leadership of the United \nStates of America. And by ``leadership,'' I am talking about this body, \nworking with the President, working with the House of Representatives, \nworking with the public-private partnerships. With that leadership, we \nwill defeat this virus.\n\n  But the question is--and the reason timing is important--how many \nchildren and women and men are going to die before we defeat the virus? \nI already told you, in the best of all worlds, for every one person who \ndied in the last 20 years, two are going to die in the next 20. Even if \nwe discovered a vaccine right now, that is going to happen, because the \nvaccine is for prevention.\n  The real question is, Will 60 million or 80 million or 100 million \npeople die? Or, again, under the leadership of the President of the \nUnited States, and with the legislation that we can generate in this \nbody, instead of it being 100 million, can it be 20 million or 40 \nmillion or 45 million or 50 million? Or will it grow from 100 million \nto 200 million or 300 million?\n  That is the urgency. That is why we need an emergency response. And \nthat is why, as a physician, as someone who, with my own hands, has had \nthe opportunity to work with hundreds of HIV/AIDS patients in this \ncountry and in many countries in Africa, it means so much to me. I have \nseen that so directly.\n  The answer is in our hands. Literally, it is in our hands. We are \ncapable today of slowing this pandemic. It is going to increase in the \nnear future. There is nothing we can do about that. But we can slow the \ntrajectory. Indeed, in countries such as Uganda it has already \nflattened and decreased, so we know there are things we can do now to \nreverse this trajectory. But we have to choose to fight first. We need \nto make that commitment the President made 2 nights ago and fight it \nwith our will, fight it with resources, fight it with energy and as \nmuch spirit as we can muster.\n  I will close because I know it is late, and we have worked again \naggressively over the course of the day and have made real progress, \nbut I will close by simply saying, the President, I know, is committed \nin both word and deed. I think it is now time for our body, this \nlegislative body, to come together to work for this legislation and \nhelp lead a great people and a great nation to overcome one of the \ngreatest moral and public health challenges the world will face in the \n21st century.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could ask the majority leader to yield \njust for a brief second, I of course appreciate very much the majority \nleader's statement. It has even more meaning based on his being a \nphysician. But having been to Africa just a few months ago for the \nsecond time, and to see the difference in the approximately 8 or 9 \nyears from the time I first went, to see the devastation by this plague \nthat is sweeping this continent is stark.\n  It is frightening to think that thousands of people every day in that \ncontinent are dying--not hundreds. They don't take weekends off. There \nare no vacations. They continue to die during those periods of time.\n  I say to my distinguished Republican leader, I also appreciate \nPresident Bush devoting some of his time in the State of the Union \nAddress to AIDS and acknowledging that there is a need to do more \nfinancially. I appreciate that very much.\n  I do say, however, to the majority leader, that, as you know, we \ntried last year to pass the same initiative. So it is not as if we have \nbeen standing still. We tried to do this in the past and, frankly, we \nwere held up in its passage.\n  I also say that the United States, of course, is doing a lot, doing \nmore than any other country, as the majority leader has indicated. But \nI believe we have an obligation to do that. I think it is good that we \nare doing it. I think we should do more.\n  I also would like to support what the majority leader has said. The \nGates Foundation is exemplary. I think it is wonderful we have a \nprivate sector joining to try to do something to defeat this plague. \nThat is what it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/30/senate-section/article/S1796-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1796]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         EARLY ACCOMPLISHMENTS\n\n  Mr. REID. Having said that, I want to say to the majority leader, \nseparate and apart from HIV/AIDS, that the reason I came here--I am \nvery glad I did because I was educated by the leader's speech--there \nare not opportunities to do this all the time, it is early in the \nsession, it is early in your leadership but I would just like to say we \nhave, I think, done some good work. Last week, we were able to complete \nthe appropriations bill. There were some who said we were going to try \nto stop it.\n  The leader took our word for it and didn't file cloture early. I \nthink that set a good tone in this body. Some of the time we spent last \nweek was tedious, but it set a good foundation. I would also say, based \non conversations we had off the floor today with you and the Democratic \nleader, it was not all that likely we would be able to complete the \nwork on a very important nomination you have wanted, the President has \nwanted, but we were able to work that out.\n  The only reason I mention that tonight is, there will be days when I \nam sure you will criticize us, and we will criticize you for not being \nable to get a lot of things done. We sure appreciate the days we have.\n  I know the leader has not decided what time we will start on the \nEstrada nomination. I will talk to you privately about that, what time \nwe should do that Tuesday. I think we have been able to accomplish some \ngood things today.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will get to the closing statements. I \nbriefly want to respond that in the past 3 weeks we have had a lot to \ndo. It has been an opportunity for us to work hand in hand, and I think \nwhat has happened over the last initial 12 days, and then now over the \nlast 4 days, does demonstrate that with an aggressive agenda, that by \nworking together and cooperating and, yes, negotiating, we can work \nthrough and achieve great accomplishments for the country. I appreciate \nhis comments.\n  Mr. REID. I would also say, I did not realize the leader had decided \nwhat time to go to the nomination on Tuesday. We would rather start it \nafter the caucuses on Tuesday. But if the leader feels he needs to go \nat 10, we will be ready to go at 10 Tuesday morning.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, it would be best if we could go ahead to \nthe nomination earlier in the day, as spelled out in the unanimous \nconsent agreement, again, just to maximize the use of our time. I will \noffer the proposal that we go in the morning.\n  Let me also say, because we are shortly going to approve the \nnomination of the Secretary of the Treasury, I didn't think even 8 \nhours ago we would be able to do that. I appreciate the opportunity to \nbe able to do that, complete it tonight, and then move in the \nappropriate fashion with the Estrada nomination.\n  Mr. REID. If the leader will yield, I should have said that good work \nwas done this afternoon with the Secretary-nominee, Mr. Snow, meeting \nwith Senators Durbin and Harkin. He obviously did an excellent job. I \nexpress my appreciation to him, but also to Senators Durbin and Harkin \nfor allowing us to move forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/30/senate-section/article/S1796-2", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1796-S1797]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    FUNDING TO FIGHT HIV/AIDS ABROAD\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise to laud President Bush's \nannouncement in his State of the Union Address of a $15 billion, 5-year \nemergency plan for AIDS relief, with $10 billion in new money to combat \nthe global AIDS pandemic, provides new hope for many of the 42 million \nmen, women, and children living with AIDS right now. This initiative, \nwhich I enthusiastically support, represents a critical first step in \nscaling up the world's response to the global AIDS pandemic. Combined \nwith expanded, though still relatively small, bilateral resources to \nfight tuberculosis, the leading killer of people with AIDS, this \ninitiative can save\n\n[[Page S1797]]\n\nmany lives. I commend the President for his leadership in this effort.\n  In truth, however, this effort has just begun. This initiative should \nbe just a first downpayment by the U.S. in our fight against AIDS. We \nmust fully fund this initiative in 2004 and do more. It is also up to \nus to now work with the President to shape this initiative for maximum \nimpact. We must invest wisely to protect and save as many lives as \npossible as quickly as possible. As we work with the administration to \ntake this initiative from an idea into action, we have important \ndecisions to make. I offer you a few key points today regarding how we \ncan use these funds in order to save the greatest number of lives and \nprotect our global health and stability.\n  We must frontload this money, and ensure that it reaches as many \ncountries as possible.\n  These funds are needed immediately, and if we do not invest enough \nnow, we will pay far more later, in money, in lives lost, and in the \nsocial, economic, and spiritual cost to the families, communities, \nnations, which are hardest hit. There are 10 million children in sub-\nSaharan Africa alone, children who ought to be free to play, to learn, \nto enjoy their young lives who have lost one or both parents to AIDS. \nThis represents a country the size of Belgium. In 10 years, at current \nrates, this number will quadruple. But we have a choice. Will we allow \nthis to happen? Every year we delay, the slower we are to scale up, the \ngreater the cost. This epidemic is not waiting for us, it is \naccelerating. So we must accelerate our response. We must increase \nfunding in the fiscal year 2004 budget we will soon consider.\n  The 14 countries in Africa and the Caribbean targeted by President \nBush are important ones. However, there are many, additional countries \nwhere we must urgently address AIDS now. For instance, in Lesotho, \nMalawi, Swaziland and Zimbabwe, where 60 percent of all deaths under 60 \nare due to AIDS, TB, and malaria, people need help immediately too.\n  Our own National Intelligence Council has identified five populous \nnations of strategic importance to the United States as the ``next \nwave'' of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, including India and Russia. India \nalone contains some one-third of the world's tuberculosis burden, and \nsince HIV fuels the TB epidemic, TB rates will skyrocket in these \ncountries as HIV spreads. HIV rates are growing faster in Russia than \nany other region of the world, and the dangerous drug-resistant strains \nof TB that are more prevalent in Russia than anywhere in the world will \npose a serious, deadly and expensive medical problem if they explode in \nsynergy with AIDS. We cannot wait; we must act now.\n  Another point of key importance regarding the President's proposed \ninitiative is we must allocate far greater resources to the important \nnew global fund to fight AIDS, TB, and malaria, but the initiative \nfails so far to do so.\n  I fear that the President's emergency plan for AIDS relief may \nunderfund the global fund, our best new means of addressing these \nepidemics. This is particularly ironic given that Secretary Tommy \nThompson has just been appointed the chair of the global fund's board. \nThe global fund is a relatively new mechanism that is centrally \nimportant in scaling up the global response to AIDS. The global fund is \ninnovative. It is independent. It is efficient. And it is fully \noperational. By tomorrow, at the close of their meeting in Geneva, \nSwitzerland, the fund's board will announce a second round of grant \nawards to programs in affected countries that are providing needed \nprevention, treatment, and care for these three diseases. In this \nsecond round, the fund will approve projects that will produce the \nfollowing estimated results:\n  For just $325 million, or about 2 percent of the proposed $15 \nbillion, 270,000 more people will receive antiretroviral, ARV, drugs in \ndeveloping countries, adding to 220,000 people who will receive ARVs \nfrom the first round of the global fund's grants. In total, the global \nfund will support a sixfold increase in the number of people being \ntreated with ARVs in Africa.\n  With $300 million, some 2 million more people will be treated for \ntuberculosis over the next 5 years through expansion of the highly \neffective DOTS, Directly Observed Therapy, Short-course, treatment \nservices.\n  For just $18 million, or one-tenth of one percent of $15 billion, 10 \nmillion more people in Africa will be treated for malaria through the \nuse of the new and highly effective anti-malarials, arteminisin-based \ntreatments.\n  This work is highly impressive, and it is critically important.\n  The global fund estimates very conservatively that it will need $6.3 \nbillion in 2003 and 2004, to be able to finance the high-quality \nproposals it anticipates receiving. The U.S. should provide at least $2 \nbillion or more in 2004, with additional resources in 2003, scaling up \nin future years.\n  Now, after this second round of grants is announced on Friday, the \nfund will be virtually out of money, and unable to even request a third \nround of proposals later this year. I commend the efforts of my many \ncolleagues over the past year, colleagues from both sides of the aisle, \nled by Senators Frist, Kerry, DeWine, Durbin, Boxer, and many others--\nwho have provided leadership toward expanding the United States' \ninvestment in the global fund. Now is not the time to back down on U.S. \nleadership at the global fund, but the time to greatly increase our \ninvestment in the fund to rapidly and effectively scale up global \nefforts. Providing our fair share of global fund resources as a part of \na new AIDS initiative would leverage major increases in other donor \ncontributions as well.\n  One more point on funding. It is of vital importance that the \nPresident's emergency plan for AIDS relief not draw resources away from \nexisting development programs such as bilateral tuberculosis or child \nsurvival efforts or other development priorities.\n  And, finally, we must look at the problem of AIDS in conjunction with \nthe problem of tuberculosis, for the two are inextricably linked from a \nmedical perspective. Tuberculosis, which is the leading killer of \npeople with HIV worldwide, is carried by one in three people worldwide. \nThe disease drains human resources from struggling economies and \npoverty-stricken regions.\n  Tuberculosis is readily curable with drugs that cost as little as $10 \nper patient in developing countries with the DOTS treatment, but only \none in four people who need DOTS have access to it. If we do not act \nnow to bring tuberculosis under control globally, then TB infection \nrates will rise precipitously with the spread of HIV; and this is of \nparticular concern given the existence of dangerous drug-resistant \nstrains, which are far more expensive and difficult to treat. With just \n$200 million invested annually, the United States can provide its fair \nshare of the resources needed to meet international TB control targets \nby 2005, as laid out in a groundbreaking blueprint called the Global \nPlan to Stop TB.\n  In closing, I again salute President Bush for his wise and \ncompassionate leadership in proposing a bold new U.S. initiative to \nfight global AIDS. I urge that this be just a first step in our scaled \nup response, and that we invest resources aggressively Now, that we \nreach as many affected countries as possible, and that we provide our \nfair U.S. share of the total resources needed by the global fund to \nfight AIDS, TB, and malaria.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/30/senate-section/article/S1797-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1797-S1798]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ANDRE AGASSI\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to my friend and \nfellow Nevadan Andre Agassi, who won the Australian Open tennis \nchampionship over the weekend. Andre is from Las Vegas, where the \ncommunity knows him to be not only an outstanding athlete but also an \noutstanding person who gives generously to many worthwhile causes and \nhelps those most in need.\n  Blessed with amazing talent, Andre was a natural who began his \nprofessional career as a very young boy. Although he is still quite \nyoung by most standards, for a professional athlete, especially a \nworld-class tennis player he is considered old. He will turn 33 this \nyear and is now one of the true veterans of the men's tennis tour. He \nhas demonstrated a tremendous dedication to fitness and training to \nenable him to compete--and win--against much younger players.\n  Andre demonstrates the same relentless determination to succeed off \nthe\n\n[[Page S1798]]\n\ncourt, and to help others have an opportunity to achieve. The people of \nNevada appreciate Andre's commitment to the community and his \nlongstanding philanthropic work.\n  Andre Agassi is an example of how a celebrity can use his fame, \nfortune, and connections for the public good. He has contributed \nmillions of dollars and helped raise millions more for charitable \norganizations. And his involvement in these projects extends beyond \nsigning large checks: he gives his time and energy to these programs, \nhelps develop a vision and plan for them and knows what's going on with \nthem.\n  He established the Andre Agassi Charitable Foundation to assist \norganizations that support children and that provide assistance to \nvictims of domestic violence.\n  The foundation provided much of the funding for the Andre Agassi \nCollege Preparatory Academy. Agassi Prep, as it is called, is a charter \nschool serving at risk children. Many of the students live in poverty. \nThe vast majority of them are from single parent households. Most of \nthe students attending the school are African American.\n  Andre's goal is to improve their lives through education and prepare \nthem for college.\n  I had the opportunity to visit this wonderful school and see the \nstudents learning in the classroom and then present a performance. I \nwas encouraged by their enthusiasm for knowledge and the respect that \nthey showed for their teachers and for one another.\n  In addition to the charter school, there is the Andre Agassi Boys and \nGirls Club in west Las Vegas, a minority community, providing a safe \nand positive environment for youth. The club functions as a place where \nchildren can participate in fun, recreational activities and also learn \nabout the dangers of becoming involved with gangs or drugs.\n  So Andre Agassi is making a difference in the lives of so many \nchildren and their families in Southern Nevada, some of whom are \nunaware that this weekend Down Under in Australia, thousands of miles \nand many time zones away, Andre won another major tennis championship, \nthe eighth Grand Slam title of his career.\n  To accomplish this, Andre won seven straight matches over 2 weeks. \nThis extends his victory streak to 21 consecutive matches at the \nAustralian Open, a tournament he won in 1995, and then again in 2000 \nand 2001. Unfortunately, he was not able to defend his championship \nlast year because of an injury. But he recovered and worked hard to get \nhis form back and once again triumphed.\n  Another reason tennis fans are celebrating Andre's latest victory is \nhis recent suggestion that if he won this tournament, his wife, Steffi \nGraf, herself a legend in the tennis world and winner of numerous \nchampionships, would come out of her retirement to team up with him and \nplay mixed doubles at the French Open this year.\n  He and Steffi are a formidable pair and should create a lot of \nexcitement on the clay courts in Paris.\n  Several years ago Andre won the men's singles at the French Open and \nbecame the first tennis male player in more than three decades to win \nall four of the Grand Slam tournaments--Wimbledon, the U.S. Open, the \nAustralian Open, and the French--during his career. These events are \nplayed on different surfaces--grass, hardcourt and clay--that emphasize \ndifferent skills and strategies, so it is very difficult and rare for a \nsingle player to have the versatility needed to excel on all of them.\n  Andre has already established himself as one of the all-time greats \nin the history of tennis and provided fans with many memories. He has \nbeen playing professional tennis now for more than half of his life. \nEven though he is playing some of the best tennis of his life and shows \nno signs of slowing down, we know that sooner or later, I predict \nwithin the next 10 years, Andre will win his last Grand Slam at age 40.\n  He and Steffi are the parents of a young boy, Jaden Gil, and I'm sure \nAndre will want to be actively involved in family life after his \nprofessional tennis days are over. I am also certain that Andre will \ncontinue his great work on behalf of children in Las Vegas, and he can \nlook forward to watching with pride as the students of Agassi Prep grow \nup, graduate and achieve success.\n  I am happy to recognize once again the accomplishments of a great \nNevadan and great American, Andre Agassi.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/30/senate-section/article/S1798-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1798-S1799]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         REMEMBERING THE LEGACY OF DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor an extraordinary man \nin American history. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., without exception, \nled a fearless life dedicated to the cause of human rights and world \npeace. His example inspired a generation of Americans to rise above \nwhat had been two centuries of injustice and inequality and usher in a \nnew day of enlightenment and freedom. For that great gift, for having \nimagined what America ought to be and setting us on that course, we \nwill forever be in his debt.\n  Had Dr. King been spared on that fateful day in 1968, he would have \nturned 74 years of age this month. He would have watched his children, \nMartin, Dexter and Yolanda, grow into strong and responsible adults. He \nwould have watched a generation of young people mature into adults, \nstruggling to keep the spirit of his dream alive. He would have seen \nthe birth of an entirely new generation, charged with carrying \nAmerica's torch into a new century.\n  Had Dr. King lived, he would have witnessed, and undoubtedly \nexperienced, countless changes in America and the world . . . but would \nhe believe we had truly arrived at the ``promised land'' he spoke of in \nhis ``I Have a Dream'' speech? Or would he find some unfinished \nbusiness? What would he say?\n  Would Dr. King still speak of the ``debilitating and grinding \npoverty'' that disproportionately affects minority communities? In \nAmerica today, like America of the 1960s, disproportionate numbers of \nminorities live in dilapidated housing with low or no income. They have \nfar too few resources to feed their families, to clothe their children, \nor to pay the price of higher and higher rents, and certainly not \nenough to afford a down-payment for a home of their own. Too many \nseniors have to make the unfair and unacceptable choice between heat \nand prescription drugs. And too few of them have the retirement savings \nof which they had dreamed. And in these sorry economic times, there is \nno safety-net, children can't support their aging parents.\n  What would Dr. King say? We live in the richest Nation in the world, \nyet certain current economic policies sometimes neglect working-class \nmen and women and turn a blind eye to the poorest among us, all in the \nname of stimulating our economy. If we want to boost the economy, we \nshould first boost the vast majority of Americans who can't spend \nbecause they don't have an opportunity to earn. Our focus should be on \nproviding equal access to professional and educational opportunities, \nand not on dispensing one-way tickets to low-paying jobs with dead-end \npossibilities. If we are concerned about our country's economic health, \nwe should be concerned about economic opportunities for all.\n  What would Dr. King say? Last year, hate crimes climbed by more than \n17 percent, and offenses targeted specifically against Muslims jumped \n1,600 percent. Just this month, as the Nation prepared itself to honor \nthe memory of Dr. King, racial threats were mailed to more than 30 \nAfrican-American churches and businesses in Kansas City, MO. And, \nsadly, Kansas City is no different than many cities in America. \nAccording to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, 9,730 hate crimes \nwere reported in the United States in 2001, that is more than 26 hate \ncrimes a day. And it is not counting the untold numbers of crimes that \ngo unreported, nor the numbers of crimes against individuals solely \nbecause of their gender or sexual orientation or disability, all of \nwhich are not captured under current Federal law.\n  Hate crimes are not simply crimes against individuals; they are \ncrimes against whole communities and have marked the demise of great \nnations. To paraphrase Dr. King, ``history is cluttered with the \nwreckage of nations and individuals'' that tolerated ``this self-\ndefeating path of hate.'' And yet Congress in its infinite wisdom has \nfailed to pass basic legislation that would strengthen the ability of \nFederal, State and local governments to investigate and prosecute hate \ncrimes; failed to remove unnecessary obstacles to Federal\n\n[[Page S1799]]\n\ninvolvement in the prosecution of bias-motivated crimes; and failed to \ngive law enforcement the tools it needs to ensure that every American \ncan live in an environment free of terror.\n  And what would Dr. King say of our efforts to make it possible that \nevery American child attend college and receive the benefits that flow \nfrom a college education? Four decades after Ole Miss and the \nUniversity of Alabama admitted their first minority students, some are \narguing that universities cannot seek to promote a diverse campus \natmosphere by considering race, among many other factors, in assembling \nits student body. I was disappointed when the President announced to \nthe nation that he would authorize the U.S. Government to oppose the \nundergraduate and law school admissions policies of the University of \nMichigan. The administration had an opportunity to send a powerful \nmessage to the Nation, namely that, partisan politics aside, the \nattainment of diverse student bodies at America's universities is in \nour greatest national interest. I disagree with his decision.\n  The President's reason for opposing the Michigan admissions system \nwas because it mandated racial quotas. It does not. As the university's \npresident, Mary Sue Coleman, noted in her response to President Bush's \nmisstatement, the university's admissions system ``is a complex process \nthat takes many factors into account and considers the entire \nbackground of each applicant. . . . We do not have, and never had, \nquotas or numerical targets in either the undergraduate or Law School \nadmissions programs. Academic qualifications are the overwhelming \nconsideration for admission to both programs.''\n  No, this debate is not about quotas. Rather, it is about educators' \njudgments about how best to teach and stimulate the curiosity of \nAmerica's college students. It is about how to nurture critical \nthinking, how to ignite students' intellectual imagination. I have said \nit many times before, but now I have the social science data to back it \nup: the greatest benefactor of a diverse student community is not the \nindividual student who gets some plus-factor on his admissions \napplication; it is the wider college community that gains immensely \nfrom learning in an environment with different types of people, with \ndifferent types of life experiences. And anyone who would suggest that \nan individual's race does not contribute to one's life experience would \nbe sadly mistaken, because, even in the 21st century, diversity \nmatters.\n\n  This debate is about how to make America's promise real for all her \nchildren. Tellingly, when asked about the lawsuits against the \nUniversity of Michigan, Dr. King's widow, Coretta Scott King, noted \nquite poignantly that affirmative action is ``an important part toward \neliminating discrimination.'' She is right. To the extent that Whites \nand minorities sometimes experience life differently, in other words, \nto the extent that there are Black-White gaps in poverty rates, in \nincome levels, in access to quality health care, in life expectancy, in \nrates of imprisonment, in any number of life indicators, those gaps \nnarrow considerably when minorities have increased and equal access to \neducational opportunities.\n  Quite frankly, the road that led me from the small town of Scranton, \nPA, to the hamlet of Claymont, DE, and eventually to the hallowed Halls \nof the Senate, while rocky and sometimes uncertain, was always paved \nwith possibility. The challenge, my friends, is to make sure every \nchild, no matter their race or ethnicity, no matter their gender, no \nmatter their families' socio-economic status, has a chance to travel a \nroad, not necessarily free of obstacles, but certainly full of \npossibility. We must be vigilant in ensuring that the road for all our \ncitizens is paved with possibility.\n  In 1957, when Dr. King and a group of others formed the Southern \nChristian Leadership Conference, they chose as their motto: ``To save \nthe soul of America.'' Our charge today is no less urgent. We have to \nmake America what it ought to be. And to do that, we start where our \nFounders started, by awakening in our hearts that spirit of revolution, \nof freedom, of democracy out of which America was born, by remembering \nthat America's promise is only as strong and as real to you as it is to \nall. Dr. King said it best: ``Injustice anywhere is a threat \neverywhere. . . . Whatever affects one directly, affects all \nindirectly.'' My friends, ``either we go up together or we go down \ntogether.''\n  The questions are really quite simple. I stand with Dr. King's \nvision, which calls on us today to make sure that we do all we can to \nclose the gaps in education and economic prosperity.\n  When Dr. King died that dark day in 1968, honestly a part of me and a \npart of every American died, too. Riots erupted in 125 cities around \nthe country, including in my home State of Delaware, where the National \nGuard occupied Wilmington for 10 months, reportedly the longest \noccupation in the country. But out of that horror and the anguish that \nfollowed, a clarion call was heard. We emerged from the riots a \nstronger and better nation, and with a stronger faith in what is good \nand right about America.\n  To my beloved countrymen, I say that, in this season marking Dr. \nKing's birth, we must remember his legacy. We must continue to raise \nour voices, continue to speak for the least among us, continue to fight \nfor what is good and right about America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/30/senate-section/article/S1799-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1799]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. In the last Congress Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred August 27, \n2000 in Normal, IL. Christopher Weninger, an Illinois State University \nstudent, was assaulted while walking home from a party. Three men \napproached Weninger on the street and asked him for a cigarette. As \nWeninger handed one man a cigarette, another man punched him in the \nface and called him ``queer.'' The victim suffered a broken nose and \neye socket.\n   I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/30/senate-section/article/S1799-2", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1799-S1800]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    YOUTH PROGRAM IS BEST REVENGE AGAINST RISING TIDE OF GUN DEATHS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I want to bring an inspiring young woman \nfrom my home State of Michigan to the attention of my colleagues. Her \nname is Lakeshia Gallman. Lakeshia graduated from Martin Luther King \nHigh School in 2002 and currently attends Wayne State University.\n  As many of my colleagues know, the Detroit area has been plagued by \ngun-related deaths of children over the last year. Lakeshia Gallman is \nno stranger to the terrible effects of this rising tide of gun violence \non families and communities. She lost her 17-year-old cousin in a \nsenseless act of gun violence 4 years ago. Since that incident, \nLakeshia's commitment to reducing the occurrence of gun violence in \nDetroit has been exemplary. Lakeshia is active in the Detroit \nNeighborhood Service Organization's Youth Initiative Project, an \norganization dedicated to drug prevention and stopping youth violence. \nShe has been a champion of gun safety initiatives in Detroit for over 3 \n\\1/2\\ years. Over the last year, Lakeshia has set up town hall \nmeetings, and met with local and national elected officials, including \nme. She also helped distribute over 2,000 gun locks and has educated \npeople about the harsh realities of gun violence. Lakeshia recently \nauthored a column on the effects of gun violence in the Detroit Free \nPress.\n  Like many Americans, Lakeshia Gallman understands that the black \nmarket and gun traffickers are two of the primary ways criminals get \ntheir hands on guns. She also knows that easy access to guns in homes \nare a primary method by which kids injure or kill other kids. We can \neliminate easy access to guns by criminals by closing the gun show \nloophole. And we can prevent kids from gaining access to guns\n\n[[Page S1800]]\n\nby enacting safe storage legislation, such as the Children's Firearm \nAccess Prevention Act. These are two commonsense steps we can take to \nreduce gun violence.\n  I had the pleasure of meeting Lakeshia Gallman in October and I \ncommended her on her hard work and dedication to preventing gun \nviolence in her community. I am sure that I speak for many of my Senate \ncolleagues in congratulating her on a job well done.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Lakeshia's Detroit Free Press column be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Youth Program Is Best Revenge Against Rising Tide of Gun Deaths\n\n\n      teen who lost cousin channels her anger into education plan\n\n                         (By Lakeshia Gallman)\n\n       Sometimes I sit back and wonder why innocent people have to \n     die. It is a shame that violence has taken over our world.\n       The shooting death of 16-year-old Detroit high-school \n     student Mario Smith over the weekend has personal meaning for \n     me as someone who graduated from Martin Luther King High \n     School this year. Mario was an honor student at King, an \n     athlete I knew to be a great all-around person.\n       His senseless death was the latest sad reminder of how gun \n     violence is destroying our communities. But I already knew \n     this--because my 17-year-old cousin was shot to death four \n     years ago.\n       My cousin and his friends were shot several times with \n     automatic weapons. It was a Sunday afternoon; my aunt told \n     him to take her car and go to the cleaners. Instead, he went \n     to pick up some friends who at the time were selling drugs. \n     They stopped at a stop sign, and two men sprayed the car with \n     their AK47s.\n       I think my cousin was at the wrong place at the wrong time \n     and hanging out with the wrong crowd. He had a lot of dreams \n     that he wanted to accomplish in life, but that was all taken \n     away from him in couple of seconds.\n       He always talked about going to the NFL or being a rapper. \n     He was like a brother. I miss his jokes and his smile.\n       He taught me how to play basketball and said he would come \n     to my first high school game. He was killed a month before my \n     first game.\n       After my cousin was murdered, I wanted revenge on whoever \n     killed him. Later, I realized that violence was not the way \n     to retaliate. I joined the Detroit Neighborhood Services \n     Organization's Youth Initiatives Project--a youth-driven \n     program that campaigns against drug violence. The program is \n     my revenge.\n       I get my revenge by educating the community on gun safety \n     and passing out gun locks to help prevent accidents with guns \n     in the home. In this way, I could repay my cousin by saving \n     other lives.\n       The Youth Initiatives Project has benefited me a lot. The \n     program has made me come out of my shell and talk to other \n     youths about my story.\n       When I first started the program, I was very shy and quiet. \n     With the help of Frank McGhee, our program director, I \n     learned that if you speak your mind, people will take a \n     minute to listen.\n       The Youth Initiatives Project has been fighting the fight \n     for a long time. We have been campaigning and having rallies \n     on this issue for about 3\\1/2\\ years. Gun violence can be \n     stopped. We just have to keep on pushing and educating the \n     public.\n       Among other achievements, the project distributed 2,000 gun \n     locks to the community over the summer. This proved that the \n     community wanted to practice gun safety--and that made me \n     proud.\n       The next issue I want to deal with is illegal gun \n     trafficking. I wonder where people are getting these high-\n     powered machine guns. People are selling guns from their \n     houses trunks of their cars and other places that are \n     illegal. Anyone can buy a gun from these places, even minors.\n       This illegal gun trafficking is very dangerous because \n     children can get their hands on guns whenever they want.\n       My message to the community is: If we had done something \n     before these murders, this could have been prevented. We were \n     not concerned until our babies were murdered. There need to \n     be more block clubs, town hall meetings and community \n     activities to keep children out of trouble. This is what I \n     leave with you. Let's start saving our future before it fades \n     away.\n       To Mario Smith's family, I would like to say that I will \n     keep praying for you and to never give up, because justice \n     will be served.\n       To my cousin: Rest in peace, Ronald Ellis, I will see you \n     again one day. Just keep on waiting for me, and we will play \n     that one-on-one game I owe you.\n       My heart goes out to the families and siblings who lost \n     somebody they love. God bless you, and never give up.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/30/senate-section/article/S1800-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1800-S1801]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          TRAVEL TO PRAGUE, CZECH REPUBLIC FOR THE NATO SUMMIT\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, as many of my colleagues may be aware, \nI am a strong advocate of NATO enlargement to include Europe's new \ndemocracies. As such, I was thrilled to have the opportunity to join \nPresident George W. Bush at the NATO Summit in Prague last November, at \nwhich time invitations for NATO membership were extended to Bulgaria, \nEstonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia.\n  I remain deeply grateful to the President for inviting me to join him \nas a member of the Congressional delegation to the NATO Summit, along \nwith my colleague Senator Bill Frist, and Congressman Tom Lantos, \nCongressman Elton Gallegly and Congressman Doug Bereuter. I appreciate \nthat the President has recognized my lifelong passion for the inclusion \nof the former Captive Nations as members of the NATO Alliance, and I \nwas proud to be in the room on November 21, 2002, when NATO Secretary \nGeneral Lord Robertson officially announced the decision to invite \nseven countries to become part of the Alliance.\n  As Lord Robertson articulated on that historic day, the decision to \ninclude these new members will serve to strengthen the Alliance as it \nprepares to confront new challenges to global security. After working \nwith the NATO aspirant countries on comprehensive domestic reforms in \npreparation for membership in the Alliance, the Secretary General \nconcluded that, ``We can therefore say with complete confidence that \nthis round of enlargement will maintain and increase NATO's strength, \ncohesion and vitality.'' I share his belief that these countries will \nmake significant contributions to the NATO Alliance. As Secretary of \nDefense Donald Rumsfeld and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff \nGeneral Richard Myers have also expressed, these countries will bring \nniche capabilities, as well as energy, freshness and enthusiasm, to the \nAlliance.\n  I sincerely believe that although the newly invited countries still \nhave work to do on their Membership Action Plans, their reforms will be \nswifter and more complete as they are brought into the Alliance, rather \nthan left out.\n  Upon our arrival in the Czech Republic, we were informed that we were \ninvited to attend a mock NATO Summit for students, which included young \npeople representing all 19 members of the NATO Alliance, as well as the \naspirant countries. The students were scheduled to discuss and debate \nthe same issues that were to be addressed by the Heads of States of the \nNATO member countries. President Bush was the keynote speaker at their \nevent. I was pleased that Senator Frist and I had the opportunity to \nintroduce ourselves to the various delegations, and I enjoyed the \nchance to share common experiences with the delegations from Macedonia, \nCroatia, Italy and Lithuania on an informal basis.\n  President Bush gave a most inspiring speech to the young people, \nemphasizing the fact that NATO has become more than simply a military \norganization, and is in fact an organization composed of people who \nshare common values. With these common ties, he remarked, those \ncountries who have been traditional adversaries will no longer go to \nwar against one another. Instead, as Article V of the NATO Charter \nclearly states, an attack against one is an attack on all.\n  Following the President's speech, we proceeded to a reception with \nSecretary of State Colin Powell. I was delighted to talk with him about \nNATO's changing role, as well as the many perspectives from which he \nhas viewed the formulation of our foreign policy. On Wednesday evening, \nNovember 20, 2002, members of the U.S. delegation attended a dinner \nwith other delegates to the NATO Summit, which was hosted by the Aspen \nInstitute. I was glad to have the opportunity to visit with President \nMesic of Croatia, President Trajkovski of Macedonia, Prime Minister \nDzurinda of the Slovak Republic, President Kucan of Slovenia, and our \nhost, President Vaclav Havel of the Czech Republic.\n  Thursday, November 21, 2002 was a thrilling day for me. I have longed \nto be present when Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, \nSlovakia and Slovenia were invited into NATO, and I was pleased to be \nthere to see President Havel begin the program and to hear Lord \nRobertson formally invite\n\n[[Page S1801]]\n\nseven countries to join the Alliance. With no objections, the consensus \namong the Allies was to invite these young democracies into NATO. Each \ndelegation, through its President or Prime Minister, made a statement \nto express their support for these seven countries and their strategic \nimportance to the NATO organization. It was inspiring to hear country \ngive their enthusiastic endorsement, and it gave me some comfort that \nthey would help to move the approval of these countries' membership \nthrough their respective legislatures.\n  On Thursday afternoon, I joined other members of the U.S. delegation \nat a small luncheon in honor of the NATO aspirant countries. I enjoyed \nthe chance to visit with President Vaira Vike-Freiberga of Latvia, \nForeign Minister Mircea Geoana of Romania, President Moisiu of Albania, \nPrime Minister Drnovsek of Slovenia, as well as Prime Minister Simeon \nSaxe-Coburg-Gotha of Bulgaria. It was a wonderful celebration of the \ninvitations extended to Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, \nSlovakia and Slovenia, as well as the ongoing reforms in Macedonia, \nAlbania and Croatia to prepare for membership in the Alliance.\n  Later that day, my wife Janet and I were happy to talk further with \nCzech President Vaclav Havel at a dinner held in his honor at the \nPrague Castle. Following dinner, at 1:30 a.m. Prague time, I placed a \ncall to Cleveland to talk with individuals with ties to NATO aspirant \ncountries who were gathered at the Lithuanian Hall of Our Lady of \nPerpetual Help at a rally to celebrate the historic events that had \ntaken place that day. I enjoyed the opportunity to share with them the \nexperiences that I was having in Prague. It was truly a capstone to an \nunbelievable day that I will never forget.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate as we \nbegin to discuss the merits of NATO enlargement during this session of \nCongress.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, as an appropriator, I come to the \nfloor today to express my opposition to the omnibus appropriations \nbill.\n  The $385 billion omnibus appropriations bill cuts almost $10 billion \nfrom what the Senate Appropriations Committee approved last year.\n  On top of these draconian cuts, the bill before us includes a 2.9 \npercent across-the-board cut, to non-military programs, and will affect \ncritical programs such as homeland security, education, and job \ntraining.\n  This bill is a major mistake and represents a short-sided approach to \nsolving our Nation's problems.\n  What is happening is an administration's effort to starve domestic \nprograms in order to save dollars for a $674 billion tax cut. If this \neffort is successful, we will see interest rates rise, the deficit \nballoon, and a 10-year cumulative deficit of $2 to 3 trillion.\n  Americans don't know it yet but soon will learn that this bill makes \na house of cards out of homeland security, which loses $1 billion which \nwas already requested, authorized, and appropriated.\n  How many Americans know that this bill will likely cut 1,175 FBI \nagents, 490 food safety engineers, and 1,600 customs inspectors who are \nvital if we are to protect our homeland from contraband and those that \nwould do us harm.\n  How many Americans know that the Head Start cut of $107 million could \nprevent 2700 youngsters from a Head Start experience, or leave 224,000 \nneedy individuals without the meals provided by WIC, or 230,000 \nveterans without medical services.\n  To make matters worse, this bill is being offered at a time when our \nNation continues to face significant challenges in protecting homeland \nsecurity, increasing school achievement, and strengthening our work \nforce.\n  Essentially what this bill does is cut the money from a number of \ncritical projects so this body can pass a tax cut of $674 billion, \nwhich will lead to a $2 trillion deficit over the next 10 years.\n  Every day this body is faced with tough choices. But in my decade in \nthe Senate, I believe this bill represents one of the worst pieces of \nlegislation to pass this Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/30/senate-section/article/S1801-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1801-S1804]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RULES OF THE COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN RELATIONS\n\n  Mr. LUGAR.

No member of the \n     Committee may receive assignment to a second subcommittee \n     until, in order of seniority, all members of the Committee \n     have chosen assignments to one subcommittee, and no member \n     shall receive assignments to a third subcommittee until, in \n     order of seniority, all members have chosen assignments to \n     two subcommittees.\n       No member of the Committee may serve on more than four \n     subcommittees at any one time.\n       The Chairman and Ranking Member of the Committee shall be \n     ex officio members, without vote, of each subcommittee.\n\n[[Page S1802]]\n\n       (c) Meetings.--Except when funds have been specifically \n     made available by the Senate for a subcommittee purpose, no \n     subcommittee of the Committee on Foreign Relations shall hold \n     hearings involving expenses without prior approval of the \n     Chairman of the full Committee or by decision of the full \n     Committee. Meetings of subcommittees shall be scheduled after \n     consultation with the Chairman of the Committee with a view \n     toward avoiding conflicts with meetings of other \n     subcommittees insofar as possible. Meetings of subcommittees \n     shall not be scheduled to conflict with meetings of the full \n     Committee.\n       The proceedings of each subcommittee shall be governed by \n     the rules of the full Committee, subject to such \n     authorizations or limitations as the Committee may from time \n     to time prescribe.\n\n\n                            rule 3: meetings\n\n       (a) Regular Meeting Day.--The regular meeting day of the \n     Committee on Foreign Relations for the transaction of \n     Committee business shall be on Tuesday of each week, unless \n     otherwise directed by the Chairman.\n       (b) Additional Meetings.--Additional meetings and hearings \n     of the Committee may be called by the Chairman as he may deem \n     necessary. If at least three members of the Committee desire \n     that a special meeting of the Committee be called by the \n     Chairman, those members may file in the offices of the \n     Committee their written request to the Chairman for that \n     special meeting. Immediately upon filing of the request, the \n     Chief Clerk of the Committee shall notify the Chairman of the \n     filing of the request. If, within three calendar days after \n     the filing of the request, the Chairman does not call the \n     requested special meeting, to be held within seven calendar \n     days after the filing of the request, a majority of the \n     members of the Committee may file in the offices of the \n     Committee their written notice that a special meeting of the \n     Committee will be held, specifying the date and hour of that \n     special meeting. The Committee shall meet on that date and \n     hour. Immediately upon the filing of the notice, the Clerk \n     shall notify all members of the Committee that such special \n     meeting will be held and inform them of its date and hour.\n       (c) Hearings, Selection of Witnesses.--To ensure that the \n     issue which is the subject of the hearing is presented as \n     fully and fairly as possible, however, whenever a hearing is \n     conducted by the Committee or a subcommittee upon any measure \n     or matter, the Ranking Member of the Committee or \n     subcommittee may request that an equal number of public \n     witnesses selected by the Ranking Member be called to testify \n     at that hearing.\n       (d) Public Announcement.--The Committee, or any \n     subcommittee thereof, shall make public announcement of the \n     date, place, time, and subject matter of any meeting or \n     hearing to be conducted on any measure or matter at least one \n     week in advance of such meetings or hearings, unless the \n     Chairman of the Committee, or subcommittee, in \n     consultation with the Ranking Member, determines that \n     there is good cause to begin such meeting or hearing at an \n     earlier date.\n       (e) Procedure.--Insofar as possible, proceedings of the \n     Committee will be conducted without resort to the formalities \n     of parliamentary procedure and with due regard for the views \n     of all members. Issues of procedure which may arise from time \n     to time shall be resolved by decision of the Chairman, in \n     consultation with the Ranking Member. The Chairman, in \n     consultation with the Ranking Member, may also propose \n     special procedures to govern the consideration of particular \n     matters by the Committee.\n       (f) Closed Sessions.--Each meeting of the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations, or any subcommittee thereof, including \n     meetings to conduct hearings, shall be open to the public, \n     except that a meeting or series of meetings by the Committee \n     or a subcommittee on the same subject for a period of no more \n     than fourteen calendar days may be closed to the public on a \n     motion made and seconded to go into closed session to discuss \n     only whether the matters enumerated in paragraphs (1) through \n     (6) would require the meeting to be closed followed \n     immediately by a record vote in open session by a majority of \n     the members of the Committee or subcommittee when it is \n     determined that the matters to be discussed or the testimony \n     to be taken at such meeting or meetings--\n       (1) will disclose matters necessary to be kept secret in \n     the interests of national defense or the confidential conduct \n     of the foreign relations of the United States;\n       (2) will relate solely to matters of Committee staff \n     personnel or internal staff management or procedure;\n       (3) will tend to charge an individual with crime or \n     misconduct; to disgrace or injure the professional standing \n     of an individual, or otherwise to expose an individual to \n     public contempt or obloquy, or will represent a clearly \n     unwarranted invasion of the privacy of an individual;\n       (4) will disclose the identity of any informer or law \n     enforcement agent or will disclose any information relating \n     to the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense \n     that is required to be kept secret in the interests of \n     effective law enforcement;\n       (5) will disclose information relating to the trade secrets \n     or financial or commercial information pertaining \n     specifically to a given person if--\n       (A) an Act of Congress requires the information to be kept \n     confidential by Government officers and employees; or\n       (B) the information has been obtained by the Government on \n     a confidential basis, other than through an application by \n     such person for a specific Government financial or other \n     benefit, and is required to be kept secret in order to \n     prevent undue injury to the competitive position of such \n     person, or\n       (6) may divulge matters required to be kept confidential \n     under other provisions of law or Government regulations.\n       A closed meeting may be opened by a majority vote of the \n     Committee.\n       (g) Staff Attendance.--A member of the Committee may have \n     one member of his or her personal staff, for whom that member \n     assumes personal responsibility, accompany and be seated \n     nearby at Committee meetings.\n       Each member of the Committee may designate members of his \n     or her personal staff, who hold a Top Secret security \n     clearance, for the purpose of their eligibility to attend \n     closed sessions of the Committee, subject to the same \n     conditions set forth for Committee staff under Rules 12, 13, \n     and 14.\n       In addition, the Majority Leader and the Minority Leader of \n     the Senate, if they are not otherwise members of the \n     Committee, may designate one member of their staff with a Top \n     Secret security clearance to attend closed sessions of the \n     Committee, subject to the same conditions set forth for \n     Committee staff under Rules 12, 13, and 14. Staff of other \n     Senators who are not members of the Committee may not attend \n     closed sessions of the committee.\n       Attendance of Committee staff at meetings shall be limited \n     to those designated by the Staff Director or the Minority \n     Staff Director.\n       The Committee, by majority vote, or the Chairman, with the \n     concurrence of the Ranking Member, may limit staff attendance \n     at specified meetings.\n\n\n                            rule 4: quorums\n\n       (a) Testimony.--For the purpose of taking sworn or unsworn \n     testimony at any duly scheduled meeting a quorum of the \n     Committee and each subcommittee thereof shall consist of one \n     member.\n       (b) Business.--A quorum for the transaction of Committee or \n     subcommittee business, other than for reporting a measure or \n     recommendation to the Senate or the taking of testimony, \n     shall consist of one-third of the members of the Committee or \n     subcommittee, including at least one member from each party.\n       (c) Reporting.--A majority of the membership of the \n     Committee shall constitute a quorum for reporting any measure \n     of recommendation to the Senate. No measure or recommendation \n     shall be ordered reported from the Committee unless a \n     majority of the Committee members are physically present. The \n     vote of the Committee to report a measure or matter shall \n     require the concurrence of a majority of those members who \n     are physically present at the time the vote is taken.\n\n\n                            Rule 5: proxies\n\n       Proxies must be in writing with the signature of the absent \n     member. Subject to the requirements of Rule 4 for the \n     physical presence of a quorum to report a matter, proxy \n     voting shall be allowed on all measures and matters before \n     the Committee. However, proxies shall not be voted on a \n     measure or matter except when the absent member has been \n     informed of the matter on which he is being recorded and has \n     affirmatively requested that he or she be so recorded.\n\n\n                           Rule 6: witnesses\n\n       (a) General.--The Committee on Foreign Relations will \n     consider requests to testify on any matter or measure pending \n     before the Committee.\n       (b) Presentation.--If the Chairman so determines, the oral \n     presentation of witnesses shall be limited to 10 minutes. \n     However, written statements of reasonable length may be \n     submitted by witnesses and other interested persons who are \n     unable to testify in person.\n       (c) Filing of Statements.--A witness appearing before the \n     Committee, or any subcommittee thereof, shall file a written \n     statement of his proposed testimony at least 48 hours prior \n     to his appearance, unless this requirement is waived by the \n     Chairman and the Ranking Member following their determination \n     that there is good cause for failure to file such a \n     statement.\n       (d) Expenses.--Only the Chairman may authorize expenditures \n     of funds for the expenses of witnesses appearing before the \n     Committee or its subcommittees.\n       (e) Requests.--Any witness called for a hearing may submit \n     a written request to the Chairman no later than 24 hours in \n     advance for his testimony to be in closed or open session, or \n     for any other unusual procedure. The Chairman shall determine \n     whether to grant any such request and shall notify the \n     Committee members of the request and of his decision.\n\n\n                           Rule 7: subpoenas\n\n       (a) Authorization.--The Chairman or any other member of the \n     Committee, when authorized by a majority vote of the \n     Committee at a meeting or by proxies, shall have authority to \n     subpoena the attendance of witnesses or the production of \n     memoranda, documents, records, or any other materials. At the \n     request of any Member of the Committee, the Committee shall \n     authorize the issuance of a subpoena only at a meeting of the \n     Committee. When the Committee authorizes a subpoena, it may \n     be issued upon the signature of the Chairman or any other \n     member designated by the Committee.\n\n[[Page S1803]]\n\n       (b) Return.--A subpoena, or a request to an agency, for \n     documents may be issued whose return shall occur at a time \n     and place other than that of a scheduled Committee meeting. A \n     return on such a subpoena or request which is incomplete or \n     accompanied by an objection constitutes good cause for a \n     hearing on shortened notice. Upon such a return, the Chairman \n     or any other member designated by him may convene a hearing \n     by giving 2 hours notice by telephone to all other members. \n     One member shall constitute a quorum for such a hearing. The \n     sole purpose of such a hearing shall be to elucidate further \n     information about the return and to rule on the objection.\n       (c) Depositions.--At the direction of the Committee, staff \n     is authorized to take depositions from witnesses.\n\n\n                            Rule 8: Reports\n\n       (a) Filing.--When the Committee has ordered a measure or \n     recommendation reported, the report thereon shall be filed in \n     the Senate at the earliest practicable time.\n       (b) Supplemental, Minority and Additional Views.--A member \n     of the Committee who gives notice of his intentions to file \n     supplemental, minority, or additional views at the time of \n     final Committee approval of a measure or matter, shall be \n     entitled to not less than 3 calendar days in which to file \n     such views, in writing, with the chief clerk of the \n     Committee, with the 3 days to begin at 11:00 p.m. on the same \n     day that the Committee has ordered a measure or matter \n     reported. Such views shall then be included in the Committee \n     report and printed in the same volume, as a part thereof, and \n     their inclusion shall be noted on the cover of the report. In \n     the absences of timely notice, the Committee report may be \n     filed and printed immediately without such views.\n       (c) Rollcall Votes.--The results of all rollcall votes \n     taken in any meeting of the Committee on any measure, or \n     amendment thereto, shall be announced in the Committee \n     report. The announcement shall include a tabulation of the \n     votes cast in favor and votes cast in opposition to each such \n     measure and amendment by each member of the Committee.\n\n\n                            Rule 9: Treaties\n\n       (a) The Committee is the only Committee of the Senate with \n     jurisdiction to review and report to the Senate on treaties \n     submitted by the President for senate advice and consent. \n     Because the House of Representatives has no role in the \n     approval of treaties, the Committee is therefore the only \n     congressional committee with responsibility for treaties.\n       (b) Once submitted by the President for advice and consent, \n     each treaty is referred to the Committee and remains on its \n     calendar for Congress to Congress until the Committee takes \n     action to report it to the Senate or recommended its return \n     to the President, or until the Committee is discharged of the \n     treaty by the Senate.\n       (c) In accordance with Senate Rule XXX.2, treaties which \n     have been reported to the Senate but not acted on before the \n     end of a Congress ``shall be resumed at the commencement of \n     the next Congress as if no proceedings had previously been \n     had thereon.''\n       (d) Insofar as possible, the Committee should conduct a \n     public hearing on each treaty as soon as possible after its \n     submission by the President. Except in extraordinary \n     circumstances, treaties reported to the Senate shall be \n     accompanied by a written report.\n\n\n                          Rule 10: Nominations\n\n       (a) Waiting Requirement.--Unless otherwise directed by the \n     Chairman and the Ranking Member, the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations shall not consider any nomination until 6 calendar \n     days after it has been formally submitted to the Senate.\n       (b) Public Consideration.--Nominees for any post who are \n     invited to appear before the Committee shall be heard in \n     public session, unless a majority of the Committee decrees \n     otherwise.\n       (c) Required Data.--No nomination shall be reported to the \n     Senate unless (1) the nominee has been accorded a security \n     clearance on the basis of a thorough investigation by \n     executive branch agencies; (2) in appropriate cases, the \n     nominee has filed a financial disclosure report and a \n     confidential statement with the Committee; (3) the Committee \n     has been assured that the nominee does not have any interests \n     which could conflict with the interests of the government in \n     the exercise of the nominee's proposed responsibilities; (4) \n     for persons nominated to be chief of mission, ambassador-at-\n     large, or minister, the Committee has received a complete \n     list of any contributions made by the nominee or members of \n     his immediate family to any Federal election campaign during \n     the year of his or her nomination and for the 4 preceding \n     years; and (5) for persons nominated to be chiefs of mission, \n     a report on the demonstrated competence of that nominee to \n     perform the duties of the position to which he or she has \n     been nominated.\n\n\n                            Rule 11: Travel\n\n       (a) Foreign Travel.--No member of the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations or its staff shall travel abroad on Committee \n     business unless specifically authorized by the Chairman, who \n     is required by law to approve vouchers and report \n     expenditures of foreign currencies, and the Ranking Member. \n     Requests for authorization of such travel shall state the \n     purpose and, when completed, a full substantive and financial \n     report shall be filed with the Committee within 30 days. This \n     report shall be furnished to all members of the Committee and \n     shall not be otherwise disseminated without the express \n     authorization of the Committee. Except in extraordinary \n     circumstances, staff travel shall not be approved unless the \n     reporting requirements have been fulfilled for all prior \n     trips. Except for travel that is strictly personal, travel \n     funded by non-U.S. Government sources is subject to the same \n     approval and substantive reporting requirements as U.S. \n     Government-funded travel. In addition, members and staff are \n     reminded of Senate Rule XXXV.4 requiring a determination \n     by the Senate Ethics Committee in the case of foreign-\n     sponsored travel.\n       Any proposed travel by Committee staff for a subcommittee \n     purpose must be approved by the subcommittee chairman and \n     ranking member prior to submission of the request to the \n     Chairman and Ranking Member of the full Committee.\n       When the Chairman of the Ranking Member approve the foreign \n     travel of a member of the staff of the committee not \n     accompanying a member of the Committee, all members of the \n     Committee shall be advised, prior to the commencement of such \n     travel of its extent, nature, and purpose.\n       (b) Domestic Travel.--All official travel in the United \n     States by the Committee staff shall be approved in advance by \n     the Staff Director, or in the case of minority staff, by the \n     Minority Staff Director.\n       (c) Personal Staff.--As a general rule, no more than one \n     member of the personal staff of a member of the Committee may \n     travel with that member with the approval of the Chairman and \n     the Ranking Member of the Committee. During such travel, the \n     personal staff member shall be considered to be an employee \n     of that Committee.\n       (d) Personal Representatives of the Member (PRM).--For the \n     purposes of Rule 11 as regards staff foreign travel, the \n     officially-designated personal representative of the member \n     (PRM) shall be deemed to have the same rights, duties, and \n     responsibilities as members of the staff of the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations. Furthermore, for the purposes of this \n     section, each Member of the Committee may designate one \n     personal staff member as the ``Personal Representative of the \n     Member.''\n\n\n                          rule 12: transcripts\n\n       (a) General.--The Committee on Foreign Relations shall keep \n     verbatim transcripts of all Committee and subcommittee \n     meetings and such transcripts shall remain in the custody of \n     the Committee, unless a majority of the Committee decides \n     otherwise. Transcripts of public hearings by the Committee \n     shall be published unless the Chairman, with the concurrence \n     of the Ranking Member, determines otherwise.\n       (b) Classified or Restricted Transcripts.--\n       (1) The Chief Clerk of the Committee shall have \n     responsibility for the maintenance and security of classified \n     or restricted transcripts.\n       (2) A record shall be maintained of each use of classified \n     or restricted transcripts.\n       (3) Classified or restricted transcripts shall be kept in \n     locked combination safes in the Committee offices except when \n     in active use by authorized persons for a period not to \n     exceed 2 weeks. Extensions of this period may be granted as \n     necessary by the Chief Clerk. They must never be left \n     unattended and shall be returned to the Chief Clerk promptly \n     when no longer needed.\n       (4) Except as provided in paragraph 7 below, transcripts \n     classified secret or higher may not leave the Committee \n     offices except for the purposes of declassification.\n       (5) Classified transcripts other than those classified \n     secret or higher may leave the Committee offices in the \n     possession of authorized person with the approval of the \n     Chairman. Delivery and return shall be made only by \n     authorized persons. Such transcripts may not leave \n     Washington, DC, unless adequate assurances for their security \n     are made to the Chairman.\n       (6) Extreme care shall be exercised to avoid taking notes \n     or quotes from classified transcripts. Their contents may not \n     be divulged to any unauthorized person.\n       (7) Subject to any additional restrictions imposed by the \n     Chairman with the concurrence of the Ranking Member, only the \n     following persons are authorized to have access to classified \n     or restricted transcripts.\n       (i) Members and staff of the Committee in the Committee \n     rooms;\n       (ii) Designated personal representatives of members of the \n     Committee, and of the Majority and Minority Leaders, with \n     appropriate security clearances, in the Committee's Capitol \n     office;\n       (iii) Senators not members of the Committee, by permission \n     of the Chairman in the Committee rooms; and\n       (iv) Members of the executive departments involved in the \n     meeting, in the Committee's Capitol office, or, with the \n     permission of the Chairman, in the offices of the officials \n     who took part in the meeting, but in either case, only for a \n     specified and limited period of time, and only after reliable \n     assurances against further reproduction or dissemination have \n     been given.\n       (8) Any restrictions imposed upon access to a meeting of \n     the Committee shall also apply to the transcript of such \n     meeting, except by special permission of the Chairman and \n     notice to the other members of the Committee. Each transcript \n     of a closed session of the Committee shall include on its \n     cover a description of the restrictions imposed upon access, \n     as well as any applicable restrictions upon photocopying, \n     note-taking or other dissemination.\n\n[[Page S1804]]\n\n       (9) In addition to restrictions resulting from the \n     inclusion of any classified information in the transcript of \n     a Committee meeting, members and staff shall not discuss with \n     anyone the proceedings of the Committee in closed session or \n     reveal information conveyed or discussed in such a session \n     unless that person would have been permitted to attend the \n     session itself, or unless such communication is specifically \n     authorized by the Chairman, the Ranking Member, or in the \n     case of staff, by the Staff Director or Minority Staff \n     Director. A record shall be kept of all such authorizations.\n       (c) Declassification.--\n       (1) All restricted transcripts and classified Committee \n     reports shall be declassified on a date twelve years after \n     their origination unless the Committee by majority vote \n     decides against such declassification, and provided that the \n     executive departments involved and all former Committee \n     members who participated directly in the sessions or reports \n     concerned have been consulted in advance and given a \n     reasonable opportunity to raise objections to such \n     declassification.\n       (2) Any transcript or classified Committee report, or any \n     portion thereof, may be declassified fewer than twelve years \n     after their origination if:\n       (i) the Chairman originates such action or receives a \n     written request for such action, and notifies the other \n     members of the Committee;\n       (ii) the Chairman, Ranking Member, and each member or \n     former member who participated directly in such meeting or \n     report give their approval, except that the Committee by \n     majority vote may overrule any objections thereby raised to \n     early declassification; and\n       (iii) the executive departments and all former Committee \n     members are consulted in advance and have a reasonable \n     opportunity to object to early declassification.\n\n\n                      Rule 13: classified material\n\n       (a) All classified material received or originated by the \n     Committee shall be logged in at the Committee's offices in \n     the Dirksen Senate Office Building, and except for material \n     classified as ``Top Secret'' shall be filed in the Dirksen \n     Senate Building offices for Committee use and safekeeping.\n       (b) Each such piece of classified material received or \n     originated shall be card indexed and serially numbered, and \n     where requiring onward distribution shall be distributed by \n     means of an attached indexed form approved by the Chairman. \n     If such material is to be distributed outside the Committee \n     offices, it shall, in addition to the attached form, be \n     accompanied also by an approved signature sheet to show \n     onward receipt.\n       (c) Distribution of classified material among offices shall \n     be by Committee members of authorized staff only. All \n     classified material sent to members' offices, and that \n     distributed within the working offices of the committee, \n     shall be returned to the offices designated by the Chief \n     Clerk. No classified material is to be removed from the \n     offices of the members or of the Committee without permission \n     of the Chairman. Such classified material will be afforded \n     safe handling and safe storage at all times.\n       (d) Material classified ``Top Secret,'' after being indexed \n     and numbered shall be sent to the Committee's Capitol office \n     for use by the members and authorized staff in that office \n     only or in such other secure Committee offices as may be \n     authorized by the Chairman or staff Director.\n       (e) In general, members and staff undertake to confine \n     their access to classified information on the basis of a \n     ``need to know'' such information related to their Committee \n     responsibilities.\n       (f) The Staff Director is authorized to make such \n     administrative regulations as may be necessary to carry out \n     the provisions of these regulations.\n\n\n                             rule 14: staff\n\n       (a) Responsibilities.--\n       (1) The staff works for the Committee as a whole, under the \n     general supervision of the Chairman of the Committee, and the \n     immediate direction of the Staff Director; provided, however, \n     that such part of the staff as is designed minority Staff, \n     shall be under the general supervision of the Ranking Member \n     and under the immediate direction of the Minority Staff \n     Director.\n       (2) Any member of the Committee should feel free to call \n     upon the staff at any time for assistance in connection with \n     Committee business. Members of the Senate not members of the \n     Committee who call upon the staff for assistance from time to \n     time should be given assistance subject to the overriding \n     responsibility of the staff to the Committee.\n       (3) The staff's primary responsibility is with respect to \n     bills, resolutions, treaties, and nominations.\n       In addition to carrying out assignments from the Committee \n     and its individual members, the staff has a responsibility to \n     originate suggestions for committee or subcommittee \n     consideration. The staff also has a responsibility to make \n     suggestions to individual members regarding matters of \n     special interest to such members.\n       (4) It is part of the staff's duty to keep itself as well \n     informed as possible in regard to developments affecting \n     foreign relations and in regard to the administration of \n     foreign programs of the United States. Significant trends or \n     developments which might otherwise escape notice should be \n     called to the attention of the Committee, or of individual \n     Senators with particular interests.\n       (5) The staff shall pay due regard to the constitutional \n     separation of powers between the Senate and the executive \n     branch. It therefore has a responsibility to help the \n     Committee bring to bear an independent, objective judgment of \n     proposals by the executive branch and when appropriate to \n     originate sound proposals of its own. At the same time, the \n     staff shall avoid impinging upon the day-to-day conduct of \n     foreign affairs.\n       (6) In those instances when Committee action requires the \n     expression of minority views, the staff shall assist the \n     minority as fully as the majority to the end that all points \n     of view may be fully considered by members of the Committee \n     and of the Senate. The staff shall bear in mind that under \n     our constitutional system it is the responsibility of the \n     elected Members of the Senate to determine legislative issues \n     in the light of as full and fair a presentation of the facts \n     as the staff may be able to obtain.\n       (b) Restrictions.--\n       (1) The staff shall regard its relationship to the \n     Committee as a privileged one, in the nature of the \n     relationship of a lawyer to a client. In order to protect \n     this relationship and the mutual confidence which must \n     prevail if the Committee-staff relationship is to be a \n     satisfactory and fruitful one, the following criteria shall \n     apply:\n       (i) members of the staff shall not be identified with any \n     special interest group in the field of foreign relations or \n     allow their names to be used by any such group;\n       (ii) members of the staff shall not accept public speaking \n     engagements or write for publication in the field of foreign \n     relations without specific advance permission from the Staff \n     Director, or, in the case of minority staff, from the \n     Minority Staff Director. In the case of the Staff Director \n     and the Minority Staff Director, such advance permission \n     shall be obtained from the Chairman or the Ranking Member, as \n     appropriate. In any event, such public statements should \n     avoid the expression of personal views and should not contain \n     predictions of future, or interpretations of past, Committee \n     action; and\n       (iii) staff shall not discuss their private conversations \n     with members of the Committee without specific advance \n     permission from the Senator or Senators concerned.\n       (2) The staff shall not discuss with anyone the proceedings \n     of the Committee in closed session or reveal information \n     conveyed or discussed in such a session unless that person \n     would have been permitted to attend the session itself, or \n     unless such communication is specifically authorized by the \n     Staff Director or Minority Staff Director. Unauthorized \n     disclosure of information from a closed session or of \n     classified information shall be cause for immediate dismissal \n     and may, in the case of some kinds of information, be grounds \n     for criminal prosecution.\n\n\n                 rule 15: status and amendment of rules\n\n       (a) Status.--In addition to the foregoing, the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations is governed by the Standing Rules of the \n     Senate which shall take precedence in the event of a clear \n     inconsistency. In addition, the jurisdiction and \n     responsibilities of the Committee with respect to certain \n     matters, as well as the timing and procedure for their \n     consideration in Committee, may be governed by statute.\n       (b) Amendment.--These Rules may be modified, amended, or \n     repealed by a majority of the Committee, provided that a \n     notice in writing of the proposed change has been given to \n     each member at least 48 hours prior to the meeting at which \n     action thereon is to be taken. However, Rules of the \n     Committee which are based upon Senate Rules may not be \n     superseded by Committee vote alone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/30/senate-section/article/S1804-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1804-S1806]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RULES OF THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON AGING\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.

The Chairman shall circulate polling sheets \n     to each Member specifying the matter being polled and the \n     time limit for completion of the poll. If any Member so \n     requests in advance of the meeting, the matter shall be held \n     for meeting rather than being polled. The clerk shall keep a \n     record of polls, if the Chairman determines that the polled \n     matter is one of the areas enumerated in Rule II.3, the \n     record of the poll shall be confidential.

Any witness shall be afforded, \n     upon request, the right to review that portion of such \n     record, and for this purpose, a copy of a witness's testimony \n     in public or closed session shall be provided to the witness. \n     Upon inspecting his transcript, within a time limit set by \n     the committee clerk, a witness may request changes in \n     testimony to correct errors of transcription, grammatical \n     errors, and obvious errors of fact, the Chairman or a staff \n     officer designated by him shall rule on such request.\n       6. Impugned Persons. Any person who believes that evidence \n     presented, or comment made by a Member or staff, at a public \n     hearing or at a closed hearing concerning which there have \n     been public reports, tends to impugn his character or \n     adversely affect his reputation may:\n       (a) file a sworn statement of facts relevant to the \n     evidence or comment, which shall be placed in the hearing \n     record;\n       (b) request the opportunity to appear personally before the \n     Committee to testify in his own behalf; and\n       (c) submit questions in writing which he requests be used \n     for the cross-examination of other-witnesses called by the \n     Committee. The Chairman shall inform the committee of such \n     requests for appearance or cross-examination. If the \n     committee so decides; the requested questions, or paraphrased \n     versions or portions of them, shall be put to the other \n     witness by a Member or by staff.\n       7. Minority Witnesses. Whenever any hearing is conducted by \n     the Committee, the minority on the Committee shall be \n     entitled, upon request made by a majority of the minority \n     Members to the Chairman, to call witnesses selected by the \n     minority to testify or produce documents with respect to the \n     measure or matter under consideration during at least one day \n     of the hearing. Such request must be made before the \n     completion of the hearing or, if subpoenas are required to \n     call the minority witnesses, no later than three days before \n     the completion of the hearing.\n       8. Conduct of Witnesses, Counsel and Members of the \n     Audience. If, during public or executive sessions, a witness, \n     his counsel, or any spectator conducts himself in such a \n     manner as to prevent, impede, disrupt, obstruct, or interfere \n     with the orderly administration of such hearing the Chairman \n     or presiding Member of the Committee present during such \n     hearing may request the Sergeant at Arms of the Senate, his \n     representative or any law enforcement official to eject said \n     person from the hearing room.\n\n\n                    vi. depositions and commissions\n\n       1. Notice. Notices for the taking of depositions in an \n     investigation authorized by the Committee shall be authorized \n     and issued by the Chairman or by a staff officer designated \n     by him. Such notices shall specify a time and place for \n     examination, and the name of the staff officer or officers \n     who will take the deposition. Unless otherwise specified, \n     the deposition shall be in private. The Committee shall \n     not initiate procedures leading to criminal or civil \n     enforcement proceedings for a witness's failure to appear \n     unless the deposition notice was accompanied by a \n     Committee subpoena.\n       2. Counsel. Witnesses may be accompanied at a deposition by \n     counsel to advise them of their rights, subject to the \n     provisions of Rule V.4.\n       3. Procedure. Witnesses shall be examined upon oath \n     administered by an individual authorized by local law to \n     administer oaths. Questions shall be propounded orally by \n     Committee staff. Objections by the witnesses as to the form \n     of questions shall be noted by the record. If a witness \n     objects to a question and refuses to testify on the basis of \n     relevance or privilege, the Committee staff may proceed with \n     the deposition, or may at that time or at a subsequent time, \n     seek a ruling by telephone or otherwise on the objection from \n     a Member of the Committee. If the Member overrules the \n     objection, he may refer the matter to the Committee or he may \n     order and direct the witness to answer the question, but the \n     Committee shall not initiate the procedures leading to civil \n     or\n\n[[Page S1806]]\n\n     criminal enforcement unless the witness refuses to testify \n     after he has been ordered and directed to answer by a Member \n     of the Committee.\n       4. Filing. The Committee staff shall see that the testimony \n     is transcribed or electronically recorded. If it is \n     transcribed, the witness shall be furnished with a copy for \n     review. No later than five days thereafter, the witness shall \n     return a signed copy, and the staff shall enter the changes, \n     if any, requested by the witness in accordance with Rule V.6. \n     If the witness fails to return a signed copy, the staff shall \n     note on the transcript the date a copy was provided and the \n     failure to return it. The individual administering the oath \n     shall certify on the transcript that the witness was duly \n     sworn in his presence, the transcriber shall certify that the \n     transcript is a true record to the testimony, and the \n     transcript shall then be filed with the Committee clerk. \n     Committee staff may stipulate with the witness to changes in \n     this procedure; deviations from the procedure which do not \n     substantially impair the reliability of the record shall not \n     relieve the witness from his obligation to testify \n     truthfully.\n       5. Commissions. The Committee may authorize the staff, by \n     issuance of commissions, to fill in prepared subpoenas, \n     conduct field hearings, inspect locations, facilities, or \n     systems of records, or otherwise act on behalf of the \n     Committee.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor Susie \nRozetta Eades Douglas. Mrs. Douglas, 81, was a Cheyenne and Pawnee and \nenrolled member of the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes of Oklahoma. Her \ngreat-grandfather was Bull Bear, who was a Cheyenne peace chief, leader \nof the Dog Men Society, and the first signatory to the Medicine Lodge \nCreek Treaty of 1867. Her grandfather, Thunderbird--Richard Davis--and \nartist and writer, is credited with preserving valuable ceremonial \ninformation at a time when the Sun Dance and other Cheyenne ceremonies \nwere outlawed.\n  Born in Pawnee, Oklahoma, on July 2, 1921, to Richenda Aspenall Davis \nEades and Joseph Cleveland Eades, Sr., she was raised in El Reno, \nOklahoma, graduated from Chilocco Indian School in 1940, and earned an \nassociate degree in business from Haskell Institute in Lawrence, KS, \nClass of 1943.\n  Homemaker and Eastern Star, she was a Quilting Society member and an \nactive volunteer worker for the Democratic Party. As an Army wife, she \ntraveled extensively and lived in Oahu, Hawaii, and Naples, Italy, \nbefore settling into her longtime home in San Antonio, Texas.\n  She passed away in San Antonio on January 21, from pneumonia and \ncomplications of diabetes and Alzheimer's disease, and was buried on \nJanuary 25 at the Cheyenne Arapaho Cemetery in Concho, Oklahoma.\n  She is survived by her husband of nearly 59 years, Freeland Edward \nDouglas, Hodulgee Muscogee; their daughter Suzan Shown Harjo and son \nDennis Gene Douglas; and a host of grandchildren and \ngreatgrandchildren. Her daughter says Mrs. Douglas was her inspiration \nfor work on the American Indian Religious Freedom Act and sacred lands \nprotection and repatriation laws.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/30/senate-section/article/S1806-2", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1806]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 IN MEMORY OF CHRISTOPHER JAMES CANNING\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nChristopher J. Canning, who died June 30, 2001, at the young age of 15.\n  Chris was from Maroa, IL, and excelled as an athlete in sports such \nas football, basketball, and baseball. Chris also excelled in the \nmartial arts, where he was a multi-state and national champion, an \n``AAU All American,'' and a member of the U.S. Elite team at the \nOlympic training center. Chris and his legacy as a martial artist will \nlive on through the United States National AAU Taekwondo Chris Canning \nAward of Excellence, established in July 2002. This award is given to \none athlete out of 14,000 at the U.S. National Championships.\n  Chris was also an honor student who appreciated reading, math and \nmusic. Chris enjoyed playing classical piano, and also played the drums \nfor his school. Chris liked to read books outside of what was required \nfor school. He liked to be challenged in many different subject areas.\n  Chris was drawn toward community and public service. Chris was also \nknown to protect kids at school from the local bullies. He helped \npeople less fortunate than himself by shoveling snow for the elderly \nwithout pay, collecting food and clothing for the homeless in Decatur \non his own, and helping to deliver meals on wheels for those confined \nto home. He would always find ways to help others, and to find homes \nfor abandoned animals through working at his grandparents' animal \nshelter. Looking to the future, he aspired to be in our Nation's \nSpecial Forces or to serve in the FBI.\n  I also want to give special recognition to Chris's family who are \nstill mourning his tragic loss. His father and mother, Art and Melissa \nCanning, his brother and sister, Robert and Elizabeth, and finally his \ngrandparents Marla and Joe Powers.\n  In short, Christopher J. Canning was a caring young man, a good \ncitizen, an asset in his academic environment, and a nationally \nacclaimed athlete. Tragically, Chris's life was cut short.\n  The memory of Chris Canning lives on, and today I pay tribute to a \nyoung man who had so much promise as an athlete, student, martial \nartist, community servant, and son. His example will always be an \ninspiration to those who follow in his footsteps.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/30/senate-section/article/S1806-3", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1806-S1807]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING PATRICK GROSS\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the career \nof Patrick Gross, a dedicated public servant and an outstanding former \nmember of my staff. He will be ending his career as the community \ndevelopment program director for USDA rural development in South \nDakota. As USDA's rural development community development program \ndirector, Pat has been a model for other dedicated and talented South \nDakotans to emulate and an invaluable asset to everyone who had the \nhonor of working with him.\n  As an original member of my staff, during my first term in the House \nof Representatives, Pat played an essential role in the development and \ncreation of my congressional offices in South Dakota. As my first State \ndirector, Pat laid the groundwork for future members of my State staff \nto follow. A leader in State economic and rural development, both \nconstituents and staff members often turned to Pat for his leadership \nand wealth of knowledge.\n  An avid outdoorsman and advocate for rural development, Pat was well \nprepared for a position as my State economic development director. \nPat's work on natural resource initiatives, land management concerns, \nand economic development projects, benefited countless South Dakotans. \nI could not have asked for a more reliable and dedicated individuals to \nhead the direction of my State offices.\n  As community development program director, Pat oversaw special \ninitiatives including the Oglala Sioux Tribe\n\n[[Page S1807]]\n\nEmpowerment Zone, Beadle and Spink Enterprise Community, four Champion \nCommunities, and public information activities for USDA rural \ndevelopment. He served on the senior management team for USDA rural \ndevelopment in South Dakota and is the recipient of the 1999 USDA Road \nWarrior Award. He served as chairman of the South Dakota Rural \nDevelopment Council and also served USDA on several national \ncommittees. Pat led the process for a 5-year strategic plan for rural \ndevelopment in South Dakota, which included strategic planning \nprocesses for eight American Indian tribes. He shared responsibilities \nin the Federal/private collaboration that planned and developed the \nSuAnne Big Crow Youth Wellness Project on the Pine Ridge Indian \nReservation in South Dakota.\n  Pat will be greatly missed at the USDA rural development in South \nDakota, and I wish Pat, his wife Donna, and their family all the best \nin the days to come. They are good friends, and I look forward to \nspending time with them in the future. It is an honor for me to share \nPat's accomplishments with my colleagues and to publicly commend his \noutstanding services to my office and the people of South \nDakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/30/senate-section/article/S1807-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1807]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         A SALUTE TO PHIL WARD\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise on the floor today to express \nmy deep appreciation for Phil Ward's service as director of the Oregon \nDepartment of Agriculture. As a Senator and as someone who has made his \nliving from the land, I can say that Phil's time as director \ndemonstrated a clear understanding not only of the land, but also the \npeople who rely on it for their livelihood.\n  By trade, Phil Ward is both a farmer and a teacher. Both professions \nrequire a great deal of patience and perspective, and Phil has \nadmirably displayed these virtues as ODA director. Producers respect \nPhil because of the time he has personally spent with them and his \nconstant call for balance in natural resources policy.\n  Since he was appointed by the Governor in 1999, Phil guided the \ndepartment as it dealt with a growing number of challenges facing \nOregon agriculture. The collapse of the Asian market and implementation \nof S. 1010 are two prime examples. Phil was also a regional leader, \nserving as president of the Western Association of State Departments of \nAgriculture, played a prominent role in the National Association of \nState Departments of Agriculture, and was extensively involved in \ntrilateral accord discussions with Canada and Mexico on agricultural \nissues.\n  Phil Ward has also been a great advocate for Oregon agriculture in \ndealing with the Federal Government. His agency successfully took over \nresponsibility from the Environmental Protection Agency for \nimplementing water quality standards for CAFOs. Phil and the ODA also \nworked closely with me and my office in ensuring that the 2002 farm \nbill was a hand up to the vast array of Oregon farm producers \nstruggling through drought, low commodity prices, and increasing \nregulatory obligations.\n  One of the things I admire most about Phil Ward is that his service \nto Oregon always rose above partisan politics and he stood tall for \nOregon's farmers and ranchers when they needed him on their side. On \nbehalf of myself and Oregon's agricultural community, I thank Phil Ward \nfor his dedicated service to Oregon, for his years of counsel to me, \nand to wish him all the best in his future pursuits.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/30/senate-section/article/S1807-2", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1807]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   TRIBUTE TO UCONN HUSKIES WOMEN'S BASKETBALL RECORD-BREAKING STREAK\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, it's my pleasure to rise in \ntribute to the University of Connecticut Huskies women's basketball \nteam, which on Saturday, January 18, made Division I history by winning \ntheir 55th consecutive game. In doing so, they surpassed the 54-game \nstreak set by Louisiana Tech between 1980 and 1982 and delighted fans \nall across my state.\n  Fifty-five straight wins would be an incredible accomplishment in any \nsport at any time. But it's especially impressive in women's college \nbasketball today, because this is an era of true parity in the sport. \nThere are so many strong teams able to compete with and, on any given \nnight, beat a great team like the Huskies. But the Huskies keep on \nworking, and they keep on winning. At home and on the road, in blowouts \nand in squeakers. Sometimes they win with defense. Sometimes with 3-\npoint shooting. Sometimes with pure hustle. But they always find a way.\n  It's no wonder the Huskies have an admirer in legendary UCLA coach \nJohn Wooden, whose UCLA men's basketball teams in the early 70s set an \nall-time Division I record with 88 straight wins. Coach Wooden said of \nwhat the Huskies have accomplished, ``It's a tremendous feat in any \nera. I think they play the pure game, more so than the men. The best \ncollege basketball in my opinion is played by the better women's \nteams.''\n  Of course, last year the very best team in the nation was UConn, \nwhich racked up a perfect 39-0 season en route to the national \nchampionship. The players on that team, led by All-American seniors Sue \nBird, Tamika Williams, Swin Cash and Asjha Jones built the bulk of this \nrecord streak.\n  And this season, a team led by All-American junior Diana Taurasi and \nmany terrific young players is in the hunt for the championship again. \nThere will be many tough games to play. Just this Monday, January 20, \nthey matched up against Notre Dame and extended the streak to 56. And \non February 1st, they will play Duke, now ranked first in the country.\n  Competition isn't about perfection. It's about perseverance. I'm \nreminded of the words of Michael Jordan, who said, ``I have missed more \nthan 9,000 shots in my career. I have lost almost 300 games. On 26 \noccasions I have been entrusted to take the game winning shot . . . and \nI missed. I have failed over and over and over again in my life. And \nthat's precisely why I succeed.'' So even if, if, the team should lose \nsomeday, the real measure of their character will be how they bounce \nback, what they learn, how they become an even better team because of \nit.\n  So much of the credit for this team's success goes to coach Geno \nAuriemma, who has built the best program in the nation during his 18 \nyears in Storrs. Assistant Coach Chris Dailey has also played a pivotal \npart in the remarkable run. The Huskies have won three national \nchampionships over the last seven years. They have made 14 straight \nNCAA tournament appearances and won a combined 23 Big East regular and \ntournament championships. Over the last three years, they've amassed an \nastounding 123-4 record.\n  I wish them luck in the weeks and months to come as they seek to \nextend the streak further. This has been a month of history in women's \ncollege basketball. Tennessee coach Pat Summit just won her 800th game, \nand the Huskies won their 55th straight victory. It's a golden time for \nthe sport, and for all the fans who love it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/30/senate-section/article/S1807-3", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1807-S1808]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   RECOGNIZING DR. JAMES MONTGOMERY OF ROSWELL, NM, AND THE NATIONAL \n                         WILDLIFE REFUGE SYSTEM\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise before you today not only \nto recognize the dedication and hard work of a fellow New Mexican, but \nto celebrate a century of conservation by the National Wildlife Refuge \nSystem.\n  On February 1 of this year, the man I honor today, Dr. James \nMontgomery of Roswell, NM, will receive the 2003 Refuge Volunteer of \nthe Year award offered by the National Wildlife Refuge Association. \nThis award is given to an individual who displays outstanding \ndedication to the preservation and advancement of the national refuge \nsystem and its endeavors to protect the beauty of the American \nlandscape.\n  Dr. Montgomery has spent the last 15 years and given more than 10,000 \nhours of service protecting and improving the Bitter Lake National \nWildlife Refuge in Roswell. He has done this for no compensation, \nmotivated only by his concern and appreciation of the refuge. During \nhis work, Dr. Montgomery played an integral role in many important \nprojects, including: spearheading efforts to maintain and establish \nspecies on the refuge; providing support to community outreach and \nevents service; and assisting refuge staff in their budget process. Dr. \nMontgomery also holds the position of treasurer for the\n\n[[Page S1808]]\n\nFriends of Bitter Lake nonprofit organization. Clearly his work on \nbehalf of the refuge sustains the accessibility and natural beauty of \none of New Mexico's treasures.\n  Bitter Lake is one of the 540 sites comprising the National Wildlife \nRefuge System and one of seven in New Mexico, Bitter Lake, Bosque del \nApache, Grulla, Las Vegas, Maxwell, San Andres, and Sevillita. On these \n540 refuges, 30,000 hard-working men and women annually donate more \nthan 1 million hours of their time to protect, maintain, and improve \nour Nation's environmental resources. Given the impressive number of \nindividuals worthy of praise, it gives me great pride as a New Mexican \nthat Dr. James Montgomery has been chosen for this honor.\n  President Bush, in his State of the Union Address, spoke of building \na more compassionate America; an America energized by individuals such \nas Dr. Montgomery who dedicate great portions of their lives to the \ngenerous spirit that has made this country great. Whether that spirit \nbe embodied by volunteers who assist those in need, or by those who \nwork to ensure that our natural wonders are preserved, all are \nnecessary and vital to our existence as Americans.\n  Furthermore, it wouldn't do to discuss Dr. Montgomery without \nmentioning the program for which he has tirelessly worked. This March \nwe celebrate a milestone in American wildlife conservation: the 100th \nAnniversary of the National Wildlife Refuge System. This momentous \noccasion is worthy of recognition because over the past century, normal \ncitizens, along with the refuge system, have been at the forefront in \nprotecting the unique beauty of the American landscape.\n  The National Wildlife Refuge System protects a wide range of wildlife \nand landscapes throughout the country. In particular, the refuges in \nthe Southwest are necessary to secure the well being and survival of \nmigratory birds, including the bald eagle, which make the area their \nhome during the fall and winter months. The system concentrates also on \nscientific endeavors that span such fields as habitat alteration and \nbiodiversity research. These efforts coincide with maintaining places \nof unspoiled natural beauty that can be enjoyed by all Americans.\n  New Mexico is privileged to have some of the most beautiful natural \nwonders within this great Nation. Wildlife refuges such as Bitter Lake \nin Roswell and Bosque del Apache in Socorro are perfect examples of the \n100 years of success by the refuge system in ensuring the treasures of \nour environment are preserved and enjoyed for generations. Of course, \nthe success would not be as great without the hard work, passion, and \nsacrifice of those dedicated volunteers like Dr. James Montgomery.\n  To that end I salute the National Wildlife Refuge System for its many \nsuccesses and Dr. James Montgomery for embodying the great spirit of \ncharity and volunteerism that America cherishes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/30/senate-section/article/S1808-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1808]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               PRIME MINISTER HUN SEN TO BLAME FOR RIOTS\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Cambodia charade continues.\n  Recent riots in that Southeast Asian country--reportedly sparked by \nunfounded rumors of Thai slights against Khmer culture and history--\ncaused extensive damage to Thai-owned businesses and property in Phnom \nPenh and the storming, looting, and destruction of the Thai Embassy. \nThe failure of the Cambodian Government to defend Thai diplomats and \nthe embassy compound from rioters is unacceptable, particularly in the \npost September 11 security environment. Further, the exploitation of \nthe rumor by Prime Minister Hun Sen is as reckless as it is \nirresponsible.\n  In the aftermath of these riots, I have heard credible reports that \ndemocratic opposition and human rights activists are being targeted for \nintimidation and arrest. Given his tendency toward paranoia and \nviolence, I do not doubt for an instant that these riots were staged by \nHun Sen as, among other things, a pretext to crackdown on the \ndemocratic opposition in the run up to the July parliamentary \nelections.\n  Over the next few days, it is imperative that the international \ncommunity not be duped by Hun Sen and the Cambodian Government into \nlaying blame for the riots on the democratic opposition. It is time to \nhelp the Royal Government of Thailand to hold Hun Sen and the Cambodian \ngovernment accountable for the destruction of property, the violation \nof democratic principles, and the damage to relations with its western \nneighbor.\n  The Cambodian authorities allowed the situation outside the Thai \nEmbassy to escalate out of control. Riot and military police did \nnothing to maintain law and order until after extensive damage had been \ndone throughout the capital. It is a simple and tragic fact that the \nCambodian Government permitted this attack to take place. Their \ninaction during the riots stands in stark contrast to the brutal \ntreatment illegal logging protesters received at the hands of the \npolice a few short weeks ago.\n  The riots must serve as a wake-up call to complacent diplomats in \nPhnom Penh. As there is no law and order in Cambodia, your embassy \ncould be next. I have not forgotten that in the mid-1990s Hun Sen \nthreatened that Cambodians might ``storm'' the American and French \nembassies; unfortunately his warnings came true for Thailand.\n  With parliamentary elections scheduled for July, diplomats in \nCambodia ought to be scrambling to protect and defend the rights of the \ndemocratic opposition to unseat Cambodia's unstable and violent \ndictator through peaceful and credible polls.\n  Cambodians can thank Prime Minister Hun Sen for chasing away foreign \ninvestors and tourists. This recent charade only underscores that he \nand the CPP are part of Cambodia's problems, and not part of the \nsolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/30/senate-section/article/S1808-2", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1808]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  PERIODIC REPORT ON THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO IRAQ--PM 4\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n\n  As required by section 401(c) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 \nU.S.C. 1641(c), and section 204(c) of the International Emergency \nEconomic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(c), I am providing a 6-month \nperiodic report prepared by my Administration on the national emergency \nwith respect to Iraq that was declared in Executive Order 12722 of \nAugust 2, 1990.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide that \nremarriage of the surviving spouse of a deceased veteran after age 55 \nshall not result in termination of dependency and indemnity \ncompensation otherwise payable to that surviving spouse; to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, today my colleague Senator Kay Bailey \nHutchison and I are reintroducing a bill that will help repay our \nNation's debt to the Gold Star Wives of America.\n  This bill corrects a long-standing disparity and would finally allow \nthe widows of veterans who remarry after the age of 55 to continue to \nreceive Dependency and Indemnity Compensation. The Gold Star Wives of \nAmerica brought this matter to our attention. We are tremendously \ngrateful to them for working with us on this important bill. At this \ntime in our Nation's history, when our brave men and women in uniform \nare putting their lives on the line in Afghanistan and elsewhere around \nthe world, it is especially important to recognize the wives and \nfamilies of those who have already served their country so proudly.\n  This benefit covers the surviving dependents of members of the Armed \nForces who have died in active duty or of a service-connected cause. \nCurrently, it is the only Federal annuity program that does not permit \na widow who receives compensation to retain her benefits if she \nremarries after the age of 55. It is time for this policy to change.\n  By eliminating this marriage penalty, our bill will continue to \nprovide these women the help some need to make ends meet, and will \nallow them to live their lives to the fullest. Discouraging marriage \nafter the age of 55 by making marriage financially burdensome is not \nthe way to show our appreciation for their sacrifice. Many people live \non fixed incomes and rely on Dependency and Indemnity Compensation to \nhelp pay their bills.\n  Under our bill, these widows would not be denied their benefits. I \nurge my colleagues to support this important legislation. It is time \nfor these inequities to be addressed, so that these women can continue \nto receive the benefits they deserve, and also be permitted to \nexperience again the profound meaning and happiness that marriage \nbrings.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill, to amend title 38, \nUnited States Code, to provide that remarriage of the surviving spouse \nof a deceased veteran after age 55 shall not result in termination of \ndependency and indemnity compensation otherwise payable to that \nsurviving spouse, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 249\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. RETENTION OF DEPENDENCY AND INDEMNITY COMPENSATION \n                   FOR SURVIVING SPOUSES REMARRYING AFTER AGE 55.\n\n       (a) Exception to Termination of Benefits Upon Remarriage.--\n     Section 103(d)(2)(B) of title 38, United States Code, is \n     amended by inserting ``1311 or'' after ``under section''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall take effect on--\n       (1) the first day of the first month that begins after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act; or\n       (2) the first day of the fiscal year that begins in the \n     calendar year in which this Act is enacted, if later than the \n     date specified in paragraph (1).\n       (c) Retroactive Benefits Prohibited.--No benefit may be \n     paid to any person by reason of the amendment made by \n     subsection (a) for any period before the effective date \n     specified in subsection (b).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN:\n  S. 250. A bill to address the international HIV/AIDS pandemic; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to draw the attention of the \nSenate and those following this proceeding to a global emergency many \nof us believe the last Congress did not adequately address.\n  Imagine the public reaction that would ensue if every year the United \nStates lost a population the size of the city of Chicago to HIV/AIDS-\nrelated deaths; if every year the United States lost the number of \nchildren equal to the population of this city, Washington, DC, to HIV/\nAIDS-related deaths. This is the reality the world faces.\n  Imagine how bad the situation would have to be in the United States \nfor the public to accept an HIV-positive muppet on Sesame Street, the \npopular television show geared to little kids ages 2 to 4. This is the \nreality of children's TV in South Africa.\n  In 2001, 662,000 children lost either one or both parents to AIDS in \nSouth Africa.\n  In 2002, 3 million children, defined as 15 years of age or younger, \nwere reported to be living with AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa; 800,000 \nchildren worldwide were newly infected with HIV last year.\n  Last weekend I went with several of my colleagues to Haiti. The \nreason for that trip had a lot to do with a well-known rock singer \nnamed Bono whose group U2 is legendary in rock-and-roll history. But he \nhas taken on a special mission, not only to make music, but to make the \nworld more aware of the HIV/AIDS crisis. He is a very likable fellow. \nHe has been a great lobbyist. This Irishman comes to Capitol Hill and \nopens every door.\n  In my office, when he came to see me, I couldn't get over how many of \nmy staffers took a great interest in HIV/AIDS just to be in the room \nwhen he sat down and talked about it. He has done such spectacular work \nwith Democrats and Republicans, the executive branch, and the \nlegislative branch. Then he had a tour, which was scheduled about 2 or \n3 months ago, in the Midwest. The tour was really to speak to the \nheartland of America about this issue of HIV/AIDS. He came to my City \nof Chicago. I was proud to meet with him and a group of African \nAmerican clergy.\n  Then he went out to a very conservative piece of real estate near the \nCity of Chicago, the great Wheaton College. Wheaton College was where \nBilly Graham took his training before he went into the ministry. \nWheaton College has a reputation of being pretty conservative, high-\nminded in their values, dedicated to their religion and their belief. \nAnd they invited him, this outspoken Irishman, to speak to them about \nHIV/AIDS. It was a great presentation.\n  At the very end there was some music, but most of it was very serious \nin that people talked about their life experiences. The thing I \nnoticed, as the presentation was made, was that one of the doctors \nsaid: You Americans tend to want to look across the ocean for HIV/AIDS. \nYou have it here in the United States, and don't forget it. But you \nalso have it in your hemisphere in Haiti in a way that most people \ndon't even appreciate.\n  Last weekend I traveled to Haiti with several of my colleagues, \nincluding Senator Bill Nelson of Florida. But the leader of our codel \nwas Senator Mike DeWine, a Republican of Ohio, and his wife Fran. Let \nme just say something for a moment about Mike DeWine. Mike and I had \nbeen friends since we were both elected to the House 20 years ago. He \nleft for a period of time and ran for Lieutenant Governor of Ohio, then \ncame back as a Senator from that State.\n  Most people don't know Mike and his wife and family have a particular \ninterest and dedication to Haiti and the poor people who live there. \nThis trip was their eleventh trip to Haiti. Many Members of Congress \nare lucky to go to the same place far away once or twice in a lifetime. \nThink about the fact that Mike and Fran, people on their staff, \ncontinue to return to one of the poorest places on earth over and over \nand over again. It isn't just to take photographs. In fact, they do \nvery little of that. It is to bring bags of toys and soccer balls, \nbasic items, medical and otherwise, that the poorest people in our \nhemisphere need, to visit programs like one called Hands Together. \nHands Together is something I never heard of before I got to Haiti, but \nI met Father Tom Hagan, who is the leader of Hands Together in Haiti, \nand Doug Campbell, his executive director, and they showed us a center \nwhich they have created in\n\n[[Page S1815]]\n\none of the poorest slums on earth. It is called Cite Soleil. My French \ntranslation would be Sun City. But it is not always sunny in this city \nfor the tens of thousands who live in the worst poverty.\n\n  They created this little school and community center to teach \nchildren how to read and write on the condition that their parents also \ncome in and learn. They provide basic food for these children. They \ninvite in senior citizens who come in for the only meal of the day that \nis worthwhile, and they try to give them some encouragement and maybe \nsome basic things they need to survive.\n  They told us a story about the senior citizens being brought to the \ncenter. There is no place for them to go in this terrible slum. When \nthey first started bringing them in, most were brought in in \nwheelbarrows. They could barely walk. The life expectancy in Haiti is \n51 years of age. If you are 60 or 70--I met people who are even older--\nit is a rarity, but you obviously have some good genetics. But they \nwere still struggling.\n  At their center with Hands Together they offered these senior \ncitizens a basic meal. I saw it. It was beans and rice with a few \nlittle peppers on the top of it, and a vitamin pill. In a matter of \nweeks, these same elderly people, who could barely walk and were \nbrought in in wheelbarrows, were up and moving around, thanks to Hands \nTogether and to Father Hagan.\n  There is also the center where the kids are educated, called the \nBecky DeWine Center, named after Mike and Fran's late daughter. It is \nwonderful to see those children come in in their uniforms, 6 days a \nweek. They want to be there, learning.\n  The reason I tell you this as background is that amidst all this \npoverty, Haiti faces an AIDS epidemic which is unparalleled in our \nhemisphere. When Bono visited Wheaton College, he said to the students: \nThis is a global crisis. It is in our backyard in the Caribbean. It is \nall across Africa. It is moving across India and Russia and China. We \nhave to do something about it.\n  It was that piece of information that led me to go to Haiti. I am \nglad I did. We set up a meeting at the ambassador's residence. \nAmbassador Brian D. Curran is our career ambassador. Previously he had \nbeen the ambassador to Mozambique. He let us meet with Bill Pape, who \nis known as ``Dr. Pop'' in the French pronunciation. What an impressive \nman. Here was a man who told us how he had decided as a public health \nleader in one of the poorest countries to try to eliminate the deaths \nof children, infants, from diarrhea, a terrible problem in the Third \nWorld. These poor children, who drink water that is contaminated, get \nsick with diarrhea and throwing up, become dehydrated and die.\n  They put together a program that has virtually eliminated that as a \nchallenge in Haiti. I am impressed. That is a big undertaking, and a \nlot of success was demonstrated. Now Dr. Pape and his organization, \nknown as GHESKIO, an organization that is one of the earliest in terms \nof commitment to dealing with HIV and AIDS, have received a $10 \nmillion-plus grant from the Global AIDS Fund to take on the AIDS \nepidemic in Haiti. Already he is able to demonstrate on the chart that \njust their first year or two of activity, the AIDS rate of infection is \nstarting to come down ever so gradually. He believes he is on the right \ncourse to deal with this epidemic.\n  Do you know where the Global AIDS Fund money comes from? Some of it \ncomes from us, taxpayers who contribute to the Global AIDS Fund. As we \ncontribute and he is successful, fewer children are infected; fewer \nchildren are orphaned. There is more hope for their future.\n  I left that visit to Haiti inspired again, as I am every time I visit \nsome of the poorest places in the world. You might think it is \ndepressing to see people living in the worst squalor imaginable, to see \nthem holding beautiful little babies as they stand right next to open \nsewers that pigs are rooting through, to see dogs that are so skinny \nthey can barely walk, to see the living conditions which are so \nhorrible. You would think that would be so depressing, but you will \nfind in every one of these places stories of courage, not just the \nmothers and fathers struggling to keep the family together, but people \nlike Father Tom Hagan and Hands Together and Doug Campbell who come \ninto that setting and say: Let us help.\n  There are many others. I just mentioned Hands Together. There is \nWorld Vision, CARE, Catholic Relief Services. The list goes on. Thank \ngoodness they are there. I am glad I had a chance to see it.\n  When we came back here to Washington, I came back with a renewed \ndedication and determination to really work on this issue of global \nAIDS.\n  Today, I am introducing the Global Coordination of HIV/AIDS Response \nAct. The 107th Congress failed to pass AIDS authorizing legislation. We \nshould have. President Bush has said in his State of the Union Address \nthat AIDS will be a top priority in terms of global health.\n  I am a proud Democrat. I take exception to many things this President \nhas done. Let me be the first to stand up and cheer President George W. \nBush. That was the right thing to do. That is the right thing for \nAmerica to do. I will be standing by his side whenever he needs me. I \nhope we all join him. The United States should lead the world in \nfighting this epidemic.\n  The President said he is going to commit $15 billion over the next 5 \nyears to his new emergency plan for AIDS relief. He said only $10 \nbillion of this is new funds. We need to sit down with OMB and see what \nthat actually means. The funding sources may be somewhat blurry, but \nthe commitment was made, and that is a wonderful step forward.\n  I also want to say that the Secretary of State, Colin Powell, has \nbeen an exceptional leader on this issue. He has taken grief for it \nbecause it involves some issues of controversy here in the United \nStates.\n  Uganda--where I visited several years ago--successfully fought the \nAIDS epidemic with what they call the ABC plan, a public health \neducation plan which doesn't have a lot of money for wonder drugs, but \nit has a lot of determination and resources dedicated to fighting AIDS. \nThe ABC plan is very basic in countries with limited education, limited \nresources: A, abstinence when it comes to sexual activities; B, to be \nfaithful to one partner; C, if you are going to ignore the other two, \nuse a condom. It is that simple.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has exceeded the 10-minute limit.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Secretary of State Colin Powell has been open and candid \nabout using all of these things to deal with AIDS. When I told him \nSenator Mike DeWine and I had been successful on the Senate floor in \nputting in $180 billion more on the global AIDS fight, a big smile \ncrossed his face.\n  Today, 42 million people worldwide are living with HIV/AIDS--5 \nmillion were newly infected last year. We have seen 3.1 million AIDS-\nrelated deaths in 2002. Each year, AIDS deaths claim more than the \nentire population of Chicago. Life expectancy has dropped below 40 \nyears of age in 10 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. AIDS has already \nerased 15 years of progress in the worse affected countries. Despite \nour efforts to date, this epidemic continues its deadly spread across \nthe globe. As the disease spreads, unraveling social structures and \ndecimating populations, the national security implications for the \nUnited States multiply--in number as well as intensity.\n  Last year, the National Intelligence Council released a report \nsupplying grave statistics for ``the next wave.'' In 5 of the world's \nmost populous countries, the number of HIV-infected people will grow \nfrom 14 million to 23 million currently to an estimated 50 million to \n75 million by 2010.\n  The disease infiltrates national armies, as well as the public \nsector, weakening the country's ability to govern and respond to \nregional threats. As the number of infections grows, the cost of \nfighting HIV/AIDS overwhelms national governments and competes for the \nsame funds they need to maintain their economy and basic social \nstructure.\n  Most governments face a lose-lose situation: Either they fight AIDS \nand underfund the infrastructures necessary to sustain continued \nimmunity, or they continue to build the infrastructures while HIV/AIDS \ndecimates\n\n[[Page S1816]]\n\nany progress, and they fall victim to it and watch their state crumble.\n  On every continent, AIDS is traveling along social fault lines and \nexploiting the weaknesses, hurting both lives and economies.\n  HIV/AIDS is a national security issue that is as important to our \ntime as the war on terrorism. It is an economic issue, a health and \nsafety issue, and it is a moral issue. Without comprehensive action, \nthe HIV/AIDS epidemic will worsen, demanding even more attention and \nfunding. That is why I introduce this bill to reset global AIDS as a \ntop priority in this Congress.\n  The main purpose of the bill is to provide a comprehensive response \nto the AIDS pandemic and acknowledge the growing need for resources. In \nthe form of specialized initiatives, my bill will focus on the growing \nnumber of AIDS orphans, the lack of health professionals in AIDS-\nravaged countries, and the lack of access to affordable treatment for \nthe majority of those afflicted with HIV/AIDS.\n  I have designed the Global CARE Act to achieve four major goals: \nBetter coordination of our own agencies in fighting global AIDS; the \nprovision of programs that address all components necessary to support \na comprehensive response to HIV/AIDS, including prevention, treatment, \ncare, and investment in broader health systems and national economies; \nincreased accountability for the health and policy objectives we will \nseek to achieve with our financial and human investment; and the \nability to mobilize the most effective human capacity-building tools to \naddress the HIV/AIDS pandemic.\n  Last year, I introduced a version of this bill which authorized $2.5 \nbillion in global AIDS spending for fiscal year 2003. For fiscal year \n2004, I have proposed authorization levels of $3.35 billion. The United \nStates, unfortunately, only contributed $1 billion to fighting this \nepidemic in 2002. With the passage of the Durbin-DeWine amendment, the \nSenate allocated $1.525 billion in its fiscal year 2003 appropriations \nbills. This is a breakthrough--a 50-percent increase by the United \nStates in its commitment.\n\n  But these funding levels are still far short of the goal. To meet the \nneed, our target for fiscal year 2004 should be in the $3.35 billion \nrange. Frankly, when you look at the world this year, the global need \njust to fight HIV/AIDS stands at $8.2 billion. Despite these good \nefforts by the United States, we can do more. But other countries in \nthe world can do more as well. Let them join the President and the \nCongress in our commitment to this fight. We have been shortchanging \nthis epidemic for too long. We take tiny steps in pursuit of a \nchallenge that is racing away from us.\n  Because the spread of this disease remains in its infancy, we have to \nlook at it in more serious terms. We must do more for the 42 million \npeople worldwide who are living with HIV/AIDS, and we have to \nunderstand that the disease is not going to wait for our political \ndetermination.\n  A 15-year-old boy in Botswana faces an 80-percent chance of dying \nfrom AIDS. We have to change his future. To do that, the Global CARE \nAct addresses this epidemic aggressively and honestly. I hope this bill \nwill provide a basic blueprint for the United States, and I hope we can \njoin on a bipartisan basis in passing it. I hope my colleagues who read \nmy remarks and follow this debate will believe, as I do, that the \nPresident has given us a great opportunity on a bipartisan basis to \nstand together and tell the world that this caring Nation is committed \nto dealing honestly and effectively with the global AIDS crisis.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Reid, Mr. \n        Graham of South Carolina, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Grassley, Mr. \n        Dorgan, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Baucus, Mr. \n        DeWine, Mr. Warner, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Nickles, Mr. Conrad, Mr. \n        Burns, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Craig, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Dayton, Mrs. \n        Feinstein, Mr. Cornyn, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Allen, Mr. Santorum, \n        Mr. McConnell, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. Inhofe, \n        and Ms. Stabenow):\n  S. 253. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code to exempt \nqualified current and former law enforcement officers from State laws \nprohibiting the carrying of concealed handguns; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the Law \nEnforcement Officers Safety Act of 2003. I am also especially pleased \nto have Senators Patrick Leahy and Orrin Hatch joining me today as lead \noriginal cosponsors.\n  The Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act would permit qualified \ncurrent and former law enforcement officers to carry concealed firearms \nacross jurisdictions. This legislation has several important benefits. \nFirst, the American pubic will be safer as off-duty and retired law \nenforcement officers are allowed to carry concealed weapons as they \ntravel across jurisdictions. If enacted into law, the basic net effect \nof this legislation will be thousands of additional police officers on \nthe streets, at zero taxpayer expense. There are many examples of off-\nduty officers coming to the rescue of American citizens facing dire \nsituations. Hopefully, with this bill's passage, we will hear about \neven more of these stories in the future.\n  Terrorists and violent criminals certainly will not be happy when \nthis bill is passed. They will have additional worries, and hopefully \nmay be deterred, because they will not be sure whether or not seemingly \naverage citizens are actually off-duty or retired law enforcement \nofficers who are armed, trained and ready to deal with whatever \nsituation may arise.\n  This legislation will also help off-duty and retired law enforcement \nofficers protect themselves and their families. All too often, after \nthey are released from prison, violent criminals seek revenge against \nthe law enforcement officers who helped lock them away. While at a \nminimum this legislation will even the playing field for off-duty and \nretired law enforcement officers, I hope that it will go further and \nactually give them an advantage.\n  This important law enforcement legislation is especially meaningful \nto me for a number of reasons. First of all, through six years of \nservice as a Deputy Sheriff with Sacramento County, California, I was \nable to get first-hand experience with the challenges facing our \nnation's law enforcement officers. As a Deputy Sheriff, I have \npersonally patrolled the streets and encountered plenty of dangerous \ncharacters, far too many of which were armed and dangerous. I also \nclearly learned that a law enforcement officer's job does not \nnecessarily end when he or she is off-duty since you never know when \nyou may come face-to-face with violent criminals.\n  Finally, now that I serve as a U.S. Senator, I have made passing pro-\nlaw enforcement legislation one of my top priorities.\n  Previous versions of this legislation have enjoyed the support of \nover one hundred national, state and local law enforcement \norganizations. The Fraternal Order of Police is a key leader among \nthose organizations. For many years now, the FOP has supported passage \nof this legislation. I am encouraged that the FOP has made it clear \nthat we will be working together once again in our efforts to get this \nbill passed and signed into law by President Bush. I want to take a \nmoment to express my appreciation for Chuck Canterbury, National \nPresident of the FOP, the rest of the FOP's professional staff and the \nover 300,000 members of the FOP they represent, for the letter of \nsupport for the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act of 2003.\n  I am pleased that Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch and \nRanking Democratic Member Patrick Leahy are playing vital roles in \nadvancing this legislation as lead original cosponsors. Over the years, \nI have championed a number of legislative initiatives aimed at helping \nour nation's law enforcement officers be better supported and protected \nas they go about their mission of protecting the American people. These \naccomplishments include a public law that continues to help state and \nlocal law enforcement officers acquire life saving bullet-proof vests \nand a federal grant-making program that helps our nation's schools \nacquire the School Resource Officers they need to reduce the threat of \nviolence in our public schools. Senators Leahy and Hatch have played\n\n[[Page S1817]]\n\nimportant roles in getting each of these legislative initiatives \naccomplished.\n  The key goal of the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act I am \nintroducing today has been one of my law enforcement legislative \npriorities since I first introduced similar legislation back in 1997 \nduring the 105th Congress. Since that time, I have introduced the \nlegislation twice more, in 1999 and 2001. Fortunately, the Judiciary \nCommittee made good progress on conceal carry legislation late last \nyear before the 107th Congress completed its work for the year. As we \nbegin anew in the 108th Congress, I hope we will be able to recapture \nthe momentum and finally get this legislation passed and enacted. Just \nas we worked together in past years to get things done, I look forward \nto working with Senators Leahy and Hatch to do what it takes to \nsuccessfully turn this worthy legislation into the law of the land. \nMany years of work and persistence may finally be paying off for all of \nus, especially our nation's law enforcement officers.\n  It is worth noting that the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act of \n2003 legislation being introduced here today enjoys the strong \nbipartisan support of thirty-one of my fellow Senators as original \ncosponsors. I urge the rest of my colleagues to join us in supporting \nthe successful passage of this important Campbell-Leahy-Hatch \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation I am \nintroducing today, the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act of 2003, and \nthe Fraternal Order of Police's letter of support, be included in the \nCongressional Record immediately following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                      Grand Lodge,\n\n\n                                    Fraternal Order of Police,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 24, 2003.\n     Hon. Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Campbell: On behalf of the more than 300,000 \n     members of the Fraternal Order of Police, I am writing to \n     advise you or our strong support for legislation you intend \n     to introduce to exempt qualified active and retired law \n     enforcement officers from State and local prohibitions with \n     respect to the carrying of firearms. The passage of this \n     legislation has been designated the top legislative priority \n     of the Fraternal Order of Police and we are proud to have a \n     former law enforcement officer as the sponsor of this bill.\n       Having served six years as a Deputy Sheriff in Sacramento \n     County, you know firsthand the challenges faced by our \n     nation's law enforcement officers. Police officers put their \n     lives on the line every day and are trained throughout their \n     careers to carry and, in worst-case scenarios use, firearms \n     to defend themselves and the public they are sworn to \n     protect. However, the bewildering patchwork of laws in the \n     States often results in a paradox for law enforcement \n     officers, sometimes placing them in legal and physical \n     jeopardy. Criminals and terrorists do not disarm themselves \n     when they travel from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and \n     neither should America's police officers.\n       This is not about firearms--it is about officer safety. \n     After 11 September 2001, it became an important public safety \n     and homeland security issue as well.\n       The danger inherent to police work and the possibility than \n     an officer will need to respond to an emergency situation \n     does not end with the shift. Criminals and terrorists are \n     never off-duty, making law enforcement officers targets in \n     uniform and out, on duty and off, active or retired. The \n     legislation you intend to offer will give us the ability to \n     defend ourselves at all times by providing qualified active \n     and retired law enforcement officers with the authority to \n     carry their firearms in all U.S. jurisdictions, so long as \n     they have photographic identification issued by the agency \n     for which they are or were employed.\n       I applaud you for your leadership and you continuing \n     efforts on behalf of our nation's law enforcement officers. \n     It is our hope that we will finally be able to get a bill to \n     the President's desk in this Congress, and we look forward to \n     working with you on this issue. Please do not hesitate to \n     contact me or Executive Director Jim Pasco through my \n     Washington office if we can be of any assistance on this or \n     any other matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Chuck Canterbury,\n                                               National President.\n\n                                 S. 253\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am proud to join Senator Campbell to \nintroduce the ``Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act of 2003,'' which \npermits current and retired law enforcement officers to carry a firearm \nand be prepared to assist in dangerous situations. During his time in \nthe Senate, Senator Campbell has been a leader in the area of law \nenforcement. As a former deputy sheriff, he knows the difficulties law \nenforcement officers face due to the patchwork of conceal-carry laws in \nState and local jurisdictions. He and I have worked together on several \npieces of law enforcement legislation, such as the Bulletproof Vests \nPartnership Grant Acts of 1998 and 2000. I look forward to working with \nhim on our bipartisan bill.\n  I am pleased that 30 Senators, including Judiciary Committee Chairman \nHatch and Committee Members Schumer, Edwards, Feinstein, Grassley, Kyl, \nSessions, DeWine, Craig, Graham, and Cornyn, as well as Assistant \nDemocratic Leader Reid and Assistant Republican Leader McConnell--have \njoined Senator Campbell and me as original cosponsors of this bill in \nan effort to make our communities safer and better to protect law \nenforcement officers and their families. In the last Congress, Senator \nHatch and I worked together to reach consensus and have the Judiciary \nCommittee approve this legislation by an 18-1 vote. I thank Senator \nHatch for his past support and look forward to working with him again \non our bipartisan bill.\n  We introduce this measure in the Senate at the request of the \nFraternal Order of Police, which strongly supports this legislation to \nprotect officers and their families from vindictive criminals and to \npermit officers to respond immediately to a crime when off duty. Last \nyear, when I chaired the Judiciary Committee, I was honored to work \nclosely with FOP's National President, Lt. Steve Young, whose death \nearlier this month was a sad loss for all of us. Steve was dedicated to \nthis legislation because he understood the importance of having law \nenforcement officers across the nation armed and prepared whenever and \nwherever threats to our peace or to our public safety arise. I will \ncontinue my close work with the FOP and its new National President, \nMajor Chuck Canterbury, to pass this legislation into law.\n  There are approximately 740,000 sworn law enforcement officers \ncurrently serving in the United States. Since the first recorded police \ndeath in 1792, there have been more than 16,400 law enforcement \nofficers killed in the line of duty. A total of 1,694 law enforcement \nofficers died in the line of duty over the last decade, an average of \n170 deaths per year. Roughly 5 percent of officers who die are killed \ntaking law enforcement action while in an off-duty capacity. On \naverage, more than 62,000 law enforcement officers are assaulted each \nyear, resulting in some 21,000 injuries.\n  Until 2001, violent crime in this country had declined each of the \npreceding 8 years. Indeed, it had declined by 40 percent since it \npeaked at 4 million violent crimes in 1993. Community policing and the \noutstanding work of so many law enforcement officers played a vital key \nin our crime control efforts. Unfortunately, during the past two years \nthe downward trend in violent crime ended and violent crime turned \nupward. Last month, the FBI reported that crime rose slightly in the \nfirst half of 2002, including a 2.3 percent increase in murders. The \npreliminary numbers for 2002 follow an increase in crime in 2001 that \nwas the first in a decade, coinciding with a struggling economy that \nmany experts say could be a contributing factor. Crime rose in 2001 by \n2.1 percent, compared with the year before.\n\n  The Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act of 2003 is designed to \nprotect officers and their families from vindictive criminals and to \nallow thousands of equipped, trained and certified law enforcement \nofficers, whether on or off duty or retired, to carry concealed \nfirearms in most situations, thus enabling them to respond immediately \nto a crime. Our bipartisan bill will allow thousands of equipped, \ntrained and certified law enforcement officers continually to serve and \nprotect our communities, regardless of jurisdiction, and at no cost to \ntaxpayers.\n  To qualify for the bill's uniform standards a law enforcement officer \nmust be authorized to use a firearm by the law enforcement agency where \nhe or she works, meet the standards of the agency to regularly use a \nfirearm, not be prohibited by Federal law from receiving a firearm, and \nbe carrying a photo identification issued by the agency.\n  A qualified retired law enforcement officer under the bill must have \nretired in good standing, have been qualified by the agency to carry or \nuse a firearm, have been employed at least 15 years as a law \nenforcement officer unless forced to retire due to a service-connected \ndisability, have a nonforfeitable right to retirement plan benefits of \nthe law enforcement agency, annually meet State firearms training and \nqualifications that are the same as active law enforcement officers, \nnot be prohibited by Federal law from receiving a firearm, and be \ncarrying a photo identification issued by the agency.\n  I have heard from many representatives of the law enforcement \ncommunity, including the Fraternal Order of Police, the National \nAssociation of Police Officers, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers \nAssociation, the International Brotherhood of Police Officers, and the \nCalifornia Correctional Peace Officers Association, CCPOA, that \nnational legislation is necessary because of the current patchwork of \nstate and local conceal-carry laws. I have also received letters of \nsupport for the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act from a variety of \nVermont law enforcement officials, including Chief Osburn Glidden of \nWilliston, Officer Wade Johnson of Hinesburg, Chief Trevor Whipple of \nBarre, Officer Bonnie Hotchkiss of Barre, Sergeant Mike Manning and \nSergeant David Yustin of the Vermont State Police, and nine Field \nSupervision Correctional Officers assigned to the Vermont Department of \nCorrections Barre Community Correctional Service Center.\n  As a former State prosecutor, I know that law enforcement Officers \nare never ``off-duty.'' They are dedicated public servants trained to \nuphold the law and keep the peace. When there is a threat to our public \nsafety, law enforcement officers are sown to answer that call. The Law \nEnforcement Officers Safety Act will enable law enforcement officers in \nVermont and across the nation to be armed and prepared when they answer \nthat call, no matter where, when, or in what form it comes.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Law Enforcement Officers Safety \nAct to make our communities safer and to protect law enforcement \nofficers and their families.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I rise along with senators Campbell, \nLeahy, and others to introduce the ``Law Enforcement Officers Safety \nAct of 2003''. This bill, which permits qualified current and retired \nlaw enforcement officers to carry a concealed firearm in any \njurisdiction, will help protect the American public, our Nation's \nofficers, and their families. I would note that this bill has the \noverwhelming support of the Fraternal Order of Police and other law \nenforcement associations.\n  This legislation allows qualified law enforcement officers and \nretired officers to carry, with appropriate identification, a concealed \nfirearm that has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign \ncommerce regardless of State or local laws. Importantly, this \nlegislation does not supersede any State law that permits private \npersons to prohibit or restrict the possession of firearms on any State \nor local government properties, installations, buildings, bases or \nparks. Additionally, this bill clearly defines what is meant by \n``qualified law enforcement officer'' and ``qualified retired, or \nformer, law enforcement officer'' to ensure that those individuals \npermitted to carry concealed firearms are highly trained professionals.\n  Such legislation not only will provide law enforcement officers with \na legal means to protect themselves and their families when they travel \ninterstate, it will also enhance the security of the American public. \nBy enabling qualified active duty and retired law enforcement officers \nto carry firearms, even if\n\n[[Page S1819]]\n\noff-duty, more trained law enforcement officers will be on the street \nto enforce the law and to respond to crises.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the passage of this \nimportant piece of legislation to provide that extra layer of \nprotection to current and retired law enforcement officers, their \nfamilies, and the public.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA:\n  S. 254. A bill to revise the boundary of the Kaloko-Honokohau \nNational Historical Park in the State of Hawaii, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Kaloko-\nHonokohau National Historical Park Addition Act of 2003. This bill \npassed the Senate by unanimous consent in the 107th Congress, and I \nhope that it will receive quick approval again in the 108th Congress. \nThe legislation provides for a small adjustment of the Park's \nboundaries to permit the purchase of permanent facilities for Park \nadministrative purposes and to provide visitors with a modest \ninterpretive center that will help them understand the cultural and \nhistorical treasures of the Park.\n  Kaloko-Honokohau National Historical Park is located along the \nbeautiful Kona coast on the island of Hawaii. It was designated as a \nNational Historic Landmark in 1962 and was established as a National \nHistorical Park in 1978. The Park was created to preserve, interpret, \nand perpetuate traditional Native Hawaiian culture. The ocean makes up \nover half of this 1,160-acre Park, and the boundaries include the \nculturally significant Kaloko and `Aimakapa fishponds and `Ai`opio fish \ntrap. There are also several heiau, or Native Hawaiian religious sites, \nfound in the Park.\n  In 2001, 54,000 people visited Kaloko-Honokohau National Historical \nPark, and the number of visitors continues to increase. In 2002, 70,000 \npeople visited the Park, an increase of 16,000 visitors. We need a \nfacility there that offers administrative personnel the space and the \nresources they need to carry out their management functions, and \nprovides visitors with the opportunity to learn about this important \npart of Hawaii. Rather than erecting a new building and disturbing the \nresources within Park boundaries, the better option is to locate the \nfacilities nearby on an already-developed parcel. The bill provides a \nsimple, cost-effective solution to the important problems of growing \nvisitorship and the need to provide adequate stewardship of cultural \nresources.

A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to require \nphased increases in the fuel efficiency standards applicable to light \ntrucks; to require fuel economy standards for automobiles up to 10,000 \npounds gross vehicle weight; to increase the fuel economy of the \nFederal fleet of vehicles, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Snowe, \nCollins, Cantwell, Corzine, Dodd, Durbin, Jeffords, Leahy, Murray, \nReed, Clinton, and Schumer in introducing legislation to increase \nCorporate Average Fuel Efficiency, CAFE, Standards for SUVs and other \nlight duty trucks.\n  This bill will close the ``SUV Loophole,'' and require that SUVs meet \nthe same fuel efficiency standards as passenger cars by 2011.\n  Simply put, this legislation is the single most important step the \nUnited States can take to limit dependence on foreign oil and better \nprotect our environment.\n  If implemented, closing the SUV Loophole would: Save the U.S. 1 \nmillion barrels of oil a day and reduce our dependence on foreign oil \nimports by 10 percent. Prevent about 240 million tons of carbon \ndioxide--the top greenhouse gas and biggest single cause of global \nwarming from entering the atmosphere each year. Save SUV and light duty \ntruck owners hundreds of dollars each year in gasoline costs.\n  CAFE standards were first established in 1975. At that time, light \ntrucks made up only a small percentage of the vehicles on the road, \nthey were used mostly for agriculture and commerce, not as passenger \ncars.\n  Today, our roads look much different, SUVs and light duty trucks \ncomprise more than half of the new car sales in the United States.\n  As a result, the overall fuel economy of our Nation's fleet is the \nlowest it has been in two decades, because fuel economy standards for \nthese vehicles are so much lower than they are for other passenger \nvehicles.\n  The bill we are introducing today would change that, SUVs and other \nlight duty trucks would have to meet the same fuel economy requirements \nby 2011 that passenger cars meet today.\n  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, NHTSA, has \nproposed phasing in an increase in fuel economy standards for SUVs and \nlight trucks under the following schedule: by 2005, SUVs and light \ntrucks would have to average 21.0 miles per gallon; by 2006, SUVs and \nlight trucks would have to average 21.6 miles per gallon; and by 2007, \nSUVs and light trucks would have to average 22.2 miles per gallon.\n  Last year, the National Academy of Sciences, NAS, released a report \nstating that adequate lead time can bring about substantive increases \nin fuel economy standards. Automakers can meet higher CAFE standards if \nexisting technologies are utilized and included in new models of SUVs \nand light trucks.\n  And earlier this month, the head of the National Highway Traffic \nSafety Administration said he favored an increase in vehicle fuel \neconomy standards beyond the 1.5-mile-per-gallon hike slated to go into \neffect by 2007. ``We can do better,'' said Jeffrey Runge in an \ninterview with Congressional Green Sheets. ``The overriding goal here \nis better fuel economy to decrease our reliance on foreign oil without \ncompromising safety or American jobs,'' he said.\n  With this in mind, we have developed the following phase-in schedule \nwhich would follow up on what NHTSA has proposed for the short term and \nremain consistent with what the NAS report said is technologically \nfeasible over the next decade or so: by 2008, SUVs and light duty \nvehicles would have to average 23.5 miles per gallon; by 2009, SUVs and \nlight duty vehicles would have to average 24.8 miles per gallon; by \n2010, SUVs and light duty vehicles would have to average 26.1 miles per \ngallon, by 2011, SUVs and light duty vehicles would have to average \n27.5 miles per gallon.\n  This legislation would do two other things: 1. It would mandate that \nby 2007 the average fuel economy of the new vehicles comprising the \nFederal fleet must be 3 miles per gallon higher than the baseline \naverage fuel economy for that class. And by 2010, the average fuel \neconomy of the new federal vehicles must be 6 miles per gallon higher \nthan the baseline average fuel economy for that class.\n\n[[Page S1820]]\n\n  2. The bill also increases the weight limit within which vehicles are \nbound by CAFE standards to make it harder for automotive manufacturers \nto build SUVs large enough to become exempted from CAFE standards. \nBecause SUVs are becoming larger and larger, some may become so large \nthat they will no longer qualify as even SUVs anymore.\n  We are introducing this legislation because we believe that the \nUnited States needs to take a leadership role in the fight against \nglobal warming.\n  The International Panel on Climate Change, estimates that the Earth's \naverage temperature could rise by as much as 10 degrees in the next 100 \nyears, the most rapid change in 10,000 years.\n  This would have a major effect on our way of life. It would melt the \npolar ice caps, decimate our coastal cities, and cause global climate \nchange.\n  We are already seeing the effects of warming: In November, the Los \nAngeles Times published an article about the vanishing glaciers of \nGlacier National Park in Montana. Over a century ago, 150 of these \nmagnificent glaciers could be seen on the high cliffs and jagged peaks \nof the surrounding mountains of the park. Today, there are only 35. And \nthese 35 glaciers that remain today are disintegrating so quickly that \nscientists estimate the park will have no glaciers in 30 years.\n  This melting seen in Glacier National Park can also be seen around \nthe world, from the snows of Mt. Kilimanjaro in Tanzania to the ice \nfields beneath Mt. Everest in the Himalayas. Experts also predict that \nglaciers in the high Andes, the Swiss Alps, and even Iceland could \ndisappear in coming decades as well. These dwindling glaciers offer the \nclearest and most visible sign of climate change in America and the \nrest of the world.\n  Yet, the Administration has walked away from the negotiating table \nfor the Kyoto Protocol. This is a big mistake. The United States is now \nthe largest energy consumer in the world, with 4 percent of the world's \npopulation using 25 percent of the planet's energy. We should be a \nleader when it comes to combating global warming.\n  The single most effective action our nation can take to limit \nreliance on foreign oil and reduce global warming is to increase the \nfuel efficiency of our vehicles. The simplest way to do this is to \nsimply bring the fuel efficiency standards for light trucks and sport \nutility vehicles, SUVs, into conformance with other passenger vehicles.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator Feinstein \ntoday in renewing the call we made in the 107th Congress for improving \nvehicle fuel economy by taking logical steps to close the SUV loophole \nprovided to the ``light truck'' category in the Federal Corporate \nAverage Fuel Economy, or CAFE, Program.\n  My colleague has been a passionate advocate of this proposal, and I \nam proud to work with her again in introducing S. 255, our practical, \nattainable bill that can garner the kind of broad support necessary to \naddress this national imperative this year. I know when we introduced \nour plan in 2001, some believed it was too much too soon, while others \nfelt it didn't go far enough. But can anyone honestly say we are better \noff today without nothing? That we are in better shape because we \nfailed to pass what is possible 2 years ago?\n  Just think about where we would be today, we would be a model year \naway from giving consumers greater choices in purchasing more fuel \nefficient SUVs. And we would also be that much closer to controlling \nour own energy destiny by reducing our reliance on foreign oil, all the \nmore critical at a time when the current strike in Venezuela and the \nsituation in Iraq make already volatile world oil markets even more \nprecarious. As an oil analyst with the Deutsche Bank in London recently \nput it, ``The oil markets can stand having one thing go wrong, but not \ntwo. That's what's happening with Venezuela and Iraq.''\n  And it is not as though we haven't been burned by the foreign oil \nmarket before. It is not as though this is something we have never \nthought of. This year is the 30th anniversary of the Arab oil embargo. \nI recall in the 1970s when the day you were allowed to refuel your car \nwas determined by whether the last number of your license plate was odd \nor even. Why hasn't any of this been enough to wean us off this habit?\n  Right now, we rely more on foreign oil than ever. In 2001, 55 percent \nof the U.S. total demand was met by oil from abroad, up from 37 percent \nin 1980 around the time when the original CAFE standards took effect, I \nmight add, and by 2025 that number will jump to a projected 70 percent \nif we don't take action. With such a large percentage of this imported \nresource coming from such a volatile region of the world, what do we \nneed to have happen before we feel a sense of urgency?\n  The fact is, this is an emergency, and we can make a difference. Even \njust increasing fuel economy standards for SUVs and light trucks by 1.5 \nmiles per gallon by model year 2007, which the administration proposes, \nwould reduce gasoline consumption by 2.5 billion gallons through that \nyear. Just imagine what we could achieve with the proposal Senator \nFeinstein and I are re-introducing, which would phase-in changes in \nCAFE requirements in four, attainable stages that will bring the \nstandards for SUV's in line with passenger cars within the next 8 \nyears.\n  Our legislation is backed by the findings of a 2001 National Academy \nof Sciences CAFE report that this body requested in 2000 on CAFE \nstandards. The report clearly states that, ``Because of concerns about \ngreenhouse gas emissions and the level of oil imports, it is \nappropriate for the Federal Government to ensure fuel economy levels \nbeyond those expected to result from market forces alone.''\n  I believe that fuel economy through better vehicle mileage is \nprobably the most significant and realistic environmental and energy \nindependence issue we, as leaders, could tackle this year in developing \nour Nation's energy policy. Had the Senate boosted fuel economy \nstandards over a decade ago as proposed by Senators Bryan and Gorton \nrather than defeating the measure by three votes, new vehicles would be \naveraging 33 miles per gallon today instead of 24.5 miles per gallon, \nand the U.S. would have saved more than 1 billion barrels of oil each \nand every day.\n  Instead, all our vehicles combined consume 40 percent of our oil, \nwhile coughing up 20 percent of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions, the \ngreenhouse gas linked to global climate change. To put this in \nperspective, the amount of carbon dioxide emission just from U.S. \nvehicles alone is the equivalent of the fourth highest carbon dioxide \nemitting country in the world. Given these stunning numbers, how can we \ncontinue to allow SUVs to spew three times more pollution into the air \nthan our passenger cars?\n  And it is not just an environmental issue, it is also a pocketbook \nissue, with rising prices at the pump. In fact, according to DOE's \nEnergy Information Administration, the typical price for regular \nunleaded gas, now $1.47 per gallon, is a full 37 cents higher than just \na year ago. Yet ironically, in the past quarter century since the last \nadjustments were made to CAFE standards, overall fuel economy has \nactually fallen to its lowest level since 1980, 24.7 miles per gallon.\n  Just think for a moment how much the world has changed \ntechnologically over the past 25 years. We have seen the advent of the \nhome computer and the information age. Computers are now running our \nautomobiles, and global positioning system devices are guiding drivers \nto their destinations. Are we to believe that technology couldn't have \nalso helped those drivers burn less fuel in getting there? Are we going \nto say that the whole world has transformed, but America doesn't have \nthe wherewithal to make SUVs that get better fuel economy?\n  Well, I don't believe it, and neither does the National Academy of \nSciences that issued a report in 2001 in response to Congress' request \nthe previous year that the NAS study the issue. They concluded that it \nwas possible to achieve a more than 40-percent improvement particularly \nin light truck and SUV fuel economy over a 10-15 year period, and that \ntechnologies exist now for improving fuel economy. That was a year-and-\na-half ago.\n  But, automakers have instead invested their new technologies in other \nattributes over the past 13 years. Specifically, there has been a 53-\npercent increase in horsepower, a 19-percent increase in weight, an 18-\npercent increase\n\n[[Page S1821]]\n\nfor acceleration and, correspondingly, a minus eight percent decrease \nfor fuel economy. The bottom line is that the auto industry has had the \ntechnological opportunities to do better but chose another road. They \ntell us this is what the consumer wants.\n  But maybe that is because, for the most part, consumers haven't been \npresented with viable alternatives. Indeed, a March 2002 poll by the \nMellman Group shows that nearly three-quarters of voters nationwide \nfavor increasing the fuel efficiency of vehicles. Another survey \nconducted since 9/11 by Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research, Inc., showed \nthat 88 percent of likely voters support increasing the fuel efficiency \nstandards for cars and trucks.\n  We have seen what a positive difference changes in CAFE standards can \nmake. The NAS panel experts found that, as a result of CAFE standards \nput into law by Congress in 1975, we have achieved a 75-percent \nincrease in fuel economy for cars. Cars went from 15.8 mpg in 1975 to \n27.5 mpg in 1985. And, through CAFE standards, we have seen a 50-\npercent increase for light trucks, from 13.7 mpg in 1975 to 20.7 mpg in \n1987. In addition, NAS noted that CAFE helped maintain fuel economy \nlevels when market forces might have forced fuel economy lower in the \npassenger fleet.\n  I don't want America's SUV manufacturers to be ``the industry that \ntime forgot?'', and history clearly shows that the Federal Government \nmust play a role in ensuring that consumers have a choice in vehicles \nwith high degrees of fuel economy, an appropriate degree of safety and \na minimal impact on our environment. How can we do anything less? \nClosing the SUV loophole will help us achieve these goals, and it is an \nidea whose time has long since arrived.\n  When I think back to the balanced budget debate in the Senate, many \nof us argued that continued deficits would leave the generations to \ncome with mountains of debt, and we had an obligation to ensure that \nthis did not happen. Today, I say to you that we have a similar \nobligation to take practical steps, to make practical tradeoffs to \nensure that generations to come won't be left with a mountain of carbon \ndioxide emissions, with an even greater dependency on foreign oil, with \neven higher prices at the pump, and with fewer of our precious natural \nresources.\n  I urge my colleagues to take the responsible road and support the \nFeinstein-Snowe CAFE standards incremental increases for SUVs and the \nlight truck category as the right direction to take.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 258. A bill to amend the definition of low-income families for \npurposes of the United States Housing Act of 1937; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I rise to bring the Senate's \nattention to a matter that is slowing Los Alamos County, NM, in its \nefforts to fully recover from the Cerro Grande Fire of May 10, 2000.\n  The Cerro Grande fire severely reduced available housing in Los \nAlamos. Indeed, a major deterrent to new hires is the lack of housing \nchoices in the city. The housing market is even tighter because of the \nloss of about 400 housing units through the devastating Cerro Grande \nFire. Los Alamos has a population of about 18,000 people.\n  While we have Federal programs to help low and moderate income \nAmericans find good housing, in Los Alamos these programs are \nineffective due to the current practice of averaging Los Alamos County \nand Santa Fe County incomes into one Metropolitan Statistical Area, \nMSA. This is harmful to Los Alamos residents, where the median income \nis about $82,000 because the Federal programs use the MSA median income \nof about $65,000 to determine participation. Eighty percent of median \nincome is a standard measure.\n  Santa Fe's median income of about $40,000 thus becomes a significant \nfactor for a Los Alamos teacher, fireman, or policeman seeking \nsubsidized Federal assistance. Their incomes in Los Alamos are deemed \nto be too high to qualify for housing because 80 percent of $65,00 is \nused as the maximum allowed for assistance. Thus, $52,000 becomes the \neffective ceiling for assistance, when the actual 80 percent ceiling \nfigure for Los Alamos incomes is about $65,000. This makes a huge \ndifference in a high-priced and competitive market. The result is that \ndevelopers are discouraged from applying for tax credits and other \nassistance programs because their applicants do not qualify to live in \ntheir new or remodeled housing projects.\n  The Los Alamos County Manager reports that not a single County \nemployee is eligible for housing created by the Low Income Housing Tax \nCredits. He, like many residents and the LANL recruiting effort, remain \nconcerned that the limited housing supply has raised rents and sales \nprices. Los Alamos County is also landlocked by federal government land \nownership.\n  There is a desperate need for affordable housing at a time when, once \nagain, our nation is calling upon LANL for helping to meet its internal \nand international security needs.\n  This situation also exists around the New York City area, where \nWestchester County incomes unfairly raise the metropolitan average to \nthe detriment of the metropolitan housing market. In that case, \nCongress agreed to separate Westchester County to ease the housing \nmarket situation. All I am asking in my bill is to accomplish the same \ngoal by allowing Los Alamos County to stand on its own in terms of HUD \nmedian income requirements. My bill does not simultaneously lower the \nSanta Fe County income to its actual median, but, rather, allows Santa \nFe County to continue to use the higher median, because the Santa Fe \nhousing market is also very unusual, and the two-county average helps \nmake more Santa Fe residents eligible for federal assistance on many \nfronts.\n  I appreciate my colleagues attention to this matter, and I know the \nresidents of Los Alamos County will be grateful for this assistance to \nallow more of them to make use of available HUD and other affordable \nhousing assistance programs.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 258\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. LOW-INCOME FAMILIES DEFINITION.\n\n       Section 3(b)(2) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 \n     (42 U.S.C. 1437a(b)(2)) is amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``and for Los Alamos County in the State \n     of New Mexico,'' after ``State of New York,'';\n       (2) by inserting ``, Los Alamos,'' after ``does not include \n     Westchester'';\n       (3) by inserting ``, Los Alamos,'' after ``portion included \n     Westchester''; and\n       (4) by inserting before the period at the end the \n     following: ``, and Los Alamos County, New Mexico, in the \n     Santa Fe metropolitan area''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself and Ms. Stabenow):\n  S. 260. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to prevent \nthe continued use of renouncing United States citizenship as a device \nfor avoiding United States taxes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, Senator Stabenow and I are introducing \nlegislation similar to the measure we proposed in the last Congress to \neffectively prevent very rich individuals from reducing their taxes by \nrenouncing the U.S. citizenship. It is a companion to a measure \nintroduced by Congressman Charles Rangel in 2002. The Joint Tax \nCommittee estimated that it will raise $656 million over 10 years from \na very few people who I call Benedict Arnolds. These people turn their \nback on their country which provided so well for then, in order to \navoid paying their fair share of U.S. taxes.\n  Under current law, there are special rules that apply to these former \ncitizens that appear to recover funds lost to the Treasury. However, \nthey are full of holes. Under the current regime, for 10 years after a \nU.S. citizen renounces his or her citizenship with a principal purpose \nof avoiding U.S. taxes, the person is taxed at the rates that would \nhave applied had he or she remained a citizen. In reality, the tax is \nnominally on a broader base of income and on more types of \ntransactions. In addition, if the expatriate dies within 10 years of \nthe expatriation, more types of assets are included in his or her \nestate. Unfortunately, the reality is that taxes are very often not \npaid.\n\n[[Page S1822]]\n\n  The reality is that once a person has expatriated and removed U.S. \nassets from U.S. jurisdiction, it is extremely difficult to enforce the \ncurrent rules, particularly for an entire decade after the citizenship \nis renounced. The measure I introduced simply provides that the very \nact of renouncing one's citizenship triggers the recognition of tax. \nSo, rather than collecting tax every time an asset is sold over the \nnext decade, my bill treats all of the assets of an expatriate as \nhaving been sold the day prior to when the person renounces their \ncitizenship. The taxes are due up front rather than over time. In \nregard to estate taxes, rather than attempting to collect the tax from \nthe estate of an expatriate not in the U.S. jurisdiction, my measure \ntaxes the inheritance of an heir who remain in the United States in \nsuch a way as to remove any tax benefit from the renouncement of \ncitizenship.\n  $656 million in revenue from these very few former citizens is a lot \nof revenue that must be made up by loyal Americans in the form of \nhigher debt or taxes that Americans will face. Last year, the Senate \npassed the measure as a part of the Armed Services Tax Fairness Act \nbut, unfortunately, the House opposed this provision. I am hopeful that \nit can become law this year. People should not be able to reduce their \ntaxes by renouncing their citizenship.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Daschle, Mr. \n        Kennedy, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Sarbanes, Mrs. Lincoln, Mrs. Murray, \n        Mr. Levin, Mr. Corzine, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Akaka, \n        Mr. Leahy, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Lautenberg, and Mr. Reed):\n  S. 261.

A bill to amend part A of title IV of the Social Security Act \nto require a comprehensive strategic plan for the State temporary \nassistance to needy families program and to give States the flexibility \nto implement innovative welfare programs that have been effective in \nother States; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce three welfare \nbills. Although these bills do not represent a comprehensive welfare \nreform proposal, they do address what I see as some of the most \ncritical and pressing issues we must deal with as we move toward \nimproving the TANF program.\n  Let me begin by introducing the Children First Act on behalf of \nmyself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Kennedy, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. \nSarbanes, Mrs. Lincoln, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Levin, Mr. Corzine, Mrs.  \nClinton, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Lautenberg \nand Mr. Reed).\n  Since 1996, federal funding for child care assistance under the Child \nCare and Development Block Grant, CCDBG, has significantly increased, \nmaking it possible for states to provide more low-income families with \nchild care assistance and to expand initiatives to improve the quality \nof child care. This has been an extremely important endeavor. Access to \nhigh quality childcare is crucial in helping families to work and \nchildren to succeed.\n  Most people agree that the recent employment gains among welfare \nrecipients can only be sustained if families have access to dependable \nchild care. Studies show that when childcare is available and when \nfamilies get help in paying for care, they are more likely to work. In \nfact, when I talk to people in my home State of New Mexico about \nwelfare reform, they identify access to childcare as the most important \nwork support we can provide.\n  Despite the past increases in the CCDBG, we must do more. Overall, \nonly one out of seven children eligible for assistance through the \nCCDBG program receives a subsidy, leaving approximately 12.9 million \neligible children without assistance. Less than 25 percent of New \nMexican children under the age of six who are eligible for childcare \nassistance are currently receiving it. Unfortunately, the need for \nchildcare assistance is only likely to increase in the near future. \nMany states are currently threatened with serious budget shortfalls \nthat threaten the availability of funds for numerous important \nendeavors, including childcare assistance. In addition, the \nadministration's recently proposed TANF plan includes provisions for \nincreased work requirements for recipients. If passed, this would \ncreate an increased need for welfare support services, especially \nchildcare. Without subsidized care, many of our Nation's poor families \nsimply cannot afford to work.\n  We must not only seek to increase access to childcare overall, but \nalso to ensure the improved quality of such care. Currently, many \nfamilies receiving assistance cannot provide their children with a high \nquality childcare setting. In part, this is because the childcare \nreimbursement rates are so low that many of the higher quality \nproviders do not accept state-subsidized children into their programs. \nLow salaries and the lack of health care and other benefits also make \nit difficult to attract and retain highly qualified childcare workers. \nThese are major issues given that quality childcare provides low-income \nchildren with the early learning experiences they need to do well in \nschool and in life. We know that children in high quality early care \nare more likely to experience academic success, for example, higher \ntest scores and an increased likelihood of graduating from high school, \nand less likely to experience social problems such as being charged in \njuvenile court or being aggressive toward others.\n\n  The Children First Act will address these important issues by \nincreasing funds for the CCDBG by $11.2 billion over 5 years. With \nthese funds, States will be able to serve approximately 1 million more \nchildren nationally. The bill also contains an increase in the quality \nset-aside in CCDBG, which will provide States with funds that can be \nused to train care providers and create and enforce standards of care.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation. \nIt will help low-income families work and help prepare our children to \nsucceed.\n  Next, I would like to introduce the Education Works Act on behalf of \nmyself and Mrs. Murray, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Reed, Mr. Corzine, and Mr. Wyden.\n  Since the 1996 changes in our welfare laws, the number of individuals \non welfare has dramatically decreased in most States. However, although \nmany have successfully left welfare for work over the past several \nyears, too many have been left behind because they don't have a high \nschool degree, have little or no work history, or are lacking the \nskills that are important for success in the job market. In addition, \nmany of those who have secured work are working for low wages, receive \nfew or no benefits, and have limited opportunity for upward financial \nmobility. As we move toward reauthorization, we must do more to support \nState efforts to insure that all individuals leaving welfare have the \ncapacity to obtain employment that will provide long-term financial \nindependence. The Education Works Act will do just that.\n  We know that the welfare programs that have been most successful in \nhelping parents work and earn more over the long run are those that \nhave focused on employment but also make substantial use of education \nand training, together with job search and other employment services. \nYes, less than 1 percent of Federal TANF funds were spent on education \nand training in 2000, largely because current law limits the extent to \nwhich education activities count toward Federal work participation \nrequirements, effectively restricting how long individuals can \nparticipate in training and also capping how many people can receive \nthese services.\n  The Education Works Act would change this by: clarifying that states \nhave the flexibility to allow participation in postsecondary, \nvocational English as a Second Language, and basic adult education \nprograms by\n\n[[Page S1823]]\n\nTANF recipients as part of TANF work requirements; giving States the \nflexibility to determine how long each recipient may participate in \neducation and training activities while receiving benefits; giving \nstates the flexibility to provide non-cash assistance in the form of \nchildcare and transportation supports to individuals who are \nparticipating in a full-time education program, without counting these \nservices against the 5-year time limit on TANF benefits; eliminating \nthe 30 percent cap on the number of TANF recipients that can \nparticipate in education and training programs in fulfillment of their \nwork requirements.\n\n  Via TANF waivers, many States have already been operating programs \nthat do many of the things we're talking about here. In other cases, \nhowever, state efforts to provide education and training to welfare \nrecipients have been hampered by an inability to use TANF funds to \nsupport these efforts. For example, in my home State, we already have \nan ``Education Works'' program but only 400 participants are enrolled \nstatewide, due to funding limitations.\n  States should be held accountable for decreasing welfare caseloads \nbut also for insuring that those entering the workforce have the skills \nthey need to become and remain economically self-sufficient. We need to \ngive all states the flexibility to implement the types of programs that \nthey believe will best achieve these goals. The Education Works Act is \nan important step in this direction and I urge my colleagues to support \nit.\n  Finally, I would like to introduce the Self-Sufficiency and \nAccountability Act. This Act has several broad goals: to increase state \nreporting and accountability for welfare dollars that are received, to \nencourage states to develop concrete strategies to help families move \nfrom welfare to self-sufficiency, and to allow states not currently \nreceiving TANF waivers to do so.\n  First, State plan requirements under current welfare law are simply \nnot comprehensive enough. Under current law, States can submit plans \nthat contain little information about the services that will be \nprovided, long-range or strategic planning, goals or benchmarks, or how \nthey will insure equitable treatment of all welfare clients. In \naddition, there are currently few provisions for informing the public \nabout the details contained in state plans. Thus, States have little or \nno accountability to legislators or to the public for the billions of \nwelfare dollars they receive each year.\n  The Self-Sufficiency and Accountability Act seeks to remedy these \ndeficits. Some of the key provisions include the following: \ncomprehensive state plans would be required to describe the programs \nand services that will be offered, eligibility requirements, the \npurposes and goals for all programs and how these goals will be \nassessed; the new State plans would increase compliance with \nnondiscrimination, employment, and civil rights laws by requiring among \nother things, better training of caseworkers, better communication with \nwelfare clients about their rights and obligations, an appeals process, \nreporting requirements for complaints, and penalties for states that \nfail to comply with these requirements; the Act would improve public \nawareness of and access to State plans in their entirety and provides \nopportunity for public comment when a state plan is pending or being \namended.\n  As I mentioned earlier, large numbers of individuals have moved from \nthe welfare rolls to work since 1996. During the current welfare \nreauthorization, we must look beyond simply putting people to work and \nfocus on strategies that will help these individuals achieve lasting \neconomic self-sufficiency. Unfortunately, the current content and \nstructure of state plans are wholly inadequate to address these crucial \nself-sufficiency concerns. The self-Sufficiency and Accountability Act \nwill address these shortcomings by encouraging States to develop \nconcrete strategies designed to move families toward self-sufficiency. \nThe bill requires States to identify and address individual and \nenvironmental barriers to self-sufficiency, describe program strategies \nimplemented to promote self-sufficiency, and to assess the progress of \nformer welfare families in this regard.\n  The final purpose of this bill is to address the issue of increased \nState flexibility to implement programs that have been proven \neffective. After the last reauthorization, many states obtained and \nsome continue to use TANF waivers to develop innovative welfare \nprograms that are suited to the specific needs of their TANF caseloads \nand labor market conditions in their states. This Act would allow \nstates that currently have waivers to continue to operate under those \nwaivers. In addition, the Act stipulates that any state may submit a \nwaiver application on terms similar or identical to states that are \nsuccessfully implementing innovative programs. In this way, all States \nwould be provided with the flexibility to employ proven strategies in \nan effort to address the unique needs of their welfare clients.\n  Taken together, the three bills I have introduced today would go a \nlong way toward helping people transition from welfare and providing \nthese individuals with the skills and supports they need to achieve a \nlifetime of productive and financially sustaining work.\n  I urge my colleagues to support these three bills and I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the bills be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 261\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

For purposes of the previous sentence, in the \n     case of a State that has a 2-year legislative session, each \n     year of such session shall be deemed to be a separate regular \n     session of the State legislature.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today my colleague Senator Bingaman and I \nare reintroducing our bill to increase mandatory funding for the Child \nCare and Development Block Grant, CCDBG. Our legislation, the Children \nFirst Act would increase the mandatory funding stream of CCDBG by $11.2 \nbillion over the next five years.\n  Congress understands that working families need help paying for child \ncare. Indeed, funding for CCDBG has grown significantly over the past \nseveral years. Yet despite these increases, funding still only reaches \none in seven eligible children nationwide, leaving approximately 12.9 \nmillion eligible children without any assistance. Roughly 500,000 \nchildren are on waiting lists for help around the country and 21,000 \nchildren are on the waiting list for child care assistance in \nMassachusetts.\n  The need for child care assistance in Massachusetts is tremendous. \nCurrently, 60 percent of Massachusetts children under age six have \nmothers in the workforce, and 16.4 percent of Massachusetts children \nunder age five live in poverty. Child care costs at an urban center for \na four-year-old averages $8,121 per year and the costs for an infant \naverages $12,978. That's 223 percent more than the cost of public \ncollege tuition in Massachusetts! It's just shocking to me, Mr. \nPresident, that we expect families to bear the burden of such costly \nchild care services, they simply cannot afford to do it and are forced \neither not to work or to leave their children in substandard, and many \ntimes even dangerous care. CCDBG is a critically important program to \nhelping poor families afford child care, but we haven't done nearly \nenough to fill the existing child care gap. Even combining CCDBG and \nstate child care funding in Massachusetts only reaches 13 percent of \neligible children.\n  Senator Bingaman and I led the effort to increase child care funding \nduring the welfare reform debate last year and we will do so again this \nyear. But today there is an even more dire need for child care funding \nthan there was one year ago. State governments face a fiscal crisis of \nhistorical proportions and as a result have been forced to make severe \ncuts in social services. In fact child care subsidies for working \nparents have been scaled back in a number of states. Unfortunately it's \nlikely that the federal government may compound those state cuts. The \nFY 2003 Omnibus Appropriations bill passed last week by the Senate \nwould cut CCDBG discretionary funds by approximately $60.9 million \nbelow FY 2002 levels. As a result, 38,000 fewer children would have \naccess to child care assistance at a time when only one in seven \neligible children receive services.\n  Increased availability and the quality of child care helps achieve \ntwo important goals: First, it enables low-income parents on welfare \nand parents trying to stay off welfare to work and support their \nfamilies. And second, it provides the early learning experiences that \nour children need to do well in school. Studies show that when child \ncare is available, and when families get help paying for care, they are \nmore likely to work. Children in high quality early care score higher \non reading and math tests, are more likely to complete high school and \ngo onto college, and are less likely to repeat a grade or get charged \nin juvenile court.\n  Increased child care funding is an investment that we cannot afford \nNOT to make. I look forward to teaming up with Senator Bingaman in the \nFinance Committee during welfare reauthorization to increase CCDBG \nfunding. I urge all of my colleagues to join us in the fight to provide \nall working families with safe, high-quality child care.\n\n                                 S. 262\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XXI of the Social Security Act to \nextend the availability of allotments to States for fiscal years 1998 \nthrough 2000, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Children's \nHealth Protection and Eligibility Act. I am delighted to be joined on \nthis bill by my good friend, Senator Patty Murray. Senator Murray has \nbeen a champion for children's health issues throughout her career in \nthe Senate. This important legislation addresses the allocation of \nbudgeted but unspent SCHIP funds that are currently out of reach of \nStates and, under current law, are scheduled to be returned to the \nFederal treasury. This legislation also helps those States with the \nhighest unemployment rates use more of their SCHIP dollars to provide \nhealth insurance coverage for low-income children.\n  Washington State is in the middle of an economic crisis resulting \nfrom a downturn in both our aviation and high-tech sectors. With the \njobless rate at seven percent, we have one of the highest unemployment \nrates in the country. 214,300 Washingtonians are unable to find work. \nAnd just over the last month, our State has lost 2,946 jobs, and over \n50 percent of those are in the high-paying manufacturing sector.\n  In 2000, before the recession began, there were 780,000 uninsured \npeople in Washington State, including 155,000 children. That number has \nsurely grown as the economy has worsened and our population has risen. \nIn fact, in October, the Census Bureau reported that the number of \nuninsured increased for the first time in two years. Sadly, there are \n41.2 million people nationwide without health insurance, 8.5 million of \nwhom are children.\n  The increasing number of uninsured isn't the only problem facing the \nhealth care system. Last September, the Kaiser Family Foundation \nreported the largest increase in health insurance premium costs since \n1990, while the Center for Studying Health System Change found that \nhealth care spending has returned to double-digit growth for the first \ntime since that year.\n  The lack of health insurance has very real consequences. We know that \nthe uninsured are four times as likely as the insured to delay or \nforego needed care, and uninsured children are six times as likely as \ninsured children to go without needed medical care. Health insurance \nmatters for kids, and coverage today defrays costs tomorrow.\n  Five years ago, Congress created a new $40 billion State grant \nprogram to provide health insurance to low-income, uninsured children \nwho live in families that earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but not \nenough to afford private insurance. In most States, the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, SCHIP has been extremely \nsuccessful. Nearly one million children gained coverage each year \nthrough\n\n[[Page S1828]]\n\nSCHIP and, by December 2001, 3.5 million children were enrolled in the \nprogram.\n  Unfortunately, however, not all States have been able to participate \nin this success, and perversely, the States that have been left out are \nthose that had taken bold initiatives by expanding their Medicaid \nprograms to cover low-income children at higher levels of poverty. \nSadly, the recession and high unemployment means that the health \ninsurance coverage we do have for children, pregnant women, and low-\nincome individuals is in jeopardy due to State budget crises.\n  Washington State has been a leader in providing health insurance to \nour constituents. We have long provided optional coverage to Medicaid \npopulations and began covering children up to 200 percent of poverty in \n1994, three years before Congress passed SCHIP.\n  When SCHIP was enacted in 1997, most States were prohibited from \nusing the new funding for already covered populations. This flaw made \nit difficult for Washington to access the money and essentially \npenalized the few States that had led the nation on expanding coverage \nfor kids. This means that my State only receives the enhanced SCHIP \nmatching dollars for covering kids between 200 and 250 percent of \nthe Federal poverty level. Washington has been able to use less than \nfour percent of the funding the Federal Government gave us for SCHIP.\n\n  Today, Washington has the highest unemployment in the country, an \nenormous budget deficit, and may need to cut as many as 150,000 kids \nfrom the Medicaid roles. Because it is penalized by SCHIP rules and \ncannot use funds like other states, Washington State is sending $95 \nmillion back to the federal treasury or to other States. This defies \ncommon sense, and I do not believe that innovative States should be \npenalized for having expanded coverage to children before the enactment \nof SCHIP.\n  This is why we are introducing the Children's Health Protection and \nEligibility Act. This bill will give States the ability to use SCHIP \nfunds more efficiently to prevent the loss of health care coverage for \nchildren. This bill targets expiring funds to States that otherwise may \nhave to cut health care coverage for kids. States that have made a \ncommitment to insuring children could use expiring SCHIP funds and a \nportion of current SCHIP funds on a short-term basis to maintain access \nto health care coverage for all low-income children in the State. The \nbill also ensures that all States that have demonstrated a commitment \nto providing health care coverage to children can access SCHIP funds in \nthe same manner to support children's health care coverage.\n  First, as my colleagues know, 1998 and 1999 state allotments \n``expired'' at the end of fiscal year 2002 and are scheduled to be \nreturned to the Federal treasury. Our bill allows States to keep their \nremaining 1998 and 1999 funds, and use these funds for the purposes of \nthis legislation.\n  Second, unused SCHIP dollars from the fiscal year 2000 allotment are \ndue to be redistributed at the end of fiscal year 2002 among those \nStates that have spent all of their SCHIP funds. Our bill would allow \nthe retention and redistribution of these funds as was done two years \nago through the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and \nProtection Act P.L. 106-554. However, under our bill, States that had \nan unemployment rate higher than six percent for two consecutive months \nin 2002 would be eligible to keep all of their unspent 2000 SCHIP \nallotment.\n  Third, at State option, for certain Medicaid expenditures, qualifying \nStates would receive the difference between their Medicaid Federal \nmatching assistance percentage, or FMAP, and their enhanced SCHIP \nmatching rate. This temporary measure would be paid out of a State's \ncurrent SCHIP allotment to ensure children's health care coverage does \nnot erode as States face enormous budget deficits. States would be able \nto use any remaining funds from fiscal years 1998, 1999, and 2000 SCHIP \nallotments, plus ten percent of fiscal 2001, 2002, and 2003 allotments.\n  Finally, our bill allows States that have expanded coverage to the \nhighest eligibility levels allowed under SCHIP, and meet certain \nrequirements, to receive the enhanced SCHIP match rate for any kids \nthat had previously been covered above the mandatory level.\n  Children are the leaders of tomorrow; they are the very future of our \ngreat Nation. We owe them nothing less than the sum of our energies, \nour talents, and our efforts in providing them a foundation on which to \nbuild happy, healthy and productive lives. During this tough economic \ntime, it is more important than ever to maintain existing health care \ncoverage for children in order to hold down health care costs and to \nkeep children healthy. I urge my colleagues to join us in support of \nthis bill.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to join with Senator \nCantwell in introducing the Children's Health Protection and \nEligibility Act. This important legislation will ensure that low income \nchildren in Washington State are not denied access to health insurance \ncoverage. The legislation provides a fair and equitable distribution of \nunobligated State balances in the CHIP program. It ensures that States \nlike Washington that have led the Nation in caring for their children \nare not denied access to vital CHIP dollars. It rewards Washington \nstate for putting children first.\n  Washington State is facing the greatest fiscal crisis since World War \nII. Between June 2001 and November 2002, Washington State lost more \nthan 74,000 non-farm jobs. This economic recession has hit families in \nWashington state hard.\n  In 2002, before the recession began, there were 155,000 uninsured \nchildren in Washington State. Current estimates place this number even \nhigher. With additional layoffs and more families losing COBRA \ncoverage, the number of uninsured children will only continue to grow. \nWashington State must have access to its CHIP dollars to prevent more \nchildren from losing their health care safety net.\n  Because Washington State was so far ahead of the rest of the Nation \nin 1997, when CHIP was enacted, our state has been unable to use its \nfull allocation. A majority of children who would be eligible for \nparticipation in CHIP were already covered in 1997 under the Medicaid \nprogram. As a result, Washington State has been unable to count these \nchildren as ``CHIP'' The federal share of CHIP is currently 67 percent \nas opposed to Medicaid, which provides only a 50 percent match for \nWashington state. If the State was able to provide coverage for some of \nthese low income children under CHIP, it would reduce pressure on our \nstate's Medicaid program. Without this relief, Washington State will \nface additional Medicaid reductions. Many of the children that \ncurrently have coverage will lose this coverage and join the ranks of \nthe uninsured.\n  Allowing the number of children without insurance to grow is both \ninhumane for our children and irresponsible for our society. Uninsured \nchildren are six times as likely as insured children to go without \nneeded medication. Uninsured children are more likely to be treated in \nthe emergency room than insured children. These children are showing up \nmore and more in the emergency room to get basic primary care. The cost \nof providing this care only increases as their families are forced to \ndelay care. We all pay when children go without health insurance \ncoverage.\n  This is not just a question of saving money. Providing comprehensive, \nprevention-based health insurance to children is a sound investment. \nDelaying this care only adds to the overall cost of health care, \neducation and our criminal justice system. This legislation that we are \nintroducing puts our kids at the front of the line.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with us in support of this legislation. \nLet's send the right message to our States: If you do the right thing, \nyou will no longer be denied your fair allocation. Instead, you will be \nrewarded for putting children first.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself, Mr. Schumer, and Mrs. Clinton):\n  S. 265. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to include \nsports utility vehicles in the limitation on the depreciation of \ncertain luxury automobiles; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the ``The SUV \nBusiness Tax Loophole Closure Act'' along with\n\n[[Page S1829]]\n\nSenator Schumer and Senator Clinton to close a loophole in tax law that \nsome are inappropriately using to deduct a majority of the cost of the \nlargest SUVs on the market.\n  To encourage small business growth, Congress has created a number of \nmechanisms for small business owners and the self-employed to be able \nto deduct a variety of capital expenses immediately. In order to keep \npeople from abusing these deductions to buy passenger cars for personal \nuse and call it a business expense, Congress capped the deduction for \ncar purchases at $7,660 in the first year, and $4,900 in the second \nyear after the purchase.\n  But to help farmers and small business owners that need pick-up \ntrucks or vans for business purposes, Congress excluded from the car \ncap those vehicles that weigh more than 6,000 pounds. Vehicles larger \nthan 6,000 pounds are eligible for the full capital expense--$25,000. \nThis tax policy was created before the advent of SUVs, many of which \nweigh more than 6,000 pounds.\n  As a result, people who do not need a large vehicle for business \npurposes are buying the largest Hummer SUVs, Mercedes SUVs, BMW SUVs \nand other super-sized SUVs and deducting a significant portion of the \ncost from their taxes immediately. If they were to buy anything smaller \nthan the largest of SUVs, then they would not get the larger tax \ndeduction because the lower weight puts the SUV under the luxury car \ncap. This distorts the market, pushing up demand for the largest of all \nSUVs at a huge cost to the taxpayer.\n  To fix this problem, my legislation places the purchases of SUVs \nweighing more than 6,000 pounds under the same tax deduction cap placed \non the purchase of cars. That would end the market distorting incentive \nthat encourages small business people such as accountants, lawyers, and \nconsultants to buy a Hummer when they do not need a Hummer for business \npurposes.\n  Let me give you an example. Karl Wizinsky, a health care consultant \nin Michigan, bought a $47,000 Ford Excursion earlier this year and was \nable to write off $32,000 of the purchase price as a business expense. \nHe was not even thinking about buying a new car until he heard about \nthe deduction. In the December 18, 2002 Detroit News article, he said \n``We really did it, bought the SUV, because it is a pretty hefty \ndeduction.'' Now, a health care consultant may need to carry medical \nsamples around town but he certainly does not need a 6,000 pound, \nextra-large SUV to do it and we should not be subsidizing that \npurchase. The group ``Taxpayers for Common Sense'' estimates that the \nSUV tax loophole costs government between $840 million and $987 million \nfor every 100,000 SUVs over 6,000 pounds sold to business.\n  I propose to fix the problem by including extra-large SUVs under the \nsame deduction cap we have in place for cars. In order to ensure that \nfarmers and small business owners can still get the tax credit to \npurchase trucks for hauling or vans for transporting products, I have \ncarved out SUVs very carefully. The bill specifically allows the larger \ndeduction for any vehicle which: No. 1. does not have the primary load \ncarrying device or container attached; No. 2. has a seating capacity of \nmore than 12 people; No. 3. is designed for more than 9 persons in \nseating rearward of the driver's seat; No. 4. is equipped with an open \ncargo area, for example a pick-up truck or box bed, of 72 inches in \ninterior length or more; or No. 5. has an integral enclosure, fully \nenclosing the driver compartment and load carrying device and having no \nbody section protruding more than 30 inches ahead of the leading edge \nof the windshield. This will allow the larger deduction to continue to \nbe taken for the purchase of vehicles that small businesses and farmers \ntruly need, including pick-up trucks and cargo vans.\n  I know that Congress never intended for the SUV tax loophole to \nexist, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to close it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 267. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor a deferral of tax on gain from the sale of telecommunications \nbusinesses in specific circumstances or a tax credit and other \nincentives to promote diversity of ownership in telecommunications \nbusinesses; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the \nTelecommunications Ownership Diversity Act of 2003. This legislation is \ndesigned to ensure that more Americans have an opportunity to provide \ntheir distinct voices in today's telecommunications marketplace. In \naddition to providing competition by certain small businesses, this \nbill would encourage ownership by individuals who are currently \nunderrepresented in the ownership of telecommunications companies, \nincluding minorities and women, by making carefully crafted changes in \nthe tax code.\n  The bill would institute market-based, voluntary measures designed to \nachieve this goal. It would provide sellers of telecommunications \nassets a tax deferral when those assets are bought for cash by certain \nsmall businesses. It would also provide investors an incentive to \nconsider certain small businesses by providing a reduction in the tax \non gains from investment in these companies.\n  Today, transactions in the telecommunications industry are routinely \nvalued in the billions of dollars. Even radio, which has traditionally \nbeen a comparatively easier telecom segment to enter, has been priced \nout of the range of most would-be entrants. Given the significant cost \nof participating in this industry, the limited club of media and other \ntelecommunications owners may not always include certain small \nbusinesses.\n  This morning, I chaired a hearing in the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation on media ownership. We heard of the \ndifficulties small minority-owned businesses experience when trying to \nraise the capital necessary to enter this business. Minorities are \nwoefully underrepresented in the ownership of commercial broadcast \nfacilities. As of December 2000, minorities owned an estimated 3.8 \npercent of these facilities in the United States, despite representing \nan estimated 29 percent of the total United States population. The bill \ndoes not mandate ownership levels by any specific group. But it does \nensure that certain small businesses are on equal footing with large \ncompanies. We should ensure that the American media landscape includes \nopportunities for these voices to be heard.\n  Too often today, new entrants and small businesses lose out on \nopportunities to purchase telecom assets because they don't offer \nsellers the same tax treatment as their larger competitors. A small \npurchaser's cash offer triggers tax liability, while a larger \npurchaser's stock offer may be accepted effectively tax-free. When an \nentity chooses to sell a telecom business, our tax laws should not make \none bidder more attractive than another.\n  The goal of viewpoint diversity has been at the center of recent \ndebate over media ownership rules. While it is important to discuss the \nrelative merits of ownership restrictions, we must also consider \nmarket-based, voluntary methods of facilitating entry and diversity of \nownership. And that's what this legislation would do.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 267\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Telecommunications Ownership \n     Diversification Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Current trends in the telecommunications industry show \n     that there is increasing convergence among various media, \n     including broadcasting, cable television, and Internet-based \n     businesses, that provide news, information, and \n     entertainment.\n       (2) This convergence will continue, and therefore, \n     diversifying the ownership of telecommunications facilities \n     remains a preeminent public interest concern that should be \n     reflected in both telecommunications and tax policy.\n       (3) A market-based, voluntary system of investment \n     incentives is an effective, lawful, and economically sound \n     means of facilitating entry and diversification of ownership \n     in the telecommunications industry.\n       (4) Opportunities for new entrants to participate and grow \n     in the telecommunications industry have substantially \n     decreased since the end of the Federal Communications\n\n[[Page S1830]]\n\n     Commission's tax certificate policy in 1995, particularly in \n     light of the availability of tax-free like-kind exchanges, \n     despite the most robust period of transfers of radio and \n     television stations in history. During this time, businesses \n     owned or controlled by socially disadvantaged individuals, \n     including, but not limited to, members of minority groups and \n     women, have continued to be underrepresented as owners of \n     telecommunications facilities.\n       (5) Businesses owned or controlled by socially \n     disadvantaged individuals are, and historically have been, \n     economically disadvantaged in the telecommunications \n     industry. For these businesses, access to and cost of capital \n     are and have been substantial obstacles to new entry and \n     growth. Consequently, diversification of ownership in the \n     telecommunications industry has been limited.\n       (6) Telecommunications facilities owned by new entrants may \n     not be attractive to investors because their start-up costs \n     are often high, their revenue streams are uncertain, and \n     their profit margins are unknown.\n       (7) It is consistent with the public interest and with the \n     pro-competition policies of the Telecommunications Act of \n     1996 to provide incentives that will facilitate investments \n     in, and acquisition of, telecommunications facilities by \n     economically and socially disadvantaged businesses, thereby \n     diversifying the ownership of telecommunications facilities.\n       (8) Increased participation by economically and socially \n     disadvantaged businesses in the ownership of \n     telecommunications facilities will enhance competition in the \n     telecommunications industry. Permitting sellers of \n     telecommunications facilities to defer taxation of gains from \n     transactions involving economically and socially \n     disadvantaged businesses, or certain small businesses \n     supported by investments from the Telecommunications \n     Development Fund that provides capital for such businesses, \n     will further the development of a competitive and diverse \n     United States telecommunications industry without \n     governmental intrusion in private investment decisions.\n       (9) The public interest would not be served by attempts to \n     diversify the ownership of telecommunications businesses \n     through any approach that would involve the use of mandated \n     set-asides or quotas.\n       (10) Today, the telecommunications industry is struggling \n     to survive one of its most troubling times. Therefore, \n     facilitating voluntary, pro-competitive transactions that \n     will promote ownership of telecommunications facilities by \n     economically and socially disadvantaged businesses and \n     certain small businesses will aid in providing the investment \n     and capital that is crucial to this sector.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to facilitate \n     voluntary, pro-competitive transactions that will promote \n     ownership of telecommunications facilities by economically \n     and socially disadvantaged businesses and certain small \n     businesses.\n\n      SEC. 3.

These students, concerned \nwith the lack of a memorial in our Nation's Capital to honor members of \nour armed forces who lost their lives during peacekeeping missions such \nas the one in Somalia, felt compelled to take action.\n  The motivation and vision of these young people propelled them to \nspearhead a campaign to establish a Pyramid of Remembrance in \nWashington, DC, which would honor U.S. service men and women who have \nlost their lives during peacekeeping operations, humanitarian efforts, \ntraining, terrorist attacks, or covert operations. The student not only \nproposed the memorial, they created a private non-profit foundation to \nraise the money to construct it. Along with the support of their \ncommunity, who provided legal counsel for the students and private \ndonations to help fund the project, their hard work and dedication has \nfacilitated a Pyramid of Remembrance which would be built at little or \nno cost to the taxpayer.\n  In April 2001, the National Capital Memorial Commission, charged with \noverseeing monument construction in Washington, DC, held hearings about \nthe proposed Pyramid of Remembrance. The Commission recommended that \nthe memorial be constructed on Defense Department land, possibly at \nFort McNair. The commissioners also noted that such a memorial would \nindeed fill a void in our Nation's military monuments.\n  On May 6, 1999, I spoke on the Senate floor in honor of two brave \nAmerican soldiers, Chief Warrant Officer Kevin L. Reichert and Chief \nWarrant Officer David A. Gibbs, who lost their lives when their Apache \nhelicopter crashed into the Albanian mountains during a routine \ntraining exercise on May 5, 1999, as U.S. troops joined with our NATO \nallies in a military campaign against Slobodan Milosevic. As I remarked \nat the time, the United States owes Kevin, David and so many other \nservice members a debt of gratitude that we will never be able to \nrepay, for they have paid the ultimate sacrifice. As the Bible says in \nJohn, chapter 15:13, ``Greater love has no man than this, that a man \nlay down his life for his friends.''\n  We must also remember and honor the lives of brave men and women who \nhave lost their lives while defending our freedom during the global \ncampaign against terrorism. Tragically, ten service members, including \nthree men from the State of Ohio, lost their lives on February 21, \n2002, when a CH-47 Chinook helicopter crashed in the Philippines. They \nare Army Captain Bartt Owens of Franklin, OH; Army Chief Warrant \nOfficer Jody Egnor of Middletown, OH; and Air Force Master Sgt. William \nMcDaniel of Fort Jefferson, OH. As our Nation continues to engage in \nthe war against terror, we must not forget the sacrifice that these men \nhave made for their country and the freedom of all Americans.\n  The patriotism, dedication, and vision of the students at Riverside \nHigh School are commendable. I support and applaud the work they have \ndone to make the Pyramid of Remembrance a reality and I believe it is \nour duty to honor American men and women in uniform who have lost their \nlives while serving their country, whether in peacetime or during war.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 268\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 to further \nthe conservation of certain wildlife species; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Captive \nWildlife Safety Act, a firm commitment to protect public safety and the \nwelfare of wild cats that are increasingly being kept as pets. I am \njoined by Senator Ensign of Nevada, Senator Wyden of Oregon and Senator \nLevin of Michigan as original co-sponsors of this legislation.\n  This bill amends the Lacy Act Amendment of 1981 to bar the interstate \nand foreign commerce of carnivorous wild cats, including lions, tigers, \nleopards, cheetahs, and cougars. The legislation would not ban all \nprivate ownership of these prohibited species, but would outlaw the \ncommerce of these animals for use as pets.\n  Current figures estimate that there are more than 5,000 tigers in \ncaptivity in the United States. In fact, there are more tigers in \ncaptivity in the United States than there are in native habitats \nthroughout the range in Asia. While some tigers are kept in zoos, most \nof these animals are kept as pets, living in cages behind someone's \nhouse, in a State that does not restrict private ownership of dangerous \nanimals.\n  Tigers are not the only animals sought as exotic pets. Today there \nare more than 1,000 web sites that specialize in the trade of lions, \ncougars, and leopards to promote them as domestic pets.\n  Untrained owners are not capable of meeting the needs of these \nanimals. Local veterinarians, animal shelters, and local governments \nare ill equipped to meet the challenge of providing for their proper \ncare. If they are to be kept in captivity, these animals must be cared \nfor by trained professionals who can meet their behavioral, nutrition, \nand physical needs.\n  People who live near these animals are also in real danger. These \ncats are large and powerful animals, capable of injuring or killing \ninnocent people. There are countless stories of many unfortunate and \nunnecessary incidents where dangerous exotic cats have endangered \npublic safety. Last year in Lexington, TX, a three-year-old boy was \nkilled by his stepfather's pet tiger. In Loxahatchee, FL, a 58 year-old \nwoman was bitten on the head by a 750 pound Siberian-Bengal Tiger being \nkept as a pet, and in Quitman, AR, four 600 to 800 pound tigers escaped \nfrom a ``private safari''. Parents living nearby sat in their front \nyards with high-powered rifles, guarding their children at play, \nfrightened that the wild tigers might attack them.\n  This is a balanced approach that preserves the rights of those \nalready regulated by the Department of Agriculture under the Animal \nWelfare Act such as circuses, zoos, and research facilities. This Act \nspecifically targets unregulated and untrained individuals who are \nmaintaining these wild cats as exotic pets.\n  The Captive Wildlife Safety Act represents an emerging consensus on \nthe need for comprehensive federal legislation to regulate what animals \ncan be kept as pets. The United States Department of Agriculture \nstates, ``Large wild and exotic cats such as lions, tigers, cougars, \nand leopards are dangerous animals . . . Because of these animals' \npotential to kill or severely injure both people and other animals, an \nuntrained person should not keep them as pets. Doing so poses serious \nrisks to family, friends, neighbors, and the general public. Even an \nanimal that can be friendly and lovable can be very dangerous.''\n  The American Veterinary Medical Association also ``strongly opposes \nthe keeping of wild carnivore species of animals as pets and believes \nthat all commercial traffic of these animals for such purpose should be \nprohibited.''\n  This bill preserves those local regulations already in existence. \nFull bans are already in place in 12 States and partial bans have been \nenacted in 7 States. I sincerely hope that grass roots organizations \ncontinue to encourage State and local governments to ban the private \nownership of exotic cats.\n  The Captive Wildlife Safety Act is supported by the Association of \nZoos and Aquariums, the Humane Society of the United States, the Funds \nfor Animals, and the International Fund for Animal Welfare.\n  No one should be endangered by those who cannot properly keep these \nanimals. Exotic cats in captivity should be able to live humanely and \nhealthfully.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this legislation and look forward to \nworking with our partners in the House to enact the Captive Wildlife \nSafety Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 269\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Captive Wildlife Safety \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITION OF PROHIBITED WILDLIFE SPECIES.\n\n       Section 2 of the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 (16 U.S.C. \n     3371) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating subsections (g) through (j) as \n     subsections (h) through (k), respectively; and\n       (2) by inserting after subsection (f) the following:\n       ``(k) Prohibited wildlife species.--The term `prohibited \n     wildlife species' means any live lion, tiger, leopard, \n     cheetah, jaguar, or cougar.''.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, today, I am pleased to be joined by my \ndistinguished colleagues in introducing legislation that addresses the \nwelfare of exotic animals throughout the country. Specifically, this \nbill prohibits the interstate shipment of exotic animals; namely lions, \ncheetahs, tigers, jaguars, and leopards. Only zoos, circuses, \nsanctuaries, universities, licensed breeders and other Federal and \nState licensed facilities are exempted from this prohibition.\n  During my days as a practicing veterinarian, I saw firsthand exotic \nanimals mistreated by owners who were ill-prepared to care for them. \nAll too often, large cats are put in cages that are too small to \naccommodate their growing needs. Owners often buy a young tiger or cat, \npaying more attention to their cuddly exterior rather\n\n[[Page S1834]]\n\nthan the overwhelming responsibility that comes along with raising an \nanimal that will grow into a large, wild, predator.\n  In my home State of Nevada, there is a burgeoning population of \nexotic animals being kept as pets. I have been contacted by animal \ncontrol centers throughout the State that are called to aid in \nsituations where a wild tiger or lion has escaped and run amok. In \nthese situations, not only are the owners and the animal control \nprofessionals in danger, so too are children and other neighbors who \nmay be in the wrong place at the wrong time. These animals' instinct is \nto attack, and they will do so, if given the opportunity. That is why \nonly highly trained individuals who have the know-how and the resources \nshould be able to own exotic animals.\n  In fact, I am informed that officials in Nye County in my home State, \nare working to pass a county ordinance that would ban the ownership of \nexotic animals because of the threat these animals pose to public \nsafety. We have the support and backing of the Humane Society of the \nUnited States, the American Veterinary Medical Association, and the \nAmerican Zoo and Aquarium Association.\n  This legislation protects the public, but also ensures that the \nanimals receive the best care possible from certified and trained \nowners. I look forward to having the overwhelming support of my \ncolleagues in the Senate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Smith, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Reed, \n        Mr. Durbin, Mr. Sarbanes, Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Cantwell, and Mr. \n        Rockefeller):\n  S. 270. A bill to provide for additional weeks of temporary extended \nunemployment compensation, to provide for a program of temporary \nenhanced unemployment benefits, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, Congress took an important step forward \nfor working families earlier this month by providing unemployment \nbenefits for nearly 3 million jobless Americans. These benefits are a \nlifeline for the millions of workers who have lost their jobs through \nno fault of their own, but as we all know, there is much more work to \nbe done on this basic issue. One million workers have run out of their \nState and Federal benefits and remain without jobs. Clearly, these \nworkers deserve our help too.\n  In fact, there is an additional category of workers who have not even \nreceived a dime of unemployment benefits. They paid into the \nunemployment insurance fund, and they lost their jobs due to the \nfailing economy, but they have been left behind by the outdated \neligibility rules in our unemployment laws.\n  Today, I am introducing the Economic Security Act of 2003 to cover \nthe 1 million who have exhausted their benefits, as well as the nearly \n1 million low-wage and part-time workers currently not eligible for \nunemployment benefits, and to increase benefit levels to help keep \nfamilies out of poverty during periods of unemployment.\n  Nationally, only about half of unemployed workers received \nunemployment benefits last year. This number has dropped precipitously \nsince 1975 when 75 percent of unemployed workers received benefits. \nThis increasingly serious problem is a result of laws implemented in \nthe 1980s to restrict eligibility for the unemployment insurance \nprogram. Because of these restrictions, many of the unemployed workers \nwho do not receive benefits today are excluded because they are part-\ntime or low-wage workers.\n  In all but 12 States, low-wage workers are ineligible for benefits \nbecause their most recent earnings are not counted. As a result, many \nformer welfare recipients--success stories who have recently entered \nthe workforce, have now lost their jobs because of the economic down-\nturn, but they are being denied the unemployment benefits they deserve. \nMany minimum wage workers, who work hard and play by the rules and have \nnot seen a raise in 6 years, are also left behind. Those low-income \nworkers are now left without a safety net.\n  In addition, the majority of States do not provide benefits to part-\ntime workers, despite the fact that part-time workers are an essential \npart of the labor force. They now comprise nearly 20 percent of the \nworkforce. Part-time workers also represent a large share of the \nunemployed, one in five unemployed workers today were working part-time \nbefore they lost their jobs. Women now represent 70 percent of the \npart-time workforce, compared with 44 percent of full-time workers, and \n17.5 percent of part-time workers earn less than $15,000 a year. \nDespite their significant labor force role, part-time working adults \nare half as likely as full-time workers to receive unemployment \ninsurance benefits. Nationally, only 12 percent of unemployed part-time \nworkers receive unemployment benefits.\n  Under the Economic Security Act, the Federal Government will \nreimburse States for 1 year for the cost of providing unemployment \nbenefits to two categories of workers: 1. Those who would be eligible \nfor regular unemployment compensation if their last completed quarter \nof earnings is included in their wage record, and 2. those seeking \npart-time employment.\n  The bill will also provide Federal funds to states to increase the \nlevel of unemployment benefits. Sadly, these benefits today are often \nnot sufficient to meet basic needs such as paying the rent or putting \nfood on the table. In 2000, the average unemployment benefit replaced \nonly 33 percent of workers' lost income, a steep drop from the 46 \npercent of wages replaced by benefits during the recessions of the \n1970's and 1980's. During an economic crisis, unemployed workers have \nfew opportunities to rejoin a declining workforce. They depend on \nunemployment benefits to live.\n  Raising benefits will enable these workers to support their families \nand invest more in the economy. They immediately spend their \nunemployment insurance benefits in their communities, and that spending \nwill provide a needed, immediate stimulus to the economy. In fact, \nevery dollar spent on unemployment benefits boosts the economy by \n$2.15.\n  The Economic Security Act of 2003 will provide Federal reimbursements \nfor states which increase their weekly unemployment checks by the \ngreater of 15 percent or $25 for 1 year. Under this provision, the \naverage recipient will have an extra $135 a month. Unemployed \nhouseholds will use this amount to help pay the rent, buy groceries, \nkeep the family car running, or hire a babysitter during job interview. \nThis boost in unemployment benefits will stimulate the economy and help \nthese laid-off workers support their families while they look for a new \njob.\n  State unemployment insurance administrators often fall short of the \nfunds they need to administer benefits efficiently and promptly, and to \nsee that all who are eligible receive their benefits. The Act provides \n$500 million to State Unemployment offices to offset the administrative \nexpenses associated with implementing the new coverage and benefit \nchanges, and to provide better employment services to workers receiving \nunemployment compensation.\n  Congress cannot continue to ignore the plight of millions of \nAmericans hurt by economic forces beyond their control. As we work \ntogether to get the economy moving again, we must also work together to \nsee that no one is left behind. We have a responsibility to give help \nand hope to these deserving Americans by strengthening unemployment \ninsurance to cover all unemployed workers, and I urge my colleagues to \ngive high priority to this needed reform.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH (for himself, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Schumer, and Ms. \n        Snowe):\n  S. 271. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow an \nadditional advance refunding of bonds originally issued to finance \ngovernmental facilities used for essential governmental functions; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, with my friend \nand colleague, Senator Corzine, the ``Municipal Debt Refinancing Act of \n2003.'' We are pleased to be joined by Senator Schumer and Senator \nSnowe in this bipartisan effort. This important legislation will allow \nStates and localities access to low cost capital during this current \nperiod of fiscal crisis, allowing cities to take advantage of low \ninterest\n\n[[Page S1835]]\n\nrates by permitting an additional advance refunding of most tax-exempt \ngovernmental bonds. This bill provides Oregon cities like Portland, \nEugene or Salem, all of which issue municipal bonds, with an increased \nability to ease some of the budgetary constraints they currently face.\n  When interest rates fall, homeowners often seek to refinance their \nmortgages to reduce interest costs. Similarly, State and local \ngovernments take advantage of low interest rates by refinancing \noutstanding high-cost debt. However, unlike homeowners who can usually \nrefinance at any time, municipalities can only redeem existing debt on \nspecific dates, known as call dates. If an issuer would benefit from a \nrefunding transaction but the existing bonds are not currently eligible \nto be called, the issuer can still refinance by executing an ``advance \nrefunding.'' In this case, the State or local government issues advance \nrefunding bonds and the proceeds of the new bonds are held in reserve \nto pay the interest and principal on the old bonds until they become \ncallable.\n  The Federal tax code prohibits tax-exempt bond issuers from advance \nrefunding most bonds more than once. Therefore, if a bond has been \nadvance refunded once and interest rates fall to the point where a \nState or local government would benefit from an additional advance \nrefunding, the issuer is precluded from taking advantage of the lower \nrates.\n  Under current law, bonds originally issued after 1985 may only be \nadvance refunded once. Bonds issued before 1986 may be advance refunded \ntwice. Second, most private activity bonds may not be advance refunded. \nIn the past, Congress has considered amending Section 149 of the Code \nto allow an additional advance refunding of bonds originally issued to \nfinance governmental facilities used for ``essential government \nfunctions''.\n  ``Essential government functions,'' as currently defined in tax \nregulations, include facilities ``owned by a governmental person and \nthat are available for use by the general public.'' In practice, such \nan approach would likely encompass most bonds issued to finance \nfacilities owned by State or local governments. One way to limit the \nrevenue cost of this proposal would be to impose a sunset on the \nexpanded advance refunding authority. This would also encourage \nmunicipal bond issuers to take advantage of the additional advance \nrefunding more immediately, maximizing the proposal's potential \neconomic simulative effect.\n  State and local access to capital at the lowest possible cost is \ncritical at this time and vital to Oregon's long-term economic growth. \nFurther, tax-exempt bonds fund a wide variety of capital infrastructure \nprojects such as schools, roads and highways, bridges, water and sewer \nsystems, airports, and parks, among many others. As Oregon faces a \nfiscal crisis on such a large scale, this advance refunding is an \ninnovative way the federal government can help cities and towns provide \nvital infrastructure and services for Oregonians. I ask all my \ncolleagues to join Senator Corzine and me in sponsoring this important \nlegislation that will help municipalities across this Nation.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this legislation printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 271\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide incentives for charitable contributions by \nindividuals and businesses, to improve the public disclosure of \nactivities of exempt organizations, and to enhance the ability of low \nincome Americans to gain financial security by building assets, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I want to express support on behalf of \nThe Charity Aid, Recovery and Empowerment, CARE, Act of 2003, which I \nam introducing today with Senator Lieberman, Finance Committee Chairman \nGrassley, Senator Bayh, Majority Leader Frist and other bipartisan \ncosponsors with the support of President Bush. The CARE Act was \nintroduced in the last Congress and was considered by the Senate \nFinance Committee but was never debated on the floor of the Senate \nbecause of repeated objections to unanimous consent requests to bring \nup the bill. The time has come to move this important resources package \nforward to help those in need and to assist those charitable \norganizations walking alongside them to restore families and \ncommunities.\n  The CARE Act reflects America's renewed spirit of unity, community \nand responsibility in the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks \nand the new challenges that have faced us since then. It is an \nimportant legislative package to encourage giving, saving, and fairness \nwhich builds on the President's Faith-Based and Community Initiative. \nThis bipartisan consensus bill seeks to harness the potential of \ncharitable organizations in order to better serve the most needy \nmembers of our society in partnership with government efforts. A \ncoalition of more than 1,600 national and grassroots charitable \norganizations helping those in need endorsed nearly similar legislation \nlast year. The bill offers incentives to individuals and corporations \nto increase charitable giving, rewards low-income citizens who choose \nto save, and insists on fairness for faith-based organizations by \nleveling the playing field so that non-governmental organizations \ninvolved in charitable activities may compete for government funds to \nprovide social service delivery.\n  Throughout our country many social entrepreneurs and community \nhealers are making a difference in the lives of those who are \nstruggling and in the neighborhoods and communities seeking to revive \nthemselves in the face of poverty, crime, failing schools, and \nunemployment. Many of these heroic individuals and organizations are \nalso motivated by faith. For example, more than 75 percent of the food \nbanks across our Nation have a religious affiliation.\n  The CARE Act attempts to help with the current challenges that \ncharitable organizations are facing and expand the base of private and \ngovernmental resources well into the future to better help those in \nneed such as the hungry, the homeless, the addicted, the sick, at-risk \nchildren, and the elderly through a variety of tools and resources. The \ntremendous outpouring of generosity by Americans after September 11 is \nto be celebrated. Yet the reality is that many needs remain unmet \nthroughout the country as some charitable giving has been redirected \nand other human needs have increased. Unfortunately, as a result of the \ntragic events of September 11, a struggling stock market, and the \nrecent recession, numerous charitable organizations have suffered \nfinancial losses, in some cases, up to 20 percent or more. The bill \nseeks to expand the capacity of the voluntary and charitable sectors in \nthis country which is one of the greatest strengths and traditions of \nour country.\n\n  The CARE Act seeks to address these needs through a number of \nexpanded tax incentives. The bill restores a charitable tax deduction \nfor the 84 million\n\n[[Page S1836]]\n\nAmericans who do not itemize for a maximum deduction of up to $250 for \nindividual taxpayers and $500 for couples for charitable giving beyond \na base level of $250 for individuals and $500 couples. To encourage \nlarger donations, IRA holders will also be allowed to make charitable \ncontributions without tax penalties. Corporations and farmers will be \noffered tax deductions for their donations of food to charity, \namounting to $1 billion dollars over 10 years in order to provide more \nfood to the needy rather than letting it go to waste. A deduction is \nalso provided for contributions of books to schools.\n  The CARE Act also attempts to narrow the gap between the rich and the \npoor. Through Individual Development Accounts, IDAs, low-income \nAmericans are encouraged to save and build assets and provided training \nin financial education. These special savings accounts offer matching \ncontributions from the sponsoring bank or community organization \nreimbursed through a Federal tax credit, on the condition that the \nproceeds go to buying a home, starting a business or paying for post-\nsecondary education. Low-income Americans are now being given the \npossibility of sharing in the American dream. The provision would \nprovide for a phased-in 300,000 savings accounts for a national \ndemonstration.\n  The CARE Act helps small faith and community-based organizations. \nThrough the Compassion Capital Fund, it provides these community \nhealers with additional resources for technical assistance such as \nenabling incorporation, grant writing and accounting skills. It also \nallows social service agencies with experience in administering \ngovernment contracts to play an intermediate role between government \nagencies and smaller charities. These provisions will help smaller \nfaith-based charities to survive and to grow into viable charitable \norganizations. The legislation also expands resources through \nsignificant increases in the Social Services Block Grant, SSBG, funds \nof more than $1.2 billion.\n  Despite the positive advantages of the CARE Act, some are wary of the \nimpact of its provisions. Some critics on the left argue that the \nprovisions violate the Constitution by fusing church and state because \npreferential treatment is given to religious groups. This is false. \nInstead, the CARE Act gives religious charitable organizations the \nopportunity to compete with secular organizations for Federal funding \nby strengthening the principle of nondiscrimination against faith-based \norganizations through the codification of basic and commonsense equal \ntreatment protections. The proposed legislation creates a more level \nplaying field for faith-based charities by ensuring that they cannot be \ndiscriminated against in applying for government funds because of their \nreligious nature by ensuring the right to maintain religious icons, \nreligious names, religious governance criteria, and religious \nreferences in founding documents. The provision also makes clear that \nthe mere fact that a faith-based provider has not previously received \ngovernment funding does not disqualify them from consideration.\n  On the other hand, some critics on the right argue that the CARE Act \nwill undermine the religious nature of faith-based organizations by \nrestricting their abilities to promote religious values and by \ncontrolling the hiring process. But the moral integrity of faith-based \norganizations is protected by the Act. Though the question of hiring is \nnot addressed in the bill, current laws will continue to apply, the \nequal treatment for non-governmental organizations provision in the \nbill assures that organizations which seek federal funds are not \nrequired to remove religious symbols, change their names, or change \ntheir governing structures to qualify. Hence, faith-based organizations \ncan still adhere to the values and beliefs that motivate, make them \nunique, and reflect the diversity of America as they serve those in \nneed. The initiative does not require faith-based organizations to \nparticipate with government funds in their efforts to serve those in \nneed, it merely gives them the option if they feel that doing so is \nconsistent with their mission and prevents the government for excluding \nqualified social services providers merely because they are faith-based \nin character.\n  The CARE Act is supported by both Democrats and Republicans. The time \nhas come to get this legislation on the President's desk as he has \nrepeatedly called for. The Senate Majority Leader, Tom Daschle, wrote \nshortly after the bill's introduction last year that ``the CARE Act is \nnot a Republican or Democratic plan. it is a bipartisan proposal that \nstrikes the right balance between harnessing the best forces of faith \nin our public life without infringing on the First Amendment . . . I \nlook forward to working with President Bush and my congressional \ncolleagues to get this proposal signed into law.''\n  The time has come for the Senate to pass this important legislation. \nThe Senate Finance Committee will take an important step next week when \nthe legislation is considered in committee. The CARE Act advances our \ncommon interest in turning the immense spirit of volunteerism and civic \nduty in our country toward building strong communities. The Act's \nultimate goal is to help those most in need in our society, the poor, \nthe hopeless and the destitute. I thank my colleagues for their support \nand the many generous Americans working to transform lives and improve \ncommunities for the difference that they make each day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/30/senate-section/article/S1836-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1836-S1839]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 35--AUTHORIZING EXPENDITURES BY THE COMMITTEE ON \n                  BANKING, HOUSING, AND URBAN AFFAIRS\n\n  Mr. SHELBY submitted the following resolution; from the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs; which was referred to the \nCommittee on Rules and Administration:\n\n                               S.

Res. 40\n\n       Whereas in 1972, Congress enacted title IX of the Education \n     Amendments of 1972 (referred to in this resolution as ``title \n     IX''), the Federal statute prohibiting sex discrimination in \n     education;\n       Whereas title IX prohibits discrimination based on sex in \n     11 areas of education, including admissions, financial aid, \n     academic programs, student services, classroom assignments, \n     vocational education, and athletics;\n       Whereas since the passage of title IX, opportunities for \n     women and girls in organized sports have dramatically \n     increased;\n       Whereas the number of female college athletes has increased \n     nearly 5-fold from fewer than 32,000 prior to enactment of \n     title IX to over 150,000 since enactment of title IX;\n       Whereas women currently constitute more than 40 percent of \n     all college athletes, compared with 15 percent in 1972;\n       Whereas female athletes have higher graduation rates than \n     female nonathletes;\n       Whereas a 2002 nationwide survey found that 82 percent of \n     women business executives played organized sports after \n     grammar school, including sports on school, intramural, or \n     recreational teams;\n       Whereas there has been a marked increase in the number of \n     female professional sports and athletes since enactment of \n     title IX;\n       Whereas at the high school level, almost 3,000,000 girls \n     are playing competitive sports today, while fewer than \n     300,000 girls played competitive sports prior to the \n     enactment of title IX;\n       Whereas today girls are entering high schools sports at \n     almost twice the rate of boys, as evidenced by the fact that \n     there were 108,208 new female high school athletes in 2000-\n     2001 versus 59,230 new male athletes in that year;\n       Whereas girls' participation in organized sports provides \n     opportunities for leadership, teamwork, and competition, \n     contributes to positive body image and good health, and \n     offers critical personal contact with adult role models;\n       Whereas girls who participate in sports are less likely to \n     take drugs, drink alcohol, smoke, or become pregnant than \n     their nonparticipating peers;\n       Whereas female athletes often serve as role models both at \n     school and within their communities;\n       Whereas while the past successes of title IX are \n     impressive, girls and women still need the full protections \n     of the Federal law;\n       Whereas in schools that participate in Division I of the \n     National Collegiate Athletic Association (referred to in this \n     resolution as ``Division I schools''), women represent 53 \n     percent of the student body, but they receive only 43 percent \n     of the total athletic scholarship dollars, 32 percent of the \n     recruiting dollars, and 36 percent of the operating budget \n     dollars;\n       Whereas in 2000, at Division I schools, for every $1 being \n     spent on women's sports, almost $2 was being spent on men's \n     sports;\n\n[[Page S1839]]\n\n       Whereas from 1992 to 1997, men's athletic operating budgets \n     increased by 139 percent while women's athletic operating \n     budgets increased by only 89 percent;\n       Whereas compliance with title IX does not require schools \n     to eliminate men's sports teams, nor does title IX impose \n     strict quotas; and\n       Whereas all the Federal courts of appeals that have \n     considered the constitutionality of title IX have upheld the \n     regulations and requirements issued under title IX: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) reaffirms its commitment--\n       (A) to ending all discrimination against women and girls in \n     elementary, secondary, and higher education; and\n       (B) to equal opportunities for women and girl in athletics;\n       (2) recognizes the continued importance of title IX in \n     providing needed protections for women and girls;\n       (3) expresses its concern that rolling back title IX \n     regulations and compliance requirements may jeopardize the \n     extraordinary progress of women and girl athletes; and\n       (4) requests that the President maintain the integrity of \n     title IX by rejecting any attempts to weaken current \n     regulations and interpretations.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, this afternoon the President's Commission \non Opportunity in Athletics recommended changes to Title IX. While the \nchanges they proposed are not as sweeping as feared, by a tie vote they \nincluded in their report a provision that could weaken current \ncompliance requirements for women and girls in sports. While I commend \nthe Commission for rejecting some of the more radical changes \nconsidered, I would implore President Bush and Secretary Paige to \nreject the notion of making any changes that diminish the protections \nof Title IX, including the so called ``50-50'' compliance provision.\n  As you know Title IX has had an enormous influence on all aspects of \neducation, but particularly in the realm of women's and girls' sports. \nSince enactment the number of female college athletes has increased \nnearly five fold from fewer than 32,000 prior to enactment to over \n150,000 today. At the high school level almost 3 million girls are \nplaying competitive sports today compared to fewer than 300,000 prior \nto passage. But this isn't just about the numbers. Girls who \nparticipate in sports are less likely to take drugs, drink alcohol, \nsmoke or become pregnant than their non-participating peers. They are \nalso more likely to graduate. Through their participation in sports, \nwomen and girls are provided opportunities for leadership, teamwork and \ncompetition, gain a more positive body image, and are accorded contact \nwith adult role models in their communities. And yet, even with gains \nand achievements, more needs to be done.\n  In Division I schools women represent 53 percent of the student body, \nbut receive only 43 percent of the total athlete scholarship dollars, \n32 percent of the recruiting dollars and 36 percent of the operational \nbudgets. And for every dollar at a Division I school spent on women's \nsports, almost two dollars are spent on men's sports.\n  We've come a long way, but we should not turn the clock back now. I \nsubmit today a resolution that not only recognizes the importance of \nTitle IX and a continued need for Title IX protections, but also calls \non the Administration to reject any changes weakening current \nregulations and interpretations of this very important law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/30/senate-section/article/S1839-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1839]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n                      committee on armed services\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, this morning the Senate Finance \nCommittee completed our first piece of business for the 108th Congress. \nThe business before the committee today was the nomination of John Snow \nto be Treasury Secretary. It is the matter that we should process as a \nfull body today. The Treasury Secretary is, after the Vice President, \nperhaps the most important position in the President's Cabinet.\n  As I said at the nomination hearing 2 days ago, the Finance Committee \nhas a bipartisan tradition of acting expeditiously on this nomination. \nThe reason is the importance of this nomination in the Nation's \neconomic policymaking. The evidence of this tradition can be gleaned \nfrom committee records. Let's take a look at the recent history. For \nthe period covering the first Bush administration, the Clinton \nadministration, and this Bush administration, this committee has kept \nthe position of Treasury Secretary filled in a virtually seamless \nmanner.\n  Let me emphasize that. For this first time in recent history, we have \na significant vacancy in the Treasury Department. There has now been a \ngap in service. That gap needs to be closed. As long as that vacancy \nremains, our markets wonder, our global trading partners speculate, and \nthe President is denied his principal economic policymaker.\n  All Finance Committee Democrats and Republicans, past and present, \nshould be proud of our record in recent history. It should surprise no \none that the committee has taken this responsibility seriously. Whether \nwe have divided government, or if one party controls the Congress and \nthe administration, it does not matter. Much of the committee's policy \nis tied to the Treasury Department. It is a relationship that has a \nhistory of seriousness, productivity, and gravity. We all have an \ninterest in filling this important position.\n  I thank my ranking member and friend, Senator Baucus, for his \nassistance. I also thank my Finance Committee colleagues for their \ncooperation.\n  Fortunately, over the same almost 15-year period, the full Senate has \nreflected the Finance Committee's seriousness on this important \nnomination. Again, over that period, under divided government or one \nparty control, we as 100 Senators, have not permitted a significant \nvacancy to occur in this critical position. Some of my colleagues will \nrecall Secretary O'Neill's nomination. Senator Helms, who some on the \nother side called ``Senator No,'' had an issue important in his State \nregarding the Africa free trade bill. Senator Helms recognized the \ncritical nature of the Treasury Secretary's position and allowed the \nnomination to move forward expeditiously.\n  Why does this office matter so much?\n  Well, let's take a look at the job description on the Treasury Web \nsite. I quote:\n\n       The Secretary of the Treasury is responsible for \n     formulating and recommending domestic and international \n     financial, economic, and tax policy, participating in the \n     formulation of broad fiscal policies that have general \n     significance for the economy and managing the public debt. \n     The Treasury Secretary oversees the activities of the \n     Treasury Department in carrying out his major law enforcement \n     responsibilities; in serving as the financial agent of the \n     U.S. Government; and in manufacturing coins and currency.\n       The chief financial officer of the Government, the \n     Secretary of the Treasury serves on the President's National \n     Economic Council. He is also Chairman of the Boards and \n     Managing Trustee of the Social Security and Medicare Trust \n     Funds, Chairman of the Thrift Depositor Protection Oversight \n     Board, and serves as U.S. Governor of the International \n     Monetary Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and \n     Development, the Inter-American Development Bank, the African \n     Development Bank, and the European Bank for Reconstruction \n     and Development.\n\n  So, Mr. President, who has an interest in filling the gap I referred \nto earlier? The answer is: (i) any American with an interest in \neconomic growth, (ii) any American senior receiving Social Security or \nMedicare, (iii) any holders of thrift deposits, (iv) any investor \nholding a Treasury bond and (v) any worker or management person with an \ninternational business. That is just for starters.\n  This is not just any Cabinet position. The Treasury Department is the \noldest Department and it is no accident that the Treasury Department is \nnext door to the White House. These important responsibilities are the \nreason the Senate has not dilly-dallied on this nomination. I thank my \ncolleagues for their cooperation in the confirmation of John Snow as \nTreasury Secretary.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, earlier today the Finance Committee \napproved the nomination of John Snow as the next Secretary of the \nTreasury. I thank my colleagues for this support of the confirmation of \nMr. Snow.\n  The confirmation process is never easy. Nor should it be, as it is \npart of the constitutional advice and consent function to review of the \nnominee's experience, qualifications and suitability to serve in the \nposition to which he or she has been nominated.\n  The Senate Finance Committee asked Mr. Snow hundreds of questions \nover a period of weeks. We sought his views on tax policy, prescription \ndrugs, and budget deficits. We asked about matters involving corporate \ngovernance and executive compensation. He has responded to all of our \nquestions.\n  The American people are anxious about the flagging economy and the \nprospect of war. With the future uncertain, it is important for our \ncountry to have a Treasury Secretary in place to help tackle the \ndifficult challenges\n\n[[Page S1842]]\n\nahead. The President has selected a man who is well qualified.\n  I remain concerned about how we handle the upcoming debates about the \nbudget, taxes and healthcare. We need to get to work. But we need to \nwork together, in a bipartisan fashion, to address these important \nissues. I am committed to working with the administration to try to \nfind common ground. The new Secretary shares this commitment. I look \nforward to working with him.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of John Snow, a \nproven leader with a reputation of a winner, and President Bush's \nnominee for U.S. Treasury Secretary.\n  John Snow is someone I know well and a proud resident of the \nCommonwealth of Virginia. In nominating John Snow, President Bush has \nbrilliantly chosen the best person in America for the vital position of \nSecretary of the Treasury. There are few Americans with the knowledge \nof diverse U.S. and international economies--manufacturing, mining, \nautomobile, electric, agriculture--trade, transportation modes--rail, \nports, barges--and hands-on track record of creating jobs that John has \ndeveloped over the last three decades. John Snow is a man of positive \naction and the right person to help President Bush create greater job \nopportunities for all Americans. He will be a respected and articulate \nleader for the principles of trusting people and free enterprise to do \nwhat they do best--create new and better jobs.\n  His prior service in Federal Government helps him as well. John Snow \nunderstands how government operates and how government can help or \nhinder job growth.\n  I have known John and Carolyn Snow for many years, and have relied on \nJohn's insight, experience and wisdom often over those years. While I \nserved as Governor of Virginia, John gave extensively of his time to \nhelp us shape a plan that successfully revived Virginia's economy and \nresulted in the creation of a record number of new jobs. He continues \nto be a trusted adviser on economic and transportation issues.\n  When John came to Richmond in the early 1980s, the city was still \nsuffering the lingering consequences of the past, and a very \ncontentious period in the 1970s. Richmond had just elected its first \nAfrican-American mayor. During this time, John stepped forward to help \nbridge the gap between the past and the future. He was a founding \nmember of Richmond Renaissance, an organization dedicated to promoting \nracial equality in downtown Richmond. He was appointed by the new mayor \nto the city of Richmond school board. He became a member of the board \nof Virginia Union, a historically black college in Richmond.\n  He is a Renaissance man--educated in law and economics at the \nUniversity of Virginia, government and business, and a professor. A \nRenaissance man who can convincingly and reasonably articulate the need \nfor positive action.\n  John Snow has been successful in business because he knows that a \ngrowing economy is one that enables every working man and woman to have \nan opportunity to benefit from their hard work, their creativity and \ntheir ingenuity.\n  With his confirmation, all of America will soon come to trust and \nrely on John Snow's considerable knowledge and experience as I and so \nmany grateful Virginians have over the years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/30/senate-section/article/S1842-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1842]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I rise to address the serious matter of pay \ninequity in the Federal judiciary.\n  As things stand now, nearly every Federal employee will receive a \ncost of living adjustment during 2003--every employee, that is, except \nFederal judges. This is because of a legislative prescription that \nrequires Congress to authorize raises in the salaries of Federal \njudges. Although this COLA of roughly 3 percent may seem small and \ninconsequential, it makes a significant difference in light of the fact \nthat Federal judges earn far less than many, if not most, of their \ncounterparts in the private sector.\n  In his 2002 year-end report, Supreme Court Chief Justice William \nRehnquist highlighted his concern that salaries of Federal judges have \nnot kept pace with those of lawyers in private firms and in business. \nHe observed, ``Inadequate compensation seriously compromises the \njudicial independence fostered by life tenure. That low salaries might \nforce judges to return to the private sector rather than stay on the \nbench risks affecting judicial performance--instead of serving for \nlife, those judges would serve the terms their finances would allow, \nand they would worry about what awaits them when they return to the \nprivate sector.'' The Chief Rustic lamented, ``Unless the 108th \nCongress acts, judges will not even receive the cost-of-living \nadjustment that nearly every other Federal employee will receive during \n2003.'' He concluded by urging Congress and the President to ``take up \nthis issue early in the new year.''\n  Today, Mr. President, the Senate is passing a bill that will allow \nFederal judges to receive the COLA that other Federal employees are \nalready slated to receive this year. Although the larger issue of \nminimizing the gap between Federal judicial salaries and private sector \nsalaries still remains, this small step will resolve the salary \ninequity between Federal judges and other Federal employees. I thank my \ncolleagues for joining Senator Leahy and me in supporting this \nbipartisan measure.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is taking up \nand passing both the Senate and House versions of legislation to \nauthorize salary adjustments for Justices and judges of the United \nStates for fiscal year 2003.\n  Here in the Senate, Senator Hatch and I were joined by Senator DeWine \nand Senator Specter to cosponsor legislation to authorize an increase \nin the salaries of Justices and judges of the United States for the \npresent fiscal year. House Judiciary Chairman Sensenbrenner was joined \nby that committee's ranking Democratic member, Congressman Conyers, and \nothers to introduce identical legislation.\n  As a member of both the Senate Judiciary Committee and the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Commerce,\n\n[[Page S1843]]\n\nJustice, State and the Judiciary, I have worked hard to help preserve a \nfair and independent judiciary. I am disappointed that the Continuing \nResolutions approved by Congress failed to give the Federal judiciary a \ncost-of-living adjustment COLA for fiscal year 2003.\n  In 1975, Congress enacted the Executive Salary Cost-of-Living \nAdjustment Act, intended to give judges, Members of Congress and other \nhigh-ranking Executive Branch officials automatic COLAs as accorded \nother Federal employees unless rejected by Congress. In 1981, Congress \nenacted Section 140 of Public Law 97-92, mandating specific \ncongressional action to give COLAs to judges. During the 21 years of \nSection 140's existence, Congress has always accorded to the Federal \njudiciary co-equal respect by suspending Section 140 whenever Congress \nhas granted to itself and other Federal employees a COLA. With the end \nof the last Congress, however, the continuing resolutions providing \nfunding failed to suspend Section 140, thus ensuring that no COLA would \nbe provided for Federal judges during the current fiscal year, unless \nother action is taken.\n  The bipartisan and bicameral legislation before us provides for a \nCOLA for Federal judges consistent with the law and with fairness.\n  Over the past year and one half as Judiciary Committee Chairman, I \nhave been honored to lead the Committee in holding hearings on 103 of \nPresident Bush's judicial nominees, some of whom proved to be quite \ncontroversial and divisive. Last year the Committee voted on 102 \nnominees and reported 100 out of Committee favorably. The full \nDemocratic-led Senate took the final step of confirming 100 judges in \njust 17 months. This remarkable record compares most favorably to the \n38 judicial confirmations averaged per year during the 6\\1/2\\ years \nwhen the Republicans previously controlled the Senate. In addition, the \n21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act we \npassed last Congress created or extended 20 Federal judgeships, more \nthan were created during the 6\\1/2\\ years that the Republican party \ncontrolled the Senate. In his end of the year report, the Chief Justice \nof the United States noted these accomplishments and thanked the Senate \nfor its actions. I appreciate his kind words.\n  I look forward to Senate passage of the House and Senate bills to \nauthorize salary adjustments for Justices and judges of the United \nStates for fiscal year 2003. I hope the President will promptly sign \nour legislation into law.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread the third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 101) was read the third time and passed, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 101\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
