Mr. President, today, our forces for freedom encircle the \nglobe. Our military men and women will observe Veterans Day in almost \nall of the world's time zones. In the skies, on the ground, and under \nthe water, they will pause to remember.\n  In a few moments, we, too, will pause to remember.\n  As Senators, we have had the opportunity to work alongside so many \nwho served our Nation so ably, and so nobly, during our country's \nstruggles on behalf of freedom--heroes such as Strom Thurmond and Bob \nDole, heroes such as John McCain and Bob Kerrey, heroes such as Max \nCleland and Chuck Hagel, heroes such as Dan Inouye. We have seen how \nthey and others have sacrificed and suffered for a cause greater than \nthemselves. Their nobility and grace, in war and in peace, stand as \nexamples to all in our new century and in the new conflict we fight \ntoday.\n\n  We work in an institution that values unlimited speech--sometimes \nspeech over everything else. But in my years of working alongside these \nheroes, I have discovered a lesson that runs true for all of them. To \nme it has been in these silences, the times they have not joined in \nwith the majority of their colleagues, that they have demonstrated \ntheir strength.\n  Our Nation is a cacophony of noise, a symphony of sound, from that \nfactory floor to the market floor, from Main Street to Wall Street. It \nis the so-called roar of democracy that makes us unique as a nation and \nas a country. But this morning we are called to silence. Why?\n  In our Nation's battles throughout her last two centuries, many have \npaid the ultimate sacrifice for freedom and liberty. This moment of \nsilence we will shortly observe is the silence of those voices stilled \nforever, of sons and daughters no longer returning home, of husbands \nand wives no longer there for each other, of mothers and fathers no \nlonger there for their children day and night.\n  In the pain of these sacrifices, our warriors have built our country \nand saved our world. They have stood as freedom's sentinel and as \nliberty's shield. They have fought the fights to which history has \ncalled us and won the victories that faith has dared us.\n  Our Nation is the beacon of liberty for so many people around the \nworld, and it is the valor and dedication of the many heroes, sung and \nunsung, throughout the Nation's past 200 years--those who sleep \nforevermore--who have made it so. We honor them today not with noise \nbut with silence.\n  As the hour of 11 a.m. approaches, I ask that we do observe this \nmoment of silence.\n  I come from the great State of Tennessee. We have our share of \nhallowed war dead. We have our share of heroes, including perhaps one \nof the most famous Medal of Honor winners, Sergeant York. In a chain of \nevents still astonishing today, he led a small squad of just 7 men in \ncharging a machine gun nest mercilessly attacking his position, \nultimately capturing 132 prisoners. An observer termed what he did ``a \ncall to courage.''\n  I encourage every American today to also take a moment of silence and \nlook for those who have answered that call to courage. All throughout \nour country, every day our veterans merit our support, our respect, our \nthanks for advancing the cause of liberty here at home and indeed \naround the world. They took what was granted to them by their fathers \nand, with their service and with their labors, they passed it on to \ntheir children, bringing America still free into a new century.\n  We pass legislation on their behalf to express the thanks--our \nthanks--of this grateful Nation. Today's silence is for them as well.\n  Now our country fights a new enemy, faceless and hateful. It fights \nin new ways, bringing new terrors and threats and intimidations to our \nfellow Americans. That is the final lesson our moment of silence \nteaches us this morning.\n  Together let's remember the strength of silence and, as we resume our \nlabors here today, just as our Armed Forces work today around the \nworld, let us move ahead with a little less noise and a little more \nfortitude.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The distinguished minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, each year, America honors its veterans on \nthis day with solemn pride.\n  But this year, Veterans Day arrives with uncommon poignancy. As we \nshow our gratitude to our veterans here at home, a new generation of \nsoldiers is thousands of miles from their loved ones, facing danger on \nour behalf.\n  There is an immediacy to this year's Veterans Day. The risks our \nsoldiers are facing today have not yet been softened by memory. Without \nthe filter of history, we see clearly the dangers they face every day \nwhen we learn of yet another attack on American soldiers, yet another \ndeath, yet another family that must go on without a loved one. At the \nsame time, we see clearly the good that American service men and women \ncan perform when we witness the hopeful faces of Iraqis eager for a \nbetter, more peaceful life.\n  Within the service of today's soldiers, we may see a clear reflection \nof the service of our veterans. Just as our soldiers today, our \nveterans, too, left families behind. They, too, woke up to uncertain \ndangers. They, too, saw friends and comrades injured or killed. Yet, \nknowing both their risks and their obligations, they, too, performed \ntheir duty each day.\n  Forty years ago, President Kennedy noted that no nation ``in the \nhistory of the world has buried its soldiers farther from its native \nsoil than we Americans--or closer to the towns in which they grew up.''\n  At our proudest moments, the American people have sent our sons and \ndaughters across the globe to fight for\n\n[[Page S14381]]\n\nfreedom. And once the fight was done, we have welcomed them home with \nhonor and gratitude.\n  Today, too, the honor of defending those who cannot defend themselves \nis carried forward by young American soldiers. And their families and \nfriends wait anxiously for their safe return.\n  South Dakota is proud of the role its sons and daughters have played \nin Operation Iraqi Freedom. At the start of the war, it was a B-1 \nbomber crew from Ellsworth Air Force Base's 28th Bomb Wing that hit \nthat bunker in Baghdad where it was thought the Iraqi leadership might \nhave been hiding. All four members of the crew were awarded the \nDistinguished Flying Cross.\n  Staff Sergeant Randy Meyer, a Marine from Big Stone City, was part of \na unit that discovered 22 American prisoners of war along a highway \nnear Baghdad.\n  Sergeant Meyer noticed that Specialist Shoshanna Johnson was too hurt \nto walk--she had been shot in both ankles--so he picked her up and \ncarried her to safety.\n  And South Dakota's National Guard and Reserve units have been on the \nfront lines, both during the active fighting and today as we work to \nstabilize Iraq and rebuild the nation of Iraq.\n  Their service on this day is doubled. Because in addition to \nadvancing democracy and security, their brave acts make us still more \naware of, and still more grateful for, the brave acts of our veterans.\n  But alongside our pride, Veterans Day comes with a challenge. Each \nyear we should ask ourselves, have we done enough to honor the \nsacrifices of our soldiers and veterans?\n  This year, if we are honest with ourselves, the answer must be no.\n  Mr. President, in keeping with our agreement to stop for a moment of \nsilence at 11 o'clock, I will do so and return to my remarks as soon as \nthe moment of silence has been completed.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenate will observe a moment of silence.\n  (Moment of Silence.)\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am hard pressed to recall a time when \nthe gap between the demands we place on our soldiers and the thanks we \noffer them once they return home has been wider. It is bitterly ironic \nthat on this Veterans Day, while soldiers are facing danger far from \nhome, the gap is still growing.\n  Today, more than 500,000 American soldiers are stationed in 137 \ndifferent countries around the world. More than 300,000 are engaged in \nactive combat or peacekeeping missions in seven different countries, \nincluding more than 140,000 in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  More than 400 American soldiers have been killed in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. More than 2,400 have been wounded.\n  Meanwhile, our military is stretched so thin we cannot tell many of \nour soldiers or their families when they might be coming home. And \ndespite the added strain and the ever more complicated mission, we are \nfailing to provide for our soldiers, our veterans, and their families.\n  Veterans of Operation Iraqi Freedom will join 250,000 veterans who \nmust wait 6 months just to see a V.A. hospital doctor.\n  This wait will be lengthened by the administration's closing of seven \nVeterans Hospitals and a budget that under-funds veterans health by \n$1.8 billion.\n  In addition, the administration has opposed expanding health care \nbenefits to Guard Members and Reservists and their families. It \nproposed cutting the pay to troops facing imminent danger. Schools for \nthe children of military families are being threatened with cuts. And \nthe Defense Department is closing 19 commissaries and considering \nwhether to close 19 more.\n  In a recent article in ``The Army Times,'' a representative from the \nNational Military Family Association was quoted asking a question \nfamiliar to many of us today. ``How can leadership be talking about \ncutting back on quality-of-life benefits right now when the force and \neveryone supporting the force is at such a high stress level?''\n  One colonel quoted in the article expressed it more simply: \n``Betrayal,'' he said to the reporter. ``Write that down and put it in \nyour report.''\n  In signing the GI Bill of Rights in 1944, President Roosevelt noted \nthat ``the members of the Armed Forces have been compelled to make \ngreater . . . sacrifice than the rest of us, and they are entitled to \ndefinite action to help take care of their special problems.''\n  Each year, we are in danger of falling further behind in our \nobligation to our veterans. Recently, ``definite action'' has given way \nto little more than indefinite praise.\n  Veterans deserve better.\n  Some within this administration seem to believe that our \nresponsibility to our soldiers ends when they come home. We disagree. \nThese men and women risked their lives to defend our own. They stood up \nfor us; now we must stand up for them, not with words but with deeds.\n  Mr. President, not long ago, a teacher from a small town in the Black \nHills of South Dakota gave her students an assignment. She asked them \nto tell the stories of each of the 2,200 South Dakotans who gave their \nlives in the fight for democracy during World War II.\n  As word spread of the children's work, the teacher was asked to bring \nthe program to the entire State.\n  In doing their research, South Dakota's children discovered some \namazing things. They found that Native American--treated within their \nown country as second-class citizens--rushed to enlist in record \nnumbers. They found young men who had failed their physicals, but used \na cousin's or a sibling's results to sneak into the service. They found \nyoungest sons--and only sons--who could easily have gotten deferments, \nbut instead demanded to serve.\n  They also found official military records that listed the wrong home \ncounty for an extraordinary number of the South Dakotans killed in the \nwar. At first, the students were puzzled. After a while, though, they \ndiscovered the reason: So many counties had overfilled their enrollment \ncaps, that young men would claim to be from another county, just to be \nallowed to serve their Nation.\n  All told, 68,000 South Dakotans enrolled in the Armed Services in \nWWII. My father was one of them. Two thousand two hundred of them never \ncame home--a greater percentage of World War II deaths than any other \nState.\n  Those who did make it home passed that same sense of loyalty and duty \nonto their sons and daughters. During the Vietnam war, 78 percent of \nSouth Dakota's eligible young men chose to serve.\n  That was, by far, the highest percentage in the Nation. I was one of \nthem. I was lucky. Two hundred South Dakotans who went to Vietnam \ndidn't make it back.\n  This year, too, South Dakotans have proven eager to serve. South \nDakota has one of the highest proportions of our citizens serving in \nactive duty in Iraq of any State in the country.\n  South Dakota knows the true meaning of patriotism. We have sent out \nsons and daughters off to war, welcomed those who returned, and buried \nthose that did not.\n  We volunteer without boast or complaint. The rewards of citizenship \nare great, therefore, the demands are great.\n  Having sent so many young people off to war, South Dakotans feel the \ntight bond that develops between soldiers and the communities they \ndefend. And we know that the debt we owe to veterans cannot be repaid \non this day alone.\n  We enjoy our freedoms every day, and every day we must remember those \nby whose courage they were purchased.\n  We must express our gratitude in both word and deed and commit \nourselves to their care, as they committed themselves to our \nprotection.\n  Today, we witness the courage of our soldiers serving throughout the \nworld and remember the courage of veterans throughout our history. \nNever once did they fall short of our expectations of them. Today, we \nmust recommit ourselves to making sure we do not fall short of their \nexpectations of us.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my remarks be taken from \nmy leader time, not from the morning business time allocated for this \ntribute this morning.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/11/senate-section/article/S14382-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S14382]]\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi).

Mr. President, it has been over 50 years since my good \nfriends, Senator Inouye, Senator Hollings, Senator Warner, Senator \nLautenberg, Senator Akaka, and I returned home from World War II. When \nI joined the Senate in 1968, approximately half of the Members of the \nSenate were World War II veterans. While there are several Senators \nhere who have served in Korea, Vietnam, and in later engagements, there \nare a few of us still around who lived through World War II. We are \nproud of a tradition of over 48 million Americans who have served in \nour Armed Forces since 1776.\n  Whenever our Nation has needed warriors to defend our Nation, young \nmen and women in uniform have stepped forward, willing to bear that \nburden. This day, Veterans Day, is a reminder to us of their courage, \nbravery, and sacrifice.\n  These days, our thoughts are never far from a battlefield. New \ngenerations have answered the call to service, and as we meet today, \nthey are defending us in some of the most dangerous places in the \nworld, where they face determined enemies and terrorists. I join all \nhere today in thanking each of them for their service and thank their \nfamilies for their sacrifice.\n  I had the honor to serve in the Army Air Corps with a squadron in \nChina in World War II. Our squadron motto was: We do the impossible \nimmediately, miracles take slightly longer.\n  The history of our Nation's Armed Forces is one of impossible \nchallenges and formidable enemies. But our men and women in uniform \nhave met and overcome them on battlefields, and in the air, and on the \nsea and, as our Chaplain reminded us, under the sea, across the globe.\n  Secretary of State Colin Powell recently spoke of the tradition of \nservice and said:\n\n       We have gone forth from our shores repeatedly over the last \n     hundred years . . . and put wonderful young men and women at \n     risk, many of whom have lost their lives, and we have asked \n     for nothing except enough ground to bury them in.\n\n  It is right and proper for the Senate to remember the young men and \nwomen who have served our great Nation in uniform and those who did not \nreturn because they made the ultimate sacrifice.\n  Veterans share a common bond. We are truly comrades in the deepest \nsense of the word, and I salute each one of them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, as the country marks the Veterans Day \nholiday, I wish to take a moment to express my thanks to the people of \nWisconsin and to our Nation's veterans and their families.\n  I urge my colleagues and all Americans to take a moment today to \nreflect upon the meaning of this day and to remember those who have \nserved and sacrificed to protect our country and the freedoms we enjoy \nas Americans.\n  Webster's Dictionary defines a veteran as ``one with a long record of \nservice in a particular activity or capacity'' or ``one who has been in \nthe armed forces.'' But we can also define a veteran as a grandfather \nor a grandmother, a father or a mother, a brother or a sister, a son or \na daughter, or a friend. Veterans live in all of our communities, and \ntheir contributions have touched all of our lives.\n  November 11 is a date with special significance in our history. On \nthat day in 1918, at the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month, \nWorld War I ended. In 1926, a joint resolution of Congress called on \nthe President to issue a proclamation to encourage all Americans to \nmark this day by displaying the U.S. flag and by observing the day with \nappropriate ceremonies.\n  In 1938, Armistice Day was designated as a legal holiday ``to be \ndedicated to the cause of world peace'' by an act of Congress. This \nannual recognition of the contributions and sacrifices of our Nation's \nveterans of World War I was renamed Veterans Day in 1954 so that we \nmight also recognize the service and sacrifice of those who had fought \nin World War II and the veterans of all of America's other wars.\n  Our Nation's veterans and their families have given selflessly to the \ncause of protecting our freedom. Too many have given the ultimate \nsacrifice for their country on the battlefields of the Revolutionary \nWar that gave birth to the United States, to the Civil War which sought \nto secure for all Americans the freedoms envisioned by the Founding \nFathers, to the global fight against nazism and fascism in World War \nII.\n  In the last century, Americans fought and died in two World Wars and \nin conflicts in Korea, Vietnam, and the Persian Gulf. They also \nparticipated in peacekeeping missions around the globe, some of which \nare still ongoing. Today our men and women in uniform are waging a \nfight against terrorism and, at the same time, are participating in \nongoing military operations in Iraq.\n  As we commemorate Veterans Day, 2003, we should reflect on the \nsacrifices--past, present, and future--that are made by our men and \nwomen in uniform and their families. We should also resolve to do more \nfor our veterans to ensure they have a decent standard of living and \nadequate health care.\n  This is especially important as we welcome home a new generation of \nveterans who are serving in Iraq and in the fight against terrorism. \nToday's soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines are tomorrow's veterans. \nThese men and women selflessly put their lives on the line as the \ncountless military personnel before them whom we honor today. We must \nensure that their service and sacrifice, which is much lauded during \ntimes of conflict, is not forgotten once the battles have ended and our \ntroops come home.\n  For that reason, I am committed to ensuring that the Department of \nVeterans Affairs makes every effort to educate our veterans about \nbenefits for which they may be eligible through the VA.\n  Our veterans and their families have made great personal sacrifices \nto protect our freedoms. Making sure our veterans know about the \nbenefits they have earned is an important first step in starting to \nrepay this debt. That is why I am fighting to overturn a VA policy that \nprevents the agency from reaching out to veterans who may be eligible \nfor health care benefits, and that is why I have introduced legislation \nto improve the VA's outreach to veterans.\n\n  In addition, I continue to hear from many Wisconsin veterans about \nthe need to improve claims processing at the VA. These veterans are \njustifiably angry and frustrated about the amount of time it takes for \nthe Veterans' Administration to process their claims. In some \ninstances, veterans are waiting well over a year. Telling the men and \nwomen who served our country in the Armed Forces that they ``just have \nto wait'' is wrong and unacceptable.\n  Last month, the VA issued a press release declaring ``partial \nvictory'' in its efforts to reduce the number of pending claims. The \nrelease noted that the VA has reduced its claims backlog from 432,000 \nto 253,000 over the last 2 years. I am pleased the VA has made claims \nprocessing a priority, but there is much more work to be done. I urge \nthe Secretary to continue this effort to reduce the claims backlog. The \nmore than a quarter of a million veterans who are still waiting to have \ntheir claims processed, coupled with the thousands of new veterans \nreturning from the battlefield of Iraq and Afghanistan, deserve the \nconcerted effort of the VA and the Pentagon to process\n\n[[Page S14383]]\n\nclaims quickly and to educate new veterans about their benefits in an \neffective and clear manner that may help to prevent the filing of \nadditional claims in the future.\n  I am looking forward to continuing to meet with veterans and their \nfamilies around Wisconsin to hear directly from them what services they \nneed and what gaps remain in the VA system.\n  So on Veterans Day, and throughout the year, let us continue to honor \nAmerica's brave veterans and their families.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I yield up to 7 minutes to the Senator from Virginia, \nMr. Warner.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues on this \nmagnificent day which we set aside for the veterans of all of our wars.\n  As I was presiding at the time we took a moment of silence, I \nreflected back to 1918 when the guns fell silent at 11 o'clock across \nthe trenches in Europe. There was a young doctor there who had been \nwounded, who had been decorated, but he was still at his post in the \ntrenches when that hour arrived. That was my father.\n  I read a poem in his honor and in honor of all veterans which \nreflects my understanding and my deep belief and gratitude to veterans. \nIt is called ``In Flanders Fields'':\n\n       In Flanders fields the poppies blow\n       Between the crosses, row on row.\n       That mark our place; and in the sky\n       The larks, still bravely singing, fly\n       Scarce heard amid the guns below.\n\n       We are the Dead. Short days ago\n       We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,\n       Loved and were loved, and now we lie\n       In Flanders fields.\n\n       Take up our quarrel with the foe:\n       To you from failing hands we throw\n       The torch; be yours to hold it high.\n       If ye break faith with us who die\n       We shall not sleep, though poppies grow\n       In Flanders fields.\n\n  I wear one of those poppies on this Veterans Day. It is issued by the \nveterans organizations all across America in reverence to those who \nhave gone before us to make it possible today to exercise free speech.\n  My distinguished colleague, Senator Stevens, my friend of these 25 \nyears in the Senate, just mentioned that there are five of us who are \nhere who served in World War II. My record pales against his record, \nSenator Hollings, Senator Inouye, and others. But I was privileged as a \nvery young 17-year-old to volunteer and take up my responsibilities, as \ndid all in my generation in those days. Yet the heavy lifting, the \nheavy work, the heavy losses had been done that went before us, and in \n1945, when I was simply in a training command, the war ended.\n  I say that only because had it not been for what the U.S. military \nhas done for me in these 58 years that I have been privileged to be \nassociated, I would not be here in the Senate. That is why I labor with \nothers, primarily those on the Armed Services Committee, to do what we \ncan for today's veterans and, most importantly, for those who are still \nin uniform and those who will follow in uniform in the generations to \ncome, together with their families.\n  I speak in gratitude from my heart to all the veterans and, indeed, \nfor what the military did for this humble soul to make it possible \nthrough the GI bill twice. I received it once for World War II and once \nfor brief service again in Korea. Again, my heart is filled with \ngratitude, and it is such a magnificent day to rise and reflect.\n  Back in World War II, I remember on our block, when our neighbors \nwere lost in battle, a gold star went on their door to remind all of \nthe sacrifices of that family. And on the other doors were a little \ndecal which said: We proudly have our son in the Army, the Navy, the \nAir Corps, the Marines, the Coast Guard.\n  Those were days when there was absolute sacrifice all across the \nNation. Today, this Nation again is united. We stand strong behind our \nmen and women of the Armed Forces, as it should be. So by the grace of \nGod, by the sacrifices of all who have gone before us, we stand humbly \ntoday and express our gratitude to them and their families.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a list of United States service \npersonnel casualties be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    U.S. SERVICE PERSONNEL CASUALTIES\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                         Total     Killed in  Wounded in\n             Contingency              casualties    action      action\n                                       (KIA/WIA)     (KIA)       (WIA)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWorld War I.........................     321,000     115,000     206,000\nWorld War II........................   1,077,245     405,399     671,846\nKorea...............................     139,852      36,568     103,284\nVietnam.............................     211,506      58,203     153,303\nAfghanistan.........................         252          31         221\nIraq................................       2,336         398       1,938\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I yield up to 4 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Wyoming, Mr. Thomas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, we all rise to recognize this day. As we \nthink about it, I suspect there is no other day of recognition that has \nas much bearing on the freedoms we enjoy as this day of recognizing \nveterans. It is so important that we take time to recognize and honor \nthose men and women who have worn this country's uniform.\n  Certainly, as we think about it today, our thoughts are primarily \nfocused on those men and women now serving overseas in Iraq, \nAfghanistan, and other places. Of course, historically we have many \nthings to think about: Those who have given so much so we can continue \nto live in freedom.\n  I suppose if we have a weakness in terms of our recognition, it is \nidentifying what others have done for us to be able to have the \nfreedoms we enjoy and have done for so many years. I think it is \nappropriate we set this day aside not only to recognize those who have \ndone so much but, frankly, to ensure young people understand the \nsacrifices that have been made. We want people who were not around at \nall in World War II, Korea, or even Vietnam to understand what has \nhappened.\n  Dwight Eisenhower once said that:\n\n       War demands real toughness of fiber, not only in the \n     soldiers who must endure, but in the homes that must \n     sacrifice their best.\n\n  That is true. All families sacrifice as well. This morning, we \nvisited a VA hospital in DC. We visited with a number of veterans who \nwere being treated in that hospital, some from World War II who had \ndone so much.\n  Today we honor those who made these sacrifices, in many cases the \nultimate sacrifice in defense of liberty, justice, and democracy. We \nare engaged today in the struggle which will test our national resolve, \nand I hope today helps us to understand the importance of that resolve. \nA new generation of Americans has answered the call and is defending \nour country.\n  Today, as we commemorate and honor those who have gone before, we \nmust remember the brave souls currently serving in harm's way. We must \nrenew our commitment to the ideals for which so many have fought and \ndied. We must never forget freedom has a very high price indeed. That \nprice has been paid by our Nation's veterans and their families.\n  I was impressed when I think it was the commandant of the Marine \nCorps who said there is a direct connection between the land of the \nfree and the home of the brave. That is true.\n  Today we say thank you on behalf of a very grateful Nation. We are \nextremely proud of all the veterans have done.\n  I ask unanimous consent the poem ``A Cowboy Defends Us'' be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objections, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          A Cowboy Defends Us\n\n                     (By Tina Willis, Apr. 9, 2003)\n\n     I wonder what it means to you\n     When you see the flutter of red, white, and blue\n     I think of American history and days that are gone\n     I think of our troops in Iraq and Iran\n\n     I think of the folks that settled this west\n     Who've raised sons and daughters and offered their best\n     These children traded a tractor for a humvee's rough ride\n     And their parents now wait with no sleep but much pride\n\n     I think of the cowboy called to duty today\n     Throwing his pony a last flake of hay\n     Before boarding a bus in this dawn's early light\n     As he joins the forces to fight the good fight\n\n     I think of the bunkhouse with one empty bed\n\n[[Page S14384]]\n\n     There's a tent in the sand where he'll now lay his head\n     As I savor my freedom and pray for our troops\n     I think of the cowboys that now wear infantry boots\n\n     Their instincts and courage were learned on the range\n     They're taking care of the homestead--with a scenery change\n     Our nation is safer and stronger today\n     Because some cowboy defends us--time zones away\n\n     And I wonder what it means to you\n     When you see the flutter of red, white, and blue. . . .\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I yield up to 4 minutes to the senior Senator from \nMissouri, Mr. Bond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Texas and the \nothers who have spoken.\n  It is a great honor and privilege to be on the Senate floor on this \nVeterans Day to acknowledge the sacrifices of America's veterans and \nthe priceless service our veterans have rendered to a grateful Nation.\n  Earlier this morning Senator Thomas, Senator Inhofe, and I visited \nthe Washington VA hospital to say thank you. Previously, I had been to \nWalter Reed and Bethesda National Naval Medical Center, as I know many \nMembers have, to say thanks also to those returning from the current \nwar. In all of these visits and in everything we do, we should express \nour thankful appreciation to America's veterans, particularly while we \nfind ourselves embroiled in a war against those seeking to destroy all \nAmerica stands for, what we hold most dear, our freedom.\n  It is the soldier, sailor, airman, and the marine to whom we have \nturned for protection from terrorists and the failed nation states that \nsupport them. Our troops are performing in an exemplary manner, taking \nthe fight to those who would harm us on enemy territory and on our \nterms. The events of September 11 and the military operations that have \nensued since then have brought a renewed understanding and respect for \nour Nation's military and our veterans.\n  In response to the horrendous acts carried out on 9/11, our men and \nwomen in uniform have taken action, as our veterans have done countless \ntimes throughout history.\n  We are fighting the war on terrorism on many fronts, using all the \ntools at our disposal. We will win this conflict through the patient \naccumulation of successes, by meeting a series of challenges with \ndetermination, with will and with purpose. This campaign is a marathon, \nnot a sprint. We must be mindful to think not only in the near term but \nto look ahead 5, 10, 15 years and to take this opportunity to shape our \nfuture world. We must find a way to help contribute to the peace and \nstability of what is clearly still a dangerous and unpredictable world.\n  After 9/11, President Bush said:\n\n       In the months ahead, our patience will be one of our \n     strengths . . . patience and understanding that it will take \n     time to achieve our goals; patience in all the sacrifices \n     that may come.\n\n  Today, sacrifices are being made by our troops who defend us far from \nhome, and by their proud yet worried families. The sacrifices they make \nare the same sacrifices made by those who served before them. We ask an \nawful lot of those who wear the uniform. We ask them to leave their \nloved ones, to travel great distances, to risk injury, even risk death. \nThey are dedicated, they are honorable, and they represent the very \nbest of our country. We are indeed grateful for these countless \nsacrifices. We can never repay our debt to those who serve our Nation, \nbut we can ensure they know they will never be forgotten. Today, we \nhave some very real reminders of the cost of freedom. It is an absolute \nthat we would not enjoy the freedoms we have today were it not for the \nwillingness of our men and women to serve each of us and our country by \ncommitting to fight on our behalf in the armed services.\n\n  We are fighting every day on the many fronts around the world and \nthose of us in this body work to provide not only the resources we need \nto ensure that our men and women in the field are the best trained, \nbest equipped, best prepared, and the best protected, but we also work \nto ensure we meet the commitments made to our veterans who have served \nin the past.\n  As former Secretary of Defense William Cohen once said, we are \n``unwilling to live in a world in which evil triumphs. And as a result, \nthe flag of freedom flies not only over America, but over those \ncountries whose people had to yield to the terror of tyranny and under \nthe heel of boots of dictators.'' Our veterans have kept the flame of \nfreedom alive, and they are a true reflection of the American spirit.\n  There are many accolades for veterans, but the one I like best is \nfrom Father Dennis Edward O'Brien's ``What Is A Vet?''\n\n       He is an ordinary yet extraordinary human being, a person \n     who offered some of his life's most vital years in the \n     service of his country and who sacrificed his ambitions so \n     others would not have to sacrifice theirs . . .\n       He is a soldier and savior and a sword against the \n     darkness, and his is nothing more than the finest, greatest \n     testimony on behalf of the finest, greatest nation ever \n     known.\n       So remember, each time you see someone who served our \n     country, just lean over and say thank you. That is all most \n     people need, and in most cases will mean more than any medals \n     they could have been awarded or were awarded.\n\n  President Bush said it best when he described the will of our Nation \nby saying:\n\n       We will not waiver; we will not tire; we will not falter; \n     and we will not fail. Peace and freedom will prevail.\n\n  That peace and freedom will prevail because of the commitment of \nthose who serve in uniform. America's veterans are the rock on which we \nhave defended America's shores and are the reason our President can \nmake such promises.\n  May God bless our veterans for their service, and may He continue to \nbless America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I yield up to 3 minutes to the Senator from Idaho, \nMr. Craig.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me thank the Senator from Texas for \ntaking out this special order this morning.\n  I join with all Idahoans and all Americans to pause during Veterans \nDay to honor the service of all our American soldiers. It is a day set \napart to celebrate peace and freedom through ceremonies of thanksgiving \nand prayer. It is a day dedicated to the men and women whose great \nsacrifices made it possible that we might pause to recognize them, to \npray and to give thanks. Sadly, however, as battles fade, so do the \nmemories of our soldiers, and what was once a fervent memory becomes \nbut a passing one of only photographs and pictures of men and women who \nserved their country.\n  But this is beginning to change.\n  As our Nation reaches out to free oppressed people around the world, \na new generation of American soldiers is joining the honored body of \nU.S. veterans. Men and women who fought and continue to fight in Iraq \nare bringing fresh faces and new experiences to the legacy of those who \nhave gone before. Troops stationed in Afghanistan work to maintain the \nstandard of freedom others obtained for us in the past. These soldiers \nare expanding the image of American veterans as they stand for liberty \nand redefine the world.\n  Like the soldiers before them, today's members of the armed services \nare risking everything to ensure the freedom and happiness of their \nfellow Americans. On a daily basis, they lay their lives on the line to \nface an unsure and dangerous future. Some of them pay the ultimate cost \nand remind us all that freedom is not free.\n  Exactly who are the new veterans? They are just like you. They are \nfathers and mothers whose children anxiously await their return. They \nare sons and daughters whose parents proudly boast to their neighbors. \nThey are students, graduates, neighbors, and friends. They are people \nin our State, our hearts, and our homes.\n  For many people, this newest fight for liberty is bringing home the \nreality of war. A veteran is no longer an unfamiliar face in an old \nblack and white photograph. The price of freedom is no longer a thing \nof the past--it is our present and our future. With a new generation of \nyoung soldiers fighting for our Nation, we are forcefully reminded of \nthe sacrifices previous veterans have paid for our happiness.\n\n[[Page S14385]]\n\n  In the nearly 80 years since Congress first marked November 11th as a \nday to recognize and honor veterans, the image of the American veteran \nhas been changing. Time has gradually brought a seasoned maturity of \nage to the once youthful faces of American soldiers. Sons have turned \ninto fathers and fathers into grandfathers as each generation replaced \nthe last.\n  Following the terrible attacks on our homeland two years ago, \nPresident George W. Bush declared:\n\n       Americans should always honor our veterans. At this moment, \n     we especially need the example of their character. And we \n     need a new generation to set examples of its own, examples in \n     service and sacrifice and courage.\n\n  Today we see the fulfillment of this challenge. We see a rising \ngeneration of new veterans fighting for the American people.\n  To the veterans of our past and present, we thank you. We honor your \nservice, commend your example, and remember your sacrifice. While some \nof us may never fully understand the significance of your labor, we all \nfeel your impact on our Nation and our lives.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I yield up to 4 minutes to the Senator from New \nMexico, Mr. Domenici.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first, I thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Texas for yielding me a few moments. Obviously, this is a time \nwhen it is very easy to talk about our veterans. But I thought I might \njust take about half of my time to tell the Senate a little story about \nmy father.\n  My father came to the United States in 1908 as a 12-year-old \nimmigrant from Italy. I don't think many of you know that in the First \nWorld War, immigrants, noncitizens, were drafted. My father was in \nlittle Albuquerque in business, 27 years old, couldn't write English, \ncouldn't speak English too well, and he got a draft notice. Sure \nenough, 3 months later he went off to war, the First World War.\n  Another thing that is most interesting is that Armistice Day was this \nday, November 11; but it was also my dad's birthday. So he was a young \nAmerican soldier, unable to speak very much English. He was \nsufficiently uncertain of his language that when he was up for \npromotion he didn't want to be promoted because he was afraid he \ncouldn't drill the soldiers; he would sound funny because he had a big \naccent. Nonetheless, he did move up and whatever he was entitled to he \ngot.\n  He remembered vividly November 11, Armistice Day--and one man in \nparticular. I think all our veterans have a memory of some leader. His \nmemory was of his captain, the captain of his Corps of Engineers which \nwas building pontoon bridges and the like. The reason he remembered him \nwas because this man told his men: Armistice is in the air. We are \ngoing to have peace. I don't want any of you dying while we are about \nto have peace. So he shepherded all of them and put them under bridges \nin the Argonne Forest, saying: Hide for 24 hours because I sense that \nthere will be no war in 24 hours and I don't want you dying.\n  Sure enough, within 24 hours the war was over. My father used to \nwrite to this captain, who lived in Illinois, and thank him for taking \ngood care of him in the midst of that war, in the Argonne Forest, as a \nnon-American who had become an American citizen by getting drafted and \nserving. Just as all our other veterans, he was very proud.\n  Today we have so many millions of American men and women who, one way \nor another, were like my father. They went off to serve their country. \nThey have had times of great fear. They have had times of great \nconcern. They have had times when there was heroism all around them.\n  I close today by saying something to all of them. In all of our \nwars--I know a little about the First World War because of my father, \nas I told you--but from all of the wars, I thank them all on behalf of \nthe people of my State for what they have done to preserve the \ngreatness of this country and the concept of freedom and liberty.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I yield up to 1 minute to the Senator from \nMississippi, Mr. Lott.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Senator from Texas for coordinating the \nopportunity today for us to honor our veterans.\n  ``Greater love hath no man than this, that he lay down his life for \nhis friends,'' or in this case his country.\n  This quotation embodies my sentiment on this Veteran's Day, as we \nhonor those men and women who have laid down their lives for our great \ncountry, and those who stand ready in her defense.\n  I stand today to render my sharpest salute to the selfless, brave \nprofessionals who epitomize the most noble of citizens.\n  How can we express our gratitude and overflowing pride for our \nservice men and women who have paid the ultimate price for their \ncountry, and those friends and family members who have endured the loss \nof their loved ones?\n  How can we ever truly appreciate the comfort and safety that the \nsoldier, airman, or seaman affords us through his or her daily \ndedication to duty?\n  Perhaps there are lessons to be learned from the strong, silent, tall \nsoldier whose steely eyes well up with tears at the sounding of our \nNational Anthem.\n  Perhaps we could stand to learn some things from the weathered, \nsilver haired, proud veteran who stands taller and breathes deeply as \nhe hears another painful round of Taps.\n  Today we all stand in solemn remembrance of those Americans who gave \ntheir lives so that others may be free. Today I would like to remind \neveryone that those lives lost were not in vain. Because of these \nindividual sacrifices we are able today to remain the greatest free \nnation in the world.\n  I would like to mention my personal pride for the men and women from \nMississippi who so bravely currently serve and have served their nation \nin defense.\n  During the Vietnam War, 637 Mississippians gave their lives. In the \nKorean Conflict, from 1950 to 1957, 412 of our statesmen made the \nultimate sacrifice.\n  Since the horrific day that will forever be remembered, September 11, \n2001, Mississippi has lost nine soldiers during Operations Enduring \nFreedom and Iraqi Freedom.\n  More than 3000 of Mississippi's sons and daughters have responded to \nthis Nations latest call for arms in the global war on terrorism, and \noperations in Afghanistan in Iraq.\n  Unlike previous wars, the veterans of these latest operations will \nprobably not have battle names to remember like Leyte Gulf or \nVicksburg.\n  As the President has said, the global war on terror is a different \nkind of war, where some operations would be visible and others would \nnot be.\n  In this global war, our troops are supporting freedom and democracy \naround the globe, and fighting terrorism in the homelands of the \nterrorists and those who support them.\n  The war on terrorism will be a long war, and it will call for the \nendurance and perseverance of every American. In the end, there \nprobably won't be a truce or surrender document signed aboard a great \nbattleship. What there will be is stability, peace, and representative \ngovernment in places where terrorism used to breed--where dictators no \nlonger use poison gas on their own people, or have mass executions.\n  And on this Veterans Day we should remember all veterans, including \nthose who continue to serve in this different kind of war.\n  And it is most appropriate to honor and salute those Mississippians \nwho have lost their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan. They are: Kenneth \nBradley, Army Staff Sergeant of Jackson, MS; Henry L. Brown, Army \nCorporal, of Natchez, MS; Larry K.

The Senator has 2 minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to take up to 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nremarkable men and women who have, over the years, placed their lives \nin danger to preserve ours. On this Veterans Day, we remember those who \nmade the ultimate sacrifice. We express sincere gratitude for those who \ncontinue to serve and protect our freedom, and we honor those families \nwho also contribute every day in service of our country.\n  On the heels of Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and \nOperation Iraqi Freedom, this Veterans Day is particularly significant. \nAs we speak, American and allied soldiers continue to fight and die in \ndefense of our liberty. Many are face to face with danger at this very \nmoment.\n  It is these remarkable men and women, past and present, who embody \nthe democratic ideals that are the foundation of our great Nation. I \nwould like to share with you the story of one soldier who recently lost \nhis life in Iraq. The following commentary was written by LTC John Kem, \na former Army legislative fellow who worked on the Subcommittee on \nMilitary Construction during his year here. He wrote:\n\n       There are very few events more poignant than a memorial \n     service for a fallen Soldier. The service finishes with a \n     final roll call by the company first sergeant of the \n     Soldier's squad members. Each Soldier in turn responds: \n     ``Here, first sergeant.'' Then, three times in a row, the \n     first sergeant calls out the dead Soldier's name. Finally, \n     after the third silent pause, waiting for a response that \n     will never come, a lone bugler sounds Taps.\n       This evening [he said] I went to a memorial service for \n     Private Second Class Jonathan Falaniko. Jonathan was killed \n     on Oct. 27 in Baghdad by a rocket-propelled grenade. As you \n     would expect, the memorial service was sad, but it was also a \n     profound lesson on faith, selfless service and a family's \n     love.\n       Jonathan's unit, the 70th Engineer Battalion, is part of \n     the Army's 1st Armored Division Engineer Brigade. The senior \n     enlisted soldier in the brigade happened to be Jonathan's \n     father, Command Sergeant Major Ioakimo Falaniko.\n       After the company commander and a few of Jonathan's friends \n     spoke at the memorial service, the command sergeant major \n     stepped forward and spoke. He spoke about Jonathan as both a \n     soldier and a son.\n       Sergeant Major Falaniko read from a few of Jonathan's \n     recent letters.\n\n  For a point of reference, Jonathan was a new soldier who had been in \nthe Army less than 6 months. He attended basic training beginning in \nMay 2003 and deployed to Iraq in August of this year. The following \nquotes are from some of his letters in the last few months of his life:\n\n       Dad, I love being in the Army and I love serving my \n     country.\n       Dad, this is where I belong, and this is where I need to be \n     with you and the other iron soldiers.\n       Dad, I push myself hard because I know the drill sergeants \n     expect a lot out of me.\n       Dad, Iraq is a mess and I am glad we are here to fix it.\n\n  Sergeant Major Falaniko finished by sharing from his heart talking \nabout the kind of kid his was; the kind that loved his sisters and sent \nthem money on every payday just to let them know he was thinking about \nthem.\n  He concluded by saying to the hundreds of soldiers there at their \nmemorial service, from the three-star general to the private:\n\n       What our country brings to Iraq is a chance for freedom and \n     democracy . . . making a difference every day. My son died \n     for a good cause . . . he answered the Nation's call like a \n     typical American soldier. Jonathan was accomplishing his \n     mission, doing what he was supposed to be doing. He had a big \n     heart and he was proud to be a soldier.\n\n  Then, First Sergeant Allen called:\n\n       Private Falaniko.\n\n  And there was silence.\n  Again, he called:\n\n       Private Jonathan Falaniko.\n\n  And finally:\n\n       Private Jonathan Ioakimo Falaniko.\n\n  Silence prevailed.\n  Jonathan Falaniko was a hero who made the ultimate sacrifice. Both he \nand his father are examples of what makes our Army and our country \ngreat.\n  The Army and our Nation mourn his death. That young man--a soldier \nfor not even a full year--was buried at Arlington National Cemetery on \nFriday.\n  On this Veterans Day, I think we should reflect on the wonderful \nyoung men and wonderful fathers who would put service to country above \nall else, for they are the ones who are protecting the freedom that we \nenjoy today.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, today is Veterans Day. It is a time to \npay tribute to those who have fought for our freedom and made us the \nNation we are today.\n  On November 11, 1919, Veterans Day began as Armistice Day. It marked \nthe first anniversary of the cease-fire agreement among the Allied \npowers and Germany to end World War I. It was also to honor the men and \nwomen who sacrificed during that conflict.\n  In 1926, a congressional resolution officially named Armistice Day in \nthe United States. It became a national holiday 12 years later. In \n1954, Congress passed a law to change the name from Armistice Day to \nVeterans Day to honor veterans of all U.S. wars.\n  As I think about our veterans and all they have sacrificed, I am \nreminded of a day 6 months ago when I visited Madisonville, TN, to see \nand participate in the raising of the largest American flag in our \nState--1,800 square feet.\n  It was really an awful day. The rain was coming down, there was \nlightning and thunder, but hundreds of people stood there to \nparticipate in that ceremony because we knew we were enduring much less \nin that rain and in that lightning than men and women from Tennessee \nwho are serving in Afghanistan or Iraq, or had served on the beaches of \nNormandy, or in the rice fields of Vietnam.\n  Tennessee is the Volunteer State. From the battle of King's Mountain \nin the Revolutionary War, through the Mexican War, the Civil War, and \nour World Wars, Tennesseans have volunteered. We have honored those \nvolunteers, and we have honored them as veterans.\n  As this Nation devotes a day to our veterans, we honor both Tennessee \nveterans and Tennessee soldiers because so many Tennesseans--\nthousands--are serving in the battle against terrorism--men and women \nin active duty, as well as men and women in the National Guard and \nthose in the Reserves.\n  The best thing we all can do on this Veterans Day is to show as much \nrespect and honor to our veterans as our veterans have always shown to \nour country.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this year, as we again remember our \nveterans and the sacrifices they have made for our country on this 11th \nday of the 11th month, the men and women serving in our Armed Forces \ndeserve special recognition. This year's remembrance is a unique time \nas we honor new veterans coming home from the battlefields of \nAfghanistan and Iraq who have made the sacrifice and have answered the \ncall. Our appreciation and gratitude extends to all of them and their \nfamilies for the sacrifices that they have made.\n  As of last week, 395 American service members have been killed and \n1,889 American service members have been wounded during Operation Iraqi \nFreedom. Our thoughts and prayers are with them and their families. We \npray for the safety of those still in harm's way and hope they return \nhome soon. I visited some of our servicemen and women at Walter Reed \nArmy Medical Center here in Washington, DC recuperating from wounds \nthey received in Iraq. Some of them had lost limbs, and face \nsignificant physical challenges in building a new life. As I expressed \nmy appreciation to them for their sacrifices, I was humbled and \ninspired by their high spirits, their determination and their abiding \nfaith in our country.\n  November 11th--the day World War I ended in 1917--has been a \ndistinguished day of recognition for America's veterans since 1954 when \nPresident Dwight Eisenhower signed into law the day that would honor \nthe men and women who have served in our Nation's Armed Forces. Since \nthe founding of our country, almost 50 million men and women have \nserved in the United States military, and nearly half of them are still\n\n[[Page S14387]]\n\nalive. So today, there are appropriate ceremonies at Arlington National \nCemetery, throughout Michigan and the rest of the country to honor our \nveterans and what their service has meant to our country.\n  I would also like to recognize the African-American men and women who \nin years past served our Nation's Armed Forces in primarily segregated \nunits. While segregation in our Armed Forces is a shameful chapter in \nour Nation's past, these veterans should be uniquely recognized for \ntheir honorable service in the face of the burden of segregation. \nAfrican-American soldiers overcame a patten of prejudice that \nquestioned their ability and prevented them from training and working \nwith their white counterparts. Segregated African-American units have \nplayed an important and powerful role in America's military, from the \nCivil War's 54th Regiment of the Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, to \nthe Indian War's Buffalo Soldiers of the 9th and 10th Cavalry to World \nWar II's Tuskegee Airmen. Four hundred thousand African-American troops \nserved the United States in World War I and a million African Americans \nserved in World War II's segregated services. We should acknowledge \ntheir commitment which went beyond normal service and the call to duty. \nI am pleased that this past weekend, a special celebration of our \nAfrican-American veterans took place in my home State of Michigan at \nthe Color of Liberty Celebration at the Wayne County Armory.\n  I would also like to take a moment to stress the importance of the \nFederal Government meeting its obligations to all veterans to provide \nappropriate and adequate health care. There is a commitment by the \nappropriate committees to add an additional $1.3 billion for veterans \nhealth care before Congress adjourns this year. Right now, 60,000 \nveterans are waiting 6 months or longer for an appointment at VA \nhospitals. I am hopeful that Congress will fulfill our commitments to \nour veterans so that they have a strong VA health care system that is \nwell-funded and suitably staffed.\n  The terrorist attacks of September 11th and the courageous actions of \nour armed forces in Afghanistan and Iraq remind us that friends of \ntyranny and enemies of freedom still exist. Whether they are soldiers, \nsailors, airmen and marines who fought in the World Wars, Korea, \nVietnam or the Gulf wars, we thank them for their service, their \ncommitment and their sacrifice in the cause of America's freedom.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, on this Veterans Day, I rise to \nrecognize a group of truly deserving American veterans--the Tuskegee \nAirmen of World War II.\n  This heroic group of African American flyers fought in two types of \nbattles--the battle of World War II and the battle against racism at \nhome.\n  The Tuskegee airmen were dedicated, determined young men who enlisted \nto become America's first black military airmen, at a time when rampant \nracism led many people to falsely assume that black men lacked \nintelligence, skill, and patriotism. And boy, were they proved wrong.\n  The military feats of this group can be described as nothing less \nthan phenomenal.\n  In Order to enter the training program, the young men were held to \nthe same demanding physical and mental standards as all other military \npilots and soldiers of supporting fields. And between 1942 and 1946, \n992 black American pilots graduated from the rigorous program offered \nat Tuskegee Army Air Field, not to mention the black navigators, \nbombardiers, and gunnery crews that were trained at selected military \nbases elsewhere due to a lack of facilities at Tuskegee.\n  Four-hundred and fifty of the Tuskegee trained pilots headed to the \nSelfridge Air Base in Michigan for combat preparation, before bravely \nheading overseas as proud members of either the 99th Fighter Squadron \nor the 332nd Fighter Group, later to be conjoined. As the only four-\nsquadron fighter group performing bomber escort missions in the 15th \nAir Force, the 332nd Fighter Group had extraordinary and unprecedented \nsuccess. They flew all of their bomber escort missions--over 200--\nwithout the loss of a single bomber to enemy aircraft.\n  The bomber escort missions of the famed 332nd ``Red Tail'' fighters \nwere so daunting to the enemy that they served as an immensely strong \ndeterrent to challenges. The bomber crews that the group escorted \noffered abundant expressions of appreciation since they faced far fewer \nchallenges than other crews in the 15th Air Force.\n  Sadly, while these men were defending liberty for the people half a \nworld away, they were also fighting for their own liberation right here \nin the United States. Despite their valiant deeds abroad, racism and \nbigotry impeded their success at home. Due to strict segregationist \npolicies, their assignments were restricted to only two fighter groups, \nand one fighter wing. Their morale suffered more damage due to the lack \nof opportunities for advancement than their air fleet did by enemy \nfire.\n  Despite this setback, these soldiers still performed splendidly. In \n1949, Tuskegee pilots took first place in the Air Force National \nFighter Gunnery Meet, surpassing the performances of all the white \nunits.\n  The bigotry against these men only served to hurt America. During the \nwar, many white units badly needed additional qualified soldiers, but \ncould not draw upon the superb skills of the Tuskegee airmen due to the \nmilitary's segregationist policies.\n  But this cloud had its silver lining. The willpower and skill that \nbrought success for the Tuskegee airmen abroad also helped in the war \nagainst racism at home. President Harry Truman, recognizing the need \nfor an integrated air force, enacted an executive order demanding \nequality of treatment and opportunity in all of the armed forces.\n  The Tuskegee airmen were instrumental in the passing of this \nexecutive order, which paved the way for broader victories later on, \nincluding the end of racial segregation in all military forces, and \neventually in the United States as a whole.\n  These soldiers are a vibrant part of America's history and a part of \nMichigan's. Not only did many of the soldiers train at Selfridge Air \nBase, but the cadet classes drew heavily from the Detroit citizenry. \nOne such citizen made Michigan understand the value of the Tuskegee \nprogram to its own history.\n  Lieutenant Coleman Young, later to become a long-time mayor of \nDetroit, was a product of the Tuskegee experience. Assigned to the \n477th bombardier, he and his colleagues were never sent into combat due \nto racism from senior officers. Determined to preserve the memory of \nthe Tuskegee airmen, with the help of other Detroit members, he \nfostered what has become the National Tuskegee Airmen Historical \nMuseum, housed at historic Fort Wayne. This small but dignified museum, \noccupying an old officer's quarters, perpetuates the great story the \nTuskegee have to tell.\n  A story I believe we should all listen to. All in all, these soldiers \ngave over 150 lives in the name of their country and in the name of \nfreedom. I now call on that country, the United States, to provide them \nthe recognition they deserve on this Veterans Day.\n  According to existing records, 155 Tuskegee soldiers originated from \nMichigan, I wish to recognize each one of them:\n\n                            Tuskegee Airmen\n\n       Kermit Bailer; Clarence Banton; James Barksdale of Detroit; \n     Hugh Barrington of Farmington Hills; Naomi Bell; Thomas \n     Billingslea; Lee Blackmon; Charles Blakely of Detroit, Robert \n     Bowers of Detroit; James Brown of Ypsilanti; Willor Brown of \n     Ypsilanti; Ernest Browne of Detroit; Archibald Browning; Otis \n     Bryant; Joseph Bryant, Jr. of Dowagiac; Charles Byous; Ernest \n     Cabule of Detroit; Waldo Cain; Clinton Canady of Lansing; \n     Carl Carey of Detroit; Gilbert Cargil; Nathaniel Carr of \n     Detroit; Donald Carter of Detroit; Clifton Casey; David \n     Cason, Jr; Peter Cassey of Detroit; Robert Chandler of \n     Allegan; Pembleton Cochran of Detroit; Alfred Cole of \n     Southfield; James Coleman of Detroit; William Coleman of \n     Detroit; Eugene Coleman; Matthew Corbin of Detroit; Charles \n     Craig of Detroit; Herbert Crushshon; John Cunningham of \n     Romulus; and John Curtis of Detroit.\n       Donald Davis of Detroit; Cornelius Davis of Detroit; Eugene \n     Derricotte of Detroit; Taremund Dickerson of Detroit; Walter \n     Downs of Southfield; John Egan; Leavie Farro, Jr.; Howard \n     Ferguson; Thomas Flake of Detroit; Harry Ford, Jr. of \n     Detroit; Luther Friday; Alfonso Fuller of Detroit; William \n     Fuller of West Bloomfield; Frank Gardner; Robert Garrison of \n     Muskegon; Thomas Gay of Detroit; Charles Goldsby of Detroit; \n     Ollie Goodall, Jr. of Detroit; Quintus Green, Sr.;\n\n[[Page S14388]]\n\n     Mitchell Greene; James Greer of Detroit; Alphonso Harper of \n     Detroit; Bernard Harris of Detroit; Denzal Harvey; James \n     Hayes of Detroit; Ernest Haywood of Detroit; Minus Heath; \n     Milton Henry of Bloomfield Hills; Mary Hill; Charles Hill, \n     Jr. of Detroit; Lorenzo Holloway of Detroit; Lynn Hooe of \n     Farmington Hills; Heber Houston of Detroit; Ted Hunt; and \n     Hansen Hunter, Jr.\n       Leonard Isabelle Sr., Leonard Jackson; Lawrence Jefferson \n     of Grand Rapids; Alexander Jefferson of Detroit; Silas \n     Jenkins of Lansing; Richard Jennings of Detroit; Louie \n     Johnson of Farmington; Ralph Jones; William Keene of Detroit; \n     Laurel Keith of Cassopolis; Hezekiah Lacy of River Rouge; \n     Richard Macon of Detroit; Albert Mallory; Thomas Malone; \n     Ralph Mason of Detroit; J.

Mr. President, today, on Veterans Day, we commemorate \nand pay special honor to all the veterans who have made such great \nsacrifices in the name of country and democracy.\n  This day is particularly poignant as our Nation is at war. There are \nmore than 150,000 military service members in harm's way, fighting \noverseas in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  They fight for freedom of the Iraqi people, who have faced decades of \nextreme oppression and brutality under Saddam Hussein, and against the \nTaliban forces, who continue to pose a challenge in Afghanistan.\n  Sadly, nearly 500 have paid the ultimate sacrifice and many more have \nsustained life altering injuries.\n  And as we prepare to send thousands more in harm's way, I believe \nthat it's our obligation to ensure that our military service members \nand veterans receive full support from Congress, and that our efforts \nare tailored to benefit those who proudly serve this Nation.\n  We have recently granted the Administration an additional $87 billion \ndollars in supplemental funding for Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  While I would have preferred that some of those funds be in the form \nof a loan to Iraq, and that there be more safeguards to ensure the \nfunds are well-used, I believe that it was necessary to provide these \nfunds.\n  It is clear to me that we must stay the course, and we must rebuild \nthe infrastructure, prevent civil war, and see to it that Iraq does not \nbecome a base for terror and instability throughout the region.\n  We must see to it that a stable governmental structure and viable \neconomy apart from Saddam's tyrannical dictatorship can be put in \nplace.\n  And most importantly, we must see to it that our troops are given all \nthe tools necessary to accomplish these objectives.\n  Approving the additional funding was the only way to truly support \nour military service members and aid their ultimate success.\n  As we seek to ensure that the current war efforts are well funded, we \nalso need to realize that very soon, the young men and women of our \narmed forces will be returning home.\n  Some will require extraordinary care for a long period of time. It is \nincumbent upon us to ensure that they have adequate facilities to aid \nthem in their recovery and recuperation.\n  There must not be any doubt by any of our injured veterans that they \ndid the right thing in sacrificing health to defend our nation's \ninterest.\n  The best way to prove to them that they have our full support is to \nensure that they receive good health care and adequate benefits once \nthey return home.\n  It is our responsibility to make sure that our veterans are not \nwaiting six months or longer for appointments at VA hospitals, nor \nshould they have to wait for 15 months for disability claims to be \nfinalized, as is now often the case.\n  And prescriptions costs must be affordable.\n  We need to make room available in VA hospitals to ensure that all of \nour veterans whether active duty or reserves are adequately served.\n  In order to accomplish this task we must be cautious as we close \nhospitals under the Capital Assets Realignment for Enhanced Services--\nCARES--program to ensure that we don't leave our veterans stranded \nwithout accessible services.\n  As our veterans return home, some with great and debilitating \ninjuries, we must also ensure that their compensation is just, full, \nand reflective of the American spirit.\n  Finally, we need to remember the families of the great men and women \nwho are separated from their loved ones.\n  We must make sure that their concerns are the Nation's concerns. \nWhile their loved ones are overseas fighting for America's interest, \nCongress must ensure that their medical needs are covered.\n  As I reflect on the origin of Veterans Day, it brings me great hope \nthat our service members will be home and peace will reign again.\n  On June 4, 1934, Congress enacted a concurrent resolution, \nrecognizing November 11, 1918. The resolution states: ``Whereas the 11 \nof November 1918, marked the cessation of the most destructive, \nsanguinary, and far reaching war in human annals and the resumption by \nthe people of the United States of peaceful relation with other \nnations, which we hope may never again be severed, and Whereas it is \nfitting that the recurring anniversary of this date should be \ncommemorated with thanksgiving and prayer and exercises designed to \nperpetuate peace through good will and mutual understanding between \nnations; . . . ''\n  On May 13, 1938, the 11 of November was approved as a legal holiday \ndedicated to world peace, known as Armistice Day. Finally, on June 1, \n1954, Congress renamed Armistice Day to Veterans Day, thereby \ncommending all veterans.\n  Veterans Day is often associated with war, but its true significance \nlies in peace and humanity.\n  Since September 11 this country has undergone tremendous struggle and \nuncertainty.\n  We have shown that our resiliency is greater than our fears and our \nconvictions of freedom and right can not be compromised.\n  This country is great because its citizens are great. This country \nwas born from the sacrifice of its citizens and the vision they saw.\n  Today we honor the citizens who served and continue to serve our \ngreat country. They are the protectors of our democracy and our way of \nlife; they are our veterans.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, in the past few days, the tragic headlines \nfrom Iraq have reminded us of the selfless sacrifices our soldiers, \nsailors, marines and airmen make every day to keep this country strong \nand safe. The conflict in Iraq brings home again the debt we owe to \nAmerica's veterans for their service and their sacrifices.\n  In North Dakota, we are extremely proud to have the highest per \ncapita participation in the Guard of any State and to be among the \nleaders in per capita participation in the Reserves. More than 1,000 \nNorth Dakota National Guardsmen and reservists in Iraq, Kuwait and \nAfghanistan are serving with distinction. Behind these statistics, \nthough, are individual soldiers who have left behind families. With the \nwonders of modern technology, I can hear directly from soldiers who are \non the frontlines in Iraq. I hear of their accomplishments, when \nthey've helped make life just a little better for an Iraqi family or \neven a whole community. I hear of their pride in doing a job well for \ntheir country. But I also hear\n\n[[Page S14389]]\n\nof their frustration with searing heat, swirling dust, and irregular \naccess to showers and the other comforts we take for granted. I hear of \ntheir worries about family at home, how their loved ones are coping \nwith their absence and their concern that the news of deaths and \ninjuries among their fellow soldiers are adding to the stress on their \nfamilies. I hear their longing to get back to home and family. In \nshort, I hear of the sacrifices they are making on our behalf.\n  And every day I hear from the family members of our activated \nservicemen and servicewomen. I hear how proud they are that their \nbeloved ones are serving the country they love. But I also hear of the \nadded burden that those left behind must bear. I hear the frustration \nof not knowing when a loved one will come home and of learning that the \ndeployment has been extended. I hear of the hit on the family finances \nfor Guardsmen or reservists who have left higher paying jobs to serve \ntheir country--and of the spouses who are left to keep the family \nbusiness running on their own. I hear of the added work as one parent \ntakes on the work normally done by two--the caregiving, the helping \nwith homework, the coaching, the meal preparation--all the little \nchores that add up and are starting to become a source of stress for \nsome families. I hear the added anxiety of knowing that a loved one is \nserving in a dangerous role far from home. Each time the phone rings, \nthey hope that it will be a rare opportunity to hear that everything is \ngoing well and to say ``I love you,'' but they fear that it could be \nnews of a casualty. In short, I hear of the sacrifices that they are \nmaking on our behalf.\n  And I hear of the tremendous impact on small communities throughout \nNorth Dakota. The current call-up has meant the loss of valued \nemployees in small businesses on main streets across the state. It has \nmeant the loss of teachers, volunteer firefighters, policemen, and \nmedical personnel. And it has meant the absence of church leaders, PTA \nleaders, Little League coaches. In short, it has meant sacrifices great \nand small.\n  So this Veterans Day, we are reminded of the tremendous sacrifices of \nour veterans and their families. Today is a Federal holiday. But it is \nmore than that. It is an opportunity to stop and thank veterans for \ntheir service and their sacrifice. It is an opportunity to tell them \nhow proud they make you. And it is an opportunity to remember those who \nmade the ultimate sacrifice and the debt of gratitude and honor this \ncountry owes to their heroism.\n  I deeply regret that the business of the Senate is keeping me here in \nWashington so that I am not able to deliver that message personally to \nthe tens of thousands of North Dakota veterans who served in past \nconflicts and wars. More than 50,000 veterans currently live in my \nState. Their service is rich in history. I remember reviewing \nhistorical accounts of one of the most significant engagements \ninvolving North Dakotans in 1942, when members of the 164th Infantry \nRegiment of the ND Army National Guard were the first Army unit to \nengage in combat action in the Pacific Theater on Guadalcanal. I was \nhonored to have introduced a resolution that passed the Senate in 1992 \npaying tribute to the heroic actions of the 164th Infantry unit.\n  Today, as I noted earlier, military personnel from our State continue \nto protect our homeland and to serve in hostile environments around the \nworld. Active duty personnel from the Minot and Grand Forks AFB, Air \nNational Guard from Fargo, and the more than 1,000 Army National \nGuardsmen and reservists continue to play a vital role in homeland \nsecurity and in the fight against terrorism. We owe these active duty \npersonnel and their families a deep debt of gratitude for responding to \nthe extraordinary challenges posed by international terrorism.\n  As we observe Veterans Day, let us remember that the respect and \nappreciation that we show our veterans and active duty personnel on \nthis day is an act that we should demonstrate every day of the year. It \nis especially important that we honor veterans and their families by \nmaking certain that our active duty personnel and veterans receive the \nbenefits that we have promised and that they are entitled to receive. \nWe can do no less for the sacrifices that they have made.\n  That is why I am working hard in the remaining days of the 1st \nSession of the 108th Congress to make certain that our veterans receive \nsignificant increases in funding for VA health care, funding that \nshould come as close as possible to the recommendations of our national \nveterans service organizations in the annual Independent Budget. I am \nhopeful that Congress will increase the VA health care budget by $1.3 \nbillion, bringing the level close to $27.2 billion. I strongly support \nthat increase. Additionally, I am very concerned by the uncertainty of \nannual appropriations for VA health care every year, and believe that \nwe need to make VA health care funding mandatory to guarantee that \nveterans get the health care they need and deserve. I am pleased to be \na cosponsor of legislation, S. 50, that would guarantee full funding \nfor VA health care.\n  I also believe that it is time to end the penalty against our \ndisabled veterans, and am pleased that we are making progress on \nproviding full concurrent receipt of veterans disability compensation \nand military retirement pay for more veterans. While final action has \nnot been completed on the concurrent receipt, I am hopeful that an \nagreement to expand significantly the number of veterans eligible for \nconcurrent receipt and military retirement pay, without an offset, will \nbe enacted by Congress in the very near future. We must, however, \ncontinue our efforts to provide full concurrent receipt for all \nveterans entitled to this benefit.\n  Let me close by saying thank you. Thank you to our veterans. Thank \nyou to our military personnel now on active duty around the world. Your \nservice and your sacrifice make me, and you make America, very, very \nproud.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, today marks the 50th anniversary of \nVeterans Day. This historic occasion is an important opportunity for \nall Americans to express our gratitude to our Nation's veterans for the \nsacrifices they have made serving our country and defending our \nfreedom.\n  My first sense of the sacrifice made by our veterans came from my \nfamily. My father volunteered to serve in the Air Force during World \nWar II, and flew missions over Europe. I will never forget his stories \nof the war, of the men with whom he served, and of the dangers they \nfaced together. Yet he knew full well the risks he would face when he \njoined up.\n  In fact, my father enlisted after learning that his brother was \nmissing in action. Like the hundreds of thousands who fell at places \nlike Normandy, Guadalcanal, Anzio, and Attu, and places so desolate \nthey remain unnamed, my uncle never came home. He and his brothers in \narms gave their lives to defend freedom at home and around the world.\n  In perhaps the most eloquent testament to the sacrifice of our \nNation's veterans, President Abraham Lincoln said:\n\n       But in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate--we cannot \n     consecrate--we cannot hallow--this ground. The brave men, \n     living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far \n     above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little \n     note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never \n     forget what they did here.\n\n  President Lincoln's stirring words are as true today as they were at \nGettysburg 140 years ago this month. The ongoing deployments in the \nMiddle East are a reminder of these sacrifices. Earlier this year, I \nhad the opportunity to visit American troops stationed in Afghanistan \nand Iraq. I was impressed by their grit and their resolve to carry out \na dangerous mission under extremely difficult circumstances.\n  I was also proud to join the families and neighbors who welcomed home \nthe thousands of Washington sailors, aviators, and Marines who served \nin the U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln carrier battle group. It was uplifting to \nsee such a tremendous outpouring of support for our troops.\n  Sadly, not all of them will make it home. To the families and loved \nones of those men and women who have given their lives, I offer my \nheartfelt sympathy. You have the everlasting gratitude of the State of \nWashington and the Nation.\n  I am profoundly grateful for the service of America's military \npersonnel and for the sacrifices they have made in protecting our \ncountry and our freedoms. Although we commemorate their service on this \nspecial day each year, it\n\n[[Page S14390]]\n\nis important to remember that the men and women in uniform make \nsacrifices to safeguard America every day.\n  Their service, both in peacetime and in war, protects us all. Our \nresponsibility to them is to ensure that they and their families are \nprovided the recognition that they have earned and so greatly deserve. \nIt is also our charge, as Lincoln described it, to renew our dedication \nto the ``great task remaining before us''--to renew our dedication to \nfreedom and democracy. I am confident that as we a nation will continue \nto live up to this challenge. I hope that we can meet our obligations \nas citizens with the same sense of duty and honor with which America's \nveterans served.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, on Veterans Day, it is fitting to pause, \nremember and recognize the contributions of those who have defended \nAmerica throughout our history. Today, I would also like to recognize a \nman who risked his life to save his fellow marines in the horrific \nWorld War II battle for Iwo Jima.\n  Historian David Kennedy, in his book ``Freedom from Fear,'' describes \nthe battle of Iwo Jima:\n\n       The twenty-one-thousand-man Japanese garrison had \n     honeycombed Iwo's basaltic ridges and Suribachi's ashen \n     flanks with reinforced concrete-and-steel bunkers and stuffed \n     them with artillery, antiaircraft guns, mortars, and machine \n     guns. They were so well and deeply entrenched that seventy-\n     two days of aerial bombing and three days of naval shelling \n     barely scratched them. At first light on February 19 two \n     divisions of marines, each man carrying up to a hundred \n     pounds of gear, stepped from their amphtracs onto Iwo's \n     beaches and sank to their boot-tops in the powdery mixture of \n     sand and volcanic ash. Vehicles, including tanks and half-\n     tracks, soon bogged down in the quicksand-like topping of \n     pumice and cinder that blanketed the island. From the \n     Japanese bunkers and pillboxes a hellish rain of shells and \n     bullets pelted the beaches, where the marines seemed to be \n     moving in slow motion through the sucking sand . . .\n       The battle ground on . . . with unmatched barbarity. \n     Japanese soldiers stubbornly refused to surrender. When the \n     fighting ended at last in late March, only a few hundred \n     Japanese, mostly wounded, had allowed themselves to be taken \n     prisoner.\n\n  From February 19 to March 25, 1945, 6,140 Marine and Navy soldiers \nwere killed on Iwo Jima and 17,372 were wounded. Nearly two of three \nsoldiers who fought on Iwo Jima were killed or wounded. Twenty-two \nMarines and four corpsmen received medals of honor.\n  During those terrible days of February and March of 1945, George E. \nWahlen was a medical corpsman. James Bradley, in the book, Flags of our \nFathers said this:\n\n       . . . In the European theater, my dad (a navy corpsman) \n     would have worn a red cross on his helmet and expected the \n     Germans to spare him as a noncombatant. And he would have \n     been unarmed, according to the Geneva Convention. but the \n     Pacific theater was different. . . . The Japanese on Iwo Jima \n     had been trained to look for corpsmen by identifying their \n     telltale medical pouch--and shoot them on the spot. Without a \n     corpsman to save the wounded, the Japanese knew, their kill \n     ratio would be much higher . . .\n\n  Though seriously wounded three times in 26 days, corpsman George \nWhalen refused evacuation and repeatedly defined heavy mortar and rifle \nfire from the enemy to find and treat his wounded comrades. \nDisregarding his own safety, he continued to cross open terrain under \nfire to aid his friends, until he was so badly wounded, he could no \nlonger walk. Even then, he carried on, crawling across the ground \nthrough the raging battle to administer aid to yet another fallen \ncomrade. For his unselfish and steadfast courage, and for ``conspicuous \ngallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the \ncall of duty.'' George Wahlen was awarded the Medal of Honor, and is \nUtah's only living recipient of that rare recognition.\n  We are all familiar with the language of military honors, but, in \nthese challenging times, where American soldiers and sailors, airmen \nand marines, once again are serving in foreign lands and showing the \nsame gallant spirit of sacrifice and courage in the face of battle, we \nneed to hear it again. I would like to quote from Mr. Wahlen's \ncitation:\n\n       Painfully wounded . . .  he remained on the battlefield, \n     advancing well forward of the front lines to aid a wounded \n     marine and carrying him back to safety despite a terrific \n     concentration of fire. Tireless in his ministrations, he \n     consistently disregarded all danger to attend his fighting \n     comrades as they fell under the devastating rain of shrapnel \n     and bullets. . . .  When an adjacent platoon suffered heavy \n     casualties, he defied the continuous pounding of heavy \n     mortars and deadly fire of enemy rifles to care for the \n     wounded, working rapidly in an area swept by constant fire \n     and treating 14 casualties before returning to his own \n     platoon. Wounded again . . .  he gallantly refused \n     evacuation, moving out with his company the following day in \n     a furious assault across 600 yards of open terrain and \n     repeatedly rendering medical aid while exposed to the \n     blasting fury of powerful Japanese guns. Stouthearted and \n     indomitable, he persevered in his determined efforts as \n     his unit waged fierce battle and, unable to walk after \n     sustaining a third agonizing wound, resolutely crawled 50 \n     yards to administer first aid to still another fallen \n     fighter. By his dauntless fortitude and valor, Wahlen \n     served as a constant inspiration and contributed vitally \n     to the high morale of his company during critical phases \n     of this strategically important engagement. His heroic \n     spirit of self-sacrifice in the face of overwhelming enemy \n     fire upheld the highest traditions of the U.S. Naval \n     Service.\n\n  James Bradley, in an article in the Wall Street Journal on November \n10, 2002, considered the phrase ``Uncommon Valor was a Common Virtue'' \nin his search to learn the story of his dad, and others at Iwo Jima. \nMr. Bradley wrote:\n\n       Corpsman George Wahlen was injured in the eye and shoulder, \n     but patched himself up secretly so he would not be evacuated. \n     When an exploding shell shattered his ankle, leaving his foot \n     dangling and all but disconnected from the leg, he shot \n     himself with morphine, taped up his ankle, and crawled back \n     to the fight with one good eye, one good arm, and one good \n     leg. Corpsman Wahlen had to be dragged off the field of \n     battle. ``Why?'' I asked. He answered, ``I just did what \n     anyone else would have done in the situation.''\n       . . . I thought to myself, ``If uncommon valor was so \n     common on Iwo Jima, why can't I find the Rambos of my \n     imagination?'' All I could find were humble guys who insisted \n     they hadn't done much . . . But I realized then that what my \n     dad's life and words, and the words and lives of these other \n     heroes, were trying to tell me, was that it was all about \n     common virtue.\n       My dad and his comrades were men of common virtue before \n     Iwo Jima, on Iwo Jima, and after Iwo Jima. Their actions and \n     lives were consistent . . . I realized that the key to my \n     dad's life was the attitude of common virtue he practiced \n     throughout his days. . . . My dad, running through bullets on \n     Iwo Jima, doing his duty in the Pacific. My dad having the \n     patience to teach me, a young son, how to tie his shoes. My \n     dad, just lending a hand in his community. . . . And I am \n     confident that if my dad were here to read these words about \n     common virtue being the root of heroism, he would shake his \n     head in agreement and say: ``It's as simple as that.''\n\n  Mr. Wahlen has demonstrated common virtue throughout his life and \ncontinues to do so. He did not end his service on Iwo Jima. Following \nWorld War II, true to the code of what Tom Brokaw called ``the greatest \ngeneration,'' he went on to serve his country in two more wars and to \ndedicate countless volunteer hours in following years to the service of \nhis fellow veterans.\n  It is to honor this fine and humble man, who would be the last to \nclaim such an honor for himself, that I am proposing to change the name \nof the Department of Veterans Affairs' Medical Center in Salt Lake \nCity, UT to the ``George E. Wahlen Department of Veterans Affairs \nMedical Center.'' Senator Hatch and I introduced this legislation, S. \n1815, last week.\n  This is a proper and fitting thing to do, not only because of Mr. \nWahlen's accomplishments and service, but also because he is beloved by \nhis fellow veterans. This is made clear by the unanimous support I \nreceived in support of this change from all of the State commanders and \ndirectors of Utah's veterans' organizations and State and Federal \nagencies: the American Legion, the Disabled American Veterans, the \nVeterans of Foreign Wars, the VA Regional Office, the Utah Division of \nVeterans Affairs, and the VA Medical Center itself.\n  When carrying the 2002 Olympic Torch George Wahlen said, ``It's an \nhonor, but I feel like I'm representing all the veterans in the State \nof Utah.'' He has represented veterans so often over the last 30 years. \nIn this circumstance, we honor George Wahlen, as a veteran, a Medal of \nHonor recipient, a man of both valor and virtue, and as a \nrepresentative of all of the veterans who have served their country.\n  Many veterans who returned as heroes are often uncomfortable with the \ndesignation of heroes. James Bradley, in Flags of our Fathers, \nrecounted a story where his third grade teacher referred to James's \nfather as a hero and wanted him to come and speak to his\n\n[[Page S14391]]\n\nclass. He recounts the exchange with his father:\n\n       ``Jim, your teacher said something about heroes . . .''\n       I shifted expectantly in my chair, waiting to hear some \n     stories of valor. Instead he looked me directly in my nine-\n     year-old eyes, signaling that he'd like to embed an idea in \n     my brain for the rest of my life. He said ``I want you to \n     always remember something. The heroes of Iwo Jima are the \n     guys who didn't come back.''\n\n  Today, we remember those who came back and those who didn't--those \nwho didn't come back from Iwo Jima, from Guadalcanal, from Normandy, \nfrom Vietnam, from Korea, from Afghanistan, from Iraq.\n  While words fail to make an adequate tribute to those who lost their \nlives and paid a price in sacrifice for what we enjoy today, I will \nborrow from what has already been written. In 1940, Winston Churchill \nspoke to the House of Commons in relation to the Battle of Britain. He \nsaid, ``Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so \nmany to so few.''\n  There are heroes that never came back. There are heroes that did. Let \nus not forget.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the veterans of the \nU.S. Armed Services and to thank those who continue to serve bravely \nand protect the United States around the world.\n  My home State of Louisiana has made a significant contribution to the \nwar on terrorism. Since September 11, 2001, more than 15,000 Louisiana \nmen and women have fought to protect Americans from those that threaten \nour safety. Every military installation in Louisiana has contributed to \nthis effort. There are 4,000 men and women from Fort Polk currently \nserving in Iraq, more than 6,000 members from Barksdale Air Force Base \ndeployed since September 11, and thousands of reservists and Guardsmen \ncontinue to be activated and deployed throughout our country and the \nworld. In the coming months, over one hundred more Marine Reservists \nfrom Belle Chasse Joint Reserve Base in Louisiana will be called into \naction in Iraq. I would like to take this opportunity to express my \ndeep gratitude for their sacrifice.\n  I also want to let the roughly 379,000 veterans living in Louisiana \nand those around the country know we do not forget your service to our \ncountry. We will be eternally grateful for your service to the United \nStates in our past and present wars against communism, fascism, and \nterrorism. Our Nation stays strong because of your efforts, and the \nworld is a better place for the things you have done.\n  On this anniversary of the historic World War I armistice in Europe, \nI honor the great achievements and sacrifices of the acting and retired \nmembers of the United States Armed Services and thank them for their \nbravery.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I pay tribute to the 26.4 million military \nveterans and their families living in the United States who have served \nin defense of our great Nation. In 1918, on the 11th hour of the 11th \nday in the 11th month, the world rejoiced and celebrated. After four \nyears of bitter war, an armistice was signed. The ``war to end all \nwars'' was over. How unprophetic were these sincere but hopeful words.\n  The turn of events has since made us realize more than ever that \n``Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty,'' and Armistice Day has \nturned into Veterans Day to honor all our brave men and women who \nserved since that hope-filled day in many countries to defend liberty \nand freedom.\n  America today, and this imperfect world, is a better place because of \nthe sacrifices made by our veterans and their families, many of whom \npaid the ultimate price, for ``The only thing necessary for the triumph \nof evil is for good men to do nothing.'' When duty called, our veterans \nresponded magnificently.\n  As we engage in Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Enduring Freedom, \nOperation Noble Eagle, and countless other missions around the world, \nit is important that we support our men and women in the military by \nproviding them with the training, equipment, and resources necessary \nfor them to accomplish their mission so that they can return to their \nfamilies in a timely manner. We must also honor their families who also \nsacrifice precious time with them so that they can defend our freedom.\n  At the same time, we must never forget the contributions and \nsacrifices made by those veterans who served in past conflicts, and \ntheir families. We must work to ensure that our veterans are provided \nwith appropriate services and benefits, such as adequate health care, \nin a timely fashion. We currently face a $1.8 billion shortfall in \nfunding needed to provide healthcare for our veterans. I remain \ncommitted to ensuring that our veterans are provided with the services \nand benefits that they have earned.\n  I am honored to pay tribute to these fine individuals on behalf of a \ngrateful Nation.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, from the Meuse-Argonne campaign of \nWorld War I to the action in Operation Iraqi Freedom, American \nsoldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines have fought on front lines \naround the globe to defend our freedom at home. Whether fighting on the \nbattlefield or manning the ramparts against the threat of Communist \naggression, it is courage, commitment and endurance of the American \nfighting forces that have made possible the unprecedented prosperity \nand political freedom that we enjoy today. As a result of the constant \nstruggle to defend freedom, we now have 26 million American veterans, \nabout 768,000 of which are from my home state of Georgia.\n  With each year that passes, these veterans are growing older. At last \ncount, 37 percent of these heroes are over 65 years old and many of \nthem need medical care. Caring for these brave men and women is an \nobligation that we must take seriously. In my first year as a \nCongressman, in 1995, spending on veterans healthcare was $16 billion. \nJust 9 years later, President Bush's fiscal year budget request was $27 \nbillion, an increase of $11 billion. We can always do better, and we \nwill, but I think that this dramatic rise in funding is remarkable.\n  We have taken other significant steps to help our Nation's veterans, \nincluding concurrent receipt legislation in the fiscal year 2004 \nDefense Authorization Act, which we will consider today on the floor of \nthe Senate. This provision helps disabled veterans wounded in combat to \nreceive both their disability compensation as well as the pension which \nthey earned in service to our Nation. In addition, the concurrent \nreceipt provision will extend full disability and Veterans Affairs \nretirement pay for all disabled veterans rated 50 percent and higher. \nWhen enacted, this provision does more to honor our Nation's disabled \nveterans than Congress has done in years.\n  On this day, my thoughts and prayers are with the families of the \nfallen soldiers who were deployed from my home State and throughout the \nNation, who served with honor and bravery in the Middle East and \nAfghanistan. My thought and prayers are also with the family of GEN Ray \nDavis, who passed away earlier this year and whose legacy of service, \nhonor, and heroism will be remembered for years to come.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I join with my colleagues on this \nVeterans Day in paying tribute to those men and women who have so ably \nserved in our Nation's Armed Forces and honoring the tremendous \nsacrifices they have made for this great country.\n  I firmly believe that those citizens who have been called upon to \ndefend our Nation, to risk and in many cases sacrifice their lives, \ndeserve our utmost respect and gratitude, for these noble men and women \nare responsible for the peace and freedom which we, as Americans, \ncherish.\n  As we use this time to reflect upon the heroic deeds of the past, we \nshould also recognize the significance of these deeds for the present \nand the future. Due to the unselfish efforts of those of who have \nserved, those who serve now, and the efforts of all of those who are no \nlonger here with us, the world continues to be a safer place and the \nprinciples of democracy survive.\n  I have often said we ought not be sunshine patriots, that our \ndedication to the men and women who have served should not solely be \nreserved for days such as this. Rather, we should be cognizant of their \ncontributions every day of the year.\n  Throughout my time in Congress, I am pleased to have fought hard on \nbehalf of the issues of importance to our Nation's veterans: improving \nveterans\n\n[[Page S14392]]\n\nhealth care and making it more accessible, protecting our veterans' \nbenefits, including the authorization of concurrent receipt, and \nensuring that each veteran has a proper burial.\n  This week, the Senate may take up the Department of Veterans Affairs \nAppropriations bill--which will fund VA and its programs during the \ncurrent fiscal year. I am pleased to have joined with many of my \ncolleagues in working to increase the VA budget by $1.3 billion--to \nensure that all veterans receive the benefits to which they are \nentitled. I am hopeful that this increase will ultimately be included \nin the bill when it is sent to the President for signature.\n  In my view, we have a responsibility to adequately fund these \nprograms--programs critical to the continued health and welfare of our \nNation's veterans. It is simply a matter of fairness and is, indeed, \nthe very least we can do to honor their commitment and service to this \nNation.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise to call attention to the \nimportance of the Veterans Day commemoration ceremonies and private \nremembrances, both formal and informal, being observed today by \nAmericans around the Nation and across the world.\n  Given the many demands on this body and the hectic pace of modern \nlife, it is all too easy for the Senate, as well as for all Americans, \nto fail to give this day--Veterans' Day the attention it demands. It is \nall too easy to let the date on the calendar pass without stopping and \nreflecting.\n  But, as citizens, as well as public servants, we must never fail to \ncommemorate, honor, and remember in our hearts our veterans and their \nsacrifices and what those sacrifices have meant to our country.\n  A mere once a year we are called to publicly applaud and honor the \nmany Americans, living and deceased, men and women of every ethnic \ngroup and walk of life, who have given of themselves, their time, their \nyouth, their sweat, and, all too frequently, their blood, and their \nlives. Their sacrifices have kept us free and enabled us to remain the \nlast best hope of the world.\n  About this nation's revolution, Thomas Paine wrote:\n\n       These are the times that try men's souls. The summer \n     soldier and the sunshine patriot will shrink from the service \n     of their country; but he that stands it now, deserves the \n     love and thanks of man and woman.\n\n  In observing Veterans Day today, we offer our love and thanks to \nthose Americans, over the course of our history, who did not shrink \nfrom the service of their country.\n  Most came to military service willingly, even eagerly, many with good \nhumor and high hopes, some more reluctantly, and more than a few who, \nfrankly, would rather have been elsewhere.\n  I can remember myself some years ago, as a young marine humping an \n81-millimeter mortar tube across the California desert, wishing very \nsincerely to be elsewhere at that moment.\n  What they all have in common, and what we all honor today, is that \nthey did not shrink from the service to their country, and still don't.\n  As they did not shrink from service during World War II in the \nPacific and in Europe, in long and bitter wars in Korea and Vietnam, in \nLebanon and Grenada, in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and, today, in Iraq \nand in Afghanistan, on hundreds of ships in every ocean of the world; \nin Minot, ND; and in Fort Dix, NJ; on Diego Garcia and in Misawa, \nJapan; at Ft. Benning, GA; on Paris Island, SC; and at Walter Reed Army \nHospital and Bethesda Naval Hospital here in Washington.\n  They responded to a sense of duty, obligation, and a desire to belong \nto or strive for something separate and apart from personal ambition.\n  They may not even see or clearly understand at the time their own \nmotivations, but they do not shrink from service all the same, and our \ncountry is the better for it.\n  A simple choice on the face of it--the willingness to serve--but one \nthat, given the unparalleled abundance of choices that Americans today \nenjoy--we must recognize, honor and support.\n  As we stop to honor our veterans, we must go beyond rhetorical \nsupport.\n  We must provide for those who have served the rest of us so well, and \nwe need to do so in practical and concrete terms, for our debt to our \nveterans' demands that we respond to their needs and their concerns, \nand demands that we deliver the benefits they have earned through their \nservice and sacrifice.\n  First, full accountability for all MIA/POW's, without exception. \nThere is no higher obligation for a country than to keep faith with \nthose of its fighting men and women who may still be in enemy hands. We \nmust not turn away.\n  In this regard, I urge the administration and the Defense Department \nto continue their search for CAPT Michael Scott Speicher, United States \nNavy, whose family is from New Jersey and whose aircraft was shot down \nover Iraq in 1991.\n  Then-Commander Speicher was reported as the first American service \nmember killed in action in Desert Storm. His status, however, was \nchanged by the Department of Defense from killed in action to MIA and \nthen, in 2002, to POW. More indications suggesting Captain Speicher may \nhave survived his 1991 shoot-down came to light after our liberation of \nIraq.\n  The Defense Department's search for him, with the urging of my Senate \ncolleagues and me, must continue until Captain Speicher's fate is fully \naccounted for.\n  Turning to the VA health care system, tens of thousands of veterans \nnow must wait six months and more for appointments. Some find they have \nto wait as long as one to two years to be seen.\n  This kind of delay and lack of access to healthcare is unacceptable \nand yet is all too common. It is also completely unnecessary. The \ndifficulties faced by our veterans are caused by chronic underfunding \nof the VA health system.\n  The VA system relies on the annual appropriations process, a process \nwhich is contentious and unpredictable and which makes it all too \ntempting to slash current year funding regardless of how this affects \nour veterans.\n  This year, for example, veterans organizations estimate that the VA \nhealth system needs $1.8 billion more than the President requested.\n  As a result, veterans advocates have once again found themselves \nplaying catch-up.\n  The solution is mandatory funding of VA health needs so that \nveteran's benefits are no longer subject to the politics of the annual \nappropriations process.\n  Without such a mechanism, the VA system will remain chronically \nunderfunded, and veterans needing care will continue to have to wait \ndisgracefully long periods of time.\n  I also wish to note that today I am introducing the Comprehensive \nHepatitis C Health Care Act, to provide increased testing and care for \nveterans at risk of or infection with hepatitis C.\n  Most veterans who have hepatitis C don't even know it, and often \ndon't get treatment until it's too late.\n  Yet despite recent advances in care, the VA still lacks a \ncomprehensive approach to testing and treating veterans for the virus.\n  The legislation I am introducing would improve access to hepatitis C \ntesting and treatment for all veterans, ensure that the VA spends all \nallocated hepatitis C funds on testing and treatment, and set new, \nnational policies for hepatitis C care.\n  I have also introduced and will continue to push for a measure to \nlower the retirement age for reservists to 55.\n  This measure is a way to ensure fairer treatment for reservists in \ntheir career planning and to make a reserve career more attractive to \nmilitary members who might otherwise opt out of further service.\n  We need to think about equity for reservists, and about the \nattractiveness of Reserve careers as our global strategy comes to rely \never more heavily on reservist citizen-soldiers.\n  We also owe our veterans full concurrent receipts.\n  There should be no conflict between a veteran's right to receive his \nor her retirement benefits and a disabled veteran's right to disability \nincome. And yet, incredibly enough, disabled veterans continue to pay \nwhat is, in effect, a tax on their disability payments. It is time--\nonce and for all--to eliminate this tax.\n  Ensuring that all veterans have access to quality healthcare is a \nsmall repayment for the contributions veterans have made in service to \nthis Nation.\n\n[[Page S14393]]\n\nUnfortunately, the current Veterans Administration healthcare funding \nformula--VERA--puts veterans in high-cost areas, such as New Jersey, at \na severe disadvantage in getting adequate medical care.\n  Vets shouldn't be forced to wait months for an appointment at a \nveterans medical clinic or to shoulder excessive fees because of a \nquirk in the formula that funds VA health care.\n  That is why I introduced legislation to make VA healthcare funding \nfairer by accounting for the distinct financial challenges confronting \nveterans and healthcare providers in different parts of the country.\n  This legislation, S. 1014, would replace the national income \nthreshold for classification as a low-income veteran--currently $24,000 \nfor all parts of the country--with regional thresholds defined by the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development.\n  This adjustment would help low-income veterans across the country \nafford quality health care and help ensure that Veterans Integrated \nService Networks, VISN's, receive adequate funding to care for their \ndistinct veteran populations.\n  In thinking about our veterans, we must also consider the brave men \nand women fighting for us now in Iraq and in Afghanistan and elsewhere.\n  As we honor their service, we must never forget what we owe them--now \nand when they return.\n  With so many Guard men and women and Reservists serving, it is \ncritical that we extend to them the benefits they deserve.\n  One benefit for which we have had to fight is the extension of \nTRICARE coverage to all reservists. We have succeeded in getting this \ncritical benefit for a year. We will, therefore, be revisiting this \nissue next year. I and like-minded colleagues remain advocates of \nextending such coverage to reservists.\n  As we asked our young citizens in the past, we are again today asking \nthem to do extraordinary things, and we need to see that they have the \nproper care and assistance when they come home. There is no excuse for \nfailing them.\n  We all remember that Veterans Day began as a commemoration of the \nArmistice which ended World War I, a catastrophic event which this body \ndescribed as ``the most destructive, sanguinary and far reaching war in \nhuman annals'' to that point.\n  We pause and remember, and we again commit ourselves to honor and to \nstand by the veterans of the Great War and of all America's wars, past \nand present.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I am proud to come to the floor \nof the Senate and join in solemn tribute to the millions of American \nmen and women who have protected our freedom over the long history of \nour Republic.\n  Every American knows it is part of our national character to pay \ntribute to the service of those who have worn the uniform of our Armed \nForces to defend our way of life.\n  As a nation, we have dedicated this day to reflect upon the service \nand sacrifice of the many generations of Americans who have delivered \nand preserved for us a nation free and strong.\n  This Veterans Day is even more solemn and thoughtful for all \nAmericans for we are a nation at war. Americans are fully aware that \nhundreds of thousands of their neighbors, son and daughters, husbands \nand wives, fathers and mothers are in harms way around the globe. \nAmericans are fully aware that over four hundred service members have \nlost and continue to risk their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan while \nover 2,400 more have been wounded or injured. All Americans share the \npain and sense of loss for those killed and those suffering from \nwounds. And Americans recognize and are ready for the many sacrifices \nthat lie ahead. We are a resolute people determined to defend our \nliberty and bring peace and justice to a dangerous world. This \ndetermination is evident throughout our Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, \nand Coast Guard.\n  I saw it myself when I visited soldiers of the Florida National \nGuard's 124th Infantry in Baghdad last summer. They are tough, well-\ntrained, devoted citizen soldiers demonstrating their professionalism \nevery day on the dangerous streets of a city that still quakes with \nwar. These great soldiers are worthy of their legacy; they are worthy \nof our admiration and gratitude.\n  We must be worthy of them and keep the Nation's promises to them-our \npromise to attend to their welfare and the welfare of their families.\n  As Abraham Lincoln instructed us, ours is an obligation to, ``to care \nfor him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and for his \norphan.'' Too often we fall short on this care. We must meet this \nobligation with the same sense of determination and honor as our \nveterans' service is always rendered.\n  We have underfunded our veterans health care system and the backlog \nof claims remains unacceptably high. This is not right.\n  We have partially eliminated the disabled veterans tax, or Concurrent \nReceipt, but only for one-third of those entitled to both their retired \npay and disability compensation. We have created among our retired \nveterans the ``haves'' and ``have-nots'' and this is simply not right. \nThey are all worthy and deserve to have what they have been promised \nnow without delay.\n  We have done nothing to improve our systems for caring for the \nsurvivors of veterans or retirees, especially those that were 100 \npercent disabled. The Department of Defense Survivor Benefits Plan \nremains uncorrected for offsets based on benefits from Social Security \nand Dependency and Indemnity Compensation--reductions in income in \namounts and at times that widows often can least afford.\n  We, the Congress, must keep trying to do the right thing by these our \ngreatest Americans.\n  The Nation continues to be truly blessed that our youth, our future \ngenerations, take inspiration from the devotion and sacrifice of those \nwho have answered the Nation's call to arms in the past and those who \ndefend us around a very dangerous world today.\n  Today we are reminded of where we have been as a nation, and upon \nwhose sacrifice we have become what we are.\n  Let us rededicate ourselves to freedom and justice and peace--and the \nsacrifice of those men and women whose service will deliver and \npreserve them for America and our friends around the world. For this we \nare a stronger people, a stronger nation, and a stronger community.\n  Let us pray for the safety of our men and women in uniform past and \npresent, and let us pray for the comfort of their loved ones.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, once again we find our young men and \nwomen in harm's way in a foreign land. As they have so many times in \nour history, Americans in uniform carry the torch of freedom in their \nhands and the promise of peace in their hearts as they face those who \nwould rule by tyranny and violence. On this Veterans Day, I rise not \nonly to commend our veterans but also to recognize the men and women of \nthe State of Maine engaged on the front lines in the Global War on \nTerrorism.\n  Maine is well represented by young men and women serving on active \nduty in our Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, and Coast Guard. Since \nSeptember 11, 2001, citizen-soldiers from across the State of Maine \nfrom all Reserve and Guard components have closed ranks with those on \nactive duty to protect our shores and secure our future.\n  The men and women from Maine have left homes, jobs, and loved ones to \nanswer the call to duty. Senior Master Sergeant Stephen Valley is among \nthem. Steve, who hails from Millinocket, ME, left the active Air Force \nin 1994 after nearly eighteen years of service. In 1998, he joined the \nAir Force Reserve, and despite family challenges, including a father \nsick with Parkinson's disease, stepped forward and mobilized in \nNovember of 2001. Steve served nearly continously in the Middle East \nsince then, including duty in Iraq and Afghanistan, until he retired \nfrom active service on November 1. He is a man of courage and \ncharacter. He represents the best we offer to a world longing for \nfreedom and peace.\n  Mainers are deployed around the globe. Nearly twenty-five percent of \nthe Maine Army National Guard is on alert, mobilized, or deployed. \nMaine National Guard soldiers are guarding prisoners at Guantanamo \nNaval Station in Cuba. Soldiers of Company E, 120th Aviation of Bangor \nare controlling air traffic in Afghanistan. Members of the 112th Air \nAmbulance Unit\n\n[[Page S14394]]\n\nfrom Bangor are performing medivac missions in Iraq. Soldiers of the \n11-36 Transportation Company from Bangor and Sanford are moving \nsupplies across Iraq and Kuwait. Soldiers from the 94th Military Police \nCompany of Maine and New Hampshire are performing police missions \nacross Iraq and are helping to train Iraqi forces to assume security \nresponsibilities.\n  This past summer, I went to Iraq. I met hundreds of American and \nBritish troops. I saw people from Maine performing key roles in \nrebuilding the country after the fall of Saddam Hussein's brutal \nregime. In the city of Kirkuk, I ate lunch with five service members \nfrom Maine--Specialist Gregory Norster of Phillips, Chief Warrant \nOfficer Brian Mucci of Shapleigh, Specialist Wayne Goodrich from \nOakland, Specialist Erin Maynard from Washburn, and Senior Airman Bill \nSpreng from Ellsworth. The contributions of Mainers to bring freedom to \nthe people of Iraq make me very proud.\n  The courage and commitment of the American and other coalition troops \nwere strikingly clear during my visit. By night, many of the soldiers \nconduct raids on pockets of resistance; by day, they renovate schools, \nrebuild roads and utilities, and help Iraqis take their first steps \ntoward democracy. Despite the continuing danger, the harsh living \nconditions, and the oppressive heat, morale among the soldiers and \nMarines I met was high. Army Sergeant Michael Levesque of Winslow put \nit best when he told me how proud he was to have ``helped to give the \nIraqi people a precious gift: their freedom.'' In Kirkuk, where I met \nMichael, morale was particularly high because the Iraqis there are so \ngrateful. Everywhere we went in this city south of the Kurdish section, \nlocal citizens waved and called out ``thank you, America!''\n  By contrast, conditions--both in July and today--remain hostile in \nand around Baghdad. Our troops face near daily ambushes and sniper \nattacks. The fighting goes on for many of our troops who must contend \nwith the threat of rocket-propelled grenades, improvised explosive \ndevices, and rogue gunmen.\n  Of all the places I have visited as a member of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, including Afghanistan, Bosnia, Kosovo, and Korea, \nnowhere have I found the challenges more difficult and the dangers more \npresent than in Iraq. In the end, the commitment of the Iraqi people \nwill determine whether Iraq will prosper in peace and freedom, or \nsuccumb to a violent minority bent on division, destruction, and \ndomination. The dedicated young men and women serving in uniform, from \nMaine and from all over America, are giving the Iraqi people the \nopportunity to seize what all humanity desires and deserves.\n\n  On this day set aside to honor sacrifice, we must also honor the \nsacrifices made by the spouses, parents, children and other loved ones \nof our troops. The families left behind must face the challenges of \ndaily living as they suffer from the separation and from the relentless \nworry. The news of any casualty strikes a chilling chord in their \nhearts. Every death, every injury, is a blow to them as they wait, and \nhope, and pray.\n  In September, I met with family members of the deployed soldiers of \nthe 94th Military Police company. These families have had to endure two \nextended deployments in three years: the 94th conducted a peacekeeping \nrotation to Bosnia that ended in 2001; in 2002, the 94th was called to \narms again and is performing admirably in Iraq. The soldiers of the \n94th are proud and professional and committed to getting the job done. \nTheir families bear the burden of absence and uncertainty. Among them \nwas Penny Mills, wife of Sergeant Curtis Mills of Shapleigh, ME.\n  Just one week later, soldiers of the 94th were ambushed in Iraq. Two \nwere severely wounded: Specialist Christopher Kotch of Brunswick and \nSergeant Curtis Mills. Soon after, I visited them at Walter Reed Army \nMedical Center. There was Penny, standing by her husband. We had no \nidea we would meet again--not so soon, not under those circumstances. \nSergeant Mills, with the support of his wife and family, is recovering \nwell. After reconstructive surgery and extensive physical therapy, he \nwill one day return to work as a letter carrier. Specialist Kotch, \nafter his recovery, will likely return to college and a life of \npossibility and promise.\n  In times of peace and in times of trial, we rely on our young men and \nwomen to step forward for our defense. The citizens of Maine have \nanswered the call. America's first casualty in the War on Terrorism was \nMaster SGT Evander Earl Andrews of Solon, ME, who lost his life in \nQatar on October 10, 2001. Today, in Litchfield, ME, a father grieves \nfor his daughter, Army Warrant Officer Sharon Swartworth, who \nmiraculously survived the attack on the Pentagon two years ago but who \ndid not survive an attack on a Black Hawk helicopter in Iraq last \nFriday. These are but two of the soldiers who died not just in the \nservice of their country, but also in the service of mankind. They did \nso on behalf of millions of people they did not know--innocent Iraqis, \nAfghans, and Americans who died on 9-11, and all peace-loving people \neverywhere.\n  Our service members and veterans--whether they served in World War I \nor II, Korea, Vietnam, Haiti, Kosovo, Bosnia, Kuwait, or now in \nAfghanistan or Iraq--share a common bond: their uniform is not that of \na conqueror, but of a liberator. We can never fully pay the debt we owe \nthose who put their lives on the line to advance the cause of freedom.\n  Nor can we repay the debt we owe those families and loved ones they \nleave behind. The enormity of that debt was best summed up one-hundred \nthirty-nine years ago in a President's letter to a mother who lost five \nsons in the war to preserve this Nation. I will close with the words of \nAbraham Lincoln:\n\n       I feel how weak and fruitless must be any words of mine \n     which should attempt to beguile you from the grief of a loss \n     so overwhelming. But I cannot refrain from tendering you the \n     consolation that may be found in the thanks of the Republic \n     they died to save.\n       I pray that our Heavenly Father may assuage the anguish of \n     your bereavement, and leave you only the cherished memory of \n     the loved and lost, and the solemn pride that must be yours \n     to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today, I had hoped to be in Sutton, \nWV to fully celebrate Veterans Day with West Virginia veterans and \ntheir families. Since the Senate is in session, I must be in \nWashington, but I do want to recognize some of our Nation's finest men \nand women who have served to protect that which we hold most dear, our \nvery freedom.\n  Last weekend, I was in West Virginia and I had the chance to talk \nwith Army Sergeant Jared Welker of Putnam County. Sergeant Welker is a \ntank gunner who saw considerable action in Iraq, and who has just \nrecently returned home. I had the privilege to spend a few hours with \nthis young soldier. Hearing about the war in Iraq from his point of \nview, a young man serving in a tank division entering Baghdad, made me \nvery proud of the men and women serving in the military--where ever \nthey are stationed. Sergeant Welker's description of his days in Iraq \nwill stay with me. His courage and his commitment to duty are truly \ninspiring.\n  And it is also a sobering reminder of the obligations that we in \nCongress have to fully support our troops in the field, and at home, \nand as veterans later in their lives.\n  On Veterans Day, we should take time to pay our respect to those who \nput their lives on the line and sacrificed in our defense. We have a \nduty to honor all veterans in both word and deed.\n  We honor them by remembering their courage, their loyalty, and their \nlove of country. My State has one of the strongest traditions of \nmilitary service, and I could not be more proud of that. When the call \nhas come to defend this Nation, West Virginians have answered in great \nnumbers. In a State as patriotic as our Mountain State, reminders of \nour veterans, heroes and heroines, are everywhere. They stand as a \nreminder of the battles fought defending the principles of democracy.\n  Understanding the sense of patriotism of the people of West Virginia \nis what caused me to seek a seat on the Senate Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs the day I arrived in the Senate 19 years ago. Joining the \ncommittee was one of the best decisions I ever made.\n  These last few weeks in Congress have been extremely important ones \nfor our Nation=s veterans. One of the most important issues of concern \ntoday\n\n[[Page S14395]]\n\nis the President's budget request for the Department of Veterans \nAffairs for fiscal year 2004. Everything provided by VA will be a \ndirect result of the proposed budget now before Congress. Regrettably, \nthe President's budget request for VA health care for fiscal year 2004 \nwill barely cover the cost of inflation at our VA Medical Centers, but \nthere is still time to fix those misplaced priorities.\n  Full funding is needed for a health care system that is besieged with \nresponsibilities. I am fighting, along with a number of my Senate \ncolleagues, to get an additional $1.8 billion appropriated for VA \nhealth care before Congress recesses this year.\n  In addition to our veterans who depend upon VA for their health care \nand prescription drugs today, current law allows members of the \nmilitary, who serve during an armed conflict, to use VA upon their \nreturn. This includes currently deployed Reservists and National \nGuardsmen, who are such a big part of West Virginia's contribution to \nour war effort. The system must be adequately funded for all these \nveterans.\n  Another critical issue of concern continues to be long-term care for \nveterans. As our veteran population grows older, VA must make sure that \nit can meet the need for long-term care. A bill I introduced earlier \nthis year extending, for five years, the congressional mandate \nrequiring VA to provide long-term care for veterans through both \nnursing homes and community-based options still has potential to be \nenacted this year. This is extremely important legislation, and I will \ncontinue to push until this become law. If I cannot convince my \ncolleagues to act this year, I will be right back next year fighting \nfor it until it is done.\n  I was thrilled to be in Clarksburg last month for the ground breaking \nof our new State veterans' home, which will be built adjacent to the \nClarksburg VA Medical Center. I have worked closely with both State and \nFederal officials on this project over the last several years, and I am \nvery proud of everyone who has been involved in making this much needed \nnursing home a reality. It is time that West Virginia had a State \nveterans' nursing home.\n  In closing, I would like to read a paragraph from a letter found in \nthe gear of a 20-year-old boy from Beckley serving during World War II. \nI think it is appropriate on this Veterans Day.\n  Private First Class Walter Walker was killed in battle in 1944 and he \nhad written a letter to be delivered to his parents in case of his \ndeath.\n  He wrote:\n\n       Frankly I think I will come back, but you never can tell \n     what little accident will happen. I am doing this for my \n     country and people I love. So that little children may grow \n     up to be free and not have to take orders from devils like \n     Hitler and Tojo. I will gladly give my life to keep you and \n     dad free as long as you may live.\n\n  Private Walker was a hero of WWII.\n  Sergeant Welker, and the more than 100,000 brave men and women \nserving today, are the heroes of Iraq.\n  Today, we honor all our young men and women who have paid the \nultimate sacrifice for freedom, and all those who have served in our \nmilitary. We need to remember to stand proud when we see the American \nflag waving high in the air, and nod our heads in respect when we pass \nby a veterans' cemetery. We need to remember that behind each of these \nsymbols of America are the people who have made them so remarkable--our \nNation's veterans.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to honor this day and the men and \nwomen for whom it was established. On the eleventh hour of the eleventh \nday of the eleventh month of 1918, the armistice was signed ending the \nfirst modern global conflict.\n  World War I was an exceptionally bloody conflict that required \ntremendous sacrifices. It was therefore appropriate for President \nWilson to establish Armistice Day as a time to recognize those who \nserved in that war.\n  Unfortunately, the hope for a new, more peaceful world after the \nGreat War was shattered as we found ourselves embroiled in a life or \ndeath struggle against tyranny. Americans again rose to the challenge. \nOver 405,000 American soldiers lost their lives and over 671,000 were \nwounded. That's over three times the casualties of World War I. Still, \nthe bravery and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform showed the \nworld the extent to which the United States of America was prepared to \ngo to preserve liberty.\n  Then, after our soldiers and sailors were called upon again to fight \naggression in Korea, it became evident that it was necessary to set \naside a day to recognize all American veterans. To encourage Americans \nto pay respects to all those who have served in America's Armed Forces, \nPresident Eisenhower signed into law a proclamation in 1954 changing \nthe name of the November 11 holiday to Veterans Day.\n  Today, we thank all those who have risked life and limb in service to \ntheir country, including those who served in Vietnam and the Persian \nGulf war, as well as Somalia, Bosnia, Kosovo, and other smaller \nconflicts. It is particularly appropriate today to pay tribute to the \nnew generation of veterans who are serving their country so bravely in \nthe global war on terrorism.\n  Americans have never hesitated to answer the call of duty and this \ngeneration is no exception. America continues to owe an immeasurable \ndebt of gratitude to the brave men and women who respond to the call of \nduty. Following in the footsteps of those who served in the 20th \ncentury, our men and women in uniform are living up to a heritage of \nservice, loyalty, honor, sacrifice, and patriotism passed down for \ngenerations.\n  Members of the active duty military, National Guard, and Reserves \nselflessly put their country first. They serve to protect the American \npeople, defend national security, preserve freedom and safeguard our \nway of life.\n  This Veterans Day, let's remember the patriots who are putting their \nlives on hold while they put their lives on the line. Their sacrifices \nguarantee America's promise for generations to come. Hundreds of \nthousands of Americans have paid the ultimate sacrifice while serving \nin the Armed Forces. Their irreplaceable loss of life reminds us that \nfreedom isn't free.\n  It is important for younger generations to appreciate the service and \nsacrifice made by those serving their country. Awareness and \nappreciation for veterans has decreased in recent times as fewer \nindividuals and families in America have a personal connection with the \nArmed Forces.\n  Now that family members, friends, neighbors, and other fellow \ncitizens are again putting themselves in harm's way in service to their \ncountry, I hope all Americans will take the opportunity this Veterans \nDay to remember and honor all veterans, to whom we owe our freedom.\n  Today I salute the patriotism, courage, and sacrifice of all American \nveterans who have answered their country's call in times of need.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as I was watching the sunrise this morning, \nI thought of the men and women currently serving in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, and our Nation's veterans of past wars.\n  Today, we must remember those who have sacrificed to defend the \nfreedoms and ideals all Americans enjoy. In our thoughts are not just \nthe proud Americans who are fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan today, nor \njust the members of the ``Greatest Generation'' who fought in World War \nII. We think about those who lost their lives or served in the extended \nCold War, the Korean War, Vietnam or who gave their lives in some of \nthe less-known engagements across the globe aimed at preserving our \ncountry and preserving basic human rights throughout the world.\n  Of course, most in our minds right now are 130,000 men and women \nserving in Iraq. Over 30,000 of these troops are reservists who left \ntheir civilian jobs and families to serve in Iraq with pride and \ndetermination. Whether Active-Duty soldiers or Reserves, every single \nperson in the military is there because they want to be there, and we \nowe them a special kind of gratitude for their service.\n  Today we should not just think about our veterans, but also address \npolicies that will directly address their needs, whether they are still \nin the service or after they have returned. We must come together as a \nSenate to ensure that we honor that unspoken social contract with our \nactive troops, guaranteeing superb quality-of-life programs exist for \nour active service members and their families and that they will never \nbecome forgotten soldiers of history.\n\n[[Page S14396]]\n\n  Let's come behind our citizen soldiers of the Guard and Reserve to \nensure they and their families are as healthy as possible. And, above \nall, let's make sure our veterans have a flourishing medical program to \nensure they receive the high-quality care they deserve.\n  On this time-honored day, we express our gratitude to our veterans, \nwe remember their courage and dedication, and we act to make up a small \npart of the large debt we owe them.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I wish to pay my respects to my \nfellow veterans. It is only through the leadership, dedication and \nsacrifice of our men and women in uniform, that we are able to enjoy \nthe freedoms that being an American entails.\n  No matter what your views on the war on terror or the war in Iraq, \nall Americans can unite behind our brave men and women in uniform. \nThese fine Americans have truly answered our Nation's highest calling \nand we are better off for it. Today is a day to give thanks to these \nheroes.\n  On Veterans Day, I like to share the story of one of my heroes during \nmy service, Mike Christian. I have shared his story before and it has \nbecome familiar to many, yet it bears repeating. This year, as \nAmericans serve across the globe in important battles against error and \ntyranny, Mike Christian's story takes on even more meaning. In the same \nmanner as service in Vietnam, a new generation of heroes is emerging in \nIraq.\n  In the early years of our imprisonment in Hanoi, the North Vietnamese \nkept us in solitary confinement, or if we were fortunate, two or three \nto a cell. In 1971, the North Vietnamese moved us from these conditions \nof isolation into large cells with as many as 30 to 40 men to a room. \nThis was, as you can imagine, a wonderful chance. And was a direct \nresult of the efforts of millions of Americans, led by people like \nNancy and Ronald Reagan, on behalf of a few hundreds POWs, 20,000 miles \nfrom home.\n  One of the men who moved into my cell was Mike Christian. Mike came \nfrom a small town near Selma, AL. He didn't wear a pair of shoes until \nhe was 13 years old. At 17, he enlisted in the U.S. Navy. He later \nearned a commission. He became a naval aviator, was shot down and \ncaptured in 1967. Mike had a keen and deep appreciation for the \nopportunities this county--and our military--provide for people who \nwant to work and want to succeed.\n  The uniforms we wore in prison consisted of a blue short-sleeved \nshirt, trousers that looked like pajama trousers and rubber sandals \nthat were made out of automobile tires. I recommend them highly; one \npair lasted my entire stay.\n  As part of the change in treatment, the Vietnamese allowed some \nprisoners to receive packages from home. In some of these packages were \nhandkerchiefs, scarves, and other items of clothing. Mike got himself a \npiece of white cloth and a piece of red cloth and fashioned himself a \nbamboo needle. Over a period of a couple, of months, he sewed the \nAmerican flag on the inside of his shirt.\n  Every afternoon, before we had a bowl of soup, we would hang Mike's \nshirt on the wall or our cell, and say the Pledge of Allegiance. I know \nthat saying the Pledge of Allegiance may not seem the most important or \nmeaningful part of our day now, but I can assure you that--for those \nmen in the stark prison cell--it was indeed the most important and \nmeaningful event of our day.\n  Our day, the Vietnamese searched our cell and discovered Mike's shirt \nwith the flag sewn inside, and removed it. That evening they returned, \nopened the door of the cell, called for Mike Christian to come out, \nclosed the door of the cell, and for the benefit of all of us, beat \nMike Christian severely for the next couple of hours.\n  Then they opened the door of the cell and threw him back inside. He \nwas not in good shape. We tried to comfort and take care of him as well \nas we could. The cell in which we lived had a concrete slab in the \nmiddle on which we slept. Four naked light bulbs in each corner of the \nroom.\n  After things quieted down, I went to lie down to go to sleep. As I \ndid, I happened to look in the corner of the room. Sitting there \nbeneath that dim light bulb, with a piece of white cloth, a piece of \nred cloth, another shirt and his bamboo needle, was my friend, Mike \nChristian. Sitting there, with his eyes almost shut from his beating, \nmaking another American Flag. He was not making the flag because it \nmade Mike Christian feel better. He was making the flag because he knew \nhow important it was for us to be able to pledge our allegiance to our \nflag and country.\n  Duty, Honor, Country. We must never forget the millions of Americans \nwho, with their courage, with their sacrifice, and with their lives, \nmade those words live for all of us.\n  This year, as we pause to remember those men and women currently \nserving their country, as well as our family and friends who serve \nbefore us, we need to remember the sacrifices of people like Mike \nChristian who made this Nation what it is today.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, America today has the most powerful, most \ncapable and best-equipped military in the history of the world. But \nnone of this would be possible without the brave men and women who \nvolunteer to serve in the Armed Forces, who accept any challenge and \nface any danger to protect their country on battlefields around the \nworld. Each of them is a volunteer--no conscription, no draft. They \nhave a genuine desire to serve, and they do so with great sacrifice \nwith great honor, great courage, great commitment, and often with great \nsacrifice.\n  Time and again, our Nation has called its sons and daughters to put \nthemselves in harm's way, and many bear the scars of battle forever. \nDespite the rhetoric of praise that we hear again and again, too often \nwhen their service ends, these veterans are forgotten, except on \nVeterans Day. We have consistently underfunded the veterans' health \ncare system. The Veterans' Administration is now preparing plans to \nclose veterans' hospitals in New England and across the Nation. They \noppose allowing disabled veterans to receive disability benefits if \nthey also receive military retirement compensation.\n  As troops continue to serve in Iraq, we need to make sure we can take \ncare of them and their families, especially when they return home. We \nhave a solemn responsibility to those who are willing to sacrifice so \nmuch. We do them a grave injustice when they return home to be cast \naside. Today, tens of thousands of newly discharged veterans are \nunemployed. National Guard and Reserve soldiers face lower wages and \npossible job loss while they are deployed. The Uniformed Services \nEmployment and Reemployment Rights Act, USERRA, protects soldiers from \nemployment discrimination, but service members can have difficulty \nenforcing their rights.\n  We can't have any more situations like the one at Fort Stewart, where \nGuard and Reserve troops were housed in deplorable accommodations, with \nunacceptable access to health care and needed services to heal their \ninjuries. Such neglect is no way for a grateful Nation to honor its \narmed services. We can and we must do better.\n  For generations, we have honored our fallen veterans on November 11 \neach year. The Armistice Agreement that ended the First World War was \nsigned on this historic day in 1918--the eleventh hour of the eleventh \nday of the eleventh month that year. Many of those we honor today have \nfallen in battle in Iraq.\n  Last week, I attended the funeral service of a Massachusetts soldier \nwho gave his life in combat there and was laid to rest in Arlington \nNational Cemetery. It was a beautiful fall day and the military \nceremony was conducted with solemn dignity and utmost reverence. It was \na very moving moment to be there with his family and friends and \nveterans of his unit. His parents have lost a son, and the Nation has \nlost a hero. As the bugler played taps, and the sounds of the rifle \nvolleys from a final salute faded across the Arlington hills, it was \nmoving to see that the veterans there had also lost a brother, although \nnone of them knew the fallen soldier personally. The brave paratrooper \nwho had tried to carry his dying comrade to safety during the attack \nwas also there. His silent presence spoke volumes about the valor and \ndedication that our service members give to our Nation every day, and \nhave given us throughout our history ever\n\n[[Page S14397]]\n\nsince that day at Concord Bridge, when the embattled farmers stood and \nfired the shot heard 'round the world.\n  On Veterans Day 2003, we thank our veterans. We remember those who \nhave given the last full measure of devotion to our country, and we \naffirm our support for all who now wear the uniforms of our armed \nforces. We give thanks to all who have served America so well in years \ngone by, and to all the brave men and women serving now in the ongoing \nwar against terrorism. And we pledge, in words that too often pass and \nare soon forgotten, to do a better job of meeting our responsibility to \nthem every day, not just on each November 11. May God give us the \nstrength to make each day a Veterans Day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add five \nadditional minutes on each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, on this Veterans Day, I want to share a \nfew ideas about the meaning this day holds for my family and for \nthousands of families throughout Washington State.\n  Today is a day to honor the sacrifices that generations of Americans \nhave made to defend our country and to support freedom throughout the \nworld. It is a day to reflect on the courage and bravery of our \nsoldiers. And it is made even more special as we think of all our \nmilitary personnel who are deployed in Iraq, Afghanistan and other \nhostile environments. But it is much more than that.\n  It is a day to make sure that we are living up to the promise we make \nto all veterans--a promise that President Lincoln described as:\n\n     . . . to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and \n     for his widow and his orphan.\n\n  Today throughout Washington State, people are coming together to \nhonor our veterans at places such as the Tahoma National Cemetery, the \nWashington Veterans Home, and in communities large and small. \nWashington State is home to almost 700,000 veterans, and every day I am \nhonored to represent them in the United States Senate.\n  Growing up, I saw firsthand the many ways that military service can \naffect both veterans and their families.\n  My father served in World War II. He was among the first soldiers to \nland on Okinawa. He came home as a disabled veteran and was awarded the \nPurple Heart. I should note that, like many soldiers of his generation, \nmy father did not talk about his experiences during the war. In fact, \nwe only really learned about them by reading his journals after he \npassed away.\n  And I think that experience offers a larger lesson about veterans in \ngeneral. They are reluctant to call attention to their service, and \nthey are reluctant to ask for help. That's why we have to publicly \nrecognize their sacrifices and contributions. It is up to use to make \nsure that they get the recognition they have earned--and not just on \nVeterans Day. It is one of the reasons why a few years ago I worked to \nensure that all veterans could get the military funeral honors. My \nfather had them, and they meant a great deal to our family.\n  I was proud to introduce legislation and to work with the VA and \nveterans service organizations to ensure that any family that requests \nmilitary funeral honors can get them.\n  In addition to my own family experiences, when I was a senior in \ncollege at Washington State University, I spent a semester interning at \nthe Seattle Veterans Hospital, helping to treat young soldiers \nreturning from Vietnam. They were my age at the time. I will never \nforget the sound of the door locking behind me after walking on to the \nhospital's psychiatric ward to spend the day with these heroes. While \nthese combat veterans were my age, they had endured experiences most of \nus could never imagine.\n  Today, as I see an administration that is considering closing \nveterans hospitals in Washington State--even as today's veterans have \nto wait 6 months just to see a doctor, and as the war in Iraq adds to \nthe number of veterans who will need medical care--I get upset, and I \nfight with everything I have. Our veterans have already fought for our \ncountry, they should not have to fight to get the healthcare or \nbenefits they were promised, so we've got to fight on their behalf.\n  Today we must ask, Are we keeping our promise to America's veterans? \nHere are some facts to help us answer that question.\n  Fact: Right now, 80,000 veterans are waiting 6 months or longer for \nan appointment at VA hospitals.\n  Fact: For the past 2 years, an average of 14,000 veterans have been \nwaiting more than 15 months for their ``expedited'' disability claims \nto be finalized.\n  Fact: Veterans could face new fees and higher co-payments--just to \nget the healthcare they are already entitled to.\n  Fact: Each year in Congress there is a debate over how much money we \nshould spend on veterans' healthcare. Too often, our veterans lose out \nto other budget priorities.\n  Fact: Disabled veterans pay a high penalty through what is called the \n``Disabled Veterans Tax.'' They must give up a dollar of their pension \nfor every dollar of disability pay they receive.\n  Fact: The VA is looking to ``reconfigure'' veterans' health care and \nis now studying the closure of two VA facilities in Washington State.\n  And finally, the war in Iraq--and the tremendous toll it is taking on \nour soliders--is increasing the number of veterans who will need \nmedical care for years down the road.\n  Those are all facts. To me, they show that we are coming up short in \nkeeping our promise to America's veterans. So what can we do about it?\n  Simply put, we need to make veterans services a priority once again. \nNo. 1, to cut down on the long waits that veterans endure; to help \nexpedite claims; and to avoid higher fees and co-payments. We need to \nincrease funding for veterans services.\n  To end the annual appropriations game, we should make VA healthcare \nfunding mandatory. That is why I support the Veterans' Health Care \nFunding Guarantee Act. It would make veterans' healthcare an automatic \npriority for our Nation.\n  The VFW, AMVETS, the Disabled American Veterans and many other \nveterans groups strongly support this bill.\n  We must also make sure that the Department of Veterans Affairs does \nnot close critical medical facilities at a time when more are seeking \nVA healthcare.\n  In addition, we must end the disabled veterans tax and ensure that \nveterans are not penalized just because they receive disability pay.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of a plan that would authorize full \npayment of both retirement pay and disability compensation to half a \nmillion disabled military retirees. And unlike other proposals, our \nplan would take effect immediately, instead of over 10 years.\n  And finally, we have to do right by today's veterans and by \ntomorrow's veterans. The brave men and women who are serving in Iraq \nand Afghanistan today will need our help when they return home. How we \ntreat them will send a signal to a generation of young people who may \nbe considering military service.\n  We have to keep our promise today and tomorrow.\n  So while we are currently coming up short, I am going to keep pushing \nfor the solutions that will truly serve our veterans. America's \nveterans have earned our respect, and they have earned the benefits \nthey were promised when they signed up. They should not have to fight \nfor the care and support they were promised.\n  On this day--and every day that I am given the honor of representing \nthem--I will stand up and fight for Washington's veterans and the \nfreedom and security they have given us through their sacrifices in war \nand peace.\n  I hope we keep our promise.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, how much time remains on the Democratic \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Sixteen minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of Veterans Day, our\n\n[[Page S14398]]\n\nnational day of remembrance established to solemnly honor the \nsacrifices of American men and women who have served in military \nactions in behalf of our country.\n  We recognize these men and women for preserving our liberty, freedoms \nand democratic way of life. For me, as a first-year Senator \nrepresenting the men and women of Arkansas, this is an especially \nnoteworthy Veterans Day. Since September 11th, numerous Arkansans have \nengaged in our battle against terrorism, serving in Afghanistan and \nother points abroad. This fall, over 3,000 men and women of Arkansas, \nmembers of our 39th Infantry Brigade of the Arkansas National Guard, \nare preparing to travel to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  Every day my prayers include the brave men and women of Arkansas who \nserve, and have served, in our armed forces. I pray that every single \none of our brave Americans in uniform will return safely home to the \nloving arms of their families.\n  Sadly, many of our veterans have not returned safely home. Many of \nour veterans have paid the ultimate price, sacrificing their lives on \nthe altar of freedom. We must never forget their sacrifices. We must \nnever forget the cost of freedom paid by our veterans.\n  As he gazed on the battlefield at Gettysburg in 1863, Abraham Lincoln \nuttered, ``The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have \nconsecrated it, above our poor power to add or detract. The world will \nlittle note, nor long remember, what we say here, but it can never \nforget what they did here.''\n  I am in a similar situation today, unable to articulate anything \nwhich even comes close to capturing the debt of gratitude each and \nevery one of us owes our veterans. No words can capture my gratitude, \nor the gratitude of Arkansas, towards our veterans.\n  Yet, as I mentioned, Veterans Day is a day of remembrance. This is a \nday to honor and remember those who have served in our armed service. \nLast week, I had the distinct pleasure and unique opportunity to talk \nwith Johnie ``Chick'' Matthews. Chick, at 102 years old, is Arkansas's \noldest living veteran.\n  Mr. Johnie ``Chick'' Matthews, a resident of Greenbrier, Arkansas, \nfirst answered the call to duty to serve this country in 1917. That was \n86 years ago.\n  He was given the nickname Chick because he enlisted into the United \nStates Army when he was only 16 years old. He was the youngest at his \ntraining facility at Camp Pike, AR.\n  His mother was a widow with mouths to feed and he realized that he \nneeded to help shoulder the financial responsibilities of caring for \nhis mother and brothers.\n  He went to Little Rock to enlist in the Army. He lied about his age. \nThe recruiter said: We are not sure we believe you, so go home and get \nyour mother to sign this document. When he went back home, he was \nscared to take it to his mother because he was afraid she would not \nsign the age waiver so he went to a neighbor woman and said: Mother \nhurt her hand and she cannot sign this. Can you sign this on her \nbehalf? She did, and he was enlisted in the U.S. Army.\n  At the age of 16, he was the youngest soldier in his unit, probably \none of the youngest in the Army. But when it was all said and done, as \nhe ended his military career, Chick had completed 46 years of military \nservice spanning World War I through Vietnam. That is truly remarkable. \nIn addition, he served in four branches--the Army, Navy, Coast Guard, \nand the Merchant Marine.\n  When I talked to Chick, I was entertained and captivated by his \nstories, but most of all I was impressed by his sense of duty. In fact, \nwhen I asked him if he would recommend military service to others, he \nsaid: If they would let me in, I would be there tomorrow morning to \nsign up.\n  In addition to Chick Matthews, I recognize another veteran who is a \nbit younger, but no less committed, to his country and to the State of \nArkansas. Randy Massanelli is a native Arkansan who dutifully served in \nthe U.S. Army for 15 years. While in the Army, he rose to the rank of \nmajor and served in Desert Storm where he was awarded the Bronze Star. \nNow he serves as my State director in Little Rock. I am grateful for \nthe knowledge, experience, and perspective he brings to the office as I \nwork to do what is best, not just for veterans and the troops around \nthe country and around the world, but also for the people of Arkansas.\n  I have known Randy since we were both at the University of Arkansas \nas undergraduates. I thank him today. He has shown me time and time \nagain what true devotion to his country really is. I am lucky to have \nhim on my team and I am proud to call him a friend. I honor him today \nas a great veteran.\n  Last, I want to recognize another veteran on my staff, Wayne Palmer, \nwho also served in Desert Storm. Wayne is a tremendous asset to my \noffice. I thank him for his service to our country.\n  Arkansans throughout the years have followed Chick's, Wayne's, and \nRandy's lead. I am proud to boast about my State's tradition of \nmilitary service. As veterans continue to risk life and limb for us, I \nwill work as hard as I can to make sure they are taken care of before, \nduring, and after their mission is completed.\n  In the coming days, we will vote on the Defense authorization \nconference report. As a conferee, I was proud to work on this \nlegislation, which includes a 3.7 percent across-the-board military pay \nincrease, expands TRICARE coverage for the Guard and Reserve personnel \nand their families, and provides benefits and programs to improve the \noverall quality of the pay for our service men and women.\n  This legislation also authorizes disabled military retirees to \ncollect their retirement pay and disability compensation, otherwise \nknown as concurrent receipt. This measure would benefit millions of \nAmericans who have served our country for years but have been \nprohibited from receiving both retirement compensation and VA \ndisability benefits.\n  Correcting this inequity for our veterans is long overdue--in fact, \n110 years overdue. I made a promise to take care of our service men and \nwomen who put their lives on the line for our country. This provision \nindicates Congress's intention to finally honor its word.\n  I am also looking forward to debating the VA/HUD appropriations bill \nwhere I have an understanding we will be looking to add $1.3 billion to \nveterans health care. We cannot discount the importance of this \nfunding, especially as more veterans come home from Afghanistan and \nIraq and the global world on terrorism. We must ensure that the \nVeterans' Administration has the resources it needs to look after those \nmen and women who look after us.\n  Mostly, this Veterans Day fills me with a sense of security and pride \nbecause of my faith in the ability and skills of our men and women in \nuniform. This faith nourishes my hope for a peaceful future for my \nchildren and the children of Arkansas.\n\n  I know our men and women in uniform are the most capable fighting \nforce on Earth. I know these individuals will willingly endure personal \nsacrifice and danger to defend our democratic values, just as our \nveterans of yesteryear endured personal sacrifice and danger to provide \nus the freedom and democracy we enjoy today. I know our Armed Forces \nwill be victorious in their mission.\n  On this Veterans Day, I extend my gratitude and the gratitude of \nevery Arkansan to our veterans and their families.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask what the allocation of time is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 7 minutes 54 seconds on the \nDemocratic side and 5 minutes on the Republican side.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, let me ask the Democratic Senator in \nthe Chamber if that is enough time for them to finish. We need to be \nthrough at 12:15.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for \nmaking the inquiry. The fact is I need about 10 minutes and the Senator \nfrom North Dakota needs 5 minutes. If that could be accommodated on an \nequal exchange basis, I suggest we ask unanimous consent to do so.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. How much more would that extend the time on the other \nside? How much more time would\n\n[[Page S14399]]\n\nthat give us if we equally divided that, our 5 minutes plus the extra?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That would be an extra 8 minutes on the \nDemocratic side and a total of 28 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if this is a unanimous consent request \nfor more time, I would like to accommodate my colleagues. I have come \nto the floor with the expectation to speak at noon, which it is now, on \nthe Syria Accountability Act, and actually I had some time on veterans \nas well. I have other commitments, such as, to go to the White House \nfor the bill signing ceremony with the President.\n  So I am glad to accommodate my colleagues, but if it is going to run \nfor 28 more minutes, that is going to preclude my speaking on the Syria \nAccountability Act.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I do not think we need 28 minutes. I \nwas going to ask for 5 minutes for the Senator from Alabama, which we \nhave left on our side. I think if you wanted----\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Fifteen.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Fifteen?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Right. I appreciate the fact the Senator from \nPennsylvania has other obligations, but this is Veterans Day. I want to \ntalk about veterans. I think we have that particular obligation since \nwe are here today and we are not in our home States, able to visit \nveterans, visit cemeteries, and talk to people about veterans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, reserving----\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, if I could ask a unanimous consent \nrequest and see if this is what people want: that there be 15 minutes \ndivided on the Democratic side as they wish and 5 minutes to the \nSenator from Alabama, for a total of 20 minutes from now. Is that an \nacceptable unanimous consent request to all on the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask that I be reminded at the 9-\nminute mark, if I have gotten that far, please, that I have 1 minute \nremaining.\n  I was in Newark yesterday, at our cathedral there, attending the \nfuneral of SGT Joel Perez. Sergeant Perez had been deployed to Iraq as \npart of the Army's 2nd Battalion, 5th Field Artillery Regiment. He died \non November 2 when the Chinook helicopter he was in was shot down. An \narticle appeared in the New York Times on Sunday, and it listed the 16 \nsoldiers, including Sergeant Perez, the 16 young people who perished on \nbehalf of our country, our interests, our liberty.\n  The names of those who died along with Joel Perez when that Chinook \nhelicopter was shot down are: Daniel A. Bader, Ernest G. Bucklew, \nSteven D. Conover, Anthony D. D'Agostino, Paul F. Fisher, Darius T. \nJennings, Karina S. Lau, Keelan L. Moss, Brian H. Penisten, Ross A. \nPennanen, Brian D. Slavenas, Bruce A. Smith, Frances M. Vega, Paul \nAnthony Velazquez, and Joe N. Wilson.\n  We salute their bravery and their courage and their sacrifice.\n  Sergeant Perez was on that helicopter because he had been granted \nleave to come home to celebrate his third wedding anniversary. And now \nhe has come home, in a flag-draped casket. Yesterday was his third \nanniversary and his funeral. He was 25 years old. He leaves behind his \nwife Milagros, an infant daughter Jaileen, his mother Luisa and father \nEdwin, and three brothers, Elvin, Michael, and Leo.\n  As I said at the funeral yesterday, it is a sobering moment when you \nsee the reality of a life that has passed so quickly. All you have to \ndo is look at the date of his birth--1978--and the date of his death--\n2003--they are much too close together.\n  Sergeant Perez is the ninth New Jersey resident killed in Iraq. The \nother eight are: Army SP Simeon Hunte, who was 23 years old, of Newark; \nArmy 2LT Richard Torres, who was 25 years old, of Passaic; Army SFC \nGladimir Philippe, who was 37 years old, of Roselle; Army SP Kyle A. \nGriffin, who was 20, of Emerson; Army SP Narson B. Sullivan, who was \n21, of North Brunswick; Army SP Gil Mercado, who was 25, of Paterson, \nmy home town; Army SSG Terry W. Hemingway, who was 39, of Willingboro; \nand Army SP Michael Edward Curtin, who was 23, of Howell.\n  I feel a special kinship to these young people because they were from \nmy State. I also feel a special kinship because I am a veteran. I \nenlisted when I was 18 years old, right out of high school. I served in \nEurope during World War II.\n  Today is Veterans Day. It has been nearly 50 years since President \nEisenhower signed a bill into law making November 11 Veterans Day.\n  The history of Veterans Day goes back even further, to 1918, when an \narmistice between the Allied and Central Powers brought World War I to \nan end at the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month.\n  On November 11, 1920, the British interred an unidentified British \nsoldier in Westminster Abbey to commemorate the Armistice. The French \ninterred an unidentified French soldier under the Arc de Triomphe in \nParis.\n  In 1921, an American soldier's remains were disinterred in France and \nsent on the transatlantic voyage to Washington, D.C., where they lay in \nstate in the Capitol Rotunda for three days. Then, at 11:00 a.m. on \nNovember 11, the remains of this Unknown Soldier were buried at \nArlington National Cemetery beneath a marble block which reads, ``Here \nrests in honored glory an American soldier known but to God.''\n  Since the founding of our country, nearly 50 million men and women \nhave answered the call of duty. There are about 25 million veterans \nalive today.\n  Right now, we have 130,000 troops in Iraq, another 10,000 in Kuwait, \nand 10,000 in Afghanistan. Other Americans are serving in South Korea, \nin Bosnia and Kosovo, and in every other corner of the globe.\n  We owe our veterans and the brave young men and women who currently \nserve in our military more than we can calculate. It is very tough \nduty. I know that from personal experience. That is why I deeply regret \nthat the Senate is in session today. I do not ever recall the Senate \nbeing in session on Veterans Day before. Frankly, I think it is \ndisrespectful to veterans across America and to the veterans in this \nbody for the Senate to be in session today.\n  Why are we doing it? Why are we here? Well, we are told that we have \na full agenda and that we have very few days left to get our work \ndone--work that was supposed to be done six weeks ago. But how are we \ngoing to spend the precious few days before we hope to adjourn? We are \ngoing to take 30 hours of that time to debate a handful of highly \ncontroversial judges whose nominations Democrats object to.\n  I feel compelled to put this chart up on the floor for everyone to \nsee because it is kind of a scorecard that shows the Clinton years and \nhow many nominees were confirmed in those years and the dozens of \nnominees who were blocked by the Republicans. Then we can see how many \nof President Bush's nominees have been confirmed and how many have been \nblocked by Democrats.\n  Democrats are objecting to a total of four nominees who have neither \nthe experience nor the temperament to be confirmed to lifetime \npositions in the federal judiciary. Four nominees have been blocked, 2 \npercent of the total. And we are being told that we cannot afford the \ntime today to be at home with our veterans or go to the cemeteries or \ngo to the veterans hospitals so that we can pay our respects to those \nwho have served or are serving this country. We cannot be with our \nveterans today because we have to spend 30 hours starting tomorrow to \ntalk about four nominees.\n  So, in all candor, I have to say that I am upset by our being here. \nIt is not the question of another day's work--we can do the work--but \nthat the majority could not find time to permit Senators to be in their \nStates with their constituents, especially veterans, with the families \nwho have lost loved ones in Iraq or Afghanistan or Beirut or Vietnam or \nKorea or so many other places.\n  When I look at the reason why we are here today, it rings hollow, as \nfar as I am concerned. I regret that we are here. This is the day we \nshould meet with veterans groups. This is the day when we remember the \nsacrifice that so many have made on our behalf. This is the day we \nought to be thinking about how we respond to our need for\n\n[[Page S14400]]\n\nadditional troops in Iraq. This is the day we ought to think about what \nit is our brave young service men and women should come home to when \nthey have fulfilled their duty: adequate health care and jobs and \nopportunity.\n\n  What kind of a message do we send to our veterans and to those who \ncurrently serve in our military? What kind of message do we send to the \nyoung men and women we are trying to recruit? Today is a solemn day \ndeliberately set aside to pay tribute to our veterans, and the Senate \nis in session because we have to spend a day and a half starting \ntomorrow talking about four judges.\n  I want the veterans across the country and the young men and women \ncurrently in harm's way to know they are appreciated, to know that some \nof the misery they are going through now is understood. How do you do \nthat? Ideally, you do that by taking the time necessary to go and greet \nthem personally. You do it by making sure veterans' benefits are \nadequate. You do it by making sure the medical care will be there, and \nthe educational opportunities. That is the appropriate way to show our \nveterans that we appreciate them. We are not going to show it by \nworking here today when, in fact, the veterans back home would like to \nsee us back home.\n  Be that as it may, we are stuck here today. So I want to take this \nopportunity to say in the most heartfelt way possible that I appreciate \nour veterans. And I salute the brave young men and women who currently \nserve, especially those who serve in the Reserves and the National \nGuard. I appreciate the enormous, enormous sacrifice that many of them \nare making now that we are asking them to serve a year or more at a \ntime, taking them away from their families, their communities, and \ntheir jobs. Today reminds us of just how much we have to be thankful \nfor.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of the time we have to our \nfriend from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from Texas just inquired whether the Senator \nfrom Alabama might go next. I understand I have 5 minutes remaining; is \nthat correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six and a half minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would be happy to have the Senator from Alabama finish \nhis remarks which are 5 minutes. I will take 5 minutes, and then we \nwill finish.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator from North Dakota and appreciate \nhis courtesy. I don't think veterans are going to be unhappy we are \nhere working today. They might have been happy to see the scene \nyesterday when we should have been able to make progress on a number of \nthings, and we had the assistant Democratic leader speaking 8 hours \nplus and reading from a book about cactus and rabbits. They might be \nunhappy about that.\n  We have soldiers in the field this very day at risk, carrying out the \npolicy of this Senate, this Congress, that we passed by over a three-\nfourths vote. We ought to be here talking about our country and doing \nsome of the country's business.\n  In fact, I was in Walter Reed Hospital this morning. I had the honor \nto meet with the service men and women who have been injured, some \nfairly seriously, in the service of their country.\n  I met with Sergeant Larry Gill who grew up in Mobile, AL, went to \nMurphy High School where my daughter went. I knew his father, \nLieutenant James Gill, in the Mobile police department, a great \nofficer. Larry Gill had a severe injury to his lower leg. He has been \nthere over a month now. It is getting better. He was so optimistic. It \nwas so wonderful to see his wife Leah who is a school teacher at Murphy \nHigh School, and his two children, Sean and Ryan, and be able to talk \nwith them and see the positive attitude he had, the commitment to \nserving his country. It was so inspiring. Larry Gill in 1983 was a \nyoung Marine serving in Beirut, Lebanon when that embassy was attacked, \nguarding the embassy as a marine, as he was often called upon to do. He \nwas knocked unconscious and had to be dug out from the rubble of the \nattack. He was a victim of terrorism in 1983. Now he comes back as part \nof our war on terrorism and is injured again.\n  As he said, he thought he ought to start collecting baseball cards \nrather than Purple Hearts. That just is an example of his spirit.\n  At the time he was injured, he was part of a National Guard unit from \nAlabama, the 1165th MP company. SPC Chris Harris and SGT Richard Barns \nand SPC4 Jose Garcia were injured.\n  I see Senator Lautenberg here.\n  SPC4 Garcia, from New Jersey, was assigned to the unit. He was \ninjured, and he refused to go home; said, no, he wanted to stay with \nhis unit, as did Specialist Harris. Both had flesh wounds that could \nhave caused them to be removed from the theater. They said, no, they \nwanted to stay with their troops. That is the kind of character and \ncourage we have out there today. It is a pleasure to see them.\n  I also visited PFC Chris Busby from Valley Head, AL, a town of 600. \nHe was injured in Baghdad. He was in an uparmored Humvee. That is \nimportant because we have been trying to make sure every uparmored \nHumvee possible is there because it is much more resistant to attack \nthan regular Humvees. His foot was out the door as he was speaking and \na mortar round hit. He said had he not been in an uparmored Humvee, he \nmay well have been far more seriously injured, if not killed. His arm \nand leg which were outside the door were both severely injured.\n  Asking how he happened to join, he said: Well, it was after September \n11. I thought I ought to serve my country.\n  He is 20 years old. His father was there. His father served 7 years \nas an MP. His brother is in Germany. He is also an MP. That is the kind \nof great, rock-solid Americans who preserve, protect, and defend our \ncountry on a daily basis. I am so proud of them. They serve us so well.\n  Just a little over a week ago I had the burden of calling Mrs. Roxy \nBell. Her son, Aubrey Bell, 33, a sergeant with the 214th MP Company, \nNational Guard Company from the Alabama National Guard, was killed in a \nfirefight through an improvised explosive device in Baghdad at the Al \nBayra police station where he was working. Sergeant Bell was part of \nthe 214th MP company from Baldwin County, AL. I had the pleasure to \nvisit with them when I was in Iraq in August. I had supper with them. I \ntalked to them. They talked about patrolling the streets of Baghdad \nwith the Iraqi police who had been brought on, which is exactly what we \nneed to do to stabilize that country, bring on more Iraqi police. They \nwere so positive, had such extraordinarily good morale. I was \nexceedingly proud of them. It was most painful to have to call and talk \nto his mother at the loss of her fine son who lost his life serving his \ncountry.\n\n  All of us need to remember that. We have sent those young men and \nwomen out. They are serving at our direction. They are placing their \nlives on the line for us on a daily basis.\n  We ask God's blessing and protection be with each one of them and \nthat we are given the wisdom to help guide them in the application of \ntheir abilities and their lives in an effective way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six and a half minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, in April of this year I was in Italy. I \nhad stopped at an American military cemetery about 15, 20 minutes \noutside of Florence. On a beautiful morning, the sun was shining on the \ngraves of 5,000 American soldiers who left their homes, left their \nfamilies, and answered the call to serve their country and gave their \nlives during the Second World War. Their final resting place is now a \ncemetery, a beautifully kept military cemetery maintained by the \nBattlefield Monuments Commission of our country south of Florence.\n  I was thinking of that prose that says: When the night is full of \nknives and the lightning is seen and the drums are heard, the patriots \nare always there, ready to fight and ready to die, if necessary, to \ndefend their country. Those patriots have given the ultimate sacrifice \nall across the world in defense of freedom here.\n  I was thinking this morning of a telephone call last week. I called a \nGerman hospital in which Brandon Olson was resting. He had just been \nwounded in Iraq. I called him in the hospital and I called his mother. \nBrandon Olson's mother called him on Thursday. On\n\n[[Page S14401]]\n\nFriday he had his foot amputated. She called him prior to surgery. When \nI talked to her, she told me her son was under heavy medication. She \ncould tell when she called him that he was in pain and his voice was \nweak.\n  This mother told her son, lying in the German hospital: You don't \nhave to talk. I just want to hear you breathe.\n  It is a mother, concerned about her son, who left this small town of \nHazen, ND to answer the call of his country. That is Brandon Olson. But \nit was also Brandon Ericson and Jason Frey, young men and women, in \nthis case three North Dakotans, who lost their lives fighting in Iraq.\n  Finally, I believe, after some long period, this country is reaching \nout to its veterans and finally understanding its requirement, its \nobligation to say thank you--thank you for your sacrifice and thank you \nfor honoring our country.\n  This morning in the newspaper in our largest city, Fargo, ND, they \npointed out that:\n  The planeload of civilian passengers in a metropolitan airport \nterminal a couple of weeks back who stood and cheered in unison when \nasked by United Airlines to give up their seats on an overbooked flight \nand take a later flight so that soldiers headed home on 14-day leaves \nfrom Iraq could get there a few hours earlier. Every soldier got a seat \non that airplane.\n  They all got on that flight because other passengers gave up their \nseats. That is what is happening in this country today as we face \ndanger, difficulty, and challenges as a nation in Iraq and Afghanistan, \nand danger from terrorists around the world. Our country is saying to \nthose who wear our uniform: Thank you. We owe you a great debt, one \nwhich we may never be able to repay, but we recognize your sacrifice \nand commitment to our country.\n  As I looked at those gravesites south of Florence, Italy, in that \nbeautiful cemetery on that April morning, I thought of John McCrae's \nwonderful poem ``In Flanders Fields.'' He wrote:\n\n     In Flanders fields the poppies blow\n     Between the crosses, row on row,\n     That mark our place; and in the sky\n     The larks, still bravely singing, fly\n     Scarce heard amid the guns below.\n\n     We are the Dead. Short day ago\n     We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,\n     Loved and were loved, and now we lie,\n     In Flanders fields.\n\n     Take up our quarrel with the foe:\n     To you from failing hands we throw\n     The torch; be yours to hold it high.\n     If ye break faith with us who die\n     We shall not sleep, though poppies grow\n     In Flanders fields.\n\n  It reminds us again--especially today, on Veterans Day--all across \nAmerica that the liberty we enjoy, the freedom we take for granted was \npaid for by the blood of patriots, and every American family has been \ntouched by those patriots who have given the ultimate sacrifice. Every \nAmerican community can and should recognize today those who live up the \nblock or down the block or on the farm, who went all across this world \nand have fought valiantly for America's freedom, and have come home to \nlive quietly among neighbors, never talking much about their service to \nour country.\n  But that service is what has made this the wonderful country it is. \nThere is no place like it on Earth. There is no place quite as free as \nthe United States of America, and that freedom has not been achieved \nwithout great sacrifice by young men and women. When America sends its \nsons and daughters to war, when America asks its sons and daughters to \nfight, then we must resolve to do everything we can to make that a \nsuccessful fight on behalf of America's freedom.\n  Today, we honor wonderful veterans who have served this country for \nmany decades.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, today, Veterans Day, we honor America's \nveterans. It is to serve as 85 years of recognition after armistice was \ndeclared on November 11, at 11 a.m., in 1918. We pay tribute to our \nveterans today, but I suggest to my colleagues and fellow Americans we \nought to pay more tribute to veterans every day.\n  The first veteran I knew was my father, Harry Specter, who was a \nveteran of World War I. My father had come to the United States as an \nimmigrant, at the age of 18, in 1911. The Czar in control of Russia at \nthe time wanted to send my father, among many others, to Siberia. My \nfather chose instead to come to America. He literally walked across \nEurope, barely a ruble in his pocket, and traveled at the bottom of the \nboat to the United States to make a new life for himself. He did not \nknow at that time that he had a round-trip ticket to France, not to \nParis and the Folies Bergeres with the dancing girls, but to the \nArgonne Forest where he was wounded in action.\n  My father carried shrapnel in his legs until the day he died. The \nU.S. Government promised the veterans of World War I a $500 bonus and, \nas has been the case so frequently with the U.S. Government, the \npromise was broken. The veterans then mounted a march on Washington in \n1932 to seek redress, exercising their constitutional right to petition \ntheir Government, and also in petitioning their Government, to have the \nGovernment fulfill the promise the Government had made to pay the \nveterans a $500 bonus.\n  Today, when there is a demonstration in Washington, the red carpet is \nrolled out. On that day, in 1932, the cavalry was rolled out with drawn \nsabers, led by MAJ George C. Patton. In command was the Chief of Staff \nof the Army, Douglas MacArthur. There is a famous picture of General \nMacArthur, with his aide de camp, MAJ Dwight Eisenhower. On that day, \nveterans were killed. It is one of the blackest days in American \nhistory.\n  That was the way the U.S. Government responded to the pleas of the \nWorld War I veterans who were asking only for what they had been \npromised--their $500 bonus. In a sense, in a metaphor, I have been on \nmy way to Washington ever since to get my father's bonus. I have not \ngotten it yet, so I am still here and running for reelection.\n  When we honor the veterans today, we ought to make note of the fact \nthat the medical services that are available to veterans are, \nrealistically viewed, insufficient. We are about to take up, in the \ncourse of the next several days, the appropriations bill for veterans. \nWe are endeavoring to get an additional $1.3 billion to help on \nveterans medical benefits.\n  I have the honor to chair the Veterans Affairs Committee in the \nSenate. Later today, I will join President Bush at the White House for \na bill-signing ceremony, where we are creating additional veteran \ncemeteries across America, so that the families of veterans can be near \ntheir departed loved ones and can pay tribute without traveling long \ndistances.\n  At the present time, families of veterans who live in southeastern \nPennsylvania have to travel about 100 miles to Indiantown Gap, to \nAnnville, to pay respects, where veterans are now interred, buried, \nfrom the southeastern part of the State. After a great deal of effort, \ngoing back about 6 years, I am paying tribute to former Congressman \nJohn Fox, who worked with me initially to introduce the legislation \nthat was finally passed by both Houses of Congress. Jim Gerlach is the \ncurrent sponsor in the House of Representatives--Congressman Gerlach--\nand there will be a bill-signing ceremony today where President Bush \nwill affix a signature and we will at least have done that for \nveterans.\n  There are many issues pending to take care of America's veterans. We \nare currently in the Veterans Affairs Committee reviewing a proposal by \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs to alter the hospital accommodations \nacross America. We are determined to see to it that any changes which \nare made benefit rather than hurt veterans.\n  Mr. President, on the subject of the proposals which are now pending, \nI am very much concerned, as chairman of the committee, for the entire \nNation about what will happen to many of the facilities which are under \nreview--facilities in New York, facilities in California, facilities \nacross the country, and one very hotly contested facility in Waco, TX. \nI am concerned about what will happen in Pittsburgh where there are \nproposals to close Highland Drive. If that is done, there has to be an \nadequate accommodation so that the facilities are at least equal to, if \nnot better than what is currently available. There are concerns about \nButler, PA, Erie, PA, and across my State. A new facility is due in \nLebanon.\n  So on this day when we are concerned about veterans, when we pay \nhonor to them, we ought to remember\n\n[[Page S14402]]\n\nthat the veterans have created the climate of freedom. When we pause \nand remember the veterans on Armistice Day of 1918, remember that it is \na continuum of veterans who have served America since the Revolutionary \nWar. My brother served in World War II, as did my brother-in-law in the \nSouth Pacific. I was in the service during the Korean war and served \nstateside.\n  We now have many aging veterans from World War II and the Korean war \nwho need more accommodations. We have veterans from Vietnam and the \ngulf war and from Iraq. As we pay tribute to the veterans for what they \nhave done for America, America should reciprocate and see to it that \nthe needs of veterans are adequately responded to.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to say a few words about Veterans \nDay, the day we honor millions who have served in our Armed Forces. We \ngive thanks to those who risk their lives and, frankly, who are risking \ntheir lives as we speak. They have done it and they are doing it now \nout of love of country.\n  We also mourn those who made the ultimate sacrifice for our Nation. \nAs American casualties mount in Iraq, Veterans Day takes on a very \nspecial meaning. Many in our country have lost loved ones in Iraq, and \nevery day we all pray for the safe return of our men and women in \nuniform.\n  In my home State of California, we have lost 73 from California or \nbased in California. The burden is heavy for their relatives--mothers, \ndads, children, friends. Yet we know they went over there, in many \ncases, following their families in a rich military tradition and, in \nsome cases, because they wanted to stand up and be counted for their \ncountry.\n  They have courage and dignity. It is our responsibility to only send \nthem into harm's way when we know what we are doing; to only send them \ninto harm's way when we have a plan; to only send them into harm's way \nwhen we have an exit strategy, and these are issues we will continue to \nwork on because some of us, I am afraid, do not see that plan and do \nnot see that exit strategy.\n  I wish to say on a personal note that November 11 is also my \nbirthday. I say that because as a child, I was so proud I was born on \nwhat was called Armistice Day because Armistice Day reflected a day of \npeace, the end of a war, the end of the war to end all wars, which \nWorld War I was known as. Unfortunately, it wasn't to be. There were \nmore wars. In 1954, Congress changed the name of Armistice Day to \nVeterans Day to pay homage to all of our veterans.\n  I regret I am not able to spend today with veterans in my State. I \nreally had wanted to do that, but I do appreciate this opportunity to \npay tribute to them on the floor of the Senate.\n  One more point on veterans. Earlier today I introduced legislation to \nhelp our future veterans by reimbursing States and localities that \ncontinue to pay their government employees who are Guard and \nreservists--such as policeman and firefighters--when they are called to \nactive duty. This legislation will go a long way to help the families \nof these Guard men and women and reservists make ends meet.\n  In many cases, the local and State governments are paying their \nsalaries and are falling behind. It seems to me that is the least we \ncan do, is reimburse for those funds. I hope others will join me in \nthis legislation. By the way, many of our States and counties and \ncities are already doing this, and their budgets are hurting.\n  This is a war that was, in fact, voted on here and executed by the \nPresident. Therefore, it seems to me the least we can do is reimburse \nlocal agencies who are putting out the funding.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, November 11, Veterans Day, is the day of \nreverence for American veterans. It is the day of the year set aside to \nhonor the people who have defended our country, our way of life, and \nour freedom. It is the day that allows us to pause to recognize their \npatriotism, their love of country, their willingness to serve, and \ntheir willingness to sacrifice.\n  Just last year, President Bush called Veterans Day the day that we \n``show our gratitude to the veterans of the United States Armed \nForces''--a day when ``we honor veterans and we honor their families, \nand we offer the thanks of a grateful Nation.''\n  The very origins of this day are both historic and symbolic. It began \nat the 11th hour on the 11th day of the 11th month--that is, 11/11/11--\nof 1918 when the allied powers signed a cease-fire agreement with the \ncentral powers, thus bringing to an end the 4-year bloody nightmare \nknown as World War I.\n  The next year, the United States set aside November 11 as Armistice \nDay to remember and honor the sacrifices that men and women made during \nWorld War I.\n  In 1926, a congressional resolution officially named November 11 \nArmistice Day. Twelve years later, in 1938, Congress made Armistice Day \na national holiday.\n  In 1954, following World War II and the Korean war, Congress made \nNovember 11 a day to honor veterans of all wars, and therefore changed \nthe name of this most important day to Veterans Day. President Dwight \nD. Eisenhower, the President of the United States at the time, asked \nAmericans to use this day to ``remember the sacrifices of all those who \nfought so valiantly on the seas, in the air, and on foreign shores, to \npreserve our heritage of freedom.'' In the first Presidential \n``Veterans Day Proclamation,'' President Eisenhower proclaimed:\n\n       It is my earnest hope that all veterans, their \n     organizations, and the entire citizenry will join hands to \n     insure proper and widespread observance of this day.\n\n  Just how important and symbolic this day had become to the American \npeople and, especially, our veterans, was demonstrated in the reaction \nto the Uniform Holiday bill of 1968. This legislation was part of an \noverall plan to make holidays part of a 3-day weekend, which would, in \nturn, encourage travel, recreational and cultural activities, and \nstimulate greater industrial and commercial activity. In so doing, this \nlegislation changed the observance of Veterans Day from November 11 to \nthe fourth Monday in October.\n  Seldom in all of my 51 years in Congress has Congress so misjudged \nthe feelings of the American people. American veterans in particular, \nand Americans in general, demanded that the observance of Veterans Day \nbe restored as November 11. It was all right to monkey around with \nColumbus Day, we learned, and even the birthday of the father of our \ncountry. But we should have never touched November 11.\n  According to the Veterans of Foreign Wars, November 11 has a special \nmeaning to veterans of all wars and is a part of American history. Of \nall the days in the year, the one day which has the most significance \nto those citizens who made an extra sacrifice in the national interest \nby their service in the Armed Forces is November 11.\n  Many States simply continued to celebrate November 11 as Veterans \nDay.\n\n  Immediately, Members of Congress introduced legislation to \nredesignate November 11 as Veterans Day. My former colleague in this \nChamber, Senator Robert Dole, who himself was a World War II veteran \nand was destined to become a majority leader of the Senate and a \nnominee of the Republican Party for Vice President and President, \nproposed such legislation. He called November 11 a ``legal holiday that \nprovides a unique and fitting day of recognition for our American \nveterans.'' It is the day, Senator Dole declared, when the Nation pays \n``tribute and homage to the men and women who have given so much in \ntheir quest for world peace and freedom.''\n  By 1975, 42 States, including my own State of West Virginia, had \nreturned to the practice of celebrating Veterans Day on November 11. In \nthat year, Congress approved legislation to return the annual \nobservance of Veterans Day to November 11. President Gerald R. Ford \nsigned the bill, stating:\n\n       It has become apparent that the commemoration of this day \n     on November 11 is a matter of historic and patriotic \n     significance to a great many of our citizens. It is a \n     practice deeply and firmly rooted in our customs and \n     traditions.\n\n  More recently, when legislative ideas were circulating through \nCongress to bolster voter participation in Federal elections, at least \none proposal centered on designating Veterans Day as the national \nelection day. In response to that proposal, my office was flooded with \nphone calls from veterans, saying: ``Please don't take away our special \nday.''\n\n[[Page S14403]]\n\n  Mr. President, November 11 is their special day. It is for this \nreason that during the years in which it was my privilege to serve as \nthe majority leader of the U.S. Senate, I was always determined that \nthis legislative body would not be in session on this most important \nand symbolic date. I always wanted to make sure that my colleagues and \nI had the opportunity to take part in the many ceremonies that take \nplace on this day in honor of the courage and the sacrifice of \nAmerica's veterans. I always wanted to make sure that this Chamber paid \nproper homage to the men and women to whom we owe so much.\n  Writing about the thousands of soldiers who lost their lives during \nthe bloody battle at Antietam, Civil War historian, Bruce Catton, \npointed out that these men did not die for a few feet of a cornfield or \na rocky hill; they died that this country might be permitted to go on, \nand that it might be permitted to fulfill the great hope of our \nFounding Fathers.\n  So may it be said of most every person who has worn our Nation's \nuniform. These people served and they sacrificed to permit this country \nto go on to fulfill the great hope of our Founding Fathers. And it is \nproper and it is right that we take one day a year to pay our most \nprofound respect to the men and the women who have worn our Nation's \nuniform, and to thank them.\n  I thank them and we here in the Senate thank them on this day for \nwhat they have given, for what they have sacrificed, and for their love \nof country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/11/senate-section/article/S14403-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14403]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on behalf of the majority leader, I call \nup the Syria Accountability Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will state the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1828) to halt Syrian support for terrorism, \n     end its occupation of Lebanon, stop its development of \n     weapons of mass destruction, cease its illegal importation of \n     Iraqi oil and illegal shipments of weapons and other military \n     items to Iraq, and by so doing hold Syria accountable for the \n     serious international security problems it has caused in the \n     Middle East, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time for debate is limited to 90 minutes, \nwith 30 minutes under the control of the Senator from Indiana, Mr. \nLugar, or his designee, 30 minutes under the control of the Senator \nfrom Delaware, Mr. Biden, or his designee, and 30 minutes under the \ncontrol of the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, there is before the Senate the so-called \nSyrian Accountability Act, which imposes sanctions on Syria. It recites \na long list of circumstances where the Syrians have not taken \nsufficient action to fight terrorism, and then it calls for Syria to \ntake corrective action, and in the absence of that corrective action, \nauthorizes the imposition of economic sanctions, and it leaves with the \nPresident of the United States the authority to waive those sanctions \nif it is in the national interest.\n  Sanctions are imposed by Congress with some frequency. At first \nblush, this appears to be a straightforward affirmative vote, but I \nbelieve the matter is more complicated than that, and I have come to \nthat view after having traveled to Syria almost every year since 1984, \nand after having had considerable contact with the Syrian Government. \nAfter considering the matter at some length, I have decided that I will \nvote in favor of the Syrian Accountability Act because the problems of \nterrorism are so serious and because I believe that Syria needs to do \nmore.\n  The bill itself has a long recitation of background circumstances, \nbut the events today in Iraq, where our fighting men and women are \nbeing subjected to terrorist attacks, casualties and fatalities, and \nwhere the people of Iraq are being subjected as victims of terrorism, I \nbelieve it is a fair demand that more be done. That would include more \nby Syria.\n  There are, according to reliable reports, official statements of the \nU.S. Government that terrorists are infiltrating into Syria, coming \nfrom Syria into Iraq. More has to be done on that subject.\n  It has to be noted that Syria has responded with a number of \naffirmative actions to be of assistance to the United States in our war \non terrorists. The officials of the State Department have acknowledged \nthat after September 11, 2001, that information was provided by Syria \non al-Qaeda, which saved U.S. lives.\n  It is also to be acknowledged there has been some improvement on the \nSyrian-Iraqi border, but clearly not enough. There were reports just \nthis morning from the State Department about the porous Syrian border \nand terrorists coming into Iraq, again exposing U.S. personnel and the \nIraqis themselves to terrorist attack.\n  It ought to be noted that Syria did join in the unanimous resolution, \nU.N. Resolution 1511, and that when Secretary of State Powell traveled \nto Syria in April of 2002, there was some helpful action taken by the \nSyrian Government on the southern border of Lebanon. But when Secretary \nof State Powell went to Syria in May of 2003 and urged the Syrian \nGovernment to oust the terrorists from Damascus, that request was not \nacted upon. Recently, Israel moved against terrorist training camps \nwithin a few miles of Damascus.\n  While all of these matters are subjected to controversy, and there \nare disputes by the Syrian Government, I believe the balance of the \nevidence supports the conclusion that those were training camps.\n  I believe it is important that the U.S. Government continues in its \nefforts to negotiate with Syria to try to improve the situation, and \nthat we ought to be mindful that there are opportunities to have frank \ndiscussions with the Syrian officials which have led to some beneficial \nresults and which ought to be pursued.\n  I urge my colleagues in the U.S. Congress, pursuant to our duties, \nfor example, on the Foreign Operations Subcommittee on which I serve, \nor on the Foreign Relations Committee, to travel to Syria to engage the \nSyrian leaders because I think it can be productive. I make reference \nto my own experience in that regard.\n  I made my first trip to Syria in 1984. As I have said, I have been to \nSyria almost every year since. I first met President Bashar al-Assad in \nJanuary of 1988 and found him to be willing to listen and willing to \nhave a dialog. My conversation at that time with President Assad lasted \nfor some 4 hours and 35 minutes, talking about a wide range of issues--\nthe Israeli-Syrian relations, the Iran-Iraq war, which was still in \nprogress at that time, U.S.-Syrian relations, the situations with the \nJews in Syria. At that time, working with then Congressman Solarz, I \nurged President Assad to allow the Jews to have free immigration out of \nSyria. There were many Jewish women in Syria who could not find \nhusbands of the Jewish faith. President Assad said to me, in one of our \nmeetings, he would release any Jewish woman where somebody came from \nthe United States--there were large Syrian-Jewish groupings in the \nUnited States--to come to claim a bride, and anyone who wanted to marry \na woman in Syria who was Jewish, if a suitor came, the woman would be \nreleased.\n\n  I reported back to a number of Jewish-Syrian enclaves in the United \nStates. Nothing much happened about that. Finally, a few years later, \nPresident Assad granted free rights for the Jews to leave Syria at \ntheir choice, something he had resisted, but something which he finally \nwas persuaded to do.\n  During the course of the discussions I had with President Assad, I \nurged him to participate in discussions with Israel. At first, he took \nthe position he would not be a party to any discussions which were \nsponsored just by the United States but only if they were sponsored by \nall five of the permanent members of the Security Council.\n  Finally, President Assad made a change and sent representatives to \nMadrid in 1991 to participate in those discussions. When Prime Minister \nNetanyahu was elected in 1996, Prime\n\n[[Page S14404]]\n\nMinister Netanyahu initially made some statements that he was going to \nhold Syria accountable for Hezbollah on the southern Lebanon border. \nThat resulted in a very tense situation with Syria realigning their \ntroops along the Syrian border.\n  Prime Minister Netanyahu knew I was about to travel to Syria and \nasked me to carry a message to President Assad and Foreign Minister \nShara, that Prime Minister Netanyahu wanted peace and was prepared to \npersonally engage in discussions and would urge President Assad to \nengage personally, but that was not a condition.\n  I relayed that message to President Assad. While he was not willing \nto engage in negotiations with Prime Minister Netanyahu, it was later \nreported there was an easing of those tensions.\n  On many occasions, I would urge President Assad to have discussions \nwith the Israeli Prime Minister. I soon developed a relationship where \nI was able to take it in a somewhat lighter vein and said to him when \nour pictures--he met with me in his office, with the large traditional \nchairs and a small stand in between to hold the tea or coffee--I said \ntomorrow there would be a picture in the Damascus newspaper of our \ndiscussion, but that if he would meet with Prime Minister Shamir, which \nI urged in the early 1990s, the picture would appear on the front pages \nof the New York Times and the London Times and across the world.\n  When the Nobel Peace awards were given to Prime Minister Rabin and \nForeign Minister Perez and Chairman Arafat, I urged President Assad to \nengage in negotiations with Prime Minister Rabin. I said he would be \nhonored at Oslo, and he responded in a light vein that he might be \nhonored at Oslo but he would not be allowed back in Damascus. I told \nhim I did not think that was true, and he commented notwithstanding \nwhat some might think, the public opinion in Syria was a matter of some \nsubstantial concern to him.\n  I attended the funeral of President Assad in the year 2000, \naccompanying Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. On that occasion, I \nhad a chance to meet his successor, President Bashar Assad. I visited \nSyria on two occasions, in 2002 and last year in 2003, and have had \nlengthy conversations with President Bashar Assad. They are \nconversations which are candid and sometimes critical.\n  For example, at the Arab summit, when President Bashar Assad made a \ncomment that Zionism was the same as nazism, I said I thought there \nought to be a change in his attitude on that because there was no \ncomparison between the brutality of nazism, their destruction, their \nattacking neighboring countries, their Holocaust, murdering 6 million \nJews, and the aspirations of the Zionists to have a homeland in Israel. \nHe listened and talked. To what extent there is an imprint, who knows. \nIt is better to have it said than to have him thinking he can simply \nequate nazism and Zionism without an objection.\n\n  President Bashar Assad also made a comment at the Arab summit that it \nwas fair to target civilians in the Golan Heights, and I disagreed with \nhim. He said, well, the civilians are armed. I said, they have to be \narmed because there are attacks on the borders. I urged him that the \nright response was to engage in diplomatic talks with the United \nStates.\n  The essential conclusions which I have reached are there is some \nsubstantial opportunity to deal with Syria. In Bashar Assad there is a \nnew leader, a man in his late 30s, English educated, willing to meet \nwith the House of Representatives or the Senate, willing to listen. \nNotwithstanding my many exhortations of President Hafez al-Assad and \nPresident Bashar Assad, they continue to harbor terrorists in Damascus. \nBoth the father and the son respond that the people live there have \nbeen exiled from what was formerly Palestine, they cannot be in Israel \nso they live in Damascus. I responded I thought that was an \ninsufficient answer.\n  Although some progress has been made, I do believe Syria needs to do \nmuch more. Syria is the de facto controller of Lebanon, and Syria needs \nto do more to stop Hezbollah and their rocket attacks on Israel, with \nthe tremendous armaments which Syria has. There are reliable reports \nabout Syria developing bacteriological warfare, a lot of chemical \nwarfare, and extending the range of their missiles, and some incipient \nefforts at nuclear weapons, so they would have to submit to \ninternational arms control regimes.\n  Most of all, I believe Syria has to do much more in the fight against \nterrorism. President Bush has said, and I think accurately, he who \nharbors a terrorist is a terrorist himself; he who harbors a terrorist \nin the eyes of the law is an accessory before the fact.\n  Today, the problem of terrorism is so acute there cannot be any \nhalfway measures. Syria needs to do a great deal more on the border to \nstop terrorists from coming into Iraq.\n  There are reports about al-Qaida being in Iraq. I am not vouching for \nany of those reports. I think we have to be very careful what we say \nabout terrorism and who the terrorists are and where they come from, \nbut there is no doubt Iraq has been a magnet for young men and young \nwomen who do not like the United States, who do not like U.S. support \nof Israel, who do not like what we have done in Iraq, and they are \ncoming into Iraq. There are daily attacks on our men and women. There \nare daily attacks on the Iraqis themselves.\n  There is a state of tremendous violence. Every day, when we look to \nthe news media, we wonder if there is going to be another report about \na helicopter being shot down or about United States soldiers being \nattacked or about Iraqi civilians being attacked. That means the effort \nagainst that kind of terrorism has to be absolute. That is why I \nbelieve the Syria Accountability Act is one which ought to be passed by \nthe Senate.\n  When the Syria Accountability Act was gaining in cosponsors, I wrote \nto President Bashar al Assad on September 17 of this year. I ask \nunanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. President Assad then asked his representative in the \nUnited States, in Washington, his charge d'affaires--they didn't have \nan ambassador--to come and talk to me, and we had a discussion as to \nwhat was going on. It seems to me, after considering the matter and the \ngravity of the risks which our fighting men and women are undertaking \nin Iraq, and the risks to the Iraqi people themselves, that it is an \nappropriate time to make a formal demand on the Government of Syria to \ndo more.\n  If they do more and if they join in the fight against terrorism, \nthere is ample opportunity for the President of the United States to \ntake the appropriate action pursuant to this resolution and to lift the \nsanctions.\n  I thank my colleague from Alabama for sitting overtime into the lunch \nperiod. I yield the floor and note we will now go into a noontime \nrecess, to reconvene at 2:15.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 17, 2003.\n     His Excellency Bashar Al-Assad,\n     President, Syrian Arab Republic,\n     Damascus, Syria.\n       Dear President Assad: I write to inform you of growing \n     concern in the United States Senate about Syria and the fact \n     that the Syrian Accountability Act now has 76 co-sponsors. I \n     had discussed this proposed legislation some time ago with \n     your Ambassador to the United States. I had refrained from \n     co-sponsoring the Syrian Accountability Act on the premise \n     that we should try to work out the problems without resorting \n     to legislation calling for sanctions.\n       Yesterday, Undersecretary of State John R. Bolton submitted \n     testimony to the House of Representatives' International \n     Relations Committee that Syria is permitting ``volunteers'' \n     to pass over your border into Iraq where those so-called \n     volunteers are intent on killing U.S. troops. This follows \n     Administrator L. Paul Bremer's statement on August 20th that \n     Syria is allowing ``foreign terrorists'' to cross Syria's \n     borders into Iraq.\n       When you met with Secretary of State Powell last May, there \n     was an understanding that Syria would shut Damascus offices \n     of Hamas, Islamic Jihad and other terrorist groups. In June, \n     Secretary Powell stated that Syria's efforts to shut these \n     offices were ``totally inadequate''.\n       The Bush Administration which had opposed the Syrian \n     Accountability Act now is neutral, taking no position.\n       After extensive dealings with your father, President Hafez \n     al-Assad, since the 1980s and with you on our meetings in the \n     past several years, I have tried to assist in finding answers \n     to these difficult problems. With the\n\n[[Page S14405]]\n\n     Syrian Accountability Act gaining so much support, it is my \n     hope that your Government will respond to the concerns \n     outlined in this letter before the U.S. Government resorts to \n     sanctions.\n       I call these matters to your personal attention with the \n     hope that prompt action can be taken by Syria to resolve \n     these problems. The United States greatly appreciated the \n     help that Syria provided to our intelligence services after \n     September 11, 2001 in our flight against el-Qaeda.\n           Sincerely,\n     Arlen Specter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/11/senate-section/article/S14405-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14405]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate soon will be \ntaking action on the Syria Accountability Act. Much work has been \ndevoted to this legislation, and I believe that we are ready to pass \nthe bill. I would like to thank the majority leader for his support of \nthis bill and the process that led to it. I also would like to thank \nSenators Santorum and Boxer for their commitment to this bill and their \nbipartisan cooperation in reaching agreement of an important amendment. \nA critical component of this amendment provides the President with the \nability to calibrate U.S. sanctions against Syria in response to \npositive Syrian behavior when such adjustment is in the national \nsecurity interests of the United States.\n  On October 30, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee held an \nexcellent hearing on U.S. relations with Syria. Among other witnesses, \nwe heard from William Burns, Assistant Secretary of State for Near \nEastern Affairs, and Ambassador Cofer Black, the Counter-Terrorism \nCoordinator.\n  These hearings underscored the difficulties presented by recent \nSyrian behavior. Hopes that reform could take root in Syria after the \nfall of Saddam Hussein have dimmed considerably. Instead, tensions have \nincreased between the United States and Syria, and a cycle of \nretaliation and revenge has derailed possible progress in the ``Road \nMap'' to peace for Israelis and Palestinians. The Israeli retaliatory \nattack on an Islamic Jihad terrorist camp in Syria has underscored that \nthe ``no war and no peace'' status quo in the region cannot be taken \nfor granted.\n  Many experts thought that when President Bashar al-Assad replaced his \nfather 3 years ago, he would adopt a more pragmatic approach to \nnegotiations with Israel and to internal political and economic \nreforms. Syrian cooperation with the United States in relation to al-\nQaida terrorists held promise for cooperation in other areas. Assistant \nSecretary Burns noted last June in Congressional testimony that ``the \ncooperation the Syrians have provided in their own self-interest on al-\nQaida has saved American lives.''\n  But Syria's subsequent failure to stop terrorist groups, including \nHezbollah, Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, from using Syria as a \nbase for training and planning suicide bombings in Israel has \ncontinued. Syria also has failed to withdraw its forces from Lebanon or \ntake concrete steps in support of the Road Map peace plan. It \nreportedly has continued to maintain stockpiles of chemical weapons and \nto pursue development of lethal biological agents.\n  Moreover, Syria is working against the U.S. and Coalition forces in \nIraq by refusing to release assets in Syrian accounts that Saddam \nHussein's regime stole from the Iraqi people.\n  These and other Syrian transgressions have led both Houses of the \nU.S. Congress to support the bill before us today, which stiffens the \neconomic and diplomatic sanctions already imposed on Damascus for being \na state sponsor of terrorism. I support this bill, which is based on \nthe presumption that modifying Syria's behavior requires a tough \nresponse. But as we give the administration additional sticks to use \nagainst Syria, we should be careful about restricting our government's \nflexibility in responding to new diplomatic opportunities. Syria has \nshown the ability to make better choices--for example, supporting U.N. \nSecurity Council Resolution 1441 in November 2002, which held Iraq in \n``material breach'' of its disarmament obligations and voting for the \nmore recent Resolution 1511, which calls upon all nations to support \nthe U.S.-led effort in Iraq. I believe the amendment to this bill \nprovides the President with the necessary flexibility.\n\n  Even as we tighten restrictions on Syria, we should be emphasizing to \nthe Syrians why it is in their interest to recalculate their approach \ntowards the United States. Syria shares a 400-mile border with Iraq. \nWith more than 135,00 U.S. troops deployed in Iraq, Syria needs to \nreconsider where its future security interests lie. This is not a \nthreat of U.S. military action but a statement of the new reality on \nSyria's borders. Moreover, Syrian forces that continue to occupy \nLebanon are draining the Syrian economy while providing few positive \nreturns. Continued Syrian occupation of Lebanon invites further \npossible military action from Israel.\n  The Syrian leadership also must adjust to the end of its ``under the \ncounter'' oil deals with Saddam Hussein. Syria must negotiate new and \ntransparent arrangements to meet its energy needs. Syria's economy will \nnot thrive without opening up to investment and trade, particularly \nwith Iraq. Significant benefits could accrue to Syria from an \neconomically vibrant Iraqi trading partner, increased trade with Europe \nand the United States, and even possible membership in a Middle East \nFree Trade Agreement down the road.\n  In this context, Syria may find motivation to return to the \nnegotiating table. An agreement on the Golan Heights that would provide \nsecurity guarantees for Israel while respecting Syria's sovereignty \ncould be the key to resolving a host of other problems, including \nSyria's occupation of Lebanon, its support of Palestinian terror \ngroups, and its economic and political isolation. Although success of \nsuch an agreement would depend ultimately on the parties themselves, \nthe United States must seek to leverage obvious Syrian interests in \npursuit of a viable settlement.\n  The Syrian regime has some difficult choices to make. It can continue \nto harbor and support groups devoted to terror, or it can act in ways \nthat will help restore stability and peace in the region and thereby \ncreate a better economic future for its people. It cannot do both. This \nbill, as amended, adds to the tools available to the President to move \nSyria toward a more responsible course. I commend the bill to the \nSenate and hope that we will pass it by a strong vote.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I wanted to come to the floor to express \nmy strong support for the Syria Accountability Act. I commend the \ndistinguished chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for \nhis leadership and the efforts he has made on this legislation to bring \nus to this point. Let me also thank my colleague from California, \nSenator Boxer, for her tireless and effective advocacy of this \nlegislation. I am very pleased this legislation is now pending. I \ncongratulate my colleagues as well as others who have made the effort \nto bring us to a point where I believe on a strong bipartisan basis \nthis legislation will pass this afternoon.\n  This day has been a long time coming. We have heard administration \nofficials argue that this straightforward response to the behavior of \nthe Syrian Government reduces the President's flexibility to deal with \nthe ``bigger picture.'' We believe that it is not only morally right, \nbut will actually strengthen the President's hand in explaining the \n``big picture'' to the Syrians.\n  Had our years of entreaties to the Syrians not fallen on deaf ears, \nand had promises from Syria over the last several years not turned out \nto be little\n\n[[Page S14406]]\n\nmore than empty rhetoric, this bill might not have been necessary.\n  However, it appears to many of us that the point where we can \ncontinue to sit back and hope for Syria to change course has passed. \nThe time has come to show Syria that continued inaction will no longer \nbe tolerated and will come at a price.\n  The behavior we seek from Syria is not different than what we expect \nof every other country in the world community--an end to its support \nfor terrorism, and enforcement of its own international agreements and \nUnited Nations Security Council resolutions.\n  Syria simply has failed one too many times to live up to these \nobligations, and this legislation backs up our hopes for Syrian \ncompliance along with the very real threat of sanctions.\n  The Syria Accountability Act holds Syria accountable for its behavior \nby imposing sanctions unless the Syrian Government certifies that: It \nis no longer providing support for terrorists and terrorism; it has \nwithdrawn all of its military and intelligence personnel from Lebanon; \nit has ceased its attempts to produce, acquire, or transfer weapons of \nmass destruction; and it has ended its support for terrorists in Iraq.\n  I am pleased with the bipartisan process that produced this landmark \nlegislation, and I especially want to commend Senator Levin for his \nleadership in ensuring that the President maintains the maximum \nflexibility to wisely wield the tools created by H.R. 1828. The \nnational security waiver, which allows the President to waive certain \nsanctions if they are deemed counterproductive to U.S. security \ninterests, will allow our government to effectively press for reform in \nSyria without endangering our efforts in the global war against \nterrorism.\n  There are three reasons we need to pass this unambiguous statement of \nU.S. intent.\n  First, as remarkable as it is to imagine, the Government of Syria \nstill provides safe haven and material support for some of the most \nobjectionable terrorist organizations in the world.\n  Hamas, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, PIJ, the Popular Front for the \nLiberation of Palestine General Command, the Popular Front for the \nLiberation of Palestine, the Democratic Front for the Liberation of \nPalestine, the Abu Musa Organization, and the Popular Struggle Front \nall maintain offices in Damascus. Members of the Syrian Government \nhave, on occasion, condoned suicide bombings against civilians within \nIsrael, calling them legitimate military operations.\n  Syria alternates between defending these offices in Damascus as \nsolely for press purposes, uninvolved in the conduct of terrorist \nattacks, and promising they will shut the offices down. To date, its \npromises have amounted to nothing. Meanwhile, its defense of these \noffices is as unfortunate as it is inaccurate. It is simply not \nacceptable to provide support for an office whose sole purpose is to \ncall attention to, and encourage support for, attacks on innocent \ncivilians.\n  Moreover, reports indicate that planning for the recent and \nhorrendous attack at a restaurant frequented by Israeli Jews and \nIsraeli Arabs in Haifa is connected to offices in Damascus.\n  We are also beginning to learn from the intelligence community that \nSyria may have allowed military equipment and personnel to flow into \nIraq on the eve of and during the war, both of which were used against \nour troops in that country.\n  Although the administration reports that the situation on the Syria-\nIraq border is ``improving,'' the international community should expect \nnothing but full cooperation from Syria on something so basic as \nstopping the flow of terrorists through its territory.\n  Second, in signing the 1994 Taif Accords, Syria pledged itself to the \n``security and independence of Lebanon.'' To date, it has helped with \nneither. Instead, it continues to support the Lebanese Hezbollah and \nundermine the democratic aspirations of the people of Lebanon by \noccupying that country.\n  In 1999, Israel withdrew its forces from southern Lebanon after being \ntold by the international community that doing so would increase its \nsecurity. Cynically, Syria exploited the resulting security vacuum and \npermitted attacks on Israel from that region, all in contravention of \nSecurity Council Resolution 425. It is especially disappointing that we \nhave to come to the floor of the U.S. Senate to call on a member of the \nUnited Nations Security Council to enforce its own resolutions.\n  Third, the Syria Accountability Act--a clear statement of America's \nresolve--should help put an end to the series of mixed signals coming \nfrom the Bush administration. Over the course of the last 3 years, we \nhave heard various policies from the different spokes-people for \ndifferent agencies of the U.S. Government. In fact, we have even heard \ncompeting policies and concerns from offices within the same State \nDepartment.\n  As I said at the beginning, I wish this bill were not necessary. \nUnfortunately, we all recognize that it has become necessary. This bill \nwill make clear to Syria what we expect of it. If it is not willing to \nend its support for terrorism or uphold its agreements, it should not \nbe accepted as a full partner in the international community.\n  I urge adoption of the legislation and again congratulate the \ndistinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee for his \nleadership in bringing this bill to the floor this afternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Democratic leader \nfor his speech and for his thoughtful comments.\n  Mr. President, I am prepared to yield to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania as much time as he should require, with the time \nallotted to our side on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I, too, thank the Senator from Indiana \nfor working very closely with Senator Boxer and me on this very \nimportant piece of legislation, which is a very timely piece of \nlegislation.\n  The House passed this legislation a few months ago and sent it over \nhere. We have been working diligently with both Senator Lugar and \nSenator Biden, and they have been most cooperative in working with the \nadministration to craft a bill that I think meets some of the concerns \nthe administration has, some of the concerns the committee has \nexperienced in dealing with sanctions bills, and particularly the issue \nof the waiver authority of the President.\n  The House-passed bill did not allow the President to waive sanctions \non military or dual-use items--``dual use'' meaning they could be used \nfor civilian or military purposes. I think the chairman of the \ncommittee rightly expressed concern about that, that the precedent \ngenerally is that the President have waiver authority in the case of \nvital national security interests or national security interests.\n  We negotiated as to what that standard should be. We obviously wanted \nthe highest level of scrutiny before the President could waive that \nwhich would be vital national security interests. The lowest level \nwould just be sort of a national interest test. And we compromised on a \nnational security interest waiver. It is sort of a midlevel, if you \nwill, waiver authority or waiver standard. We think that is appropriate \nhere for all of the items, all of the potential sanctions that may be \nimposed by the President under this act.\n  So the President, under the revised bill we have before us, does \nimpose sanctions, but it gives the President the flexibility to waive. \nBut he has a threshold he must meet and make the case that that \nthreshold is made in order to waive these sanctions. So we give the \nPresident the hammer that I think is necessary and that so many have \ntalked about here.\n  Syria is a bad actor in the region. It is part of the ``axis of \nevil,'' in my opinion. It is a country that sponsors terrorism, that \nsupports terrorism, that encourages terrorism, not only against \nAmerican interests, not only against Israel, but it is occupying, \nthrough setting up these terrorist organizations, as well as their own \nmilitary force, what was a very moderate and progressive Arab country, \nLebanon.\n  That is a heinous act, and I find it somewhat remarkable that the \nrest of the Arab world does not continue to condemn it and do what we \ndo: try to ratchet up the pressure on Syria to get\n\n[[Page S14407]]\n\nout of Lebanon, to allow the people in Lebanon to determine their own \ngovernment and to freely elect people who could serve the best \ninterests of the Lebanese people, not the dictator in Damascus.\n  So we have, really, a purpose beyond our national security interest, \nalthough I would argue that a free and prosperous Lebanon--and given \nthe history of that country, and being a bridge between the Middle East \nand West--that would be a very stabilizing presence in the Middle East, \nto have a country with a democratically elected government, and not \nbeing the threat Lebanon now poses, not because of the people \nthemselves but because of the terrorists who reside in southern \nLebanon, because of the other heinous acts that are conducted by the \nterrorist groups based in Lebanon that they project throughout the \nworld.\n\n  This is a very important issue for national security. It is a very \nimportant issue for the peace in the Middle East.\n  I am very gratified that the Senate could come to a conclusion on \nthis bill and bring it to the floor of the Senate and have it pass on a \nday when we honor our veterans, as we should. We had people fight and \nlose their lives in Lebanon, and they did so bravely and courageously. \nBut I have to say, it was not one of the proudest moments for me as an \nAmerican to see our troops withdraw from Lebanon and not stay there to \nfight another day, with the oppression Syria was imposing upon that \ncountry.\n  This is a chance for us to begin the process of reengaging in \nLebanon, reengaging the Syrians who have been nothing but trouble and \nfomenting trouble throughout the Middle East and being disruptive of \nthe peace process in the Middle East.\n  I say to the Senator from Indiana, thank you for the time. Thank you \nfor your willingness to bring this bill to the floor and to move this \nbill forward.\n  I will enter into a colloquy with Senator Boxer to discuss our desire \nand our hope that the President not immediately think about waiving \nthese provisions; that he think carefully about any kind of waiver; \nthat we try to impose some sanctions and send a message. Given the \nactivities of the Syrians in the Middle East and the activities of \nSyria in Iraq, it is such an important and relevant discussion, that \nthe President use these sanctions that are available to him for him to \ndo so.\n  Mr. President, I wish to enter into a colloquy with my colleague, \nSenator Boxer of California, concerning the waiver authority extended \nto the President for the sanctions contained in the Syria \nAccountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act of 2003.\n  Mr. President, as the original cosponsor of the Syria Accountability \nand Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act of 2003, I want to clarify the \nbill's intent with the original sponsors, Senator Boxer. Is it the \nSenator's understanding that--given the seriousness of the charges \nagainst the Syrian regime and the fact that the highest levels of the \nU.S. Government have already made it clear that there will be \nconsequences to the Syrians if there is no change in their behavior--\nthe national security waiver contained in the bill is meant to address \nonly those circumstances where United States national security \ninterests are indeed severely threatened?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, that is my clear understanding and the clear intent \nof the legislation. The bill lays out in great detail the serious \nthreat Syrian actions pose to United States interests. Our expectation \nis that, unless the President can make the certification described in \nsection 5, subsection (d) of the bill, he must impose sanctions on the \nSyrian Government. The national security waiver was only included to \naddress currently unforeseen instances where U.S. national security \ninterests would truly be threatened should such sanctions go forward. \nWe expect the President to use the waiver only for such exceptional \ncircumstances, and not on a routine basis as a way to circumvent \ncongressional intent as so clearly expressed in the Syria \nAccountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act of 2003.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2148\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Indiana [Mr. Lugar], for himself, Mrs. \n     Boxer, and Mr. Santorum, proposes an amendment numbered 2148.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n           (Purpose: To make technical and other corrections)\n\n       On page 2, strike lines 8 through 15.\n       On page 9, strike lines 21 through 24.\n       On page 15, line 1, strike ``will be held responsible'' and \n     insert ``should bear responsibility''.\n       On page 15, beginning on line 6, strike ``shall impede \n     Syria's ability'' and insert ``will work to deny Syria the \n     ability''.\n       On page 15, strike lines 18 through 20.\n       On page 16, line 17, insert after ``citizen in Iraq'' the \n     following: ``if the Government of Syria is found to be \n     responsible''.\n       On page 18, strike lines 15 through 20 and insert the \n     following:\n       (b) Waiver.--The President may waive the application of \n     subsection (a)(1), (a)(2), or both if the President \n     determines that it is in the national security interest of \n     the United States to do so and submits to the appropriate \n     congressional committees a report containing the reasons for \n     the determination.\n       On page 20, beginning on line 6, strike ``withdrawn all \n     Syrian military, intelligence, and other security personnel \n     from Lebanon'' and insert ``ended its occupation of Lebanon \n     described in section 2(7) of this Act''.\n       On page 21, beginning on line 15, strike ``the attacks \n     against the United States that occurred on September 11, \n     2001, and other''.\n       On page 21, beginning on line 20, strike ``given the \n     recognition that Hizbullah is equally or more capable than al \n     Qaeda'' and insert ``and other terrorist organizations \n     supported by Syria''.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2148) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Chair. I now yield time to the Senator from \nKansas, Mr. Brownback.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, Senator Lugar, who does such an outstanding job on \nso many issues and really is a national treasure for us on \ninternational affairs and international issues, for allowing me \nrecognition to speak on this bill. I thank the cosponsors, Senators \nSantorum and Boxer, for their work in bringing this issue in front of \nthe body. I urge its passage.\n  I urge usage of the Syria Accountability Act by the President. \nSeveral of these issues have already been covered. I wish to address \nthem with some specificity by saying 43 and counting--43 and counting. \nThat is the number of dictatorships that are left in the world. There \nwere 45 at the start of this year. Two have changed over. Dramatic \nchanges are taking place in some other countries. But there are 43 \ndictatorships.\n  One of the harshest is Syria. It is a state sponsor of terrorism, one \nof five countries in the world that we recognize is a state sponsor of \nterrorism. We are facing terrorists coming from Syria on a daily basis \nin Iraq. You can hardly visit with any of our leadership working on the \nissue of Iraq and bringing democracy to that country without hearing \nthem talking about foreign terrorists coming into Iraq. The largest \npercentage of those is coming through Syria. Another percentage is \ncoming from Iran, which is another country that needs to go through a \ndemocratic metamorphosis and become a democracy. Iran is not a \ndemocracy today. We need to confront that.\n  We need to confront, for the safety of our troops, these foreign \nterrorists coming in from Syria who are being sponsored by the Syrian \nGovernment.\n  We know for some period of time Syria has sponsored Hezbollah, one of \nthe leading terrorist organizations in the world, certainly very active \nin the Middle East, active in Lebanon, active in Israel, active, it \nappears, in support of going into Iraq. We know the historical legacy \nof Syria associated with Iraq and the Baathist Party regime that \ncontrolled both countries. It did control Iraq; it doesn't now. It is a \nruthless, dictatorial, Stalinesque type of organization. They use \npolitical prisoners, torture, all sorts of means to\n\n[[Page S14408]]\n\nmaintain control by the Baathist leadership. The Syria Baathist \nleadership is the same sort of leadership we saw in Iraq. They are a \nbad lot. It is time we put pressure on Syria to change.\n  President Bush last week made a beautiful speech to the National \nEndowment for Democracy calling for democracy throughout the world and \nsaying that is the natural state of mankind, to be free and at liberty. \nYet we see a dearth of liberty and freedom throughout much of the \nMiddle East, particularly in countries such as Syria.\n  I hope the President will use the Syria Accountability Act to bring \ngreater pressure on the dictators in Damascus, on bringing them a clear \npoint that we will not tolerate this use of terrorism; we will not \ntolerate their attacks on our troops; that we will not tolerate a \nregime that is a dictatorship; that the people of Syria deserve better. \nThe people of Lebanon deserve better than to be minding the dictator \npaymasters that exist in Damascus. The President really needs to use \nthis power that is being given by the Congress to the administration \nfor these sanctions in Syria.\n  I urge that we pass this act. I urge the President to use these \nsanctions. And I urge us to use all the means at our disposal to \ntighten the noose around the leadership of the dictators in Damascus. \nWhat they are doing in Syria, what they are allowing to flow out of \ntheir country, that would stop. This is one of the few countries left \nin the world that continues to be state sponsors of terrorism on a very \naggressive basis. It must stop. We must show resolve in that.\n  I state my support for the bill and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nKansas for his important argument.\n  How much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Chair.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum, with the time to be counted \nagainst the side of the opposition to the bill as opposed to our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, there have been consecutive Republican \nspeeches on this amendment. We will be prepared to recognize the \ndistinguished Senator from California. She will ask for her own \nrecognition, but we hope she will have an opportunity to speak at this \npoint.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, under the order, I have how much time \nremaining on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 18 minutes 24 seconds left for \nSenator Biden's designee.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Does the Senator from Illinois wish to make a few \ncomments? How much time does he need?\n  I yield 5 minutes to my friend from Illinois, and then I will use the \nremainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from California.\n  Mr. President, I rise as a cosponsor in strong support of the Syria \nAccountability Act.\n  Syria plays a key role in the Mideast region and it could play a \nconstructive role, but all too often, it has not.\n  After September 11, Syria offered to share information that could \nhelp in the U.S. fight against terrorists. It joined us in the first \nGulf War to oust Saddam Hussein from Kuwait in 1991, and it joined in \npeace negotiations with Israel in the 1990s. But Syria has taken steps \nand pursued policies that have undermined regional peace and damaged \nU.S. interests.\n  Syria was opposed to the US invasion of Iraq and it certainly has a \nright to that opinion but Syria has not taken robust action to keep \nforeign fighters from crossing its borders to fight Americans.\n  Syria objects to the U.S. occupation of Iraq, but has itself occupied \nLebanon since 1976. More than 20,000 Syrian troops and police occupy \nmuch of Lebanon, dominating its politics and government and undermining \nits independence.\n  Syria harbors terrorists that promote and organize violence, \nundermining hope and progress for a comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace \nsettlement.\n  Hizballah, Hamas, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, \nand the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command \nhave offices, maintain training camps, and other facilities on Syrian \nterritory and operate in areas of Lebanon occupied by the Syrian army, \nsuch as the Beqaa Valley. Some of these groups, Hizballah in \nparticular, receive supplies from Iran through Syria.\n  The people of Syria are repressed, ruled by a small ethnic minority \nin a police state. There is no freedom of speech, no political freedom, \nand no freedom to dissent. The Syrian regime is also run by the Ba'ath \nParty, but split from Saddam Hussein's branch of this party.\n  The President has recently spoken about how badly the Middle East \nneeds an infusion of democracy. He has argued that, despite the fact \nthat the United States has found no weapons of mass destruction in \nIraq, this country's war was justified because of the repressive nature \nof that regime.\n  I agree wholeheartedly with the President that one of the most \nimportant things that this country can do to fight terrorism is to \npromote democracy in the Middle East.\n  The lack of democracy in many Middle Eastern countries has led \ndirectly to Islamic extremism. There are almost no outlets for \npolitical expression in a region filled with kings, emirs, and \nrubberstamp parliaments--except at the mosque.\n  It is no accident that most of the terrorists were originally from \ncountries that do not allow dissent or meaningful political \nparticipation.\n  I, for one, do not believe this nation can remove every dictator and \nrepressive regime. We cannot impose democracy from the other end of an \nM-16.\n  Mideast countries will not become models of democracy and openness \novernight. But we must look to a longer term future where we call on \nthem to embark on a ``soft-landing'' towards a more democratic future.\n  The bill we consider today, the Syria Accountability Act, will send a \nstrong message of disapproval to Syria regarding its actions supporting \nterrorism, undermining regional peace, repressing its people, and \nundermining the independence of Lebanon. It will send those messages \nshort of going to war.\n  The bill will broaden U.S. sanctions against Syria unless the \nPresident certifies that Syria does not support terrorism; that it has \nwithdrawn its military, intelligence, and security personnel from \nLebanon; stopped developing ballistic missiles and chemical and \nbiological weapons; and that it is no longer in violation of UN \nSecurity Council resolutions. The bill allows the President to waive \nsanctions if he believes waiving them would be in the interests of U.S. \nnational security.\n  I believe that Syria could play a constructive role in bringing peace \nto the region, ending the scourge of terrorism, and take its place as a \nregional leader. Syria and the United States could enjoy strong and \ngrowing relations. The bill we pass today will hold Syria accountable \nfor its actions and send a strong message that Syria must change.\n  Syria has a great opportunity to decide whether it will be part of \nthe family of civilized nations dedicated to self-government, dedicated \nto the principles of equality, and dedicated to peace in the region, or \nSyria can turn a different course. There has been ample evidence of I \nguess the experience we have had in Syria to suggest they have decided \nto chart a course that is not consistent with those values.\n  After September 11, Syria was one of the first to come to our side \nand say they would help us fight terrorism in the world. I had a chance \nto visit that nation and its leader shortly thereafter. He expressed \ncondolences for our losses in the United States and pledged support in \nour effort to end terrorism.\n  Sadly, the accumulated evidence since that date does not suggest \nSyria has made the real commitment we\n\n[[Page S14409]]\n\nneed, not only for the sake of ending terrorism in our country but for \nthe sake of ending terrorism in the world. In fact, too many times \nSyria has been on the wrong side of history in the past and the current \nday.\n  This Syria Accountability Act basically says to Syria they will be \nheld accountable for their conduct. Frankly, we understand that today \nDamascus, Syria, is the international headquarters for a variety of \nterrorist groups. That is totally unacceptable.\n  The President was right when he said we are opposed to not only \nterrorists, but those who harbor and support them. Syria has to take \nthose words to heart, and this act is a measure that needs to be passed \nby Congress and signed into law by the President so Syria understands \nthe importance of the role it plays in the Middle East and how closely \nit will be watched.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am very pleased we are going to vote on \nthe Syria Accountability bill, a bill I first introduced with Senator \nSantorum in April of 2002. It has had a very bumpy ride. I am glad the \nride will soon end smoothly; at least that is my sense.\n  On April 18, 2002, with a list of 45 cosponsors, I introduced this \nbill with Senator Santorum.\n  On that day, I said:\n\n       We cannot afford to rest for one second in pursuing those \n     who believe that purposely killing innocent civilians is a \n     legitimate means to political ends. We cannot give \n     concessions to terrorists nor can we reward them by giving \n     into their demands. This will only lead to more terror.\n\n  With that, Senator Santorum and I introduced the Syria Accountability \nAct because we knew at that time--and we know today--that by a variety \nof means the Government of Syria is supporting terrorist groups. It \nneeds to end.\n  In the 108th Congress, May 1, 2003, now with a total of 81 \ncosponsors, we introduced our bill again and at that time we said:\n\n       If we are serious about peace in the Middle East and a \n     cessation of terrorism here at home, then we must confront \n     the Government of Syria in a way that will not lead to war \n     but to a diffusing of tensions and a more peaceful world.\n\n  The administration opposed our bill very strongly. In fact, Secretary \nPowell came before the Foreign Relations Committee and when Senator \nLugar and Senator Biden said to him, do you support or oppose the Syria \nAccountability Act, Secretary Powell said it would not be helpful to \npass it.\n  I did not agree with him then and I do not agree with him now. When \nSecretary Powell went to see the head of Syria, what was one of the \nfirst things he said to him? He said, you ought to shape up because \nthere is a bill in the Senate, the Syria Accountability Act, and those \nfolks over there are serious.\n  It proved my point that, in fact, for us to be tough on terrorism \ngives the State Department the backup they need. I think, frankly, it \nwill be very helpful for us to pass this bill today.\n  Now, the administration has moved off their opposition and they are \nneutral on this bill. They are neither for it nor against it. The good \nnews is, the leaders of the Foreign Relations Committee, finally I \nthink, have decided that maybe Boxer and Santorum have been on the \nright track. So this is a very big day for us because we have gone \nthrough a pretty tough legislative ride. We did not get hearings in the \ncommittee. We could not move it.\n  In addition to Senator Santorum, my original cosponsor of this, I do \nwant to thank Senator Byrd, who made suggestions to perfect our bill, \nSenator Lugar who worked with Senator Byrd and others, Senator Biden, \nwho agreed to let this come up in an expedited fashion, and over on the \nHouse side Representatives Eliot Engel and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen helped \nus quite a bit in moving this bill.\n  So it is, in fact, a day that is important. What we are basically \nsaying in our bill is that if Syria does not shape up they are going to \nface sanctions from this Government. If Syria does not stop supporting \nterrorism, if Syria does not stop the development of weapons of mass \ndestruction, if Syria does not end its occupation of Lebanon and cease \nsupport for the terrorists operating in Iraq, they are going to face a \nseries of escalating sanctions.\n  The fact is that we have 81 cosponsors--and I see Senator Santorum on \nthe floor now. He worked his side of the aisle, I have worked mine, and \nwe were able to really get these cosponsorships up. On October 15, the \nHouse passed its version of the bill 398 to 4. So I have to say we are \non to something.\n  Let me say from the bottom of my heart what I think we are on to. We \nare on to the premise that the truth shall set you free. We cannot have \nrelationships with Syria and close our eyes to the truth, and the truth \nis that Syria is, in fact, supporting terrorism in ways that are very \nclear. They are a major supporter of Hezbollah, an international \nterrorist organization that has carried out numerous attacks against \nAmericans and Israeli civilian targets. They have operated freely in \nthe Syrian-controlled Beqaa Valley in Lebanon over the past 20 years. \nOther terrorist groups such as Hamas, the Popular Front for the \nLiberation of Palestine, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of \nPalestine-General Command all maintain offices, training camps, and \nother facilities inside Syria or in areas of Lebanon under Syrian \ncontrol.\n  Anyone who has traveled to the region knows that one of the saddest \nstories in the world is the story of Lebanon and how its people have \nlost any control over their own destiny. As we fight for democracy in \nthe world, we have to remember that. This was a country at one point \nthat was absolutely considered the Paris in the Middle East, and it has \nreally been lost because it has been taken over in a hostile takeover, \nI might say, by the power of Syria.\n\n  So all of these issues, getting Syria to turn its back on terrorism \nand not allow these organizations to operate within their borders, \nSyria allowing the Lebanese people to have a life of freedom and \ndemocracy or at least self-determination, however they determine it, \nthese are issues that are crucial. As long as they keep up the status \nquo, the goal of Middle East peace is quite elusive.\n  Twenty thousand Syrian troops and security personnel continue to \noccupy Lebanon and again, as I said, undermine its political \nindependence. It is a direct violation of U.N. Security Council \nResolution 520. What does that say? That resolution calls for strict \nrespect of the sovereignty, territorial integrity, unity, and political \nindependence of Lebanon.\n  We also know that Syria is developing weapons that are very \ndangerous, and that they are not doing enough to prevent terrorists \nfrom entering into Iraq. In fact, the terrorist who was attempting to \nblow up an Iraqi police station was found to be carrying a Syrian \npassport.\n  This has to stop. Nations must be held accountable for the \nproliferation of terrorism and they must be held accountable if they \nare not doing all they can to pursue Middle East peace or at least \nallow that peace to take place.\n  So this legislation has taken a bumpy road. When Senator Santorum and \nI got together to work on it, people said that is quite a combination. \nThey said if those two can get together on anything, eventually we know \nwe are going to win.\n  It has taken us almost 2 years but we could not be happier. We want \nto thank the 80 other Senators who are cosponsors of this bill. We, \nagain, thank Senators Lugar and Biden for allowing this bill to come \ndirectly to the floor today. We think it is a historic day.\n  Our goal is to prevent war and to lay out markers for Syria. We do \nnot want to go to war with Syria. We just want to say, in a truthful \nway, these are the things that you have been doing wrong. Please meet \nthese markers. Help us. Help us in the world. If you don't, we are \ngoing to have some sanctions and they are spelled out. I think others \nhave spelled them out. The idea behind this bill is to avoid a \nconfrontation and instead have a relationship that is respectful \nbetween our two nations. I think today we will go a long way to that \nend.\n  I believe all my time is used up at this point so I will yield the \nfloor and I hope we will be voting shortly on this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I will take this occasion to tell the \nSenate that today we celebrate the birthday of\n\n[[Page S14410]]\n\nthe distinguished Senator from California. Senator Boxer is a year \nyounger. This is an excellent day for her to offer this legislation, \nand we commend and thank the Senator.\n  I yield such time as he may consume to the Senator from Oregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I join the chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee in wishing a happy birthday to Senator Boxer. I \nalso thank Senator Boxer and Senator Santorum for their tenaciousness \nin advancing this bill. It is long overdue and it is to be celebrated \nby all of us.\n  Senator Lugar, Senator Biden, and the Foreign Relations Committee \nhave worked this bill into a condition where we can bring it to the \nfloor, giving the President sufficient discretion, and make clear that \nwe will continue to engage in diplomacy with the Syrians but we are \ngoing to do it on a more realistic basis, a basis that has \nconsequences, a basis that deals with facts, not fantasy, and truly \nmakes progress in the Middle East.\n  It is a matter of historical record that for a long time, several \ndecades now, the Syrians have occupied the nation of Lebanon, their \nsmaller neighbor to their west. In the course of that, whatever their \nmotives were for going in, they have stayed there for gain. They have \ndenied democracy to the Lebanese people, they have denied them self-\ndetermination, and they have been responsible for keeping the breach \nand the wound alive in Lebanon.\n  But as it relates to this bill, I also have to take note of the fact \nit is Veterans Day. We thank our veterans. We celebrate our veterans. \nWe owe them a great debt.\n  As we think of yesterday's veterans, I am reminded of today's \nveterans, many of whom, from the State of Oregon, are in Iraq now and \nwho are in harm's way for the cause of American liberty and the safety \nof the American people and our allies in the ongoing war on terrorism. \nThe truth is, much that is aimed at them today comes from Syria. It \ncomes from car bombers holding Syrian passports. Indeed, just the other \nday we learned the car bomb that was interdicted and the person pulled \nout of the car that was filled with explosives was from Syria. Syria \nmaintains a porous border with Iraq that simply cannot remain as it is \nbecause if it does, it will mean the death of more of our soldiers. We \nwant them home and we want them safe.\n  There is more than a porous border that concerns me with Syria. It is \nthe fact that Syria provides a safe harbor, indeed a safe haven, a \nheaven, if you will, for terrorists. For those who conspire to murder \non a massive scale, Syria gives them a place to stay, gives them \nprotection, and a place to hide their money and their weapons before \nthey can bring them into conflict with American soldiers. Who knows \nwhat also may be there from the arsenals of Saddam Hussein. Who knows \nwhat weapons of mass destruction may even be there as well.\n  All of this needs to end. Our President needs to have the tools, the \ndiplomatic tools necessary to prosecute the case with Syria in a way \nthat gets us beyond the status quo because the status quo is \nunacceptable and the status quo is deadly and the status quo has to be \nover. I join with Republicans and Democrats alike today in urging \npassage of the Syria Accountability Act, for the sake of our country, \nfor the sake of the Middle East, for the sake of Muslims, for the sake \nof Jews, for the sake of Christians, and all who have suffered much.\n  The road to Damascus has brought so much murder, so much conspiracy, \nso much weaponry, so much blood money that has been used against the \npeace process and those who are the advocates of a peaceful resolution \nin the Middle East.\n  It is a matter of Scriptural record that a man named Saul on the road \nto Damascus once saw an awful lot of light, changed his way, and even \nchanged his name. We know him today as the Apostle Paul. What we need \nnow on the road to Damascus is a lot more light because all we have \nbeen getting is so much darkness. We need a new beginning with Syria. \nThe President needs a new authority against Syria. This bill is crafted \nin a way that is helpful diplomatically so we can avoid hostilities. \nBut let us have the courage in this war on terrorism to go where the \nfacts take us. Let us all pray it does not take us down the road to \nDamascus, but we have to be realistic.\n  This bill is a very good start. I urge the Senate to adopt it today \nby a very large margin.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am voting for the Syria Accountability \nAct because I believe it is important to call attention to Syria's \ncontinuing military occupation of Lebanon in violation of international \nlaw, and its support for terrorist organizations, including Hezbollah, \nthat are responsible for ongoing, deadly incursions into Israel.\n  It is well established that the Syrian Government rules through fear \nand repression. Torture by Syrian security forces is routine. The \ndenial of basic human rights has been widely documented. We should \ncondemn these policies.\n  And there are allegations that Syria supplied Iraqi forces with \nmilitary equipment, which the Secretary of Defense has described as \nhostile acts against the United States.\n  The United States is justified in seeking to apply political and \neconomic pressure on Syria in an effort to change its policies. That \nsaid, there are some aspects of this legislation that I do not support, \nand I want to take a moment to discuss them as I do not want there to \nbe any misunderstanding about my vote. Most importantly, I do not want \nmy vote for this legislation to be cited as an endorsement for military \naction against Syria.\n  For examples, Section 4, entitled ``Statement of Policy,'' says that \nit is the policy of the United State that ``the United States shall \nimpede Syria's ability to support acts of international terrorism and \nefforts to develop or acquire weapons of mass destruction.'' I doubt \nthat anyone disagrees that we should try to do that. But by what means? \nWill support for this legislation be cited at some point in the future \nby the administration, or others, as a green light for launching a \nunilateral, military attack to ``impede Syria's ability to support acts \nof international terrorism?'' That is precisely what was done by the \nWhite House when it cited resolutions passed a decade ago to justify a \nunilateral attack against Iraq years later, even though that was not \nwhat many, if any of us who supported those resolutions intended at the \ntime. Over and over again, the administration, in an effort to justify \ntheir precipitous use of force against Iraq, cited passage of the Iraq \nLiberation Act in 1998 as evidence that Congress supported the \noverthrow of Saddam Hussein in 2003. What the administration kept \nomitting in numerous public statements is that one section of that act \nmade clear that nothing in the act was to be construed as authorizing \nthe use of U.S. military force against Iraq. I am concerned that the \nSyria Accountability Act could be distorted in a similar way. I do not \nsupport military action against Syria, and I am in no way endorsing \nsuch action by voting for this legislation today.\n  The same can be said of the statement that it is the policy of the \nUnited States that ``efforts against Hezbollah will be expanded given \nthe recognition that Hezbollah is equally or more capable than al \nQaeda.'' First, I do not know if it is true that Hezbollah is ``equally \nor more capable than al Qaeda.'' Perhaps it is. I don't know, and I \ndoubt the authors of this legislation can be certain that it is, \nespecially given the difficulties we have had in obtaining \nreliable information about these organizations. In any event, while I \nmight support expanded efforts against Hezbollah, it would depend on \nwhat those efforts are. For example, I am not in favor of sending U.S. \ntroops to Lebanon to engage in combat against Hezbollah. I do not want \nmy vote today to be construed as supporting any expanded efforts \nagainst Hezbollah regardless of what they might be.\n\n  Similarly, the legislation states that it is United States policy \nthat ``Syria will be held accountable for any harm to Coalition armed \nforces or to any U.S. citizens in Iraq if the Government of Syria is \nfound to be responsible due to its facilitation of terrorist activities \nand its shipments of military supplies to Iraq.'' Syria should be held \naccountable. But in what way? The legislation, once again, is silent. \nMy support for efforts to hold Syria accountable, should\n\n[[Page S14411]]\n\nthe evidence warrant it, depends on what those efforts are.\n  Finally, the legislation says that it is the policy of the united \nStates that ``the United States will not provide any assistance to \nSyria and will oppose multilateral assistance for Syria until Syria \nends all support for terrorism, withdraws it armed forces from Lebanon, \nand halts the development and deployment of weapons of mass destruction \nand medium- and long-range surface-to-surface ballistic missiles.'' We \nall want Syria to do those things, and I am not in favor of providing \nassistance to the Syrian Government. But this legislation goes farther. \nIt purports to cut off any assistance to the Syrian people, even \nthrough private voluntary organizations. I do not believe in punishing \nthe citizens of a country simply because their government is corrupt or \nabusive, so I have concerns about this provision.\n  There are also aspects of Section 5 of the legislation, entitled \n``Penalties and Authorization,'' which concern me. For example, among \nthe sanctions that the President could impose are a prohibition on U.S. \nbusinesses from investing or operating in Syria. It is not obvious to \nme how this will penalize the Syrian Government, but it will hurt U.S. \nbusinesses. While the record is mixed, there are examples of U.S. \nbusinesses contributing to social, economic and even political change \nin other repressive countries.\n  Of more concern is that the legislation encourages the President to \nreduce U.S. diplomatic contacts with Syria. I am uneasy with this \napproach, as I believe we should consider expanding our diplomacy and \npeople-to-people contacts with Syria. It is in our interest to promote \ndialogue with a country with which we have such profound differences, \nand which poses a military threat to Israel. Reducing those contacts \ncould further misunderstanding and exacerbate tensions between us. It \nis also worth mentioning that after the September 11 attacks, Syria \nreportedly cooperated with the United States in intelligence sharing \nabout al-Qaida.\n  I do not believe this legislation will persuade Syria to do any of \nthe things we want it to do. I am aware that the Administration has \nopposed it in the past. This legislation seems to start us down a road \nof intensifying tensions between the U.S. and Syria without a clear end \ngame other than invading Syria, which I do not support and I doubt many \nother Senators support. However, I agree that Syria's support for \nterrorism and its violations of human rights deserve condemnation, and \nI will vote for this legislation with the caveats I have mentioned.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I do not support the passage of the \nSyrian Accountability Act. The situation in the Middle East is a \ndelicate one. It calls for subtle, creative diplomacy as the United \nStates seeks to support its troops in Iraq, promote the Arab-Israeli \npeace process, and combat terrorism.\n  While I agree with the goals of the Syrian Accountability Act, I am \nconcerned that this legislation will undermine our ability to achieve \nthose goals. In particular, I am opposed to the act's provisions that \nwould mandate the imposition of new sanctions against Syria. I believe \nthat these provisions would tie this or any future administration's \nhands in a way that will make the conduct of our foreign policy more \ndifficult. A number of sanctions already exist against Syria by virtue \nof its designation as a state sponsor of terrorism. In addition, the \nPresident already has the authority to impose many of the sanctions set \nforth in this act. If we are to promote peace in the region and move \nSyria in a more positive direction, the United States must pursue an \napproach that is more nuanced and flexible than what is called for in \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Syria \nAccountability Act, of which I am a proud cosponsor of the Senate \ncompanion. Syria is listed by the State Department as a state sponsor \nof terrorism, and yet fewer U.S. sanctions apply to Syria than to any \nother country on the list. This Act will authorize a range of sanctions \nagainst Syria, prohibiting exports to Syria of dual-use items and \nrequiring the President to choose from a set of other sanctions, \nincluding prohibitions on exports of most U.S. goods to Syria and on \nAmerican investment in Syria, restrictions on Syrian diplomats in the \nUnited States and on U.S. diplomatic contacts with Syria, prohibitions \non Syrian aircraft in the United States, and blocking of transactions \nin Syrian government property.\n  These sanctions are appropriate, and, in my view, long overdue. \nDespite recent U.S. efforts to engage in dialogue with Syria, Damascus \nhas refused to renounce its support for terrorism. It provides \nterrorist organizations with political and material support. It has \nturned away from negotiations with Israel. And it continues to occupy \nsouthern Lebanon, where its forces destabilize the Middle East by \nsupporting Hezbollah and undermining Lebanese sovereignty.\n  Syria acts as the safe haven for a broad array of terrorist \norganizations and Palestinian groups committed to the destruction of \nIsrael. Hezbollah, Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the Popular Front \nfor the Liberation of Palestine, and the Popular Front for the \nLiberation of Palestine-General Command are all active in Damascus. The \nSyrian government has not only refused to sever ties with these \norganizations; it has defended their use of Syrian territory to \ndisseminate propaganda that attacks Israel, thereby undermining efforts \nto bring peace to the region. Worse, the offices maintained by these \ngroups provide operational support for terrorist activities, \nnotwithstanding the Syrian government's claims that they are engaged \nonly in political and informational activities. These activities \ninclude the deadly and despicable suicide bombings, conducted by Hamas \nand Palestinian Islamic Jihad, against civilians in Israel.\n  Syria is also a supporter of Hezbollah, which is responsible for the \nkilling of hundreds of Americans and is one of the biggest obstacles to \nour efforts to combat global terrorism. Throughout much of southern \nLebanon, occupying Syrian forces support and protect Hezbollah, \nallowing it to deploy thousands of rockets that threaten Israel and \ndestabilize the region, and to launch attacks against civilian targets \nin Israel civilian areas. Syria also permits Hezbollah to receive \nassistance from Iran.\n  The Syrian occupation of Lebanon represents a long-standing threat to \nstability in the Middle East. While Syria has reduced its forces in \nrecent years, it still maintains as many as 20,000 troops and security \npersonnel in Lebanon. In addition to harboring Hezbollah, those forces \nexert undue influence in Lebanon and prevent the Lebanese government \nfrom deploying its own troops to southern Lebanon, as required by U.N. \nSecurity Council Resolution 520. It is long past time for Syrian forces \nto withdraw from Lebanon and for Lebanon to cease to be a refuge for \nterrorist organizations, including Hezbollah.\n  Syria has not moderated its unrelenting hostility to Israel, nor has \nit demonstrated a commitment to negotiations. Moreover, it has used its \nposition on the world stage and within the Arab world to undermine \nefforts to bring peace and stability to the region. As a frequent \nsponsor of U.N. resolutions related to the conflict in the Middle East, \nSyria has consistently promoted a perspective that castigates Israeli \nsecurity measures without condemning the terrorist threat faced by \nIsrael.\n  While I have long supported this act and welcome its passage, I \nbelieve that our ability to influence Syria's behavior and deter its \nsupport for terrorism also requires a multilateral strategy. The effect \nof this act will unfortunately be limited by the lack of support for \nsanctions against Syria among our friends and allies. It is critical \nthat the administration demonstrate global leadership on this issue as \nwell as other aspects of the war on terrorism. By reaching out to the \ninternational community and by appealing to our common interest in \ncurtailing global terrorism and achieving peace in the Middle East, we \ncan ensure that the sanctions we are imposing today are truly \neffective.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Since September 11, the bar for assistance in our war \nagainst terrorism has been raised, and the Syrian Government is no \nlonger entitled to a free pass. The United States must no longer allow \nSyria to get away with taking with the right hand what it gives with \nthe left.\n\n[[Page S14412]]\n\n  Unfortunately, the Government of Syria remains an obstacle to peace \nin Iraq, settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict--indeed, Syria \nhas rebuffed repeated Israeli offers to make peace between Israel and \nSyria--democratic development and sovereignty for the Lebanese people, \nregional security, and the protection of human rights of the Syrian \npeople themselves.\n  There is no doubt that Syria actively supports international \nterrorism. The evidence supporting this contention is overwhelming:\n  The U.S. State Department has certified Syria on its list of state \nsponsors of terrorism continuously since the 1970s. Syria's dubious \ncompany on this list includes Hussein's Iraq, Iran, Libya, North Korea, \nand Communist Cuba.\n  Syria provides material support and safe haven to numerous \ninternational terrorist groups, including Hezbollah, Hamas, the Popular \nFront for the Liberation of Palestine, and Islamic Jihad.\n  Syria allows terrorist groups to maintain training camps on Syrian \nsoil. Indeed, in October, after a terrorist bombing in Haifa, Israel \nretaliated against a known Islamic Jihad terrorist training camp near \nDamascus.\n  Syrian-controlled southern Lebanon is a haven for anti-Israel \nterrorists and a staging ground for terrorist rocket attacks against \nNorthern Israel.\n  Syria has facilitated the transfer of military equipment from Iran to \nterrorists operating in Syria-controlled Lebanon.\n  Syria maintains a robust chemical weapons program, raising the risk \nthat Syria could transfer such weapons to terrorists.\n  In addition to Syria's long-time efforts to support the deadly aims \nof international terrorist groups, its government has played a \ndecidedly unhelpful role in regional security. Most notably, the Syrian \nGovernment illegally collaborated with the Hussein regime to circumvent \nUnited Nations resolutions and has worked to undermine Iraqi democracy \nin the wake of the liberation of that country.\n  Although Syria voted for the recent U.N. resolution on Iraq, \nostensibly expressing its support for the reconstruction of a free and \ndemocratic Iraq, Syria has used nearly every other opportunity to \nundermine the American-led coalition's efforts to liberate the people \nof that country from the brutal reign of Saddam Hussein. Furthermore, \nrecent media reports indicate that Syria may have accepted and hidden \nHussein's weapons of mass destruction before the U.S.-led invasion.\n  In addition, there are credible reports that Syria provided material \nsupport to Iraqi troops during the war and currently provides safe \nhaven to former Hussein regime officials and loyalists. U.S. \ninvestigators have located $3 billion hidden by the Hussein regime in \nSyrian banks, and Syria has refused to return this money to its \nrightful owners: the people of Iraq.\n  During the 1990s, Syria repeatedly defied U.N. sanctions against Iraq \nby participating in enormous black market purchases of oil from the \nSaddam Hussein regime. The proceeds from these sales directly supported \nHussein's military regime and opulent lifestyle.\n  Syria has not acted sufficiently to curb cross-border movement of \nforeign terrorists, including a significant number of Syrian nationals, \ninto Iraq. Indeed, in some circumstances, the Syrian Government appears \nto have facilitated their migration to that country; Syrian passports \nhave been found in the possession of international terrorists arrested \nby the U.S. military there. These terrorists seek to wage jihad against \nAmerican troops and undermine democracy in Iraq and throughout the \nMiddle East.\n  In addition to Syria's unhelpful polices in Iraq, it remains a \nspoiler for the development of peace and democracy in Lebanon, a \ncountry it has forcibly occupied for decades. Its military occupation \nof Lebanon undermines Lebanese efforts to create a sovereign democratic \nstate and furthers instability in the region. Syria, a dictatorship, \nwields considerable political control in Lebanon, thereby distorting \nLebanon's officially democratic process and making that country a de \nfacto puppet state of the Syrian Government.\n  Unconditional U.S. engagement of Syria has failed to encourage true \nmoderation in Damascus; a new approach is necessary to encourage the \nSyrians to cooperate or face the consequences. Other Arab governments \nwho say one thing and do another--such as Egypt--would be wise to pay \nattention to the congressional debate about, and support for, the \nSyrian Accountability Act.\n  I believe the Syrian Accountability Act will give the administration \nthe tools it needs to highlight to the Syrian Government the risk of \nchoosing the wrong side in the global war against terrorism. The Syrian \nGovernment has an opportunity to reform itself, to provide its people \nwith the economic and political freedoms they seek, to end its support \nfor murderous terrorist organizations, and to become a proponent of \npeace in the Middle East.\n  If Syria's leaders decide to embark on a moderate and peaceful path, \nit will find the United States to be a benevolent and helpful ally. But \nif it continues to support international terrorism, Syria's leaders \nwill find themselves international pariahs, with fewer resources or \nfriends to help them maintain their increasingly tenuous grip on power.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nthe Syria Accountability Act of 2003, a bipartisan piece of legislation \nof which I am proud to be a cosponsor.\n  The time has come for the Senate to send a strong message to Syria \nthat its support for terrorism, its occupation of Lebanon, and its \ndevelopment of weapons of mass destruction are unacceptable and will \nnot be tolerated.\n  This legislation, introduced by my friend and colleague from \nCalifornia, Senator Boxer, and Senator Santorum provides the President \nwith maximum flexibility to target specific sanctions against Syria \nsubject to a national security waiver.\n  Specifically, it requires that sanctions be imposed on Syria unless \nthe President certifies that Syria: is not providing support for \ninternational terrorists; has withdrawn all military, intelligence, and \nother security personnel from Lebanon; has ceased the production, \ndevelopment, acquisition, or transfer of weapons of mass destruction \nand long range ballistic missiles, and; has ceased support for \nterrorist activities inside of Iraq.\n  If the President does not make such a certification, the bill \nrequires the President to prohibit the export to Syria of military \nitems and dual use technology and impose two or more sanctions from a \nlist of options including: prohibiting the export of products of the \nUnited States--other than food and medicine--to Syria; prohibiting \nUnited States businesses from investing or operating in Syria; \nrestricting the travel of Syrian diplomats in Washington, D.C. and New \nYork; and reducing diplomatic contacts with Syria.\n  I, for one, believe that sanctions should be imposed only as a last \nresort and that all avenues should be explored to change another \nstate's behavior before taking such action.\n  With regard to Syria, Congress has passed numerous resolutions \ncalling on Syria to change its ways and Republican and Democratic \nadministrations alike have made it clear that Syria's actions are \nwholly inconsistent with a peace-loving and productive member of the \ninternational community.\n  Nevertheless, words have not achieved the results we are looking for \nand as a result, we must take further substantive action.\n  Syria's behavior and actions leave a lot to be desired and have \nseverely hindered the Arab-Israeli peace process.\n  First, it continues to be listed as a state sponsor of terrorism by \nthe State Department and is reported by the Secretary of State to \nprovide ``safe haven and support to several terrorist groups'' \nincluding Hizballah, Hamas, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of \nPalestine.\n  Despite repeated calls by Secretary of State Colin Powell that Syria \ncease its support for terrorism and close the facilities and offices of \nthese groups, it has refused to do so.\n  Second, for over 20 years Syria has ignored United Nations Security \nCouncil resolutions and has failed to withdraw completely from Lebanon, \nmaintaining 20,000 troops and security personnel in that sovereign \ncountry. The presence of those troops restricts the political \nindependence of Lebanon and harms relations between Israel and Lebanon.\n\n[[Page S14413]]\n\n  Finally, Syria has continued its development and deployment of short \nand medium range ballistic missiles and biological and chemical \nweapons. It has not signed the Chemical Weapons Convention and has one \nof the largest missile inventories in the Middle East. It is reported \nto have three production facilities for chemical weapons and has a \nstockpile of the nerve agent sarin.\n  In the post-September 11 world, we all understand the dangers posed \nby states who sponsor terror and seek weapons of mass destruction.\n  I had hoped that Syria would realize that it is in its best interests \nto turn a new page in its relations with the United States and the \ninternational community and cease its support for terror, withdraw from \nLebanon, and halt its pursuit of chemical and biological weapons.\n  It has not done so and it is time for the United States Senate to \nrespond. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, for decades, the United States has engaged \nthe regime in Syria in the hope that Damascus would play a constructive \nrole in bringing about Arab-Israeli peace. The U.S.-Syria relationship \nhas been ongoing despite the fact that Syria has been ruled by \ndictatorship with an uninterrupted record of support for terrorism, \nspecifically directed at Israel.\n  The results of U.S. engagement with Syria have been anything but \npositive. Throughout the years, Damascus has continued to support \ninternational terrorism directed at America and Israel, occupy Lebanon, \ndevelop a weapons-of-mass-destruction program, acquire ballistic \nmissiles, and pursue policies counter to U.S. interests.\n  Since the liberation of Iraq, Syria has played a destabilizing role \nby allowing terrorist fugitives to enter Syria and by allowing \nmercenaries to cross into Iraq--or at least not stopping them--to \nengage U.S. troops. Syria has been able to conduct its policies--which \nare antithetical to U.S. interests--with near impunity. They have \nresulted in the loss of hundreds of American lives--especially when you \nconsider the bombing of the U.S. Marine Corps barracks in Beirut in \n1983.\n  Although Syria is listed--and has been since the 1970s--by the State \nDepartment as a state sponsor of terrorism, along with Iran, Libya, \nIraq, Cuba, and North Korea, it has not faced the same degree of \ndiplomatic and economic isolation that has been directed at other \nterrorist states. In fact, Washington maintains full diplomatic \nrelations with Syria, making Syria the only designated state sponsor of \nterrorism to have such relations with the United States.\n  Syria's special treatment despite its support for terrorism should be \nover.\n  The events of September 11, 2001 have offered a window of opportunity \nto review many U.S. bilateral relationships and determine whether it is \nnecessary to change the dynamic--and often the status quo--that has \ncharacterized these relations. The administration and Congress have \ndone this most notably with Saudi Arabia in seeking greater cooperation \nin the elimination of terrorist activities operating from Saudi soil.\n  Now is also an ideal time to reassess U.S. relations with Damascus \nand demand accountability in our relationship. Equally important, it is \ntime for the Syrian leadership to make a tough choice: it is either \nwith the United States completely in the war on terrorism, or it is \nnot. Either way, shielding Syria from the same economic and political \nisolation directed at other terrorist states is unmerited and runs \ncounter to U.S. principles in the war against terrorism.\n  As Under Secretary of State John Bolton stated in testimony before \nthe House International Relations Committee on September 16, 2003, \n``Syria remains a security concern on two important counts: terrorism \nand weapons of mass destruction.'' Bolton added: There is no graver \nthreat to our country today than states that both sponsor terrorism and \npossess or aspire to possess weapons of mass destruction. Syria, which \noffers physical sanctuary and political protection to groups such as \nHezbollah, Hamas, and Palestinian Jihad, and whose terrorist operations \nhave killed hundreds of innocent people--including Americans--falls \ninto this category of state of potential dual threat.\n  Since the 1970s, the U.S. State Department has listed Syria as a \nstate sponsor of terrorism. Specifically, in its ``Patterns of Global \nTerrorism, 2002'' report, the State Department found that the Syrian \nGovernment ``has continued to provide political and limited material \nsupport to a number of Palestinian groups, including allowing them to \nmaintain headquarters or offices in Damascus,'' although the Syrian \nGovernment insists that the groups' Damascus offices undertake only \npolitical and informational activities, not terrorist operations.\n  Syria maintains close relations with Iran, another autocratic regime \nlisted by the State Department as a state sponsor of terrorism and a \nprominent financial, political, and military backer of these \nPalestinian terrorist organizations.\n  Moreover, Syria remains the de facto ruler of Lebanon, which it has \nforcibly and illegally occupied since 1990. Lebanon, the country in \nwhich more than 200 U.S. Marines died in 1983 following a terrorist \nattack on their Beirut barracks, remains a breeding ground and training \ncenter for terrorist organizations.\n  Terrorism has spawned in Syria due largely to Syria's opposition to \nthe existence of Israel and its subsequent objection to an Arab-Israeli \npeace process. Although the United States has engaged Syria--and given \nit a prominent place in discussions--during the past few decades, \nDamascus has long been an unwilling and uncooperative partner in \nbringing about Middle East peace. In fact, Syria did not endorse \nPresident Bush's Middle East ``roadmap.''\n  Syria also appears to be in the terror financing business. In April \n2003, an Italian government study found that Syria functioned as a hub \nfor an al-Qaida network that moved Islamic extremists and funds from \nItaly to northeastern Iraq, where the recruits fought alongside the \nrecently defeated Ansar al Islam terrorist group.\n  And, on October 21, it was reported that U.S. Treasury Department \ninvestigators have evidence that $3 billion that belonged to Saddam \nHussein's government is being held in Syria-controlled banks in Syria \nand Lebanon. The Syrian Government has not yet granted Treasury \nofficials access to these accounts, nor has it been willing to share \nany information about the account holders.\n  Let's review past U.S. policy toward Damascus. Despite all of Syria's \nirresponsible and threatening policies, successive U.S. administrations \nhave been willing to engage the Syrian Government. For decades, the \nUnited States has pursued a policy of engagement with Syria, trying to \nwin Damascus' support for Middle East peace but to no avail.\n  As part of this strategy, the United States has maintained full \ndiplomatic relations with Damascus. It also has allowed U.S. companies \nto invest in Syria, something that cannot be done in other terrorist-\nsponsor states such as North Korea, Iran, Cuba, and Libya.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, in 1999--the last \nyear there was reliable data available--direct investment of U.S. \ncompanies into Syria was $6 million, with 13 U.S. businesses having \noffices in Syria. While this may seem miniscule in terms of the dollar \namount, it is notable because it is tolerated at all.\n  With the death of Syrian President Hafez Assad in 2000 and the \nascendancy of his son Bashar to the presidency, there were high \nexpectations that Syria would depart from its anti-Israeli policies and \npro-terrorist support of the past and enact political and economic \nreforms, as well as become a positive influence and player in achieving \nMiddle East peace. Three years into Bashar's term, such developments \nhave not materialized--and without a catalyst to encourage such reform, \nit appears unlikely that Bashar will proactively change Syria's course.\n  We need a new approach toward Damascus. Continuation of the current \nU.S. policy toward Syria must end. For too long, it has been too \nineffective and has allowed Syria to pursue with near impunity policies \ncounter to U.S. interests. Moreover, it is unproductive and \nantithetical to the principles associated with the President's war on \nterrorism.\n  The U.S. must pressure Syria to play by the rules. Given that the \ngovernment of Syrian President Bashar al-\n\n[[Page S14414]]\n\nAssad is relatively weak, and recognizing that Bashar deemed it \nnecessary, or least desirable, to provide some assistance to the United \nStates in apprehending al-Qaida, it should be possible to pressure \nDamascus into changing its policies. That said, Washington must \ndemonstrate that it is serious about having Damascus drop its support \nof terrorism and its pursuit of policies that endanger peace and \nstability in the Middle East.\n  Therefore, to demonstrate American commitment, the United States \nshould adopt the following measures in pressuring Syria: Enact the \nSyria Accountability Act now. Among the numerous provisions contained \nin the bill, the most notable include the calls for Syria to \nimmediately and unconditionally halt support for terrorism; withdraw \nfrom Lebanon and provide for Lebanon's full restoration of sovereignty; \nhalt development of certain weapons; and enter into serious \nunconditional bilateral peace negotiations with Israel.\n  This bill also states that Syria ``should bear responsibility for \nattacks committed by Hezbollah and other terrorist groups with offices, \ntraining camps, or other facilities'' in Syria or Lebanon. Further, the \nbill states, that being in violation of key United Nations Security \nCouncil resolutions and pursuing policies which undermine international \npeace and security, ``Syria should not have been permitted to join the \nUnited Nations Security Council or serve as the Security Council's \nPresident, and should be removed from the Security Council.\n  Pursuant to the legislation, the United States is empowered to ``will \nwork to deny Syria the ability to support acts of terrorism and efforts \nto acquire weapons of mass destruction, WMD.'' In addition, the United \nStates will not provide any assistance to Syria and will oppose all \nforms of multilateral assistance to Syria until Damascus withdraws from \nLebanon and halts its pursuit of WMD and ballistic missile \naccumulation.\n  Until Syria enacts these measures, the President is required to \nprohibit: the sale of defense articles to Syria that require the \nissuance of an export license--dual-use items; U.S. businesses from \ninvesting in Syria; and export of any goods other than food and \nmedicine to Syria. Diplomatic relations also must be reduced but the \ndegree of that is not defined. The President is given waiver authority \nfor 6-month periods for all of these categories, except the export of \ndual-use items if it is determined that ``it is in the vital national \nsecurity interest'' to do so.\n  The Bush administration should apply uniformity in its policies \ntoward terrorist-sponsoring states. Therefore, the administration \nshould not allow U.S. companies to invest in Syria because it sends the \nsignal that Syria is receiving special treatment from Washington. A \nfairly dramatic reduction of U.S. diplomatic representation would \nperhaps strongly suggest to Syria that it is not an American ally and \nwill not be one until it starts acting like one.\n  Sending a strong message is key.\n  The United States should apply the proliferation security initiative, \nPSI, and sanction WMD suppliers. The administration has successfully \ndeveloped and employed a plan, known as the proliferation security \ninitiative, PSI, to interdict illicit weapons shipments and contraband. \nPSI was announced by President Bush on May 31, 2003. It involves robust \ncargo inspections and possible interdiction of WMD materials and \nillegal arms, based on pooled intelligence among participating \ncountries. To date, 11 nations form the core PSI group: Britain, \nFrance, Germany, Australia, Japan, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Poland, the \nNetherlands, and the United States. While most of the initial PSI \nactivities have focused on North Korea, attention should be paid to \nSyria--and Iran--with the goal of halting the flow of weapons \ntechnology both in and out of Syria.\n  A critical complementary strategy to PSI is using sanctions on \ncountries that supply Syria with weapons and WMD technology. The \nPeople's Republic of China, Pakistan, Russia, Iran, and North Korea are \nknown proliferators of these materials, with Russia and North Korea \nbeing key suppliers to Syria.\n  As part of a wider U.S. policy, the administration should attempt to \nconvince its PSI allies to also use sanctions against WMD suppliers.\n  In conclusion, Syria's actions in the Middle East--and in Iraq, \nspecifically pose a clear, near-term threat to regional stability and \nto the safety and security of American forces serving in the region.\n  With the removal of Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq and the defeat of \nthe Taliban regime in Afghanistan, the United States has made clear \nthat state support for terrorism will no longer be tolerated.\n  It is overdue for the United States and like-minded nations to hold \nSyria accountable for its actions. Syria's new head of state has had \nample time to make the choice whether Damascus is with the United \nStates as a partner or not in fighting the war on terrorism.\n  If Syria is not, then it should face the diplomatic and economic \nconsequences as set out in the Syria Accountability Act. As a sponsor \nof the Senate version, S. 982, I respectfully urge my colleagues to \nvote for this important measure in the form of H.R. 1828, as amended.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I stand in support of the Syria \nAccountability Act, H.R. 1828, which the House of Representatives \npassed, 398-4, last month. I am an original cosponsor of the Senate \nbill, S. 982, introduced by my colleagues, Senators Santorum and Boxer, \nwhich has over 80 cosponsors as of today. Today, I support the \namendment to H.R. 1828 submitted by my able colleague and chairman of \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Lugar, in coordination \nwith Senators Santorum and Boxer. I commend my colleagues for their \ngood work.\n  It is well within Congress's prerogative to write and implement \nsanctions, but the practice of doing so, as the chairman of the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee knows so well, can raise important points \nabout the overall constitutional prerogative of the executive in its \nright to conduct foreign policy. The amendment prepared by Senator \nLugar, in cooperation with the original sponsors of the bill, preserves \nthe prerogatives of both branches of government, and, at the same time, \nI believe, unifies and solidifies our nation's policy on the question \nof terrorism, and, in particular, Syria's contribution to peace, \nstability and progress in the Middle East.\n  Quite frankly, Syria has largely failed to contribute significantly \nto peace and stability in the Middle East, a stability that U.S. blood \nand treasure is now invested to achieve. We have watched the \nadministration give Syria ample opportunities, since September 11, \n2001, to make its contribution. Quite frankly, Mr. President, the \nadministration flattered the Damascus dictatorship by giving it this \ntime to join with the civilized world in unequivocally renouncing \nterrorism completely, as well as dismantling all manifestations of \nmaterial and political support for terrorist organizations.\n  Some suggest that Syria has played a game of sitting on the fence, \nwhen it came to the war on terrorism. However, Mr. President, Syria was \nnever on the fence. Syria is on the other side of the fence, with the \nother state sponsors of terrorism we have labeled as such since 1979. \nAnd today I will agree with what Secretary Powell told President Assad \nearlier this year: By refusing to cooperate, he was ``on the wrong side \nof history.''\n  Since 1979, Syria has appeared every year on the State Department's \nlist of state sponsors of terrorism. It has been so identified for its \nrole in terrorist acts, as well as the support it gave--and continues \nto give, to this very day--to Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad and \nHezbollah, terrorist organizations that, to this very day, organize and \ncommit acts of aggression or terrorism.\n  Throughout the 1990s, Syria played coy with U.S. administrations \nattempting to engage it in the Middle East peace process. Who can \nforget the scene of the long-suffering Secretary of State, Warren \nChristopher, waiting hours outside of Hafez Assad's office on his \numpteenth visit, at the very same time Iranian weapons were being \ntransferred to Hezbollah at the Damascus airport? Who can forget \nPresident Clinton's futile attempt in Geneva, near the end of his term \nand near the end of Assad's brutal life, to re-engage the\n\n[[Page S14415]]\n\ndictator in peace talks? On the question of peace or normal relations \nwith Israel, in every aspect but the desire to reclaim territory for \nitself, Syria has most definitely been a rejectionist state.\n  There are persistent reports that Syria has a stockpile of chemical \nweapons, including sarin and possibly also VX, which it could combine \nwith one of the largest missile stockpiles in the Middle East. \nCoalition forces are not in Iraq to rid that former dictatorship of its \nweapons of destruction while we look the other way on similar weapons \nheld by another Ba'athist regime. The era of that ideology of Arab \noppression, along with the threat of weapons of mass destruction to \nmaintain that oppression, is over.\n  Syria has not assisted us in our historic mission in Iraq. Joining \nthe Security Council in unanimous approval of Resolution 1441, the \nSyrians were quick to denounce the threat and use of force to achieve \nthe goals of the resolution. Since the beginning of Operation Iraqi \nFreedom, our officials--from the President, to the Secretary of State, \nto the Secretary of Defense--have publicly criticized Syria for its \nlack of cooperation. Syria's border has remained open to fleeing \nBa'athist officials, and to international terrorists anxious to die \nfighting against Coalition forces. Our officials believe that Syria \nholds up to $3 billion of Saddam's ill-gotten loot, funds that the \nGoverning Council could use for reconstruction, funds that would lessen \nthe obligations we have undertaken in this body this week.\n  Syria invaded Lebanon more than a quarter-century ago, and maintains \napproximately 15,000 troops there to this day. Throughout this period, \nSyria has backed the Shi'ite terrorist organization, Hezbollah, an \norganization that has been tied to terrorism around the world. Twenty \nyears ago, a Hezbollah suicide bomber killed almost 300 U.S. Marines as \nthey slept in their barracks in Beirut. Hezbollah continues to attack \nacross borders, shelling Israel as late as last week. Nothing Hezbollah \ndoes is without Syrian sanction. The Middle East will not see peace, \nand the United States should not consider itself secure as long as \nHezbollah, with its Syrian backers, exists.\n  So it is time to go to the source and sanction Syria. This bill \noutlines a series of goals and commensurate diplomatic and economic \nsanctions to apply to the Syrian regime. It maintains flexibility of \npolicy choice for the administration, but it is clear in stating the \nCongress's intent, in resolve and policy, to further isolate the \ndecrepit dictatorship in Damascus.\n  I do not know if this bill will motivate Damascus to cross the fence \nand join the anti-terror coalition of civilized nations. I suspect that \nto believe so would be pollyannaish. But I do believe that the way we \nact today will declare to the Damascus dictatorship that there are \ncosts to being on the wrong side of the fence in the war on terror.\n  September 11, 2001 began a new era in U.S. foreign policy, and the \nPresident's policies since that watershed event have been based on \nclarity of vision. Against the threat of terrorism, which lurks and \nbreeds in the shadows, we have responded with clarity of purpose. \nAgainst the traditional approaches of diplomacy, which balance nuance \nagainst process, we have demanded progress. Against previous approaches \nthat part-time antagonism toward a mutual enemy should be rewarded with \nfull-time tolerance of non-compliance with our stated goals, we say \ntoday: No longer.\n  President Assad will receive this message clearly. Perhaps Syria will \nmodify its behavior. If it does not, Syria can join the list of rogue \nstates who failed because they challenged the order of the civilized \nworld.\n  The American public has read reports in the press about Syria's \ncooperation with us in identifying, in the months after September 11, \nmembers of Al-Qaida. I have read no where, nor have I heard any analyst \nargue, that such cooperation was because Syria was dedicated to our \ndefense, or to our global war on terrorism. Since then, the American \npublic has heard many members of the current administration express \ndisappointment with Syria's behavior, and they have seen many reports \nof Syria's lack of cooperation. And one thing is clear in a democracy, \nMr. President: Our foreign policy must have the support of the public.\n  I will always respect the President's foreign policy prerogative, and \nI have defended the executive's prerogative under Republican and \nDemocratic administrations. I have supported ``quiet diplomacy'' for \nsmall results. But a diplomacy that produces invisible results is not \nquiet, it is silent. Today, I believe the members of the President's \nadministration agree with me.\n  For the reasons I have stated here, this bill will pass \noverwhelmingly, as it did in the House of Representatives. We may \nconsider this the Senate's contribution today to the war on global \nterrorism.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today the Senate is voting on H.R. 1828, \nthe Syria Accountability Act. I would like to explain to my colleagues \nwhy I will be voting against this legislation.\n  As chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee's Near East \nSubcommittee, I have come to appreciate the great importance of U.S. \nleadership in working to restart the Middle East peace process. In \nrecent visits to the region--the West Bank, Jordan, Iraq, Turkey and \nAfghanistan--I heard a uniform chorus in these Arab and Muslim nations \nthat active United States involvement was urgently needed to halt the \ncontinuing violence between Israel and the Palestinians. I regret that \nthis administration has not actively responded to these pleas for \npeace.\n  I have also learned that our disinterest in becoming involved in \nMiddle East peace has contributed to the sharply declining image of the \nUnited States in the Arab/Muslim world. Indeed, according to the \nrecently released report of the Advisory Group on Public Diplomacy for \nthe Arab and Muslim World--``the Djerejian report''--hostility toward \nAmerica has reached shocking levels, and the bottom has fallen out of \nArab and Muslim support for the United States. The report also \ndocuments that ``large majorities in the Arab and Muslim world view \nUnited States policy through the prism of the Arab-Israeli conflict.''\n  I am troubled by these developments and fear that the \nadministration's emerging hard line toward Syria, in addition to \npassage of this bill, will only add fuel to this fire. It is true that \nthe Syrian Government can do more to work with the United States in \ncombating terrorism in the region, and the administration has made some \nvery clear requests of the Syrian Government. But if Syria does not \nrespond to our requests, most, if not all, of the sanctions \ncontemplated by the Syrian Accountability Act can already be imposed by \nthe administration. This means that a bill that is widely perceived as \na crackdown against Syria has little substantive effect. Indeed, \nPatrick Clawson of CSIS testified to our committee last week, ``Some \nmight say that the act is largely symbolic, but do not underestimate \nthe importance of symbols.'' And that concerns me, because the symbol \nof the United States as cracking down on an Arab nation ultimately \nharms our interests in many very important parts of the world.\n  So in reality I would describe this bill as a ``lose-lose'' for the \nUnited States: We're getting little additional muscles against Syria \nwhile further antagonizing the Arab world. I urge my colleagues to vote \n``no'' on this bill.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, Syria has long been considered by the United \nStates to be a rogue state. Syria continues to associate with terrorist \ngroups, including those that have carried out ruthless attacks that set \nback the cause of peace in the Middle East, leading it to be placed on \nthe State Department's list of state sponsors of terrorism. Syria has \noccupied Lebanon continuously since 1976, in violation of U.N. Security \nCouncil Resolution 520.\n  The United States is justified in seeking to apply political and \neconomic pressure on Syria to change its foreign policy. However, I \nwill vote against the Syria Accountability Act.\n  Of the 22 pages of this bill, only six pages relate to sanctions that \nthe United States may apply to Syria. The other pages contain 51 \nclauses of findings, senses of Congress, and statements of policy. \nThese nonbinding provisions build a case against Syria, and I fear that \nthose provisions could later be used to build a case for a military \nintervention against Syria.\n  In many cases, the non-binding clauses in the bill appear to gloss \nover the complex situation with respect to\n\n[[Page S14416]]\n\nSyria. For example, on page 11, the bill speaks of ``hostile actions'' \nby Syria against U.S.-led forces in Iraq. Yet, the evidence is \ninconclusive as to the role of the Government of Syria in the attacks \nthat have been carried out against our troops in Iraq. Such \ninsinuations could be used to build the case for a preemptive military \nintervention against Syria, which, unfortunately, is a very real \npossibility because of the dangerous doctrine of preemption hatched by \nthe administration.\n  Other language in the nonbinding clauses may simply be ill-\nconsidered. For example, on page 7, the bill quotes an unclassified CIA \nreport that says that it is ``highly probable'' that Syria is working \non biological weapons. In the very next clause, however, the bill \nquotes an Under Secretary of State as saying that Syria ``is pursuing'' \nthe development of biological weapons. It is exactly this kind of \nshading of intelligence probabilities becoming certainties for which \nCongress has criticized the administration and its intelligence \nagencies for creating the hysteria that led to war in Iraq. Could \nCongress be so willing to make the same mistake with respect to Syria?\n  The United States should use economic and diplomatic leverage to \npressure Syria to change its support for terrorism and alter its \nforeign policy. The sponsors of this legislation have made improvements \nto several nonbinding provisions in this bill, and they have worked to \naddress some of my more serious concerns. While I appreciate their \ncooperation, I still cannot support this legislation. The findings, \nstatements of policy, and sense of Congress provisions in the Syria \nAccountability Act could be used to build a case against Syria that \ncould too easily be hyped to imply congressional support for preemptive \nmilitary action against that rogue state. I will vote against this bill \nbecause of that dangerous course that it may portend.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remains 1 minute 54 seconds.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I note no more Senators on our side of the \naisle wish to speak. Therefore, I yield the remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  The question is on the engrossment of the amendment and third reading \nof the bill.\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read a third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to reconsider the vote and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am proud of my colleagues throughout \nthe Senate for the overwhelming support just given on the Syria \nAccountability Act. I believe this bill sends an unambiguous signal to \nthe administration and to the Syrian regime that the Congress considers \nSyrian support for terrorism, its occupation of Lebanon, and its \npursuit of dangerous weapons all significant threats to the United \nStates and to global security.\n  I am particularly concerned that this administration has let Syria \noff the hook. Despite the support the Syria Accountability Act just \nhad, there are waivers that concern me. Syria's record is not one that \nwe can look at with any assurances that they are going to do what they \nhave to.\n  The administration claimed that al-Assad's regime's support for the \nglobal war on terrorism is so valuable that he should not be pressed on \nother issues, including the failure of the Syrians to secure the Iraqi \nborder, thereby permitting the constant infiltration of foreign \nterrorists pouring into Iraq.\n  Apparently, the Syrians must have shared intelligence about al-Qaida, \nand FBI and CIA officials have reportedly met in Syria with Syrian \nintelligence officers to discuss terrorism. The Syrians have also \nhelped to capture a top al-Qaida figure, a Syrian-born German citizen \nwho is part of the Hamburg cell that planned the September 11 attack.\n  So while Syria might be sharing information on al-Qaida, at the same \ntime it is deliberately thwarting the Palestinian-Israeli peace \nprocess.\n  Syria harbors leaders who order, plan, and finance terror attacks \nagainst Israeli citizens. Operatives of the Islamic Jihad, Hamas, the \nPopular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and the al Aqsa Martyrs \nBrigades, which I might add is a terrorist group affiliated with Yasser \nArafat's political party FATAH, are regularly receiving training in \nSyrian camps.\n  So what is perplexing is why this administration has refused to force \nthe Syrians to stop training Palestinian extremists even as it promotes \na resolution of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.\n  No Palestinian roadmap to peace, no negotiations will be successful \nbetween Palestinians and Israelis as long as Syria continues to occupy \nLebanon and to train and churn out suicide bombers.\n  I am worried that the administration has made a cynical tradeoff, \nfocusing on supposed Syrian support for the hunt for al-Qaida while \nignoring the Syrian's deliberate obstruction of the peace process.\n  Last month, when the Islamic Jihad successfully blew up an Arab-owned \nseaside restaurant in Haifa, killing 19 Israelis, including 5 \nPalestinian Israelis, Israel responded by striking one of the \nPalestinian training camps, choosing a time when it was empty to avoid \ncollateral damage. The Bush administration responded with a bland \nstatement urging both Israel and Syria to avoid actions that heighten \ntensions or could lead to hostilities.\n  Despite President Bush's call for Damascus to expel terrorist \norganizations from Syria and close down its camps, the Syrians have \ndirectly refused. They have made a mockery of President Bush's famous \nclaim that you are ``either with us or against us in the war on \nterrorism.''\n  We in the Senate have just passed the Syria Accountability Act, but \nSyria will not be held accountable until the administration decides to \nend its tradeoffs in the global war on terrorism,\n\n[[Page S14417]]\n\nprioritizing the fight against some forms of terror over others.\n  The message we want to send has to be clear and direct. We will not \ntolerate any support for terrorism, especially among those who purport \nto be our friends.\n  Everyone has seen the Syrian action in Lebanon and we know how \ntreacherous that is. They occupy the country and pretend they want to \nmake peace, but they do not want to. They have not indicated by their \nactions that they want to.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/11/senate-section/article/S14417-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14417]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2004--CONFERENCE \n                       REPORT--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, it is my hope that we can go next to the \nDefense authorization conference report. We have some Senators who may \nwant to make closing remarks, and then we would like to adopt this \nimportant conference report during today's session. I think it is \nfitting that the Senate act on this measure today, on Veterans Day.\n  Having said that, I ask my Democratic colleagues if they are prepared \nto allow for a 3-hour debate limitation prior to a vote on adoption of \nthe Defense conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have no problem going to the conference \nreport today. We do not need a vote on the motion to proceed. We would \ngo to that. We have our Congressional Medal of Honor winner, Senator \nInouye, who asked to be present when we vote on this conference report, \nand I think we should do that. He is somebody we all look upon as a \nhero, and he is doing veterans ceremonies in his State. We have no \nproblem debating the bill today.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Senator Stevens told me he would be back here at about 6:30.\n  Mr. REID. We would be happy to have 4 hours of debate today, equally \ndivided, and a vote on it early in the morning, but we would rather not \nvote on the matter today. I would be happy to offer a consent request \nthat we would complete our debate on it today, and vote on it, with \nmaybe 5 minutes equally divided, early in the morning, at whatever time \nthe leader chooses.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we have a number of Senators who believe \nstrongly that we ought to go ahead and bring this bill up, that we \nshould debate it, and that on Veterans Day we should have that \nopportunity to vote on that bill, if at all possible. Therefore, I will \nnot agree to put the vote off until tomorrow. We will be bringing it to \nthe floor, and I think then we will have discussion, debate today, on \nthis Veterans Day. We will see how it goes, and we may or may not be \nvoting later tonight.\n  Mr. President, reclaiming the floor, thus, we have Members who would \nlike this rollcall vote. Having said that, I move that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. \n1588, the National Defense Authorization Act, and I ask for the yeas \nand nays on the motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could ask a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, could we keep this vote open for a little \nextra time, maybe an extra 20 minutes? We need 30 minutes because we \nhave a Senator who is 30 minutes away. I know it is unusual to have a \nvote that long, but maybe this one time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is not debatable. It would require \na unanimous consent.\n  Mr. REID. I withdraw any request I have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nproceed to the consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. \n1588.

The clerk will report the conference report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Committee of Conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     1588), to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2004 for \n     military activities of the Department of Defense, for \n     military construction, and for defense activities of the \n     Department of Energy, to prescribe personnel strengths for \n     such fiscal year for the Armed Forces, and for other \n     purposes, having met, have agreed that the House recede from \n     its disagreement to the amendment of the Senate and agree to \n     the same with an amendment, and the Senate agree to the same, \n     signed by a majority of conferees on the part of both Houses.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the Record of November 6, 2003)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. As chairman of the Committee on Armed Services of the \nSenate, together with my distinguished colleague from Michigan, the \nranking member, we are proud to bring a conference report on national \ndefense authorization for fiscal year 2004 for final passage.\n  It is fitting that we consider this important legislation on Veterans \nDay, a day when our Nation pauses to honor those who serve in the Armed \nForces, their families, and those who have gone before them, proudly \ndefending our Nation's freedom.\n  I was deeply moved earlier today by the number of Senators on both \nsides of the aisle who spoke out with a sense of reverence and respect \non this Veterans Day, November 11, 2003.\n  This bill provides much needed benefits to those now serving, and \ntheir families, in the Armed Forces, as well as addressing longstanding \nneeds of military retirees and veterans. This has been an unusually \ninteresting and somewhat lengthy conference. In my 25 years, I think \nSenator Levin and I\n\n[[Page S14418]]\n\nwould indicate that it was quite a challenge, but I commend the \ndistinguished chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Mr. \nHunter, his colleague, the ranking member, the gentleman from Missouri, \nMr. Skelton, and above all my own partner of these 25 years, Senator \nLevin.\n  We had many challenging issues to resolve. Among them, of course, the \nbase closure issues commonly referred to as BRAC; another category of \nprovisions with regard to trade commonly referred to as Buy America, \nand the concurrent receipt issue which was pioneered in the Senate both \nlast year and again this year.\n  We did resolve these issues. I say ``we,'' because, again, it was a \npartnership of the four of us working together for these several \nmonths. I am proud that we achieved our goals of concluding a \nconference which sent a strong message of support to our men and women \nin uniform and their families, wherever they are in the world today.\n  An undertaking of this magnitude is ultimately a bipartisan effort. I \nam proud in my many years on the committee, together with Senator Levin \nwe have carried on the tradition of our predecessors, Senators Nunn and \nTower and Goldwater and Stennis and Jackson. These were men of enormous \ndistinction. We are proud to have that reputation as a committee. It \nprevails to this day and I hope on into the future.\n  I especially thank those who worked with me, all the members of the \ncommittee, not only my distinguished ranking member but the chairmen of \nthe subcommittees and their ranking members. They all put in tireless \nefforts to make this bill possible. It is probably one of the largest, \nif not the largest money bill passed by the Senate, in terms of \nauthorization. I readily salute and thank them for their many hours of \nwork to make it possible.\n  No committees succeed without a dedicated professional staff. I think \nthe staff of the Armed Services Committee is envied throughout the \nSenate, again, for its bipartisanship, for its long hours and, in many \ninstances, for its original thinking which Members accept and \nincorporate into their legislative creations.\n  I especially want to recognize the efforts of the staff director of \nthe Armed Services Committee, Mrs. Judy Ansley, and the Democratic \nstaff director, Richard DeBobes, veterans of many years on the staff of \nArmed Services. Mrs. Ansley was my staff director when I was ranking \nmember of the Intelligence Committee. She is an extraordinarily \naccomplished woman who proudly but humbly holds the title of the first \nwoman in the history of the Senate to be the chief of staff of the \nArmed Services Committee. They have led a great staff of their \nsubordinates, all of whom deserve--I wouldn't say equal credit, but \nnearly equal credit to the staff director and the Democratic staff \ndirector.\n  This staff worked long hours and helped Members reach the agreements \nthat are contained in the conference report before us. It is always a \nchallenge to the staff when it comes to conference. They are always \nready to step up and accept that challenge and help us produce this \nconference report.\n  I believe it is a strongly bipartisan bill that serves the best \ninterests of the men and women of our armed services and of our Nation \ntoday. I urge its swift passage to my colleagues.\n  As we stand here today beginning this conference report debate, \nhundreds of thousands of soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines, active \nand reserve, guard, and countless civilians who have worked for many \nyears in the Department of Defense and who support the troops--they \ncollectively are serving bravely around the world, from the Persian \nGulf region in Afghanistan, to Europe, North Korea, and on down as far \nas Australia, New Zealand, and that part of the world. All Americans \nare justifiably proud of what the U.S. Armed Forces and their coalition \npartners have accomplished in Iraq, Afghanistan, and in the global war \non terrorism. It is far from over. But never let it be said those in \nuniform and their civilian counterparts have not done their duty.\n  We are ever mindful the defense of our homeland begins on the distant \nbattlefields. To the extent that we can contain the threats on those \nbattlefields or those areas which are not battlefields but are \npotential battlefields, the less likely that we would experience a \nproblem here at home--as we reverently refer to 9/11 in our history.\n  As we begin this debate, we must pause and remember that military \nsuccess is not achieved without sacrifice. Thankfully, Operation Iraqi \nFreedom and Enduring Freedom were remarkably swift in terms of days, \nweeks, and months. But no matter how well conducted those operations \nwere, and are continuing, military victory does not come without \nsacrifice and loss. We extend our heartfelt sympathies to the families \nand loved ones of those who have lost their lives in these operations \nand in other military operations to make America and the world safe.\n  I also pause to say we think foremost about those who have given \ntheir lives, but many have given their limbs. They have bodies which \nhave been wounded. Those wounds, in some instances, are carried for the \nrest of their lives. So let us keep in mind those who suffer the scars \nof war and those families which lovingly nourish and care for them and \nwill in the years to come.\n  We mourn the loss of all of our soldiers and resolve to forever \nremember their service. In this month of Thanksgiving it is especially \nappropriate that we give thanks to those who serve and have served \ntheir Nation with distinction throughout its history.\n  I wear the poppy in my lapel today. It is now distributed all across \nAmerica for veterans organizations. It reflects on the sacrifices of \nWorld War I--the enormity of the casualties this Nation suffered in \nthat war. I am always especially proud of my father, a young doctor who \nserved in that conflict in France, in the trenches, and cared for the \nwounded.\n  We are blessed to have this new generation of great Americans, so \ncommitted to American traditions, values, and ideals, carrying on the \ntraditions of those who preceded them, with equal dedication, with \nequal valor. Without a doubt, the U.S. military is the most capable \nmilitary force in the world today. We don't say that boastfully; we say \nit factually. It is a model of excellence and the standard by which \nothers are measured. The provisions in this conference report sustain \nand improve on that excellence.\n  Throughout its history, America has never gone forward from our \nshores, in harm's way, to try to take the land, the possessions from \nothers. There have been instances where we have had to occupy for a \nperiod. But by and large, we have always gone, and most certainly in \ntwo of these conflicts today, the two principal ones--Iraq and \nAfghanistan--we are there solely in the cause of freedom.\n  We must send a strong message of support to these men and women in \nuniform serving on the distant posts throughout the world, indeed the \nbattlefields. They are bravely protecting our Nation here at home. By \npassing this important legislation today, we send that message. This \nconference report contains much deserved pay and benefits for military \npersonnel and families, much needed increases in family housing and \nquality of life projects on military installations, as well as prudent \ninvestments in the equipment and technology our military needs to \nsuccessfully counter future threats. We must always be looking, not 1 \nyear, not 2, but decades in the future, to try as best we can to \nascertain what is the threat to freedom here at home, to freedom \nabroad, and to fashion those weapons to enable the Armed Forces of the \nUnited States, together with coalition forces with which we have fought \nin World War I and World War II and on the battlefields of Korea and in \nthe battlefields today, to give those weapons to those brave persons to \nuse them in the cause of freedom.\n  The conference report also makes significant improvements in the \nbenefits for disabled veterans, as well as an important new benefit for \nmembers of the Reserve component who play such an important role in our \nnational security.\n  When I use the word ``Reserve,'' I include the reservists equally as \nthe National Guard. Sometimes it is a confusing term for those who are \nlistening. By no means do I exclude either the Guard or Reserve. It is \na total force.\n  I remember so well when I was privileged to serve in the Pentagon as \nNavy Secretary when Melvin Laird, the Secretary of Defense at that \ntime, coined\n\n[[Page S14419]]\n\nthe idea of having a ``total force'' and to discontinue the draft. It \nwas a calculated risk, but we did it. It succeeded largely because \nthere are many men and women of the Armed Forces today who are proud to \nsay, ``We are volunteers'', or ``all volunteers.'' Fortunately, the \nNational Guard and the Reserve have established themselves as a strong \nand equal partner in this total force concept.\n  This conference report endorses the President's budget request for \ndefense in fiscal year 2004. And I wish to commend the President and \nthe Secretary of Defense and all of those who prepared this budget that \ncame to the Congress. It is largely incorporated in the conference \nreport before us today. That report continues the momentum of recent \nyears in making real increases in defense spending to sustain \nreadiness, enhance the quality of life of our military personnel and \ntheir families, modernize and transform the U.S. Armed Forces to meet \ncurrent and future threats, and take care of our retirees and veterans.\n  The conference report before us provides $401.3 billion for defense, \nincluding $74.2 billion for procurement, $63.4 billion for research and \ndevelopment, and $114.4 billion for current readiness. This is in \naddition to the $65.5 billion for the Department of Defense contained \nin the supplemental we just passed to sustain our forces in Iraq and \nAfghanistan and elsewhere in the world during fiscal year 2004. This \nconference report will authorize the Department's portion of the \nsupplemental.\n  I once again commend the very brave and courageous and determined \nPresident of the United States in going to the American people and \nsaying these funds are necessary not only to protect our freedom but \nthe freedom of peoples throughout the world wherever we can work with \nour coalition partners in achieving those goals.\n  There are many provisions of this report that are important and of \nwhich I am very proud. I want to highlight just a few.\n  First and foremost is the 4.1 percent pay raise for the men and women \nin uniform, and the extension of special imminent danger pay, family \nseparation allowances, and other benefits for those in harm's way. We \nare asking a lot of our men and women in uniform and their families in \nthese challenging times, and they have never failed to respond. Their \npay raise and extension of combat benefits contained in this conference \nreport signal our strong support to those troops and their families.\n  For years, we here in Congress have been grappling with how to \nresolve the problem with concurrent receipts--an inequity that many use \nin our compensation system for disabled military retirees. By law, \nmilitary retirees are prohibited from collecting both their hard-earned \nmilitary pay and their disability pay. Last year, we were able \nto establish a new form of special compensation for military retirees \nwith combat-related disabilities--so-called Purple Heart Plus. It was \nreally conceived right in this very Chamber by a number of individuals, \nincluding Senator Levin, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, Senator McCain, \nand a number of other veterans who recognized that this was needed and \nthat it was time. That was a start. We called it a beachhead. I am very \npleased we have been able to expand on that beachhead in this \nconference report by extending the special compensation for combat-\nrelated disabilities to military retirees with disabling conditions due \nto combat or combat-related operations, and by phasing in full \nconcurrent receipt over 10 years for those retirees with disabilities \nrated at 50 percent or greater. This is a major step forward.\n\n  I remember the day when there were three Senators standing right \nthere in the well--Senator Reid of Nevada, my distinguished ranking \nmember, Senator Levin, and myself--and at that time the Senate bill had \na concurrent receipt provision in it; the House bill did not. By voice \nvote, we passed that amendment and put it in this bill. By virtue of \nthat action--not just the three of us; I happened to be here at that \nmoment, but many others who had worked this issue--that was the \nbeginning, that was the engine that finally drew this train out of the \nbarn and down the tracks to where we are today. I think it is a \nsuccessful achievement. And many in this Chamber made it possible. The \nSenate had that provision in its bill.\n  With respect to the controversial ``Buy America'' provisions, I \nbelieve the conferees reached a balanced compromise that shows our \nsupport for a strong U.S. industrial base without undermining our \nimportant defense cooperation and defense trade relationships with our \nallies.\n  The conference agreement also removes several unnecessary barriers to \ndefense trade which are contained in current law. The ``Buy America'' \nprovisions have the full support of all relevant agencies and the \nadministration. The final version went through many iterations.\n  I commend the Director of the Office of Management and Budget who, \nworking with the Chief of Staff of the White House, put this bill \ntogether in final form at the request of myself and others. With the \nPresident's goals clearly in mind, this revision was incorporated in \nthis conference report.\n  My colleagues and the distinguished chairman of the House Armed \nServices Committee did a great deal of work on this provision. He was \ntenacious in his desire to see that this bill contained provisions \nimportant to the preservation of our industrial base, and those goals \nwere achieved at the same time in a manner that is consistent with our \ngoals as a nation of free trade.\n  A part of this conference report of which I am particularly proud is \nthe provision which authorizes a program to begin replacing our aerial \ntanker fleet with new aircraft through a lease of no more than 20 KC-\n767 aircraft and a multi-year procurement of an additional 80 aircraft. \nExtensive analysis by the General Accounting Office and the \nCongressional Budget Office indicated the multi-year lease pilot \nprogram proposed by the Air Force would be significantly more expensive \nthan a traditional procurement. After a hearing before the Committee in \nSeptember 2003, the Department was asked to examine alternatives where \na fewer number of aircraft were leased, with the rest of the 100 \naircraft purchased under a multi-year procurement program. This \nexamination confirmed that the fewer aircraft leased and the more \naircraft purchased, the greater the savings. These findings have \nresulted in a conference agreement that will give the Armed Forces the \nmodern equipment they need, but will save the American taxpayer over \n$4.0 billion over original proposals. This is a win for the Air Force \nand a win for the American people.\n  The civilian personnel system of the Department of Defense has been \nin need of reform for some time. The Secretary of Defense had the \nvision to determine that this had to be revised subsequent to the just \nearth-shaking, dramatic event of 9/11. He made a very strong personal \neffort to achieve it, and I think this bill reflects upon his great \ncredit and tenaciousness and those of his colleagues.\n  We have included provisions in the conference report that will \nprovide expansive new civilian personnel authorities for the Department \nof Defense. I am pleased we were able to provide the Secretary of \nDefense with the increased flexibility necessary to allow the DOD to \nrespond to the new threats of the new century and the demands of the \nwar on terrorism. While providing the new authorities, the conferees \nwere sensitive to the concerns and the rights of the vital civilian \nemployees of the Department of Defense. I have spoken on this floor \nmany times, and rarely if ever have I omitted direct reference, because \nthey are teammates--full teammates and partners--to the men and women \nwho serve in uniform.\n  The establishment of a national security personnel system which is \nauthorized in this conference report gives the Secretary of Defense the \nflexibility he needs to manage the current civilian workforce and to \ntransform--and I underline the word ``transform''; it is essential. The \nSecretary of Defense has been unfailing in his efforts to look into the \nfuture and to transform the Department of Defense to meet those \nchanging threats that are on the rise and needs to do so to manage his \nworkforce for the future while providing appropriate protections and \nappeals processes for the employees.\n  I recognize the very hard work of my colleague, Senator Collins, my \nlong-time friend in the House, Congressman Tom Davis, and indeed \nSenator Levin, who, together with Senator Collins in\n\n[[Page S14420]]\n\nthe Governmental Affairs Committee, crafted a piece of legislation \nwhich was largely drawn as a model to follow in this instance. We did \nnot measure up to all the goals in the Collins-Levin bill, but, in \nfact, we in large measure achieved a number of the goals of that piece \nof legislation.\n  Balancing the readiness needs of the Armed Forces with the critical \nneed to protect the environment is always a challenge and a risk. We \nhave included provisions in the conference report to make modifications \nto both the Endangered Species Act and the Marine Mammal Protection Act \nwhich ensure realistic training opportunities for our military without \nunnecessarily endangering environmentally sensitive areas.\n  There are many other important items in the conference report that \ndeserve mention, from enhanced access to TRICARE for certain Reserve \ncomponent members, and I particularly thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom South Carolina, who is a leader on this issue. We needed increased \nspending for our special operation forces to continue investment in \nimportant homeland defense initiatives.\n  The bottom line is this conference report is an extremely important \npiece of legislation that provides the resources to continue the global \nwar on terrorism while safeguarding Americans here at home. It sustains \nthe current readiness of the Armed Forces and provides resources to \nprepare them for the future.\n  This conference report sends a clear signal to our citizens \nthroughout the world, to nations all over, that the United States is \ncommitted to a strong national defense and to the freedom so richly \ndeserved by nations throughout the world. More importantly, it sends a \nclear signal to our men and women in uniform, from the newest private \nto the most senior flag and general officer, that they have the support \nof the Congress and of the American people.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this conference report legislation \nthat upholds the President's fundamental national security priorities \nand makes the right investments in future capabilities. It is \nimperative we send our President, our fellow citizens, and the world a \nmessage of resolve from the Congress--a national defense authorization \nconference report that provides authority to our Nation's leaders and \nour Armed Forces to protect our Nation and our vital interests around \nthe world. It takes care of the troops, their families, and our \nveterans, who have all served so well in the defense of freedom.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask the chairman if it might be all \nright, and Members of his side, as well as other Members on this side, \nif I give my remarks--they are fairly lengthy--and if I proceed for 5 \nor 10 minutes and then yield to Senator Jeffords for his comments.\n  Mr. WARNER. I readily accede to the request of my full partner in \nworking on these matters for these 25 years. We will do that and that \nwill accommodate colleagues who are waiting to speak, if you do not \nmind that the chairman was rather lengthy in his remarks. It was \nimportant that be done.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I may actually be lengthier than the chairman.\n  First, I thank the chairman for his brevity. I would then be happy \nbefore I complete my remarks to yield to other Senators who may be \nwaiting. Since I will be here all the time, I can complete my remarks.\n  I am pleased to join the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, \nand my dear friend, Senator Warner, in urging the adoption of this \nconference report. The conference on this bill took 147 days to \nconclude, making it the longest conference on a defense authorization \nbill in the history of our committee. The agreement would not have been \npossible without the strength and the perseverance of Senator Warner.\n  This is a historic bill for another reason as well. This conference \nreport includes two key Senate provisions that serve the fundamental \nneeds of the men and women upon whom we now call and upon whom we have \ncalled in the past to fight our Nation's wars. These two provisions are \nthe concurrent receipt provision added by the amendment of Senator \nHarry Reid on the Senate floor and the TRICARE provision added by the \namendment of Senator Daschle on the Senate floor. Senator Warner's \nstrong support was instrumental to the success on both of these issues. \nThey simply could not have been achieved without the support of our \nchairman.\n  On concurrent receipt, the conference report would phase in full \nconcurrent receipt of military retiree pay and veterans disability \ncompensation for all retirees with disability ratings of 50 percent or \ngreater. Currently, military retirees who receive VA disability \ncompensation have their military retired pay offset by the amount of \ntheir VA disability compensation. The conference report would also \nexpand the combat-related special compensation we enacted last year to \nreimburse all veterans for combat-related disabilities for any retired \npay forfeited because of the prohibition on concurrent receipt.\n  I continue to believe it is unfair to require our disabled military \nretirees to forfeit earned retired pay in order to receive VA \ncompensation for their service-connected disabilities. According to the \nCongressional Budget Office, the conference provision on concurrent \nreceipt will benefit approximately 225,000 disabled retirees.\n  On TRICARE, the conference report would provide enhanced access to \nhealth care for members of the Guard and Reserve and their families, \nincluding TRICARE coverage that begins upon notification that a member \nof the Reserve component has been activated, TRICARE coverage that \nextends 6 months after release from active duty, and extended TRICARE \nbenefits on a cost-share basis for members of the Reserve components \nand their families who do not have access to other health insurance \ncoverage.\n\n  The citizen soldiers of our Guard and Reserve willingly place \nthemselves in harm's way for their country. This is the least we can do \nto recognize their courage and their patriotism.\n  These two provisions address the fundamental needs of the men and \nwomen whom we now call upon and we called upon in the past to serve our \ncountry in uniform. They have something else in common, as well. Both \nof these provisions were included in the conference report despite the \nveto threat from the administration. On July 8th, the Secretary of \nDefense wrote to the conferees to state that providing these vital \nbenefits to our veterans and to our Guard and Reserve would ``drain \nresources from important programs benefiting our military.'' The \nSecretary's letter stated if the President is presented with a bill \n``authorizing concurrent receipt of military retirement pay and \nveterans disability compensation benefits or expands TRICARE, then I \nwould join other senior advisers to the President in recommending that \nhe veto the bill.''\n  As a matter of fact, as many will remember, the administration held \nup the enactment of last year's Defense authorization bill for several \nmonths and nearly stymied the bill because of the administration's \nopposition to concurrent receipt proposals similar to the language \nincluded in this year's bill.\n  The conference report before the Senate today contains both of these \nSenate provisions. This year, as last year, Senate conferees stood up \nfor what they believed in despite the opposition of the administration. \nThis year, as last year, we stood with America's disabled veterans, we \nstood with America's Guard and Reserve. Unlike last year, the House \nconferees agreed to go along with us. It was the right decision. I do \nnot believe the President would have vetoed our conference report over \nthese issues last year and I am confident he will not do so this year.\n  Again, I pay my respects to the chairman of our committee, because \neven though, as always, he is generous in giving credit to others for \nprovisions in the bill, including his reference to Senator Reid which \nhe accurately made, without his leadership these provisions simply \nwould not be in this conference report. All of our veterans and all the \nmen and women in our military are and should be in his debt for his \nleadership in this and so many other ways.\n  This bill contains a number of other important provisions for our men \nand women in uniform. These include provisions that would increase \nmilitary pay by 3.7 percent across the board,\n\n[[Page S14421]]\n\nwith targeted pay raises for midcareer personnel, raising the average \nincrease to 4.1 percent.\n  It extends increased imminent danger pay and family separation \nallowances, authorizing a high tempo allowance of up to $1,000 per \nmonth for active and Reserve personnel who experience unusually high \ntempo. It doubles the death benefit to $12,000. It authorizes survival \nbenefit plan annuities for surviving spouses of Guard and Reserve \npersonnel who die during inactive duty training.\n  It removes skill requirement limitations for reenlistment bonuses for \nmembers who reenlist in Afghanistan, Iraq, or Kuwait. It authorizes \nfull replacement for household goods lost or damaged during military \nmoves. It expands commissary use privileges for Guard and Reserve \nmembers and their families. It provides supplemental impact aid to \nassist schools with large numbers of children of military families.\n  I am pleased the bill would increase authorized active duty end \nstrength for the Army.\n  Madam President, I now ask unanimous consent that I be able to yield \nto our good friend from Vermont, and then I would offer others the \nopportunity to follow him if they wish. I can complete my statement at \na later time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Virginia, Mr. \nWarner, and the Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin, for the good work \nthey have done in crafting this important piece of legislation.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, will the Senator indulge the manager for \na moment to make an inquiry?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Please do.\n  Mr. WARNER. To accommodate other Senators, I ask the Senator about \nhow much time he wishes to speak.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I say 5 or 6 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Fine.\n  Mr. WARNER. We may have differences of views, but it is important.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank the chairman and also Mr. Levin, the Senator \nfrom Michigan, for the good work they have done. I appreciate the hard \nwork that goes into these issues which I will be discussing.\n  This bill provides important support for the men and women of our \nArmed Forces who are subject to hostile attack while attempting to \nbring stability and democracy to the people of Iraq.\n  While I was strongly opposed to the invasion of Iraq, I believe that \nthis Defense authorization bill is very necessary. If I had my way I \nwould have changed some of its provisions, but on balance the Senate \nnegotiators have done a very admirable job of crafting an acceptable \ncompromise on most of the defense issues.\n  I am, however, quite displeased that the administration insisted on \nasking for language in this bill exempting the Department of Defense \nfrom provisions of the Endangered Species Act and the Marine Mammal \nProtection Act.\n  First of all, the Defense authorization bill is not the proper place \nto have this debate. Discussions about these landmark environmental \nlaws ought to take place in the broader context in our environmental \nprotection legislation. However we made a good effort at crafting \ncompromise legislation in the Senate bill. I was quite distressed that \nthe House conferees refused to go along with this reasonable approach.\n  In the 1950s, I was a gunnery officer on the USS McNair, a destroyer \nthat participated in operations off the coast of Lebanon and had \nparticipated in actions to train our men in the service.\n  I retired from the Naval Reserves as a captain. I am a veteran, and I \nam also an environmentalist. The two are not mutually exclusive.\n  I understand firsthand that to be effective in the field, our \nsoldiers, marines, pilots, and sailors must have the best possible \ntraining. I also understand that our country has an invaluable natural \nenvironment that we must protect as best we can.\n  As part of the 2004 Department of Defense authorization bill, the \nDepartment of Defense submitted the Range Readiness Preservation \nInitiative.\n  The RPPI created broad statutory exemptions for ``training \nactivities'' of the DOD from five environment and resource laws: the \nClean Air Act; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, \nand Liability Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; the \nEndangered Species Act; and the Marine Mammal Protection Act.\n  All of these laws, with the exception of the Marine Mammal Protection \nAct, fall under the jurisdiction of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, of which I am the ranking member.\n  The EPW Committee held hearings on this proposal, in this Congress \nand in the 107th Congress, and found that the provisions of this \nproposal were unnecessary because the DOD had authority for seeking \nexemptions from these laws for national security reasons under existing \nlaw.\n  In particular, section 7-J of the ESA allows the law's requirements \nto be waived, at the request of the Secretary of Defense, for national \nsecurity concerns.\n  To date, no Secretary of Defense has ever needed to utilize this \nprovision of the ESA. Despite this, the DOD authorization bill reported \nby the Armed Services Committee contained a provision amending the ESA \nto provide that an Integrated Natural Resources Management Plan \nprepared by the Department of Defense could take the place of a \ncritical habitat designation on DOD lands.\n  The Endangered Species Act has dramatically protected the diversity \nof our Nation's natural environment. Many species, including the bald \neagle, the symbol of the United States, simply might not be in \nexistence today other than for the ESA. Each year, since 1999 the \nannual list of endangered plant and animal species has exceeded 1,200.\n  The grizzly bear, eastern cougar, bighorn sheep, whooping crane, \nAmerican crocodile, and five species of sea turtle are some of the more \nrecognizable mammals, birds, and reptiles that are endangered but have \nbeen protected and need protection.\n  The ESA protects these animals and their habitats, and the hundreds \nof other animal and plant species that are threatened or endangered \nacross the 50 States. This past May, the Senate stood up for the ESA--\nthe Endangered Species Act--and changed the provision of the DOD \nauthorization bill. We did that. We did our job. A majority of the \nSenate adopted an amendment to keep a balance between the needs of the \nDepartment of the Interior to protect species under the ESA and the \nDepartment of Defense's need to give our men and women in uniform the \nbest and most realistic training possible.\n  The amendment required the Secretary of the Interior to make a \nwritten determination that the management activities identified in the \nINPRM would effectively conserve the species within the lands covered \nby the plan, and the plan assured that adequate funding would be \nprovided for the management activities.\n  The day after that vote, the Senate overwhelmingly passed S. 1050, \nonly to have its will overturned in this conference report. Supporters \nof the ESA exemption in this conference report will argue that the \nPentagon's hands are tied when military training comes into contact \nwith critical habitats of endangered species.\n  This is not the case. As I stated earlier, exemptions exist under \ncurrent law. In this conference report, the exemption of DOD from the \ncritical habitat designations of the ESA will not allow for case-by-\ncase decisions and will make it give the Pentagon a waiver from \nendangered species protections, even when more conservation-friendly \noptions may exist.\n  The ESA provision in this conference report provides no assurance \nthat the INRMP will provide conservation benefits to species.\n  There is no definition about the kind of benefit that needs to be \nincluded in the plan or a requirement that the benefit be in some way \nequal to a critical habitat designation.\n  Critical habitat designations are intended to protect habitat, \naddress habitat threats and pave the way for future recovery of the \nspecies. None of those requirements are contained in the word benefit. \nI can only hope that is how the Secretary of the Interior will define \nbenefit in the written determinations required under this new language.\n  In addition, this conference report weakens the protections for \nmarine\n\n[[Page S14422]]\n\nmammals. The conference report provides a weaker definition of \n``harassment'' of marine mammals that is the trigger for needing a \nMarine Mammal Protection Act authorization from the National Oceanic \nand Atmospheric Administration and the Fish and Wildlife Service. This \nweaker provision is extended beyond military readiness to ``a \nscientific research activity conducted by or on behalf of the Federal \nGovernment.'' These activities do not have to be necessary for military \nreadiness.\n  Also, the requirement under the MMPA that any takings of marine \nmammals be limited to ``small numbers'' of marine mammals, or limited \nto a ``specified geographical region'' where similar impacts are to be \nexpected has been removed. Another weakening of protections for \nspecies.\n  My reasons for concern over the degree of DOD sensitivity to \nenvironmental dangers has been heightened by my recent work on behalf \nof Marines and their families from Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.\n  Thousands of retired and ex-Marines and their families were exposed \nto highly contaminated drinking water over 20 years ago for long \nperiods. It is now coming to light that this contamination caused many \nbirth defects and childhood cancers. The extent of this tragedy could \nhave been significantly lessened if the DOD had been more sensitive to \nenvironmental concerns.\n  Therefore, I think it is a mistake to allow the Department of Defense \nto regulate its own environmental activities.\n  When an endangered species becomes extinct, it is lost forever. That \nis a very serious and eternal consequence of poor, shortsighted \nenvironmental policy. National security is more tightly tied to \nenvironmental security than many in the Pentagon would acknowledge. We \ncannot afford to try out a bad policy when the consequences are \nirrevocable.\n  I am opposed to changing the present requirement that DOD be \nconcerned with both our national security and our environmental health. \nBecause of my deep concern over these provisions, I must vote against \nthis legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I listened carefully to my colleague. I \nhave the privilege of having served on the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee for many years. The Senator referred to action taken by the \ncommittee when this issue was before it. Could he be more specific? I \ndon't recall. He said the committee took certain actions. I am having \ndifficulty recalling that the committee took an action.\n  We had a hearing. I remember consulting with my colleague about the \nessential need to have the Vice Chiefs of Staff of all the three \nmilitary departments which came before the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee. And to the individual, they were consistent in their urging \nthat the Endangered Species Act be changed in such a way to permit--and \nthis is the key--only this amendment to apply to Government-owned land \non military reservations. I remember that. But does he recall the \ncommittee having taken action?\n  I think if you look back through your words, I listened very \ncarefully.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, I will get back to the Senator from \nVirginia on that and provide him the information. I can't articulate it \nspecifically right now, but I will get back to him with that \ninformation.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my friend.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, if the chairman will yield on that point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. My recollection is that on the Senate floor we did add a \nsignificant protection, a criteria before the Endangered Species Act \nwould be ignored. That was under the Lautenberg amendment that we would \nrequire there be a conservation benefit provided as well as adequate \nfunding provided if the Department of Defense was going to proceed.\n  The Senator from Vermont's recollection relative to the committee \nperhaps refers to what we did on the Senate floor, which he also \nreferred to in his remarks, where we did add important protection that \nwas missing when the bill came to the floor, but a very close vote on \nthe floor added that protection.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. That is correct. That protection was added.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am not sure if that is what the Senator was referring \nto.\n  Mr. WARNER. I listened to the ranking member, the Senator from \nVermont. The ranking member said that the committee decided thus and \nso. I don't recall an action having been taken by the committee on \nwhich I am privileged to serve with my distinguished colleague.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I will get back to you on that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Again, if the Senator will yield, I think actually in the \ncommittee we were unable to do what the Senator from Vermont had \nactually urged us to do and which I totally agree with. I thank him for \nhis comments, which I share.\n  I reach a different conclusion on how I will vote on the whole bill \nbecause of the other provisions in it, but I happen to agree with him \nin terms of his analysis on the Endangered Species Act and on the \nMarine Mammal Protection Act and the damage that I believe we have \nneedlessly done to those statutes when we could have done some things \nwhich would have protected both the environment and the training of our \nforces.\n\n  But in any event, I think that probably is what the Senator from \nVermont is referring to, although I am not sure.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, he has offered to clarify the record. I \nbelieve at this time if we go from side to side, would that be \nagreeable to the Senator from Illinois? Could I inquire of the Senator \nfrom Texas the amount of time he desires to speak.\n  Mr. CORNYN. If I may have 10 minutes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, I would like to have an opportunity to \nspeak.\n  Mr. WARNER. Then I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Texas \nhave 10 minutes and the Senator from Illinois have 10 minutes, and that \nis to be followed by the Senator from Colorado for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I appreciate that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield, Senator Akaka has been here as \nwell. Perhaps after the Senator from Colorado, then the Senator from \nHawaii would be recognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Absolutely.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If we could add that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I extend my thanks and appreciation to \nthe Senator from Michigan for yielding and allowing me to say a few \nwords during his comments. Particularly I express my appreciation to \nthe chairman of the Armed Services Committee, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Virginia. The manner in which we have seen them navigate the \ntraffic jam here on the floor this afternoon on this important \nlegislation is indicative of the cooperative and collaborative effort \nthat both the ranking member and the chairman have demonstrated \nthroughout this lengthy process of reconciling not only coming up with \na bill but reconciling the differences between the House and Senate on \nthis important legislation.\n  I rise to say a few words about the Defense authorization conference \nreport that is before the body today. On Veterans Day in 1954, \nPresident Eisenhower called upon all Americans to not only remember the \nsacrifices of those who fought so valiantly but to rededicate \nthemselves to the task of promoting an enduring peace.\n  Today, almost 50 years later, we recall the dedication of all our \nveterans as we honor them on Veterans Day 2003. We take this time to \nhonor them because they gave so much to all of us and to say a prayer \nfor the men and women laboring overseas even now to spread the light of \nfreedom to a land that was previously cloaked in darkness.\n  We must always remember the old adage which is still true that \nfreedom is not free but was bought and paid for by the sacrifices of \ngenerations that have gone before us and, indeed, even the present one.\n  I can't help but think about my own father when I think about the \nsacrifices of generations that have gone\n\n[[Page S14423]]\n\nbefore, because he was a member of that greatest generation who at a \nyoung age flew in the Army Air Corps in a B-17 over Nazi Germany. On \nhis 13th mission, he was shot down and captured by the enemy and \nimprisoned for 4 months in a German prison camp.\n  Later, when General Patton and his troops came through and liberated \nhim and his colleagues, my dad would return to this country, to Corpus \nChristi, Texas, where he met my mother and where they married and \nraised a family and really became, as I said a moment ago, what we have \ncome to know as the greatest generation. We owe, indeed, everything we \nhave to the contributions and the preservation of our freedoms that \nthey made. It is they and others like them who, since that time, have \nfought in the cause of freedom that we honor today.\n  I think it is altogether fitting that we consider this bill on \nVeterans Day because it accomplishes great things for all of the \nmembers of our Armed Forces, both active and retired, as well as their \nfamilies. I have been amazed at how the senior Senator from Virginia, \nChairman Warner, has navigated this important legislation through the \ndifficult conference committee process. I know it was not easy. It has \nbeen my pleasure to work with and learn from him during the course of \nmy service on the Armed Services Committee.\n  This legislation authorizes more than $400 billion in budget \nauthority for defense programs in fiscal year 2004. I strongly believe \nit is our duty to ensure that the U.S. military has the resources they \nneed, whether it be the equipment, the facilities, or the training to \ndo the job we have asked them to do, and to win the war on terror.\n  In short, we must do whatever is required to maintain our military's \nstatus as the greatest fighting force on the face of the planet, even \nas we transform the nature of that force to face the challenges of the \nfuture.\n  I am proud of the work that has been accomplished here in terms of \nproviding an expanded entitlement to concurrent receipt to include \nthousands of more veterans. I believe it is indeed a major step in the \nright direction. Our veterans have more than earned this; they deserve \nit. I am glad this bill will expand the special compensation for the \ncombat-related disabilities program to include all veterans whose \ndisabling condition was due to combat or combat-related operations.\n  I strongly believe we are honor-bound to keep our commitment to our \nmen and women in uniform and that our support of them will not end when \nthey leave active duty and go into retirement. No veteran should ever \nbe left behind. I will continue to work in this body to make sure that \nTexas veterans, indeed all veterans, receive the benefits they so \nrichly deserve.\n  Our men and women in uniform, whether they be active duty or \nreservists, or members of the National Guard, are all doing a \ntremendous job fighting the war on terror. So I am especially glad to \nsee that this bill provides for an average pay raise of 4.1 percent, \nprovides enhanced access to TRICARE for members of the Reserves, and \nauthorizes increased hostile fire pay and family separation allowances \nto continue.\n  When someone leaves their home to fight for the cause of freedom \nabroad, we know it affects not just that soldier, or that sailor, or \nthat marine, or that airman; it affects their entire community, it \naffects their friends, and it affects their families. So we must not \nthink only of the service of the brave men and women who fight on the \nbattlefield, but the sacrifices their families make at home. Of course \nwe must remember, above all, those whose loved ones will not be coming \nback, who paid the ultimate price so others may live free.\n  I especially acknowledge the hard work Chairman Warner and the senior \nSenator from Arizona did on the Boeing tanker lease. I believe they \nwere able to achieve an excellent compromise, one that will save the \ntaxpayers more than $4 billion. It is critical that, while we allocate \nneeded funds to ensure our Nation's defense, we also spend the money in \na careful and fiscally responsible manner. I believe they have \naccomplished that, and we will accomplish that by approving the bill \ntoday.\n  Finally, I thank the conferees, and particularly the leadership, the \nchairman and ranking member, and others who have worked so hard, for \nincluding the bulk of the Military Citizenship Act, a bill I \nintroduced, which will expedite the naturalization process for nearly \n37,000 men and women serving in our Armed Forces who are not U.S. \ncitizens. It will reduce waiting times, waive normal fees, and require \nthe Secretary of Defense to enact a policy that facilitates the \nopportunity for a member of the armed services to finalize \nnaturalization, including the granting of high priority for emergency \nleave and transportation on military aircraft. I believe there is no \nbetter way for us to honor the heroism and sacrifice of those who risk \ntheir lives for our fundamental national values than to offer them a \nfull opportunity to enjoy the blessings of American citizenship.\n\n  In 1944, Winston Churchill spoke in the Royal Albert Hall to the \nveterans of another war, and he reminded them of the great and just \ncause they served. He said:\n\n       We are joined together in this union of action which has \n     been forced upon us by our common hatred of tyranny. Shedding \n     our blood side by side, struggling for the same ideals, until \n     the triumph of the great causes which we serve shall be made \n     manifest. . . . Then, indeed, there will be a day of \n     thanksgiving, one in which all the world will share.\n\n  Coming up to the current time in Iraq, of course, we know the fight \nis ongoing and there is still much to be done. But the difference our \nArmed Forces have made in such a short time is undeniable.\n  Less than a year ago, the idea that the Iraqi people could ever live \nin freedom was nothing but a dream. Now the vision of a free, \nprosperous, and peaceful Iraq is in sight. The day of thanksgiving is \nnot here yet, but it is coming.\n  Thanks to the leadership of President Bush and the professionalism \nand patriotism of our Armed Forces, and the sacrifices of their \nfamilies, it is coming soon.\n  One out of every 10 active-duty military personnel calls Texas home. \nI am honored to represent them, along with the senior Senator from \nTexas, Mrs. Hutchison. I am proud--and I know we are both proud--of the \nwork that has been done on this Defense authorization bill to serve \ntheir needs while enhancing our national security. I wish our brave men \nand women in uniform godspeed and look forward to the day when these \nyoung men and women can stand beside veterans of past wars as living \nexamples of selflessness and courage for the cause of freedom.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I compliment the Senator from the Lone \nStar State, Texas, who rightfully can take pride in his services on the \nArmed Services Committee. He was most eloquent on behalf of the men and \nwomen of the Armed Forces, and indeed I appreciate his comments. I \nthank the Senator.\n  I believe we are under an order to proceed to the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nIllinois is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, first, may I say to the Senator that he \nhas been working with me on a rather serious problem in the military \nregarding a helicopter. I commend him on taking those initiatives.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I express my gratitude to the chairman \nfor those remarks and also for his service to the Senate and the \ncountry. As chairman of the committee, with his able ranking member, \nSenator Levin of Michigan, they have produced an extraordinary bill at \nan extraordinary time.\n  To think we are now appropriating record amounts for our military \ndefense is appropriate as America faces an act of war in Iraq and \nAfghanistan and literally commitments around the world. I know this \nbill is controversial in some respects. It includes in it a provision \nwhich I urged in the earlier debate on another bill. That is an \nincrease in the combat pay and family separation allowance for those \ncurrently in harm's way, those involved in fighting and waging these \nwars.\n  I think that is the right thing to do. This committee was doing the \nright thing by including it so our men and women in uniform at least \nhave some peace of mind that they know while they are facing imminent \ndanger, while\n\n[[Page S14424]]\n\nthey are separated from their families, we are going to try to give \nthem additional assistance.\n  I join the Senator from Vermont in his earlier remarks. There are \nelements about this bill that trouble me. I understand by his remarks \nthat they were elements urged by the House conferees, not the Senate \nconferees. I honestly agree with him. There is no reason why we should \never have to sacrifice our environment or the treasures of nature to \nprotect America. In those rare situations where national security \ndemands it, there is a law that allows for it. But this bill, \nunfortunately, goes a step too far, allowing the Department of Defense, \nI am afraid, to have a waiver from environmental requirements that is \nnot necessary and, frankly, could endanger the environmental security \nin the name of national security. We could have done better. I hope we \naddress this issue in the future.\n  There are two specific areas I would like to address that are touched \nby this bill, but not directly. They relate to the men and women who \nare currently fighting for this country and risk their lives even as we \nmeet. It is appropriate on Veterans Day that we would be debating this \nbill. Our hearts go out to not only the men and women in uniform, but \nto all their families who worry and pray and hope the day will soon \ncome when their loved ones return home.\n  I worry about what is becoming of the profile of America's military \nbecause it is changing. This bill acknowledges it, but we have to \ncontinue to acknowledge it. More and more we are dependent on the Guard \nand Reserve to perform important military functions of our Government.\n  Currently, about one out of every five fighting persons in Iraq is a \nmember of a Guard or Reserve unit. With the callup that is anticipated \nin just a few months, that percentage will change dramatically. Over 40 \npercent of the people on the ground in Iraq fighting for America will \nbe members of Guard and Reserve units. That is a dramatic departure \nfrom where we were just a few years ago in the Persian Gulf war when \nthe Guard and Reserve played an important, but limited, role. Now the \nGuard and Reserve play a much larger role. Senator Warner of Virginia \nalluded earlier to the concern I have, about the equipment and \ntreatment of the Guard and Reserve who are activated, particularly in \nlight of the tragic incident just a few days ago when an Army Chinook \nhelicopter was shot down, killing 16 of our soldiers. Included among \nthem was the pilot Brian Slavenas of Genoa, IL, who will be buried \ntomorrow.\n  I looked into this and was concerned that the appropriate equipment \nhad not been committed to this Guard helicopter unit, a unit which \ncomes from both my State of Illinois and the neighboring State of Iowa.\n  What I learned after an extensive investigation is that, in fact, \nwhen the 106th unit was activated to be sent overseas, it was \nrepresented they were fully operational and ready to fight. In fact, \nonly 3 of the 14 helicopters had the necessary equipment to defend \nagainst shoulder-fired missiles.\n  When this was discovered, efforts were made to equip the other \nhelicopters as they were being sent overseas, with some success but not \ncomplete. In fact, once they arrived in Kuwait in position to go into \nIraq, further efforts were made by their commanding officer, Colonel \nPalumbo, and others to make certain they had the appropriate equipment.\n  During that period of time when equipment was being secured for these \nhelicopters, they were flying dangerous missions. It troubles me. \nFirst, they should not have been activated fully operational when they \nwere not. It should have been discovered at an early point. Second, it \ntroubles me that they were flying on dangerous missions without the \nnecessary protective equipment.\n  I understand the requirement of war sometimes makes those risks \nnecessary, but considering what we know now about the shoulder-filed \nmissiles and the ordnance ammunition on the ground in Iraq, I think \nextra precautions should have been taken to equip all of these \nhelicopters before they were put in harm's way.\n  I trust that will be the standard to follow in terms of helicopters \nand that literally all Guard and Reserve units will receive the \nnecessary equipment, the same equipment as Regular Army, before they \nare called into action.\n  That will be my standard and one I would like to hold this Department \nof Defense to, in cooperation with this committee.\n  The last point I wish to make is this: Several weeks ago this Senate \nconsidered an amendment I offered to the $87 billion emergency \nsupplemental bill asking the Federal employees who are activated in the \nGuard and Reserve be held harmless in terms of their salary and income \nwhile they serve; that we at least provide for them as much money from \nthe Federal agencies they are leaving as they would have made if they \nhad stayed home.\n  This is not a radical idea. Dozens of States, local units of \ngovernment, and private companies do this already across America, but \nwe don't do it for Federal employees, despite the fact that of the over \n1.2 million Guard and Reserve people in America today, 10 percent work \nfor the Federal Government. Of those who are currently activated, \n23,000 are Federal employees called away from their jobs and away from \ntheir families and homes to serve overseas.\n  By a vote of 96 to 3, we accepted this provision saying that, yes, \nthe Federal Government would treat our activated Guard and Reserve \nemployees the same as State and local governments already do. Then the \nbill went to conference. Sadly, on a partisan rollcall vote that \nprovision was stripped out of the bill. Many of the same Senators who \nhave come to the floor talking about their devotion to our veterans \nwere not there when we needed them to keep this provision in our \nconference on the $87 billion appropriations.\n  I say to my colleagues on the floor, I am going to offer this \nReservist Pay Security Act of 2003 again and again. To all my \ncolleagues who stand proudly behind the men and women in uniform, let \ntheir votes reflect it. Let their votes reflect that we will treat our \nFederal employees as State and local government already treat their \nown. That is only fair.\n  As America becomes more dependent on the Guard and Reserve, it is \nonly right and just that we stand behind not only the men and women in \nuniform, but their families so that their income is sustained while \nthey are serving our country and risking their lives.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nColorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, I understand the Senator from Delaware \nhas a comment. He is trying to catch a train this evening and wants to \ntake 1 or 2 minutes to comment. I ask unanimous consent that we let him \nspeak, if it is OK with the chairman.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I certainly want to accommodate our \ncolleague from Delaware. He has been a stalwart on defense. He was a \nnaval aviator when I was privileged to be Secretary of the Navy. I am \nhappy to accommodate him, I say to my Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I think we all appreciate that accommodation. I ask that \naccommodation be made without taking time away from the Senator from \nColorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I inquire of my colleague from Delaware, \nhow much time does he desire?\n  Mr. CARPER. Two minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Take up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I thank the chairman, and I thank \nSenator Levin and my other colleagues who graciously have given me a \nfew moments.\n  We have been reminded during the course of the Afghanistan war and \nthe conflict in Iraq of the need for our ability to deliver large \nnumbers of personnel, equipment, and weaponry to the front. We deliver \na lot of those items by sealift, and we deliver a good deal of it by \nair. Some 30 percent of the equipment going into Iraq comes through \nDover Air Force Base. The aircraft that fly a lot of that equipment are \nC-5As and C-5Bs.\n  Several of us on the floor this evening have facilities that either \nhave C-5s already operating out of them or will. There is a provision \nthat has been agreed to in this conference report\n\n[[Page S14425]]\n\nwhich I think is worth touching on because I think it is of critical \nimportance. The issue is how do we best provide for cost-effective \nairlift in the 21st century.\n  We have created an air bridge between this country and other fronts, \nincluding Iraq and Afghanistan. The air bridge includes C-5As and B's, \nit includes C-17s, and it includes C-130s in the theater. C-5As were \nbuilt in the 1970s. C-5Bs were built in the 1980s, and the C-17s are \nliterally being built today. The C-130s, some are old and some actually \nquite new. The C-5As that were built in the 1970s are believed to have \na useful life on their wings and their fuselages for probably another \n40 years. The same is true of the C-5Bs which are somewhat newer than \nthe C-5As.\n\n  The House of Representatives had language that said that before we \nretire indiscriminately, prematurely, C-5As, we should allow a process \nto go forward which was agreed to in the earlier Defense authorization \nbills. In those earlier Defense authorization bills, we said we wanted \nthe Air Force to install avionics modernization packages in three C-5s, \nalong with reengining three C-5s, the hydraulic systems, new landing \ngear systems, new engines in one C-5A and two C-5Bs, and before we \nretire prematurely any more C-5As we should first go through that \nprocess on those three planes and flight test them in order to find out \nif those changes to the aircraft actually raise the aircraft readiness \nperformance of C-5As and C-5Bs.\n  I thank the chairman and Senator Levin for agreeing to the House \nlanguage, so that now we will go forward. The Air Force will have the \nopportunity to install both the avionics modernization package and the \nreengining package in one C-5A and two C-5Bs. The Air Force will have a \nchance to fully test those packages before we retire any additional C-\n5As.\n  There is report language in the Senate version of this bill that also \nsays we need to update our estimate for what we need for airlift going \nforward in this 21st century. I think when we take that language and \nput it with the provision that says we are not going to prematurely \nretire any C-5As beyond the initial 14 that have been earmarked for \nearly retirement, that gives us a very good package and one that I \nthink enables us to better determine how do we cost-effectively provide \nairlift in the 21st century.\n  Again, I express my thanks to the committee and to our friends in the \nHouse for agreeing to this compromise. I think it is a good position \nfor us, for the Air Force. I think it is a very good position for us \nwho are interested in trying to find out how do we provide cost-\neffective airlift in the 21st century.\n  Again, I thank my friend from Colorado, Senator Allard, for yielding \nand the chairman and ranking member for allowing me to speak these \nwords.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If Senator Allard would yield for 15 additional seconds.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I would be glad to yield for 15 seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I commend the Senator from Delaware. His leadership on \nthis issue is what really led to the result which was achieved, which \nhe so accurately described. We have taken a logical step. The House \napproach to it was surely the lift that was needed, but the Senator \nfrom Delaware added a great deal to it and brought to our attention \nrepeatedly this issue. I am glad the result is as satisfactory as it \nis.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, I thank the Chair and note in a public \nway that it is an honor and privilege to serve with the Chair on the \nArmed Services Committee. I think it is entirely appropriate that the \nChair is having an opportunity to preside in the Senate at the time \nwhen we have this important legislation affecting the armed services \npersonnel. The Chair is a hard worker on the Armed Services Committee.\n  I rise to discuss the conference report for fiscal year 2004, the \nDepartment of Defense authorization bill. Before I discuss those \nprovisions that I think deserve this body's attention, I believe it is \nimportant to note how difficult this particular conference was.\n  In fact, it is only because of the patience and perseverance \nexhibited by the distinguished senior Senator from Virginia that we \neven have an authorization bill. Senator Warner has worked tirelessly \nover the last 4 months to come up with a compromise bill that this body \ncould approve. He acted with integrity and poise despite the \ndifficulties. I commend him for his efforts and thank him for his \ncommitment to the Armed Services Committee and to our men and women in \nuniform.\n  I believe it is appropriate for this body to consider this important \nlegislation today. The soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines who have \nkept this country free and preserved the peace are owed a debt of \ngratitude by all others who have the privilege of living in America.\n  We in America are blessed with freedoms unattainable in any other \ncountries, rights inconceivable elsewhere, and liberties guaranteed by \nour way of life. Our grandfathers fought in World War I hoping their \nsons would never have to. Our fathers again fought in World War II, \nKorea, and Vietnam keeping the same hope alive. We have recently fought \nin Iraq, Somalia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, and now again in Iraq. We hope \nthat as we battle the war against terrorism, we can see the end of war \nas we know it and never have to send our sons and daughters into harm's \nway again.\n  Until that time, though, the least we can do to respect their service \nis honor them on Veterans Day. The least the Senate can do is approve \nthis legislation which will do much to ensure our men and women in \nuniform are well equipped, well trained, and well provided for.\n  The conference report before us authorizes $401 billion for the \nDepartment of Defense and Department of Energy nuclear weapons \nprograms. It also authorizes multiyear incremental procurement funding \nfor the Air Force's planned acquisition of 100 tanker aircraft, which I \nwill discuss in greater detail momentarily.\n  The first priority of this bill is to address many of the quality-of-\nlife issues facing our troops today. It includes an average 4.1 percent \npay increase and provides higher targeted raises for midcareer service \nmembers. The agreement also expands the benefits provided for disabled \nmilitary retirees. Veterans who are more than 50 percent disabled or \nreceive their disability during combat operations will now be able to \ncurrently receive retirement pay and disability compensation.\n  On top of this, the bill authorizes certain special imminent danger \nand separation pay through next year. I support these benefits and \nbelieve they will greatly assist those who are courageously serving our \ncountry.\n  Now I will turn to provisions in this bill relating to our country's \nmilitary service academies. Since last January, I have been heavily \ninvolved in addressing the allegations of sexual assault at the U.S. \nAir Force Academy. This fine institution, which has produced thousands \nof outstanding Air Force officers, has been seemingly besieged by a \nculture of indifference.\n  Over the last 10 years, dozens of female cadets have been sexually \nassaulted but only a few have reported the crime and even fewer have \nreceived the kind of support and assistance needed to overcome such a \ntraumatic experience.\n  In fact, some victims said they were punished for reporting a sexual \nassault and many feared they would be punished if they did report the \ncrime. Nearly 65 female cadets came to my office and met with me and my \nstaff. I cannot express enough my admiration for their willingness to \ntell their stories and for their determination to change the climate at \nthe academy.\n  I have also been very pleased by the Air Force's response to these \nallegations. Immediately after I notified the Air Force, Secretary \nRoche and General Jumper ordered a comprehensive investigation. This \ninvestigation discovered a systemic lack of coordination of activities \nand information, inadequate command involvement, considerable cadet \nreluctance to report sexual assaults, and failed gender climate \nsurveys.\n  The investigation led to the Air Force's agenda for change, new \nleadership at the academy, and a renewed emphasis on sexual assault \nprevention and response. Earlier in the year, Congress also created an \nindependent panel to look into these allegations. That\n\n[[Page S14426]]\n\npanel, headed by former Congresswoman Tillie Fowler, found that Air \nForce headquarters needed to better oversee the activities of the \nacademy, that the board of visitors needed to be more involved, and \nthat the Department of Defense inspector general's office should fully \ninvestigate the role former academy and Air Force headquarters \nofficials played in creating the climate that permitted these assaults.\n  Both the Air Force's investigation and the Fowler Commission \nrecommended a number of important legislative changes. I am pleased \nmany of these changes have been incorporated in the legislation before \nus. For example, each service Secretary must now prescribe a policy on \nsexual assault that promotes awareness of the crime, informs cadets of \nprocedures for reporting, and describes procedures for disciplinary \naction. Perhaps more importantly, each service is now required to \nconduct an annual assessment on the effectiveness of the school's \nsexual assault program.\n  These assessments will help academy and headquarters leaders, as well \nas the Board of Visitors of each academy, in their effort to measure \nwhether these programs are working.\n  The bill also includes a requirement for an Air Force study on the \npermanent professors and gives the Air force the authority to appoint a \ndean from an expanded pool of candidates.\n  I would like to take a moment to thank the chairman, Senator Warner, \nfor his assistance in addressing these problems. From the beginning, \nSenator Warner worked with me to encourage the Air Force to \nappropriately respond to these allegations. His interest and dedication \nto fixing this problem were instrumental and invaluable. I have deeply \nappreciated his counsel and his willingness to devote the Committee's \ntime to this issue.\n  As chairman of the subcommittee on strategic forces with oversight \nover national security space, strategic weapons, ballistic missiles, \nand nuclear weapons, I would like to take some time to discuss some \nimportant provisions in this conference report relating to these \nissues. Before I do so, though, let me first thank Senator Bill Nelson, \nthe ranking member for the strategic forces subcommittee, for working \nso closely with me throughout the year. While we did not agree on every \nprovision, his assistance and contribution helped make this a better \nbill.\n  Let me now address several specific provisions.\n  With regard to enhancing U.S. national security space capabilities, \nthe conference report establishes a policy that states that the Nation \nwill have an assured space launch capability, promotes the development \nof an effective space cadre, and authorizes additional funds for space \ncontrol initiatives.\n  With regard to protecting our country from a ballistic missile \nattack, the conference report authorizes $9.1 billion for ballistic \nmissile defense research, development, and procurement. Specifically, \nthe report authorized an additional $100 million for ground-based mid-\ncourse system and $90 million for the PAC-3 Patriot terminal missile \ndefense system.\n  With regard to improving the Department of Defense intelligence \ngathering capability, the conference report requires the Secretary of \nDefense to establish an intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance \ncouncil to develop a roadmap to fully integrate the ISR efforts of the \nmilitary services. The report also prohibits the National Imagery and \nMapping Agency from spending more than 10 percent of its commercial \nspace imagery budget on other important but unrelated projects.\n  Lastly, the conference report includes a number of provisions that \nwill greatly improve our ability to deter a possible nuclear attack. \nOne provision repeals the ban on research and development on low-yield \nnuclear weapons. Another requires the Secretary of Energy to achieve \nand maintain the ability to conduct an underground nuclear test within \n18 months. Finally, the report authorizes $21 million for advance \nconcept initiatives, of which $15 million is directed toward continuing \na study on the robust nuclear earth penetrator.\n  I again wish to commend Senator Warner, his staff director Judy \nAnsley, and the rest of his staff for their outstanding work on this \nconference report. I understand that this was one of the most difficult \nconferences in which Senator Warner has ever had to participate. I was \nparticularly impressed by the way he addressed the Air Force's proposed \nlease of 100 tanker aircraft. Like many other Members, I was greatly \ntroubled by the budget implications of this lease. Senator Warner's \ncompromise agreement will get the Air Force the tankers it needs while \nsaving the American taxpayer nearly $4.0 billion. I supported the \ncompromise and see it as another example of Senator Warner's \ndetermination to do what is best for our men and women in uniform.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank our distinguished and very valued colleague of \nthe committee, Senator Allard, for his remarks and his work on this \nbill.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Chairman. It has been a delight working with \nhim.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the distinguished ranking member and I are \ntrying to work out accommodations for a number of Senators. The Senator \nfrom Hawaii will speak next, followed by the Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Senator Byrd is here and has been waiting. I want to see \nif we can figure out how to accommodate also Senator Dayton, I believe, \ntonight.\n  Mr. WARNER. Let me suggest the following. I will not ask for \nunanimous consent.\n  Mr. LEVIN. And perhaps Senator Nelson.\n  Mr. WARNER. I suggest our leadership, together with the managers of \nthe bill, consider that, following Senator Collins, then we could go \ninto a period of morning business and give Mr. Byrd the time he is \nseeking, and then Senators could come over as in morning business, \nspeak on behalf of the bill, and ask their statements be printed in the \ncolloquy prior to the unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We are going to check with Senator Nelson at this point to \nsee what his intention is. We believe Senator Bill Nelson wants to come \ntonight. Whether it is morning business or the bill, that should not be \nconsequential although perhaps for some reason it might be. I want to \nfinish my remarks also. Senator Pryor we want to accommodate in the \nmorning, as we have spoken about. Perhaps we can work all this out as \nSenator Akaka has the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. I have been notified Senator Sessions is on the way to \nbring his important contribution to this bill.\n  At this time I ask those Senators anxious to work with this tentative \nagreement to so advise the managers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from Hawaii is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I fully support our men and women who have \nserved and are currently serving in our Armed Forces. As the ranking \nmember of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness and \nManagement Support, I have worked with my colleagues to ensure that our \nmilitary members are provided with appropriate resources and equipment \nto successfully accomplish their mission. I wish to state my \nappreciation for being a member of this committee, and to thank the \nSenator from Virginia for his leadership. I commend the Senator from \nMichigan for his guidance and leadership as well, and I also wish to \nthank my subcommittee chairman, the Senator from Nevada, Mr. Ensign, \nfor working with me on readiness issues.\n  I also commend the committee members of both sides of the aisle, and \nalso subcommittee members, for a job well done.\n  I am delighted to work with the Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins, \nchair of the Governmental Affairs Committee, as we deal with some of \nthese issues.\n  I rise today, however, to express my disappointment with the outcome \nof the conference report on several issues. I am particularly concerned \nwith the DOD civilian personnel system. We worked on this issue very \nhard in the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs and came up with a \nbipartisan approach that the committee endorsed with a 10-to-1 vote. \nOur approach would have provided DOD important new flexibility to \nmanage its workforce, but it would have done so in a manner that \npreserved important safeguards for DOD employees.\n\n[[Page S14427]]\n\n  This balanced approach was supported by a substantial majority of the \nSenate conferees. Unfortunately, we understand that there was stiff \nopposition from the House conferees and the administration, which \ninsisted that the Secretary of Defense be given unilateral authority to \ndecide what protections, if any, would be available to Federal \nemployees. We were able to win some significant concessions. The \nconference report includes Senate provisions that would preserve the \nright of individual employees to appeal adverse personnel actions to \nthe Merit Systems Protection Board and the courts; direct DOD to \nmaintain current funding levels for civilian pay; provide specific \nguidance on the implementation of a pay-banding system; and require DOD \nto work with the Office of Personnel Management on the implementation \nof the new system.\n\n  With these protections built in, I would like to be in a position to \nsupport the civilian personnel provision. Unfortunately, I cannot, \nbecause of the outcome on the issue of collective bargaining.\n  Unlike the Homeland Security Act, this conference report would not \nauthorize the Secretary of Defense to waive Chapter 71 of title 5, \nwhich governs collective bargaining. These provisions remain in full \nforce and effect for DOD. However, the conference report does authorize \nthe Secretary of Defense to establish ``a labor relations system for \nthe Department of Defense to address the unique role that the \nDepartment's civilian workforce plays in supporting the Department's \nnational security mission.''\n  In general, the new labor relations system established by the \nDepartment must be consistent with Chapter 71, since Chapter 71 remains \nin effect. In a few areas, however, the conference report would \nspecifically override Chapter 71. For example, the conference report \nstates that the new labor relations system ``shall provide for \nindependent third party review of decisions, including defining what \ndecisions are reviewable by the third party, what third party would \nconduct the review, and the standard or standards for review.''\n  By giving the Secretary of Defense the authority to decide who \nreviews disputes, the issues to be reviewed, and the standard of \nreview, this bill appears to hand one party the final say on all labor \nand management issues. This language is inconsistent with the concept \nof good faith bargaining between equals.\n  At the same time the administration has asked us to establish a new \nNational Security Personnel System, it continues to pursue an \naggressive outsourcing agenda and to strongly resist cost of living \nincreases for Federal civilian employees. I am deeply concerned that \nthe administration's agenda of taking away employee's rights, giving \naway their jobs, and cutting their pay could have a real demoralizing \neffect on the DOD workforce that has done so much for our national \nsecurity for so long.\n  I am also disappointed by the outcome of the conference on \nenvironmental issues. In the past, our committee has worked on a \nbipartisan basis to ensure that DOD behaves in an environmentally \nresponsible manner, without being unduly hampered by environmental \nrequirements when it conducts essential military activities. This year, \nthe administration worked with the majority in both Houses to force \nthrough a series of provisions exempting the Department from basic \nenvironmental laws.\n  In particular, this conference report would amend the Endangered \nSpecies Act to exempt defense lands from critical habitat designations \nwithout establishing appropriate environmental safeguards, as the \nSenate bill would have done. It would authorize DOD to conduct \nactivities that have a significant potential to harm large numbers of \nmarine mammals without even applying for a permit and having the \nappropriate regulatory agencies review the proposed activities. It \nwould exempt Fort Huachuca in Arizona from the requirement for \ncumulative impact analyses under the Endangered Species Act. And it \nincludes language, which is not in either bill and not in the \njurisdiction of our Committee, that would direct the Army Corps of \nEngineers to issue new rules making it easier for private citizens to \navoid their obligation to preserve wetlands.\n  The military service chiefs have testified before our committee that \nour armed forces are more ready today than they have ever been before. \nThat is because the military services have gone the extra mile to find \nconstructive ways to comply with applicable laws and regulations with a \nminimum impact on training and readiness. It takes hard work with \nregulators and impacted communities on a case-by-case basis to achieve \nthese solutions, but the payoff comes in the credibility the department \nhas earned as a good neighbor and a faithful custodian of the public \nlands.\n  I am concerned that the exemptions included in this bill could begin \nto undermine the trust and cooperation on environmental issues that we \nhave worked so hard to build between the military and civilian \ncommunities over the years.\n  Finally, this bill includes deep cuts to essential military \noperations and maintenance accounts that I believe are misguided. \nDuring the committee's markup and floor consideration, I voiced my \nconcern that the proposed reductions in the military services' working \ncapital funds were so drastic that they may harm military readiness.\n  The working capital funds are a complicated but crucial financial \ntool the military services use to ensure adequate supplies of spare \nparts, both now and in the future. Deep cuts to those accounts cause \nfluctuations in prices that units do not have the funds to pay for, \nwhich puts readiness in jeopardy and is a disservice to the men and \nwomen that serve. I am pleased that this bill represents a slight \nimprovement from the large reductions taken in the Senate bill, but \nremain concerned about the almost $1 billion the conference report \ntakes out of working capital fund accounts.\n  I was also disappointed by the $150 million reduction in base \noperating support taken from the Air Force; these funds are critical to \nthe upkeep and maintenance of Air Force bases. Without them, basic \nrepairs will be foregone and service members' quality of work and life \nwill suffer. This is not the right message to send to our air men and \nwomen as they continue to make huge sacrifices for our Nation.\n  I am pleased by the military construction provisions that we were \nable to include in the conference report. In support of our defense \ninfrastructure as well as the quality of life for our service men and \nwomen, this year's bill includes $9.7 billion for military construction \nin the U.S. and overseas, $5.7 billion will fund mission-critical \nprojects which support important activities such as training, \ndeployment, and ongoing operations. An additional $1 billion will fund \nfamily housing projects which will directly impact the quality of life \nfor our servicemen and women and their families.\n  Although this year's bill funds many essential construction projects \nworldwide, it also makes significant cuts to numerous overseas projects \nrequested by the Department, specifically in Germany and Korea. Final \ndecisions have not yet been made regarding our overseas presence, and \nthe reductions in this bill potentially send the wrong message to our \nU.S. forces fighting overseas. We ensure that we continue to support \nour men and women overseas to accomplish their missions and that we \noffer them the quality of life they deserve.\n\n  Again, I strongly support the men and women who serve in our Armed \nForces. I also support the 750,000 Federal employees who play a crucial \nrole in ensuring that our Armed Forces have the equipment, training, \nand resources they need to accomplish their mission. I believe it is \nimperative that DOD work closely with communities surrounding military \ninstallations and training ranges to achieve a positive working \nrelationship based on mutual trust, understanding, and respect. For \nthese reasons, I am greatly disappointed with the outcome of the \nNational Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2004.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Before Senator Collins is recognized, I thank Senator \nAkaka for his statement and, more importantly, for his service on the \ncommittee as ranking member of the Readiness and Management Support \nSubcommittee. That subcommittee has\n\n[[Page S14428]]\n\nsome of the most difficult issues which we have had to deal with this \nyear; a number dealt with in ways I did not particularly agree with, \neither. As the Senator from Hawaii indicated, he had concern on a \nnumber of them, as well. Without his service on that subcommittee, we \nwould have had many more problems than we ended up having. We are very \nappreciative and grateful for the service he provided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after I have \nconcluded my remarks and the senior Senator from West Virginia has \nconcluded his remarks that the Senator from Georgia, Senator Chambliss, \nbe recognized for 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, let me begin my remarks this evening by \ncommending the chairman and the ranking member of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee. Both Senator Warner and Senator Levin care deeply \nabout strengthening our national defense and about supporting the men \nand women who wear the uniform. It has been a great pleasure to work \nwith both of my colleagues. I particularly appreciate their work on \nwhat was an extremely challenging conference with the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Personally, I have very mixed feelings about this conference \nagreement, but on balance I believe it deserves our support. For \nexample, it provides much-needed support for naval shipbuilding, it \nprovides a pay raise and improved health care benefits for our men and \nwomen in uniform, it provides real progress in providing concurrent \nreceipt to our disabled veterans. It has many provisions that are \nabsolutely essential, particularly in this time of war.\n  On the other hand, I am disappointed, for example, with the \nenvironmental provisions that have been included in this conference \nreport. I felt the Senate version of the DOD authorization struck a far \nbetter balance than the provisions in the House bill, or even the \ncompromises that are included in this conference report. I believe it \nis a false choice to say we have to sacrifice environmental protection \nin order to allow our troops to get the training they need. I much \npreferred the Senate version in this regard.\n  What I most want to comment on tonight are the Civil Service \nprovisions that have been included in this legislation. The primary \ngoal of our Federal personnel system should be the recruitment and \nretention of the highest quality workforce to serve the citizens of the \nUnited States. Unfortunately, the current antiquated system does not \nalways achieve that goal. It has become too cumbersome for agencies to \nhire good employees, particularly those with specialized skills or \nexpertise. It has become too difficult to reward outstanding workers, \nand it has become almost impossible to remove poor performers. Clearly, \nreforms are needed.\n  Earlier this year, the Department of Defense delivered to Congress a \nfar-reaching proposal to restructure the Department's civilian \npersonnel system. Unfortunately, the Department's proposal went too far \nand it did not include important safeguards to protect good employees.\n  To strike a better balance, I worked hard with several of my \ncolleagues, including Senator Levin and Senator Voinovich, to craft an \nalternative that would give the Department of Defense the authority it \nneeded to create a more responsive system while providing vital \nprotections for the civil servants who work for the Department. The \nstakes in this debate were very high because the Department employs \nsome 735,000 civilian employees. That is approximately a quarter of the \nentire workforce. So we needed to get this right. We needed to come up \nwith a system that was more flexible but that was also fair to the \ncivilian employees of the Department.\n  Title 5 of the United States Code sets forth the rights and the \nduties of Federal workers and defines their relationship with \nmanagement. It is a series of laws committed to the jurisdiction of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee which I am privileged to chair. I take \nour responsibility for these laws very seriously. In fact, I would have \nmuch preferred for this matter to be addressed through the normal \ncommittee process. Indeed, the Governmental Affairs Committee, as \nSenator Akaka mentioned in his remarks, approved a carefully drafted \nbill by a vote of 10 to 1. This was a bipartisan bill that Senator \nLevin helped to craft, along with Senator Voinovich and myself. It had \nthe cosponsorship of several members of the committee including Senator \nAkaka, Senator Sununu, and several others.\n\n  Unfortunately, the House acted to include this issue as part of the \nDefense Department authorization bill and thus that prompted the \nresolution of this important matter in conference.\n  This conference agreement, while by no means perfect, is a reasonable \ncompromise to the challenge of modernizing an outdated system while \nprotecting employees' rights. It is not as I would have drafted it. It \ndoes not represent fully the compromise so carefully crafted in a \nbipartisan manner by the Governmental Affairs Committee, the committee \nof jurisdiction. But we have included several important safeguards in \nthis conference report.\n  For example, employees subject to adverse personnel actions will have \nan independent appeals process and an independent third party will \nresolve collective bargaining disputes. These are two essential reforms \nthat were not included in the Department's original proposal.\n  Another very important provision in this bill has to do with the \ncollective bargaining rights of the Department's employees. The \nDepartment of Defense has repeatedly claimed it has no desire to waive \nthe collective bargaining rights of its employees. Indeed, the bill \nbefore the Senate specifically states the Department does not have the \nauthority to waive the chapter of title 5 that governs labor-management \nrelations. Thus, I fully expect the labor relations system developed by \nthe Department will abide by the principles enumerated in chapter 71, \nsuch as the duty to bargain in good faith--a duty that applies to both \nlabor and management, incidentally--and the prohibition against unfair \nlabor practices.\n  Furthermore, the Department's ability to change employee management \nrelations sunsets in 6 years, providing an additional check, another \nsafeguard, on the Department as it develops its labor relations system. \nWe put in specific language to require collaboration with the \nrepresentatives of employees to make sure this is a collaborative, \nrather than a confrontational, process.\n  In addition, the final bill does not include the unilateral waiver \nauthority sought by the Secretary which would have enabled the \nDepartment to waive the process for developing the system in the \ninterests of national security.\n  This actually was originally proposed by the Department and was a \ncompletely unilateral waiver that would have allowed the Secretary to \nwaive virtually all personnel laws and regulations. I am pleased we \nhave not included that authority. I do not think it is necessary, and \nit is contrary to the spirit of developing a modern personnel system in \na collaborative way with the employees of the Department.\n  The Governmental Affairs Committee will keep a very close eye on the \nDepartment of Defense as it develops the regulations to implement the \nnew national security personnel system to ensure a collaborative \nprocess that will lead to a modern, effective, and fair personnel \nsystem. Senators Levin, Voinovich, Sununu, Stevens, Akaka, Lieberman, \nand Chambliss, and I will work together with our colleagues who care \nabout this issue on both committees to ensure that the Department \ncreates a system that is consistent with the merit system principles \nafforded to other Federal employees.\n  The Office of Personnel Management will also play a crucial role in \nthe development of the system. And I trust that the Department will \nmake every effort to use the expertise of Director Kay Coles James and \nher staff.\n  Finally, I thank Senator Levin, who has worked so hard on this issue. \nAs the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and as \nthe senior member on the Governmental Affairs Committee, he, more than \nany other Member in this body, has unique experience and expertise \nwhich he brought to bear on this issue.\n  I also pay tribute to the chairman of the committee, Senator Warner, \nwho was very gracious in deferring to my\n\n[[Page S14429]]\n\nstrong interest in this area. He did allow and encourage me to take the \nlead in what were difficult negotiations with the administration and \nthe House on this issue.\n  In the end, the product is not the one I would have preferred, but it \ndoes represent a reasonable approach and one that I hope will be \nsuccessful in creating a modern, fair, and efficient personnel system \nfor the Department of Defense.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wonder if Senator Byrd will yield for \njust one moment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I am glad to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Collins. In her usual \nmodest way, she has given much too much credit to others for something \non which she deserves the lion's share of the credit, which is an \noutcome which is not what either she or I would have preferred but is \nfar closer to that outcome than would have been the case but for the \npersistence and--I will add the word here--courage of one of our \ncolleagues; that is, Senator Susan Collins of Maine.\n  The rights are protected here that are essential to employees that \nwill lead to greater collaboration between employees and the Defense \nDepartment because of her tenacity. I salute her for it and commend her \nfor it.\n  It was a pleasure to work with her, on a bipartisan basis, in the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee on the bill to which she has referred. \nHer outline of what was accomplished is indeed an accurate outline. I \nwill have more to say about that later. But in the meantime, I express \nmy gratitude to her. I think all of us, those of us who were even \nunaware of the outcome in any detail, will someday understand the \ncontribution Senator Collins has made to the personnel relations in \nthis Government, particularly in the Defense Department.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I begin by thanking the distinguished \nSenator from Virginia, Mr. Warner, and the equally distinguished \nSenator from Michigan, Mr. Levin, for their courtesies and \naccommodations to me on this occasion and on innumerable, innumerable \nprevious occasions as well.\n  We are now in the sixth week of fiscal year 2004 and the Congress has \nonly presented the President with 4 of the 13 appropriations bills. The \nthird continuing resolution under which most of the Government is \noperating expires on November 21. Regrettably, the Senate has yet to \napprove 3 of the 13 bills. The House and Senate Republican leaders have \nexpressed their intent to move to what has become known as an omnibus \nappropriations bill.\n  I hope that the Senate does not once again fall prey to this monster \nknown as an omnibus. An omnibus is a legislative creation without a \nmother or a father. It is more like a Frankenstein creature--a being \npatched together from old legislative body parts that don't quite fit.\n  And just as Dr. Frankenstein was quite surprised by the results of \nhis creation, so may we be startled by the results of ours. Hastily \ndrafted legislation, as Senators in this body well know, often has \nstrange and unintended consequences. This omnibus would include at \nleast three and as many as seven bills. It would be at least a $130 \nbillion ``Frankenstein'' of a bill, and no one knows what other \nappendages would be attached to it as the Republican leaders rush to \nclose out this session of Congress.\n  Under the cloak of a continuing resolution, the House has already \npassed just such a $190 billion omnibus bill that would fund 9 of the \n15 Departments.\n  In accordance with the Constitution, revenue bills must originate in \nthe House of Representatives and, by custom, most appropriations bills \nlikewise originate in the House, but under the guarantees of the \nConstitution, as those guarantees flowed from the Great Compromise of \nJuly 16, 1787, the Senate has the right to amend those revenue and \nappropriations bills, as in all other bills.\n  The House can open the door to legislation on an appropriations bill, \nbut if the Senate is denied the opportunity to consider amendments, or \nis severely limited in the number of amendments which it may consider, \nSenators are thereby denied the opportunity to offer amendments of \ntheir own and the potential for the achievement of truly good \nlegislation in the final result, is, accordingly, lessened. The \npeople's right to representation in the Senate would be denied and the \nlikelihood of legislative errors in the final product is increased.\n  I believe creating an omnibus bill would be a grave mistake. The \nFramers saw the Senate as a powerful check against an overreaching \nexecutive. If free and unlimited debate is bridled and the right of \nSenators to offer amendments is hindered or denied, is not the Senate's \npower to check the executive accordingly diminished?\n  Sadly, the House and Senate have resorted to omnibus bills many times \nin recent years. In January of this year, Congress produced a monstrous \n11-bill omnibus. For fiscal years 1996, 2000, and 2001, we produced \nomnibus bills that contained five bills each year. In fiscal year 1997, \nwe had a six-bill omnibus, and in fiscal year 1999, we had an eight-\nbill omnibus. Every one of these massive bills, written in the \ncompressed environment of a threatened Government shutdown, resulted in \nthe White House being at the table, writing our appropriations bills \nwith us.\n  Which party commands the White House at a given time should really \nmake no difference as to how we conduct our duties in the writing of \nappropriations bills. We are here to work with, but also to act as a \ncheck on the occupant of the White House, and to reflect the people's \nwill. We are not performing that watchdog function when we invite the \nWhite House behind closed doors.\n  I stood in this Senate and decried the omnibus bills during the last \nadministration. I do so again today. I deplore this process. Through \nthis process we, in effect, circumvent the supreme law of the land. We \ncircumvent the Constitution. Just as I expressed to the Senate during \nthe Clinton administration, by producing omnibus appropriations bills, \nwe blur and we blend the very clear lines of the separation of powers \nset out in our national charter. Instead we cook up an unsavory soup \nwhich will be force-fed to the American people in order to avoid a \ncompletely avoidable Government shutdown.\n  Between fiscal year 1986 and fiscal year 2003, 25 appropriations \nbills were incorporated into omnibus appropriations legislation without \nhaving first been considered by the Senate. For example, the Labor-HHS-\nEducation and Foreign Operations bills were included in omnibus \nlegislation four times each without having ever been considered by the \nSenate. The people are certainly entitled to a full debate when it \ncomes to deciding how to spend their tax dollars. After all, it is \ntheir money, isn't it. We heard that cry over and over again during the \ntax cut debate. May I observe that it is the people's money in an \nappropriations bill as well.\n  Some may believe that we have had so many omnibus bills in the last \ndecade that defaulting to an omnibus bill has become an inevitable part \nof the legislative process. I stand here today to tell the Senate that \nthis is not the case. In the 7\\1/2\\ years that I chaired the \nAppropriations Committee, from 1989 to 1994 and in 2001 and 2002, I \nnever resorted to an omnibus bill to complete the 13 bills. What it \ntakes to avoid the omnibus is the will and the drive to stand up for \nthe rights of all Senators to debate important legislation and to \ncomplete all 13 appropriations bills.\n  I commend Senator Ted Stevens for his valiant efforts to move the \nappropriations bills forward this year. I know that he would prefer \nthat the Senate debate the remaining bills as freestanding bills. The \nsituation that Chairman Stevens finds himself in is not of his making.\n  I must ask our leaders, why are we not considering appropriations \nbills the rest of this week? Why was the Senate in recess the week of \nOctober 6? Why was the Senate in recess for the entire month of August? \nWhy is the Senate taking 3 days this week to debate judicial \nnominations?\n  I am pleased that the Senate leaders have allowed the Senate to \ndebate the Transportation-Treasury bill, Foreign Operations and \nAgriculture bills. However, I remain concerned that there\n\n[[Page S14430]]\n\nwill be an effort to fold all of the remaining conference reports into \nan omnibus bill along with a polyglot of unknown authorization bills \nand the White House will dictate the contents of the bill.\n  I am concerned that once again the leadership will dictate to the \nAppropriations Committee that we include legislative matter in the \nomnibus bill that were not considered in the appropriations bills when \nthe bills were before the House or Senate. There are already rumors \nswirling that the FAA conference report, the Water Resources \nDevelopment bill, the Internet Tax Moratorium bill, and the healthy \nforests bill will be dropped into the omnibus. In 1999, the Senate \nreinstituted rule XVI, concerning legislating on an appropriations \nbill. In 2000, the Senate reinstituted rule XXVIII in order to avoid \nthe insertion of new matter in conference reports. I hope our leaders \nwill not allow these critical rules, which protect Members' rights to \ndebate, to be abused.\n  In the past, before rule XVI and rule XXVIII were reinstituted, \nomnibus bills were used to enact scores of such measures, such as \nMedicare givebacks legislation, a tax extenders law, Community Renewal \nTax Relief, Immigration Reform legislation, and debt collection \nlegislation. We should not travel this dark and pot-hole-riven road \nagain.\n  I am also concerned that the Senate has been passing bills \nwith promises of spending on critical programs that will prove to be \npure fantasy. The Senate approved $1.3 billion for veterans medical \ncare on the Iraq supplemental and in conference, what happened? It \ndisappeared, just like that. Houdini was there. The Senate, by a vote \nof 63-31, approved $1 billion to implement election reform legislation \nthat the President signed last October 2002 but he underfunded in his \nbudget. However, the Transportation-Treasury conferees have not been \ngiven any additional allocation to fund this increase. The Senate \napproved a $289 million increase for global AIDS, but the conference \nhas been given an allocation that will force them to reduce the Senate \nForeign Operations bill by $1.2 billion. The Labor-HHS-Education \nconferees are being told that they have to cut the Senate bill by $765 \nmillion. I hope the Senate will not fall back on an across-the-board \ncut on all programs to pay for these requirements. The bills are \nalready lean. Across-the-board cuts will hurt veterans programs, \nhomeland security programs, transportation programs and education \nprograms.\n\n  Last Spring, this Senate approved a budget resolution that put tax \ncuts first. We knew at that time that the budget resolution would \nexplode our deficits by placing tax cuts for the wealthy at the front \nof the line and funding for critical veterans programs, education \nprograms and homeland security programs were at the bottom of the pile. \nNow that decision is coming home to roost. I fear that the Senate will \nsoon be asked to sweep the bad news into a single, omnibus bill and \nship it down to the White House.\n  I call on our leaders to reject the easy allure of the Frankenstein \nomnibus. We should debate each of the remaining bills and send the \nPresident all 13 bills for his consideration, for his signature or for \nhis veto. The Senate is the upper house of a separate branch of \ngovernment, with institutional safeguards that protect the people's \nliberties. We should not fall prey to the omnibus. We should not allow \nenactment of massive, monstrous, omnibus appropriations bills to turn \nSenators into legislative automatons.\n  The Senate should rise up and reclaim its full constitutional powers \nby insisting that we will work whatever amount of time it takes, for \nwhatever number of days of the week it takes, to take up and pass all \nappropriations bills. We should never again revert to using an omnibus \nappropriations bill, which will likely come before this Senate in the \nform of an unamendable conference report. We should insist on a full \ndebate on all of the remaining appropriations bills and send the \nPresident 13 regular appropriations bills.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nGeorgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \nconference report on the fiscal year 2004 National Defense \nAuthorization Act. I believe this legislation does a tremendous amount \nof good for the men and women in our Nation's military and their \nfamilies, for America's veterans, and for our country's efforts in Iraq \nand Afghanistan.\n  I say a special thanks and congratulations to the Chairman from \nVirginia, Mr. Warner, as well as the Ranking Member, Senator Levin of \nMichigan, for their bipartisan spirit in the preparation of the \noriginal bill that came out of committee and passed on the floor of the \nSenate, as well as the preparation of the conference report, which we \nwill soon conclude. Senator Warner and Senator Levin showed strong \nleadership throughout the process.\n  I also wish to point out one particular thing that we in the \nPersonnel Subcommittee tried to address. It is pretty obvious, as we \nlook back at the current conflict in Iraq and the recent conflicts that \nhave taken place around the world, that we are calling more and more \nupon our Guard and Reserve to serve on a regular basis. It is incumbent \nupon us that we do more to equalize the status of the Guard and Reserve \nand the Active Force.\n  As the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Alexander, knows, he and I have \nconducted a number of hearings around the country relative to the \ntreatment of children of military families, including the Guard and \nReserve. We want to make sure that we are providing all the support \nnecessary for our Guard and Reserve as well as our Active Force to make \nsure that military families have the kind of quality of life we want \nthem to have and that they expected to have when they signed up for \nmilitary service.\n  As chairman of the Subcommittee on Personnel of the Committee on \nArmed Services, I am proud of the significant actions that we and our \nHouse colleagues have taken in this legislation to help ease the burden \nfor the brave soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines who serve our \nNation.\n  Specifically, the conference report authorizes an average 4.15 \npercent pay raise for service members and a higher, targeted pay raise \nup to 6.25 percent for mid-career personnel.\n  The conference report reduces service members' out-of-pocket housing \nexpenses and it authorizes payment of special pay for positions of \nunusual responsibility and of a critical nature for our Reserve \ncomponent, in order to ensure that Reserve and Guard personnel serving \nin command positions are recognized for their important contributions.\n  The report authorizes continued payment of special pay and bonuses \nfor both Active Duty and Reserve personnel. Payment of increased rates \nof the family separation allowance and special pay for duty involving \nhostile fire and imminent danger at the higher monthly rates designated \nearlier this year are continued.\n  The conference report also provides enhanced access to TRICARE for \nmembers of the Reserve components and their families, and in a \nmeaningful gesture of support for the invaluable contribution of our \nselected Reserve, it provides full commissary access for National Guard \nand Reserve personnel.\n  I want to particularly thank these Members of the Senate--Senators \nLandrieu, Graham, Allen, Alexander, and others--who have worked very \nclosely with this Member of the Senate, to ensure that the equalization \nof the Guard and Reserve with the active force continues to move in the \nright direction. As we ask our military men and women and their \nfamilies to do more and more, it is only right that we continue doing \nall we can for them. This important legislation continues to ensure \nthat we have the best trained, best prepared, and best equipped troops \nin the world.\n  I am very pleased that this conference report includes an agreement \non concurrent receipt, which I believe is long overdue and is directed \nat the most deserving disabled military retirees. The conference report \nwould extend concurrent receipt for all disabled veterans rated 50 \npercent and higher phased in over the next 10 years. It would also make \nspecial compensation for combat-related disabilities available to every \ndisabled military retiree--Active and Reserve--whose disability was \nincurred as a result of combat or combat preparation causes.\n\n[[Page S14431]]\n\n  In my 8 years in the House, prior to coming to the Senate this year, \nCongressman Mike Bilirakis of Florida, was the champion of concurrent \nreceipt. I commend him for his hard work on the House side and his \ndiligent efforts in ensuring that concurrent receipt is finally coming \nto be a realization. We have had the support of the chairman, and the \nranking member, as well as Senator Reid, who has been active on this \nissue. It is something that is long overdue, and it is time we gave our \nveterans the just reward they deserve.\n  American veterans have made great sacrifices so that we may live in a \nsafe and secure America. Military retirees who incurred disabilities \nbecause of their long and faithful service should no longer have to \nincur the offset of their retired pay. I view this provision as a \nhistoric step in the right direction to help this important class of \nveterans.\n  Last year, at the conclusion of the fiscal year 2003 authorization \nbill, the distinguished chairman said that what we did then with \nrespect to concurrent receipt was a step in the right direction and \nthat we would do more. To his credit, and the credit of the ranking \nmember, we are now following through with that commitment and moving in \nthe right direction. This is a huge step and we will continue to look \nafter our nation's disabled veterans in the future.\n  The conference report includes a provision that will enhance the \nprocess for achieving posthumous citizenship for deceased, non-citizen \nservice members that was sponsored by myself and Senator Zell Miller, \nmy colleague from Georgia. This legislation was inspired by the \ndramatic story of Diego Rincon of Conyers, Georgia, a non-citizen \nmember of our Armed Forces who was killed by a suicide bomber in Iraq. \nThis provision will instruct the Government to take steps immediately \nto facilitate and expedite the process of naturalization following an \nimmigrant soldier's death. Diego Rincon is a true American hero and \nthis legislation ensures that he will be honored as one.\n\n  Included in the conference report is authorizing language to delay \nthe decommissioning of Navy and Marine Corps Reserve aviation squadrons \nlike those at the Naval Air Station Atlanta. This provision, which was \nalso included in the final version of the fiscal year 2004 Defense \nAppropriations Act, prolongs the life of aviation squadrons at NAS \nAtlanta by preventing the Navy from decommissioning squadrons until the \nGeneral Accounting Office completes a review of the Navy's plan for \ntactical aviation integration. This measure restricts funds to be used \nto decommission aviation squadrons until February 1, 2004.\n  Senator Miller and I have worked hard all year to delay the \ndecommissioning of the aviation squadron at NAS Atlanta and I am \nparticularly pleased we were successful in postponing these decisions \nuntil the General Accounting Office conducts a thorough review of the \nNavy's plans for tactical air integration to ensure that it is done \nwisely and in a way that ensures the Navy's missions can be met long \nterm. NAS Atlanta Reserve fight squadrons stand ready with great \nprofessionalism for a speedy deployment to critical missions around the \nworld. This provision ensures NAS Atlanta will continue contributing to \nthe Navy's crucial missions and war fighting ability.\n  This legislation also authorizes the lease of up to 20 aerial \nrefueling aircraft by the Air Force and extends authority for the Air \nForce to purchase up to 80 tanker aircraft through a multi-year \nprocurement effort. This agreement will allow the Air Force to begin \nrecapitalizing their tanker fleet in a fiscally responsible manner and \nsave taxpayers approximately $4 billion over the original Department of \nDefense proposal.\n  This particular provision, Mr. President, has not been without \ncontroversy. I commend my colleague, Senator John McCain, for pointing \nout to the committee several important discrepancies in the process \nleading up to this tanker provision. The chairman and the ranking \nmember held several hearings on this subject and, for the right \nreasons, we were able to restructure this lease arrangement so that not \nonly will our men and women in the military benefit from the provision \nin the conference report, but the taxpayer will benefit as well.\n  The Defense Authorization Act includes several other military \nprograms that greatly benefit Georgia, as well as the country as a \nwhole. For instance, it includes: Funds to authorize the Air Force to \nbegin re-engining J-STARS aircraft. It includes $3.5 billion for 22 FA-\n22 aircraft, the next tactical fighter jet for the U.S. Air Force; $336 \nmillion for five C-130 aircraft, as part of a multi-year buy \narrangement; $931 million to convert two Trident ballistic missile \nsubmarines into guided missile submarines, one of which will be \nstationed at Kings Bay Naval Base in Georgia; $2.1 billion for 11 C-17 \naircraft, under, again, our continuing multi-year contract, which, for \nthe first time in the history of the United States Air Force, we have \noperated in a businesslike manner from a procurement standpoint; $19.7 \nmillion to accelerate the C-5 aircraft avionics modernization programs; \nand an important provision aimed at ensuring that Army or Air National \nGuard personnel may effectively command Active Duty personnel when they \nare entrusted with command of a unit composed of both active duty and \nGuard personnel. This provision will directly benefit the command \nrelationships and operations of the 116th Air Control Wing at Robins \nAir Force Base that flies and operates J-STARS aircraft.\n  Mr. President, I believe this conference report does a tremendous \namount of good for our Nation and, most importantly, for the brave men \nand women who are serving our Nation overseas and at home. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the conference report and again, I commend \nSenator Warner and Senator Levin for their strong leadership.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nGeorgia, first, for his work throughout the year on this bill. I \nlistened very carefully. He reflects a lot of hard work in his \ncomments. I thank him for his service on this committee.\n  We are basically rotating. The distinguished ranking member has \nyielded his slot at this time to the distinguished Senator from \nAlabama. But after that, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from \nMichigan be recognized for such time as he desires to complete his \ncomments on this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, before the Senator starts, we urge any \nother Senators to kindly contact the managers because in consultation \nwith the leadership, we are proceeding to conclude this debate.\n  Mr. LEVIN. While the chairman is on that point, Mr. President, I \nunderstand there will be two more Senators in addition to me on this \nside tonight who will have remarks on the bill.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague. I know of an additional Senator, \nthe Senator from North Carolina, who I believe will be coming over very \nshortly. That will be three Senators we know of desiring to make \nremarks. I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. TALENT). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, it has been a great honor and a thrill \nfor me to serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee under the \nleadership of Senator Warner and Senator Levin. They are the great \nprofessionals in this Senate. At the beginning of our Conference there \nwere very difficult and challenging issues that looked as if they could \nnot be settled, and reasonable minds could not reach an accord. But, as \nSenator Warner and Senator Levin continued to pursue the issues and \nworked hard on them, realizing that we had a goal and a responsibility \nto pass this FY04 Defense Authorization Bill, the conferees managed to \nreach agreements which I believe are sound.\n  The bill before us today is a good step forward for America, for the \nstrength of this country's defense, and for the men and women in \nuniform.\n  Today is Veterans Day. Some said we should not be here, but I think \nit is quite appropriate that while our soldiers are in the field today, \nnot taking a holiday in Baghdad, or in Tikrit or Mosul or in Basra or \nacross the border in Afghanistan, we in the United States Senate have \nwork to do with regard to our Defense bill. It is quite appropriate we \nare here today and moving forward, providing for a 4.1 percent\n\n[[Page S14432]]\n\npay raise, and higher pay raises for certain specialities and for mid-\ngrade personnel.\n  We continue today to see good things in our military which is fast \napproaching a transformed military. All of us are watching very closely \nthose changes and the recruiting and retention figures of our forces, \nbut to date the numbers look good in both categories.\n  I met earlier today with a United States Army Lieutenant Colonel from \nthe 173rd Airborne Brigade at Walter Reed who was injured last month in \nIraq and is now recuperating from his combat wounds. He told me when \nhis battalion were taking the highest casualties, they also had the \nhighest reenlistment rate. He said his soldiers, his young men, are \nwarriors and he made that statement with the greatest passion. He was \nso very, very proud of them. You could sense it and see it in his eyes.\n  I express my appreciation to Senator Warner and Senator Levin for the \ngreat work they have done. I thank Judy Ansley, our committee staff \ndirector; Bruce Hock and Tom MacKenzie, who helped me so much on the \nAirland Subcommittee I chair. All in all, we have had a good year and \nmade great progress. We have such talented professional, decent, honest \nmen and women who lead and our part of our armed services staff.\n  I want to make a particular note of appreciation for Archie Galloway \non my staff. Archie is a retired Lieutenant Colonel, a Ranger. He \nserved in the 101st Airborne Division. He has been a constant adviser, \nfriend, and counselor on these issues. He really helps me to do what is \nbest for America as we moved forward on these issues.\n  I am also very proud of our Guard and Reserve units and the men and \nwomen who serve in them. I served 13 years in the Army Reserve. Alabama \nhas a tremendous National Guard and Army reserve presence and \ncapability. These soldiers are serving with distinction. I believe the \nreserves will soon have 40 percent of the personnel in Iraqi theater.\n  I visited Iraq last August and visited two of the three Alabama \nNational Guard MP units assigned around Baghdad. Almost half of the men \nand women in our Alabama MP units are full-time professional police \nofficers, sheriff's deputies, and State troopers in their public life \nback home in Alabama. They are superbly qualified for the job and the \nchallenges ahead of them. They are taking risks every day working with \nthe local Iraqi police trying to identify, prosecute, and arrest people \nwho are committing terrorist acts. They are trying to knock down crime \nthroughout the country of Iraq and they are doing a superb job.\n  I would like to briefly mention the job our Airland Subcommittee \naccomplished during this year and during the conference. Of the $401 \nbillion provided by this bill, the Airland Subcommittee managed \napproximately $25 billion in procurement and $15 billion in research \nand development (RDT). We took our tasks very seriously. These are \nvery large sums of money, in two very important accounts. We worked \nhard on each issue. Airland responsibilities extend to all the \ntransformational issues in the military, large and small. Most notable \nis the Army's Future Combat Systems (FCS). The Army's goal is to create \na new, more versatile, capabilities based system that can operate in \nthe future across a wide variety of mission areas. Even though the Army \nwill be reporting in three different lines in the future, the work \ncontinues and must continue to its inevitable conclusion.\n\n  Time is short, relatively speaking, for the transformation to be \naccomplished. Rogue states and more capable adversaries loom on the \nhorizon. We need to constantly ask ourselves: Is our military, the one \nwhich exists today, perfectly configured to meet this threat or can we \ncontinue to transform it and make it better able to meet the threat in \nthe future?\n  Secretary Rumsfeld is a man who believes in asking tough questions \nabout the future and taking the action today that will transform our \nmilitary for the future. People have different ideas as to precisely \nhow to achieve that goal. But, I believe this Congress and this \nSecretary of Defense, and I believe this President of the United \nStates, are committed to making sure we succeed.\n  I was at a NATO conference in Europe not too long ago. The French \nrapporteur who was reporting on the war in Iraq for the conference \nshared some thoughts with us. He said the thing they learned most, and \nit was most clear during the war in Iraq, is that a well-trained, \ndisciplined, technologically advanced military will defeat a much \nlarger military not so advanced. That fact is absolutely clear.\n  We used 500,000 troops in the first Gulf War, Operation Desert Storm, \njust to remove Saddam Hussein from Kuwait. In Operation Iraqi Freedom \n(OIF), we defeated the entire Iraqi Army with less than 250,000 troops. \nWe now have about 130,000 troops in Iraq. We have coalition support \nfrom the British and numerous other countries, but our personnel now \nare at about 130,000.\n  In Afghanistan, we were able to bring down the Taliban Government \ntogether with coalition forces. That cruel government was harboring and \nsupporting al-Qaida and was also providing the training grounds for \nthem to attack the United States. We defeated Taliban and al-Quaida \nforces with, I recall, no more than 4,000 troops US forces on the \nground, using high-tech air support, special forces, and employing \nspecial operations of all kinds. We all know the story of the soldier \non horseback talking to a B-52 at 35,000 feet calling in 2,000-pound \nbombs to within 30 feet of any spot he needed to hit. That is a new \nkind of warfare. That is truly transformational. We need to adjust to \nit and make sure we are fully prepared to handle the next phase of \nemerging technologies, the next phase of emerging training \nopportunities, and the next phase of initiative our men and women in \nuniform bring to the battlefield.\n  There are a lot of things in the bill which we all are proud of \ntonight. The concurrent receipt progress we have been trying to make is \na big step in this legislation, and there are a number of other \nbenefits for our military men and women that are important.\n  As a result of my visits earlier today and last month to Walter Reed, \nwe discovered a problem impacting families when a soldier is facing \nimminent death. The military tries often to retire that person because \nthey can receive better benefits. It is awfully grim, unpleasant, and \nwrong to bring a family into that situation. In this bill we fixed that \nprocess with a modifying provision. Some of the things being forced \nupon our military families in an imminent death situation are no longer \nrequired. Our doctors and our soldiers no longer have to call families \nto discuss imminent death retirement measures; rather, they can \nconcentrate on the necessary lifesaving measures which are so \nimportant.\n  We also have better benefits in this bill for our soldiers who are \nkilled in combat.\n  Within the Airland Subcommittee jurisdiction, I would just mention a \nfew things that I think are quite significant as we go forward. We have \n$705 million for the joint direct attack munition for the Navy and Air \nForce. This is the famous JDAM. These were the bombs I mentioned \nearlier that can hit within 30 feet of a target using a global \npositioning satellite (GPS) guidance system. We need plenty of these \nmunitions. JDAMS are the bread and butter of our Naval and Air Force \nbombers today. I believe this bill has gone a long way toward ensuring \nthat we have adequate supplies to meet the challenges in the future.\n  Frankly, if we err however, we ought to err on the side of having far \ntoo many JDAMS. We should not have anything less than absolutely what \nwe need at any given time to defend the just interests of the United \nStates.\n  We moved forward on the FA 22. This new aircraft is so important. \nThere was a challenge earlier this year however. We challenged the \ncontractor. The Subcommittee was not happy with the progress the \ncontractor had been making. We had program hearings and DOD testimony. \nWe heard from witnesses and then we proposed reductions to the program. \nIn the end, we ended up reducing the FA 22 program by $160 million. We \nalready believe, from the time those hearings took place in the early \npart of the year, that the contractor is making good progress in \ndealing with the problems and issues that were previously plaguing the \nprogram and slowing it down. We believe they are going\n\n[[Page S14433]]\n\nto continue to make good progress. I hope so. If not, we will be \nchallenging them again next year.\n  We also dealt with the Boeing tanker lease. That was a matter Senator \nMcCain raised early this year. He challenged the way the Department of \nDefense and the Air Force were planning to fund 100 new Boeing 767 \naircraft. He believed that the way that was being handled was not good \nfor the taxpayers. So we went through a long process of debate, IG and \nGAO evaluations of the funding process. In the end, the committee \nconcluded that the program, as proposed by the administration, was not \nthe best way to fund these aircraft.\n  We therefore came up with a program to lease 20 767's and go forward \nto purchase the remaining 80. This change in procurement and leasing \nwill save, we believe, $4 billion dollars. I salute Senator McCain for \nhis leadership on this effort, and I also appreciate the great work of \nboth Senator Warner and Senator Levin in reaching this new plan that I \nbelieve will work to the benefit of the Air Force and the taxpayers.\n  Another of the subcommittee issues addressed the fleet of HUMVEES \nfound throughout the force structure. One of the things I learned in \nAugust while visiting units in Iraq is that many of the Humvees \nutilized for moving our soldiers around the battlefield are the light \nskinned, unarmed, and vulnerable Humvee models which are quite \nsusceptible to small arms fire. This bill provides additional monies \nfor the up-armored version, as they call it, Humvee.\n  Just this morning I was at the Walter Reed Army medical center \nmeeting with PFC Chris Busby a military policeman from Alabama. He had \nsevere injuries to his lower leg and one of his arms. He said he was in \nhis Humvee, had his arm and his leg out the door, and a mortar round \nexploded nearby. It injured his arm and leg. He told me, without my \nasking: If I had not been in an up-armored Humvee, I may not be here \ntoday. Grenades, mines, and all of those are less effective against an \nup-armored Humvee. We need more of them, particularly in an environment \nsuch as Iraq.\n  We also provided funds for friend-or-foe equipment to try to avoid \nfriendly fire problems. We also provided $60 million for the EA6B \naircraft outer wing panels. I discovered after talking with senior Navy \nofficials that we are having problems with these aircraft from stress. \nThese funds will do a lot to fix the operational deficiencies of those \nplanes.\n  We also provided $70 million for 7 UH60 Blackhawk helicopters. There \nare many more proposals and line items in this bill that I think will \nhelp make this a stronger and more vigorous nation and will make our \nmilitary the best. What we need simply is this: We need the best \ntrained military in the world. We need to give them the best equipment \nthat exists in the world. We have both of those at this moment. We need \neven better equipment. We need even better training. If we maintain \nthat momentum, if we maintain our commitment to research and \ndevelopment and to the utilization of new technologies where ever \npossible and we apply these capabilities and that desire to the modern \nbattlefield our soldiers will remain the best military force the world \nhas ever known.\n\n  I am so proud of our men and women in uniform. When I meet them in \nthe hospital, or talk to them after they return home, or when I meet \nwith them in Iraq or Afghanistan or Kosovo, or aboard a ship at sea or \nat a base here in the United States, I find that they are so highly \nmotivated and committed to serving this country. They believe so deeply \nin the causes of our country. They are committed incredibly to helping \nthe Iraqi's achieve a better life.\n  They are not just there to fight wars. They deeply want the Iraqi's \nto do better, to have a government that is free. Would that not be a \ngood thing? Not just for us, and not just for the Iraqi people, but for \nthe whole world. Wouldn't it be wonderful not to have any Saddam \nHussein's in the world? Wouldn't it be wonderful not to have 300,000 \npeople in mass graves that we are now uncovering in Iraq--the people \nSaddam Hussein slaughtered as a result of one of the most brutal \nregimes the world has ever known? He is gone now and we have an \nopportunity to step forward and create a government that allows the \nIraqi people an opportunity to progress and succeed in the future. That \nis what we hope will happen. It is indeed a difficult time. Nobody \nknows what the future will bring, but I believe we will be successful \nbecause I am putting my confidence in the men and women who are serving \nour country around the world tonight.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Sessions for his service on \nour committee. He is one of the members of our committee who works \nextremely hard. I have traveled with him. I did not travel with him the \nlast time he made reference to, but I know how committed he is to the \nmen and women in our service. That is shown every day here, but it was \nalso shown to me very dramatically on the trip we were able to take \ntogether, and we thank him. I know, more importantly, the men and women \nin the Armed Forces thank him for that commitment.\n  The Senator from New Jersey is in the Chamber. I am wondering if he \nmight like to go next. Approximately how long does he plan on speaking?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I would say probably less than 10 minutes, but if I \nam allowed 10, that is fine.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If that would be all right with the chairman, I understand \nSenator Dayton is on his way and he would also like 10 or 15 minutes. \nThen I would try to make my remarks with an additional 10 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. On this side, the Senator from North Carolina will soon \nbe in the Chamber to take up a position in the queue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Michigan for \npermitting me to say a few words at this point.\n  I rise to speak on language in the Defense authorization conference \nreport that was added by conferees. It waters down two of our \nenvironmental laws significantly. There are two sections of this \nconference report to which I strenuously object. One ignores the will \nof the Senate with regard to protecting endangered species and the \nother represents the greatest single rollback of marine mammal \nprotection in the last 30 years.\n  Last May, the Senate passed an amendment which I developed with \nSenator Jeffords to protect endangered species on Department of Defense \nlands. Before my amendment, the Senate bill effectively exempted the \nDepartment of Defense from complying with the Endangered Species Act, \nbut my amendment instituted a reasonable two-step approach to protect \nendangered species without impeding military readiness or ability. That \namendment was passed by the Senate. We need these protections and we \nknow they work.\n  There are only 2 species that have been on the endangered species \nlist that have gone extinct after being put on that list while over 600 \nspecies not on the list have gone extinct during that time. Look at the \ncomparison: Two which failed to survive because they were on the list, \nand 600 which failed to survive because they were not protected.\n\n  The American people have spoken on this issue. We ought to listen to \nthem. A Zogby poll earlier this year learned that 85 percent of \nregistered voters believe the Defense Department should follow the same \nenvironmental laws as everyone else. Unfortunately, most of the Senate \nlanguage was stricken by the conferees. What remains will not, in my \nopinion, provide adequate protection for threatened and endangered \nspecies. But what is worse, new language is contained in this report \nthat could have disastrous consequences for populations of whales and \nother marine mammals off our coasts.\n  Ironically, in the State of New Jersey, which has a lot of coastline \nfor the size of the State, we have a marine mammal stranding facility. \nPeople voluntarily go out into the water, get a dolphin, or they will \nget even a whale occasionally. They will bring it to shore and figure \nout a way to nurse it back to health and get it back in the sea. We \ntreasure those, as every one of us should, because they are part of the \necology. Where they go ultimately, I think it is fair to say, the human \nrace goes.\n  A rider was attached by the conferees that would allow marine mammals \nto\n\n[[Page S14434]]\n\nbe casually harassed, injured, and killed by activities ranging from \nsonar exercises to the testing of underwater explosives. Ironically, it \ncomes just as the committees with jurisdiction and expertise over \nmarine mammals have begun their work on reauthorizing the Marine Mammal \nProtection Act.\n  Once again, the conferees chose to add language that was not \nauthorized by either House. We are seeing this on a too regular basis--\nlanguage that is debated, discussed, and voted upon goes one way. It \ngoes into conference. The conference committee, then composed of \nMembers almost principally, almost exclusively of the majority party, \ndecides they do not want to listen to what was sent over from the \nSenate or what was sent over from the House. If they disagree with it, \nthey change it and the administration contributes to that. It is \noutrageous.\n  I have been part of this body for nearly 20 years and this is not how \nthe Congress used to make law. We cannot look backward. We are where we \nare, but it is not a good turn of events.\n  That is what has happened. The conferees add their own language. It \nextends exemptions to the Marine Mammal Protection Act in the House \nlanguage to apply not only to military activities but to all \nGovernment-funded research--a change that could be easily exploited by \nindustry groups.\n  Under this act, there will now be no limit to the numbers of marine \nmammals the Department of Defense could kill or harm and no limit to \nthe range of coastal habitat its activities could impact.\n  I am very much aware the leadership on the Armed Services Committee, \nunder the chairman from the State of Virginia and the ranking member, \nour friend from Michigan, also has these same concerns. In particular, \nVirginia is a coastal State. They worry about what happens on their \ncoasts. They worry about the sea life that is there, as well as the \ncondition of the habitat. Virginia has some fairly strict requirements \nto make sure there is not a lot of damage done to the sea environment.\n  The rider that was developed would essentially give the Pentagon a \ncategorical exemption to the provisions of the Marine Mammal Protection \nAct.\n  The Department of Defense receives 38 percent of all permits under \nthe Marine Mammal Protection Act. Well over one-third of these permits \nwill now be exempt from efforts made to limit the harm done to marine \nmammals. I am very disappointed these provisions have been included in \nthe conference report.\n  I can tell you a few other people who are disappointed. They are my \ngrandchildren and my children. They love the sea, and they love what \nlives in the sea. I have a child who lives in Florida, a daughter with \ntwo kids. They know what the marine mammal life is about. They are very \nconscious of the fact that people should not hurt them, harm them. I \nsay that because that is the human relationship. It is the human \nexperience.\n  I saw a picture of one of my granddaughters swimming with a dolphin. \nI thought I probably wouldn't like to be there seeing her do it, but \nshe had a smile on her face. I think even the dolphin had a smile on \nits face. But we care about these issues. It is a pity to stand here \npleading for a reinstitution of provisions that were in the bills \nbefore they got to the conference committee, that either have been \neliminated or have been added without the approval of either body.\n  It is disappointing to see these provisions have been included in the \nconference report. For decades, DOD has managed to find common ground \nwith its training and its environmental goals. These riders do not \nhonor our military; they do not honor the will of the American people; \nand they do not honor the living creatures with whom we share our \nplanet.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wonder if we could establish order for \nSenators to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That would be helpful to the Chair.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We have been going back and forth. Senator Reid is ready \nto proceed for a couple of minutes. I wonder whether Senator Dole might \nallow him, for 2 minutes, given his responsibilities, to go first. Then \nwe would go to Senator Dole, then back to Senator Dayton. Would that be \nall right with all the Senators?\n  Mr. WARNER. I think we see the distinguished leader wishing to \ncomment. Before we close out on that UC----\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, if I could have 30 seconds before we file \nthat. Let me thank Senator Lautenberg for his comments and assure him \none of the reasons this conference lasted I think longer than any \nconference in history, 147 days, was because of those two environmental \nprovisions which, until the end, many of us fought very hard against.\n  The House prevailed. There would not have been a conference report, \nbasically, if we had just refused to give in on this. Ultimately we did \nnot have the votes on this side to carry on in that particular course \nof action. But I assure the Senator from New Jersey I, as one Senator, \nagreed with his comments. The provisions that were in the House bill, \nhowever, ultimately prevailed. That is what happens with some of these \nconferences. We basically win some and lose some, and as far as I am \nconcerned we lost on this one, and so did the world.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will simply add to my colleague's \naccurate description that there was some mention you didn't \nparticularly like the way it was written in conference. In fact, it was \nnot. It was provisions adopted by the House. There were just a few \nwords of modification in the conference.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The chairman is correct on that. I concur with our \nchairman. This problem is not the one we have run into recently as much \nas it is a problem of a very great difference between the Senate \nprovision, which the Senator from New Jersey helped to author, and that \nof the House. His amendment was a very important amendment and put us \non the right track. But we ran dead on to the House provisions. In this \ncase it was the House provisions versus the Senate provisions, rather \nthan additional provisions in conference which were the problem.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the manager and ranking member of the \ncommittee. But I say to my friend from Virginia, sometimes it is just a \nfew words here and there that make all the difference in the way things \ncome out.\n  I know there is a consciousness between the two distinguished leaders \non the Armed Services Committee that the environment could have been \nand should have been protected as we planned it and as we discussed it. \nBut we are where we are. I hope there will be a time in the not too \ndistant future when we will be able to realize we have done some damage \nand change that.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, first, I want to express my appreciation to \nnot only the managers but also to Senator Dole and Senator Dayton for \nallowing me to speak out of order.\n  There is so much rhetoric about the acrimony between the Republicans \nand Democrats in the Senate. Whatever is written, it is exaggerated. \nThere is so much that happens in this body based on the work of the \nSenators. There is no better example of that than the Senator from \nVirginia and the Senator from Michigan. They have worked together for \nmany years on this most important committee. They do it in a bipartisan \nfashion. They have done, I really do believe, an exemplary job of \nbringing this bill to the Senate.\n  This conference was long, grueling, and hard. But there are a lot of \nconferences which we have been unable to complete. This one has been \ncompleted, even though it deals with the most important aspect of our \ncountry--its national security.\n  I want the Record to be spread with the fact that so much goes on in \nthis body as a result of the goodwill of leaders, but the two members \non this committee are exemplary. You can't find better leaders. They \nare Members who have set aside their personal preferences on many \noccasions for the good of the country--I shouldn't say on ``many'' but \non most occasions--for the good of the country. They come from \ndifferent approaches on what should be in a bill, but when it all boils \ndown, they do what is best for the country.\n  I have told both of these Senators that I feel good for my \ngrandchildren as a result of the fact that every night these men are \nresponsible for what takes place in the Senate dealing with\n\n[[Page S14435]]\n\nthe U.S. military. I say that without equivocation, and without \nhesitation.\n  There are a lot of good things in this bill. But the thing I want to \ntalk about--and others can talk about other aspects they think are \nimportant--is concurrent receipt. We started on this journey a number \nof years ago. It was a lonely journey. I worked hard to focus attention \non this issue. Attention has been focused not by me but by veterans \nthroughout America. Because of them, we are at the point where we are \nnow.\n  The negotiations on this issue alone in this bill were grueling. I \nhad contacts with both managers of this bill over the months. It was \ndifficult to arrive at a point where we now are; that is, people who \nare 50-percent disabled will be able to draw both their retirement \npension and their disability benefits. That is tremendous. Of course, \nthat is something we all wanted to accomplish. But it costs a lot of \nmoney, and we are going to do more in the future.\n  I want the two managers of this bill to know how much I personally \nappreciate the work they have done on this particular aspect of the \nbill. But I speak for veterans communities all over America, saying \nthis is a tremendous bit of work to be able to arrive at this point; to \nthink that we would be here talking about a 50-percent disability and \nreceiving all of their benefits. A few years ago, it would not have \nbeen possible but we are there.\n  My admiration to the two managers of this bill goes even further. It \ndidn't go unnoticed last night as I was spending a lot of time on the \nfloor that to my right was my friend from Michigan who was with me for \nthe last several hours of my little odyssey. He and I were here alone. \nI appreciated that very much.\n  For the two managers, good work for America.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I appreciate the expressions of the \ndistinguished assistant minority leader. But he is so accurate about \nthe veterans groups. They are all experienced lobbyists. Somehow I \ndon't look upon them exactly as lobbyists. They are by and large all \nveterans. They very conscientiously reflect what is felt by Americans \nin their hearts with regard to veterans. They translate that feeling \ninto legislation.\n  This was a long, long trail across rough terrain over many years. But \nI must say to my good friend from Nevada that had it not been for his \nsteadfast and always unheralded leadership we would not be here tonight \nwith this provision in this bill. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, if I could ask Senator Dole to yield for \njust 1 additional minute, I want to thank the Senator from Nevada for \nhis leadership in this area, and for his kind remarks. But let it be \nvery clear. The Senator from Nevada has led the fight on this \nconcurrent receipt issue. Two-hundred and twenty-five thousand retired \ndisabled veterans are going to now be able to receive their disability \nbenefit as well as their retirement compensation because of his \nleadership. There are others, obviously, who participated. There always \nare. The Senator from Nevada is very generous in sharing that credit.\n  Surely our chairman, Senator Warner, deserves a great deal of credit, \nas others here deserve credit, along with Senator Reid. I know Senator \nWarner will agree with me. As he just pointed out, Senator Reid has \ntruly been a leader in this effort. It would not have happened without \nhis leadership. There are 225,000 veterans and their families out there \ntonight who will receive this benefit which they have earned and \ndeserve who otherwise would not have received it.\n  I am sure the President will sign this bill, even though at one time \nit was suggested that the Secretary of Defense would recommend a veto. \nI can't believe that will now, in fact, happen. I thank the Senator for \nhis leadership.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I may simply add, if the Senator will \nindulge me, because this is a very important point about the work that \nwas done on concurrent receipt. In the final analysis, the \nadministration came to fully support it and worked with us.\n  I also salute Senator McCain who was tireless in his efforts on this \nvery legislation through the many years I have worked on it with him \nand others.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, I have great respect for Chairman Warner \nand Ranking Member Levin for their exemplary work on this conference \nreport which will go so far toward improving our Nation's defenses and \ngiving our men and women in the Armed Forces the resources they need. \nIt is a great privilege to serve with these two outstanding leaders on \nthe Committee on Armed Services.\n  For the thousands of North Carolinians serving overseas, this bill is \nmost important for them and for their families. One of the most \nfundamental duties of the Federal Government is to provide for the \ncommon defense. As I have said so often, if our young men and women are \nbeing called into harm's way, they must have the best equipment, the \nvery best training, and the highest morale. With this bill, we are \ngiving them just that.\n  This legislation provides a 3.7-percent pay raise to all of our \nuniformed service personnel, and it continues the family separation \nallowance that helps provide much needed dollars for spouses and \nchildren when their loved ones are deployed.\n  There is a provision to continue special pay for duty in hostile fire \nor imminent danger. I am also pleased that the housing needs of our \nmilitary personnel and their families are so strongly supported in this \nbill. The legislation will provide much needed improvements in housing, \nespecially for our bases back in North Carolina.\n  TRICARE is also expanded for Reserve components under this \nlegislation, something that is so desperately needed at a time when we \nare relying so heavily upon our Reserve Forces. This means our \nreservists and their families will get the health care and medical \nattention they need.\n  This legislation remembers our veterans who deserve so much for their \ncommitted service to our country. It is unfair for disabled veterans to \npay for their own disability compensation. Legislation enacted last \nyear restored benefits to retirees with disabilities who were awarded \nthe Purple Heart or were severely disabled by combat-related \nactivities. It was a good beginning.\n  The legislation before us now goes further by allowing special \ncompensation to be extended to all military retirees whose disabling \ncondition was due to combat or combat-related operations.\n  Additionally, concurrent receipt will be phased in over the next 10 \nyears for those retirees with noncombat-related disabilities of 50 \npercent or greater. And the fight is not over. Our next step is to work \nto find a solution that meets the goal of full concurrent receipt for \nall military retired who are eligible for disability benefits.\n  As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I will continue \nto keep this a priority.\n  I am also pleased to see the multiyear procurement for the F-18 Super \nHornets in this bill. This is the first step toward basing this new \nmission in North Carolina. Soon it will bring over 1,000 new jobs to \neastern North Carolina where they are desperately needed.\n  The legislation also authorizes $11 billion for the defense science \nand technology program, including $797.6 million for the critical, \nhigh-payoff science and technology programs. Many of these \ntransformational technologies will be coming from new innovative \nbusinesses in North Carolina as well as from our exemplary university \nsystem.\n  It also increases by more than 30 percent the funding for special \noperations to include over $61 million for weapons systems, \npsychological operations capabilities, and enhanced intelligence. And \nwe all know how much we have relied on our brave and daring special \nforces literally on the front lines in the war on terror.\n  The committee worked long and hard on the various ``buy American'' \nprovisions, particularly the Berry amendment, which I am so pleased \nremains strong. At a time when we are all concerned about manufacturing \njobs, I am glad we are going to take a good hard look at our industrial \nbase to make sure that we give our troops the best equipment for years \nto come.\n  At Seymour-Johnson and Pope Air Force Bases, at Cherry Point Marine\n\n[[Page S14436]]\n\nCorps Air Station, and Fort Bragg and Camp Lejeune, I was deeply moved \nby the dedication, the commitment, the patriotism of the members of our \nArmed Forces and their families. They make me proud and thankful to be \nan American. I am honored to have had the opportunity to work on this \nlegislation and give something back to our men and women in uniform.\n  This is a good bill. It goes a long way toward strengthening our \nmilitary, protecting our military families, and caring for our \nveterans. I applaud the committee for its work and urge my colleagues \nto support this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I rise today to join with my colleagues in \nsupport of this conference report, the national defense authorization \nbill for fiscal year 2004. At the outset, I express my appreciation and \nmy utmost respect for the two outstanding leaders of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, Chairman John Warner from Virginia and Ranking \nMember Carl Levin from Michigan.\n  When I was preparing to join the Senate 3 years ago, I asked two of \nmy distinguished Minnesota predecessors, former Senator and Vice \nPresident Walter Mondale, former Senator David Durenberger, and my \nlong-time friend and then-colleague-to-be, the late Senator Paul \nWellstone, for their advice on committees to seek assignment. All three \nenthusiastically recommended the Senate Armed Services Committee for \ntwo primary reasons: First, it is of paramount importance with \nresponsibility to assure this Nation's overwhelming military \nsuperiority now and forevermore; Second, the unparalleled opportunity \nto serve under, work with, and learn from the two incomparable \ncommittee leaders, Chairman Warner and former chairman, now ranking \nmember, Levin. The advice of my fellow Minnesotans was prescient in \nboth respects.\n  For all the attention that is given to this body's partisan \ndifferences and discord, what are usually overlooked, though \nfortunately much more prevalent, are the bipartisan professionalism, \nmutual respect, and shared commitment to do what is best for America, \nfor all of America. That ethic is what predominates in the Senate Armed \nServices Committee. It begins with the personal conduct and \nprofessional relationship of these two extraordinary public servants \nand national leaders, John Warner and Carl Levin.\n  At any time in our Nation's history, but especially during the \nunprecedented circumstances of the last 3 years, since the September \n11, 2001, attack, the two wars that followed and are still ongoing in \nAfghanistan and Iraq, our Senate and our Nation are exceedingly \nfortunate in the leadership of these two outstanding men, Chairman John \nWarner and Ranking Member Carl Levin. They have also led members on the \nArmed Services Committee, on which I am proud to serve, to pass \nlegislation, first in the Senate with overwhelming bipartisan support \nand now in the conference with the House, with President Bush's \ncivilian defense leadership and with our Nation's military command, \nChairman Richard Myers and the members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who \nserve this country with such great distinction.\n  As George Washington said in 1793, in his fifth annual address to \nCongress: ``If we desire to avoid insult, we must be able to repel it. \nIf we desire to secure peace, it must be known that we are at all times \nready for war.''\n  The succeeding 210 years have proven President George Washington's \nwisdom and the imperative that we follow that advice. With this \nlegislation, we have continued that bipartisan commitment and upheld \nthat most sacred trust, the protection and safety of our fellow \ncitizens across this great Nation and, so much as humanly possible, \nthroughout this world.\n  The final bill before the Senate authorizes $401.3 billion in budget \nauthority for fiscal year 2004 with additional funding authorized for \nthe acquisition of 100 tanker aircraft. The Defense appropriations \nmeasure, which this body has passed, which will come back in conference \nreports that we will pass again with overwhelming bipartisan support, \nwill obligate most of that funding, which does not count the $67 \nbillion in the recent supplemental appropriation for ongoing military \noperations in Iraq and Afghanistan, which means that, in total, in \nfiscal year 2004 we will spend over $500 billion for our national \ndefense and military operations.\n\n  Some of my constituents would say that is too much. Some would say it \nis too little. It is unquestionably a great deal of money. As a great \nformer Senator and colleague and member of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, Max Cleland, would say, $500 billion does not go as far as \nit used to.\n  But freedom is not free. Today, on Veterans Day, as we honor the \nbrave men and women who have sacrificed their lives, their bodies--as \nSenator Cleland did--we are reminded once again that freedom is \npriceless and ever more expensive.\n  But the results in Iraq and Afghanistan should assure our Nation that \nthe money we have spent has been well worth it and well spent. It has \nsaved American lives in those theaters and it has saved the lives of \nother people in the world. It has protected the world from some of the \nmost evil forces imaginable and from that most awful of possible \noccurrences, a nuclear catastrophe.\n  My fellow citizens should recognize that we are not, all of us, \ntogether, paying that price. We are borrowing it and passing most of \nthe costs of its repayment to our children and our grandchildren. The \nprojected fiscal year deficit for the Federal budget for the same \nfiscal year 2004 which we have just begun is estimated to exceed $500 \nbillion. That happens to be approximately the expenditure for our \nnational defense. It is not right to single out defense spending as the \ncause of that deficit. It is right, in fact, to single out everything \nas the cause of that deficit.\n  Regarding our spending and our tax policies, which the Concord \nCoalition, a coalition of business men and women and previous leaders \nof this Nation, recently called the most reckless fiscal policy in this \nNation's history--4 years ago, in fiscal year 2000, the total Federal \nrevenues coming from the personal income tax, the corporate tax, the \nexcise tax, the estate tax, and the capital gains tax equalled, for the \nfirst time in 40 years in our Nation's history, the expenditures other \nthan Social Security and part of Medicare which we call the on-budget \nexpenditures, which include all of our expenditures for national \ndefense, military operations, intelligence, and other ongoing \nactivities.\n  For this fiscal year just completed, 2003, those revenues amount to \nonly two-thirds of those expenditures. And next year, if projections \nhold, revenues will be even less than two-thirds of those expected \nexpenditures.\n  I regret we live in a world where this much money must be spent on \nour national defense. I would rather we could spend the money on \nspecial education for all of our children, who are now still being left \nbehind, and that it could be spent on student aid for our young adults, \nwho are going tens of thousands of dollars into debt just to complete \ntheir undergraduate and postgraduate education.\n  I wish the money could go to buy prescription drug coverage for our \nsenior citizens and other Medicare recipients that would be as good as \nwhat the Members of Congress receive. I wish we could provide health \ncare to the 44 million Americans who receive no health coverage at all. \nI wish we could rebuild our highways and improve our mass transit \nsystems, add to our bridges, and advance our infrastructure.\n  There is so much else we can do for the betterment of our citizens, \nbut, unfortunately, there can be none of these homeland improvements \nwithout improved homeland defense. We cannot achieve national \nprosperity for all of our citizens if we do not first and always \nachieve national security for all of our citizens.\n  As I said, the experience of the last 3 years should assure all \nAmericans that those national defense dollars are being well spent and \nthat we are well served, well protected as a result.\n  In Afghanistan, the United States military accomplished, in 10 weeks, \nwhat the old Soviet Union could not accomplish in 10 years: the routing \nof the Taliban and the restoration of the beginning of a new \ngovernment, a government of the people of Afghanistan.\n  In Iraq, it took only 3 weeks for the United States forces on the \nborder to\n\n[[Page S14437]]\n\noccupying Baghdad, the nation's capital. The difficulties that have \noccurred since then have not been the result of failed military \nstrategy or its execution but, rather, the failure of securing the \npeace to catch up with winning the war.\n  Our Armed Forces, our fellow Americans--our sons, our daughters, our \nbrothers, our sisters, wives, husbands, mothers, and fathers--in the \nwords of the motto of the U.S. Army's Second Division, which I visited \nin April with Senate Majority Leader Frist, and others of my \ncolleagues--are ``second to none.'' The U.S. military is second to \nnone. It is the best, the bravest, the most accomplished, intelligent, \nand patriotic armed forces anywhere in the world, anywhere in the \nhistory of the world.\n  I am especially proud, as a Minnesotan, of our State's and other \nStates' reservists and National Guard men and women, who are now--many \nof them--on active duty serving in their second or even third tour of \nduty in recent years. They deserve our gratitude, and, more than that, \nthey deserve our ongoing support.\n  It is very important, as others have noted, that this authorization \nprovides for a significant pay increase for our Active Forces. It \nestablishes, for the first time, the coverage on health care to some of \nthe members of the Reserve and National Guard, those who do not \npresently have the opportunity to obtain that health coverage through \ntheir private employers, to be covered not just when they are on active \nduty--which they increasingly are--but year-round.\n\n  I viewed, on Sunday night, the ABC televised report that said of the \nreservists and the National Guard men and women presently serving in \nIraq, only 54 percent indicated they would reenlist, which is \nunderstandable, given the severe circumstances they are experiencing \nthere, as the chairman and ranking member and others of us, including \nmyself, experienced briefly last July in that country.\n  I would expect that with the opportunity to return to home and \nfamilies, that percentage would increase, but it underscores how \nimperative it is we create incentives for these courageous men and \nwomen, and for their families, and for their employers. They undergo \nthe sacrifices that they must to be in the Ready Reserve and to step \nin, in these times of national emergency. We need to provide health \ncoverage for them and for their families.\n  I salute the chairman and the ranking member and Senator Graham of \nSouth Carolina, who also spearheaded this measure in this Senate, who \nhas assured me this is the first step toward securing, hopefully next \nyear, complete coverage under the Federal health care system for all of \nour reservists and National Guard men and women because it is the right \nthing to do, it is the humane thing to do, and it is the best thing we \ncan do to offer them a reason to reenlist, to stay a part of keeping \nthis Nation as strong as it must be.\n  They are taking awfully good care of us. It is imperative that we \ntake as good care of them as we possibly can. The same measure of \nstandard should apply to our veterans who have served us formerly who \nare now moving on in years.\n  I note, as others have, with great appreciation, the outstanding \nefforts of the Senate Democratic assistant leader, Harry Reid of \nNevada, who has championed the concurrent receipts for all of our \nveterans who have suffered disabilities, who reach the age where they \nalso are eligible for Social Security and other retirement benefits.\n  Why they should be penalized, unlike anyone else in the private \nsector or the public sector, is beyond me--those people who have served \nand who have paid the price with their own physical infirmities, \nwounds, sometimes maimings.\n  Today I was at the Korean War Memorial with a group of Minnesotans, \nsome of whom could not walk and were in wheelchairs--amputees because \nof the wounds they suffered fighting for this Nation's freedom and the \nsecurity of the world in Korea over half a century ago. Why they should \nbe penalized now in their older years for that service, for what they \nearned, and what they paid for with the price of their own bodies, is \nsomewhere where we still, as a nation, have fallen short in our \nresponsibility to them.\n  To phase it in, with all due respect to all of us who made this \neffort--but against the fervent opposition, which I do not understand, \nof the administration, to immediately correcting this injustice--to \nphase it in over 10 years, to me is unconscionable--indefensible and \nunconscionable.\n  We have put tax relief for the wealthiest people of this Nation in \nplace and made it retroactive. We have tax relief coming in and out and \nin and out and back again within the same 10 years we are talking about \nphasing in this deserved benefit--earned benefit--for our injured \nveterans of America.\n  That is another critical task that I know this body, which passed it \noverwhelmingly last year--and the efforts of the chairman and ranking \nmember of this committee, if they had been able to prevail, would have \nbeen applied fairly and immediately to all of our disabled veterans. \nBut it is a task that all of us must undertake again next year.\n\n  There are important measures in this legislation that benefit the \nState of Minnesota, as other States. What is most important is that \nthis is a measure that benefits our entire country.\n  I would say again that the bipartisan spirit of the committee, of the \nSenate, with regard to national defense, both before but particularly \nduring most of the 3 years I have been in the Senate, which has \nincluded the post-9/11/2001 era, has been probably my proudest \nparticipation in the Senate because we are first and foremost, all of \nus, Americans.\n  Even those disagreements that sometimes preoccupy us, that capture \nthe headlines, that seem to be the description of this great body, are, \nin fact, as our distinguished Democratic leader, Tom Daschle, has \nreminded us regularly, the noise of democracy.\n  It is because we can all stand in this body and express our views and \nagree or disagree, hopefully, respectfully, with one another. \nRegardless, that we can do so, and go home to our families, to return \nthe next day to offer our best judgments and ideas, again without fear \nof incarceration or execution or obliteration--that is what is \npriceless about this Nation. That is what this bill is intended to \npreserve.\n  I believe that the committee, and the conference committee, the men \nand women serving in our Armed Forces, the civilian leadership of this \ncountry under President Bush and his civilian defense leadership, the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, and the command of the military of this country, \nfor whom I have felt the greatest respect and regard--I think our \nfellow Americans can sleep well tonight with the knowledge that they \nare being well protected.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I express my appreciation to the \ndistinguished Senator from Minnesota for his work on our committee \nthroughout the year. He volunteered to travel to Iraq with our CODEL, \nand he is ready to pick up the burdens at any time he is requested. I \nthank him also for the respectful way in which he referred to our \nformer colleague whose seat he proudly holds today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition? The Senator from \nMichigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me join Senator Warner in thanking \nSenator Dayton, first for the very overly generous comments he made at \nthe beginning of his remarks. They are obviously very warm and very \nmuch appreciated. The references he made to the former colleagues of \nours are particularly important personally to both Senator Warner and \nto me, and we are very grateful for them.\n  Senator Dayton has brought to our committee and to this body a very \ngreat passion, not just for Minnesota--although Lord knows that passion \nis there for issues that affect Minnesota, including his Guard and \nReserve that are so close to his heart--but also the defense issues \nthat affect every citizen of this Nation. Perhaps typical of him was \nthe way in which he identified, with a number of other colleagues, a \nproblem for the service men and women who are coming back on leave from \nIraq and who are dropped off at Baltimore Airport and have no way to \nget to their homes. Senator Dayton joined a few others in this body to \nmake sure in that supplemental appropriation we would get them home, \nnot just to our shores but to their own personal homes.\n\n[[Page S14438]]\n\n  That is the kind of personal approach he takes toward issues, a \ncombination of great passion and tenacity and forthrightness and \ndirectness and guts and courage, taking on a lot of tough issues, but \nalso a very personal approach. We are very glad he is on the Armed \nServices Committee and grateful for the contribution he makes to our \ncommittee.\n  If the chairman has no other matter, I thought what I would do is \nvery briefly continue with a few comments. I began a rather lengthy \nstatement I was going to make about the Defense authorization bill, and \nI have a few additional comments.\n  Where I left off a couple hours ago was making reference to the fact \nwe increased the Active Duty end strength of the Army in this bill by \n2,400. That is a small number, given the demands we are placing on our \ntroops, but at least it gets us on the right road. Senator Jack Reed \nworked hard for this increase. Senator Warner and I in conference did \nthe best we could, given the circumstances we faced and the limits we \nhad to deal with. But Senator Reed was determined we would do what it \nis clear to all of us we must do and consider more of, which is to take \na look at the huge demand we are placing on our troops, take a look at \nthe sustained callups of our National Guard and Reserve components \nsince the Vietnam war.\n  We now are watching them more and more deployed for extended periods \nand repeated deployments of the same Guard and Reserve units. We have \nto address this issue. There are many ways to do it, but one of them is \nto take a look at increasing the end strength of our Active-Duty \npeople. We decided we would start this year with the Army where the \ngreatest crunch has been felt. That 2,400 personnel increase authorized \nby this bill again is a relatively small increase given the demands on \nour troops, but it is an important statement of where this committee \nis.\n  We are also pleased the conference report includes a proposal which \nSenator Kennedy and others were very instrumental in proposing which \nwould serve to expedite the naturalization of lawful permanent \nresidents serving in the military, and their families. These are men \nand women in uniform who willingly put their lives at risk to preserve \nour freedoms. They deserve nothing less than full participation in \nthose freedoms as citizens.\n  The expedited and naturalization of lawful permanent residents who do \nserve in the military, and also for their families, has been championed \nby Senator Kennedy and a number of other colleagues of ours. That \nprovision is in our bill.\n  This conference report also addresses the Air Force proposal to \nlease, rather than buy, 100 new tanker aircraft. The Senate Armed \nServices Committee spent many hours trying to gauge the severity of the \nproblems with the existing Air Force tanker fleet and the urgency of \nthe requirement to replace those aircraft. In my view, the Air Force \nwas deficient in the case they tried to make that there is an imminent \nrisk to the fleet, but the Air Force did show a long-term requirement \nfor tankers that will ultimately require the fielding of replacement \naircraft.\n  At the same time, the Government Accounting Office, the Congressional \nBudget Office, and the Congressional Research Service all raised \nserious questions about whether the lease proposal presented by the Air \nForce was in the best interest of the taxpayers. According to these \nindependent analyses, the tanker lease proposal was likely to cost the \ntaxpayers as much as $5 billion more than a traditional purchase of the \nsame aircraft on the same schedule.\n  After considering these issues, Senator Warner put forward an \nalternative approach under which the Air Force would lease 20 tanker \naircraft and purchase the remaining 80 aircraft contemplated in the \noriginal lease agreement. I supported this creative approach. It would \nreduce the acquisition cost for aircraft by more than $4 billion \ndollars, while allowing the Air Force to acquire the full 100 aircraft \nthat they say they need.\n  In order to help the Air Force with its funding problems, we agreed \nto authorize incremental funding of the 80 aircraft purchase, so that \nthe Air Force can budget for aircraft construction costs in the year \nthe costs are incurred, rather than obtaining full budget authority at \nthe time the order is placed. Incremental funding is not generally a \ngood idea, but it is a significant improvement over the lease approach \noriginally proposed by the Air Force in this case.\n  I want to specifically point out the very creative role of Senator \nWarner in coming up with a solution which I was proud to support. This \nis his creative solution to a real problem. We have a need for new \naircraft. The problem is the resources were not there for them. The \nright way to do this is purchase, not lease. We did the best we could \nto make it clear at the same time we acquire these aircraft, we want to \ndo it with minimum damage to the usual procurement rules which require \na purchase rather than a lease of equipment of this kind.\n  I was also pleased the conference report includes a Senate provision \nauthorizing the expansion of the cooperative threat reduction program \nof the Department of Defense and the nonproliferation programs at the \nDepartment of Energy, outside of the former Soviet Union. That was the \nchange we were able to make. This is the basically flowering of the \nNunn-Lugar program. Senator Lugar, of course, who is still in this \nbody, is the one who has promoted and prodded and pressed us to do \nthis. He has been absolutely right on this program. They have proven to \nbe important tools in helping to reduce the proliferation risk from \nnuclear, chemical, and biological materials in the former Soviet Union.\n  We give the President the authority which the President requested to \ncontinue the destruction of chemical weapons in Russia. It fully funds \nCTR programs. But at the request of the administration, with full \nsupport of Senator Lugar, who really was a leader in this, and the full \nsupport of our chairman and our committee, we have now for the first \ntime, using the authorities in the agreement, allowed the President to \nuse these cooperative threat reduction funds from the Department of \nEnergy Materials Protection and Control Program to meet emerging \nthreats in other parts of the world. It is no longer limited now to the \nformer Soviet Union.\n  Again, Senator Warner's total support of this change was instrumental \nin making it happen.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, it certainly \nwas his leadership on those issues, the CTR, the expansion. Truly, I \njoined you, and felt strongly about them. We were steadfast when the \nfour of us finally got into the conference and settled those points.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the chairman.\n  Finally, I am pleased that the conference report includes a Senate \nprovision authorizing the expansion of the Cooperative Threat Reduction \nprogram of the Department of Defense and the nonproliferation programs \nat the Department of Energy outside the Former Soviet Union. These \nprograms have proven to be important tools in helping reduce \nproliferation risk from nuclear, chemical and biological materials of \nthe Former Soviet Union. This conference agreement also provides the \nPresident with the authority he requested to continue destruction of \nchemical weapons in Russia, and fully funds the CTR programs.\n  As we have all come to appreciate, however, the risk that nuclear, \nchemical and biological materials and knowledge will proliferate is not \nlimited to Russia and the other States of the former Soviet Union. For \nthe first time, using the authorities provided in this agreement, the \nPresident will be able to use CTR funds, and funds from the Department \nof Energy, DOE, Materials Protection and Control program, to meet \nemerging threats in other areas of the world.\n  I had previously expressed my gratitude to Senator Collins for her \nextraordinary leadership in this effort. Her assessment on the floor is \none I join.\n  The House bill contained a provision, based on an administration \nproposal, that would fundamentally alter the Federal Civil Service \nSystem by authorizing the Secretary of Defense to waive certain \nprovisions of law governing employee performance, pay and allowances, \nlabor relations, hiring and firing, training, pay administration,\n\n[[Page S14439]]\n\noversight and appeals. The House provision included few legislated \nprocedures and processes for the new civilian personnel system, other \nthan the requirement that the new system be ``flexible'' and \n``contemporary''.\n  The Federal Civil Service System was established more than a century \nago to replace a patronage system that was characterized by favoritism, \nand abuse. While reform and streamlining of that system is a reasonable \nobjective, it is equally important that we do not allow those abuses to \nresurface. The House bill would not only have provided the greatest \nshift of power to the executive branch in memory, it would also have \nput us at risk to some of the abuses of the past.\n  Senator Collins and I worked together closely to fashion a bipartisan \nbill in the Governmental Affairs Committee that would provide the \nDepartment of Defense the new personnel flexibility that it needs, \nwhile preserving important protections for individual employees. Our \nbill was approved by the Governmental Affairs Committee in early June \nand became the basis for our negotiations in conference with the House.\n  The bipartisan approach that Senator Collins and I took on this issue \nmet with opposition from the administration at every turn. At times, it \nappeared that some of our opponents were less interested in enacting \nsound human capital provisions than they were in providing as much \npower as possible to the Secretary of Defense.\n  Nonetheless, we were able to build some important protections into \nthe legislation that is included in this conference report. These \ninclude provisions from the Collins-Levin bill that would: preserve the \nright of individual employees to appeal adverse personnel actions to \nthe Merit Systems Protection Board and, if necessary, the courts; \nensure that the new personnel system cannot be used as a basis for \nreducing the amount of money allocated to civilian pay \naccounts; provides specific guidance and direction on the \nimplementation of a pay-for-performance system; ensure that the Office \nof Personnel Management will play a central role in developing a new \npersonnel system for the Department of Defense; and provide for the \norderly phase-in of the new personnel system.\n\n  The outcome on collective bargaining issues was more of a mixed bag. \nI believe that the right of employees to participate in labor \norganizations of their choosing, and to engage in collective bargaining \nthrough such organizations, is a fundamental one in our society. This \nview does not appear to be shared by the White House or the Department \nof Defense.\n  Nonetheless, the collective bargaining provisions that Senator \nCollins and I were able to negotiate on this bill are substantially \nbetter from our perspective than comparable provisions included in the \nHouse bill and the Homeland Security Act.\n  The Homeland Security Act authorize the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity to waive any and all of the provisions of Chapter 71 of Title \n5, which governs labor-management relations for Federal employees. This \nwaiver authority gives the Secretary of Homeland Security complete \nauthority to establish any new labor relations system he may choose, \nwith virtually no statutory limitation. The House bill would have \nprovided the same authority to the Secretary of Defense.\n  This conference report does not include any authority to waive the \nrequirements of Chapter 71. On the contrary, as the Chairman of the \nHouse Government Reform Committee pointed out on the House floor last \nweek, this bill specifically lists the provisions of Chapter 71 as \nbeing non-waivable. The bill before us states, and I quote, ``Any \nsystem established [under this provision] shall . . . not waive, \nmodify, or otherwise affect'' Chapter 71. This means that the \nDepartment of Defense, unlike the Department of Homeland Security, \nremains subject to the collective bargaining requirements of Chapter \n71.\n  The conference report also states that, notwithstanding the provision \npreserving the full force and effect of Chapter 71, the Secretary ``may \nestablish and from time to time adjust a labor relations system for the \nDepartment of Defense to address the unique role that the Department's \ncivilian workforce plays in supporting the Department's national \nsecurity mission.''\n  These two provisions must be read together and both must be given \nmeaning. The first provision states that Chapter 71 may not be waived \nor modified. The second provision states that the Secretary may \nestablish a unique labor relations system. For both provisions to have \nmeaning, the unique labor relations system established by the Secretary \nmust be consistent with the requirements of Chapter 71. For example: \nSection 7102 of Chapter 71 states that each employee shall have the \nright to form, join, or assist any labor organization to engage in \ncollective bargaining with respect to the conditions of employment \nthrough representatives chosen by employees. The unique labor relations \nsystem established by the Secretary must preserve this right.\n  Section 7105 states that the Federal Labor Relations Authority FLRA \nshall determine the appropriateness of units for labor organizations \nrepresentation and supervise or conduct elections within such units. \nNothing in the conference report gives the Secretary of Defense any \nauthority to waive or modify this requirement imposed on an independent \nFederal agency.\n\n  Section 7111 requires an agency to accord exclusive recognition to a \nlabor organization if the organization has been selected as the \nrepresentative by a majority of the employees in a bargaining unit. The \nunique labor relations system established by the Secretary must \npreserve this right.\n  Section 7114 states that a labor organization which has been accorded \nexclusive recognition as the exclusive representative of the employees \nin the unit represents and requires an agency to bargain in good faith \nwith such a labor organization. The unique labor relations system \nestablished by the Secretary must preserve this right.\n  Section 7116 provides that it shall be an unfair labor practice for \nan agency to interfere with, restrain or coerce employees or to refuse \nto consult or negotiate in good faith with a labor organization. \nNothing in the conference report gives the Secretary of Defense any \nauthority to waive or modify this requirement.\n  Section 7118 authorizes the General Counsel of the FLRA to \ninvestigate allegations that any person has engaged in unfair labor \npractice. Nothing in the conference report gives the Secretary of \nDefense any authority to waive or modify this requirement applicable to \nan independent federal agency.\n  Unfortunately, the conference report does provide for exceptions to \nthe applicability of Chapter 71. In this regard, the conference report \nspecifically provides that the labor relations system established by \nthe Secretary ``shall provide for independent third party review of \ndecisions, including defining what decisions are reviewable by the \nthird party, what third party would conduct the review, and the \nstandard or standards for that review.'' It also states that national \nlevel collective bargaining shall ``be subject to review by an \nindependent third party only to the extent provided'' under this \nprocess. This language appears to preclude the appeal of such issues to \nthe Federal Service Impasses Panel under section 7119 of Title 5.\n  While I was disappointed by the decision to include language limiting \nthe review of collective bargaining decisions, the preservation of \nother rights under Chapter 71 makes this provision far preferable to \nthe personnel provisions in the House bill or the Homeland Security \nAct. Senator Collins' commitment to this issue has ensured that \nDepartment of Defense employees will have far greater protection under \nthe National Security Personnel System than they would otherwise have \nenjoyed. I commend her for her steadfast determination to make this \nprovision as balanced and as fair as possible.\n  Several of the environmental provisions in the bill go far beyond \nwhat is needed to address the legitimate needs of the Department of \nDefense.\n  The first of these would exempt defense lands from critical habitat \ndesignations without establishing a suitable alternative environmental \nsafeguard. Both the House bill and the Senate bill recognized DOD's \ninterest in greater flexibility for military training by allowing the \nuse of an ``Integrated Natural Resources Management Plan,'' INRMP, \nadopted by DOD to protect endangered species in lieu of a critical \nhabitat designation, which would be far\n\n[[Page S14440]]\n\nmore restrictive. However, the Senate bill included a threshold test--\nused by the past two administrations--before an INRMP could be approved \nas a substitute for a critical habitat designation. The House bill \ncontained a much less careful approach.\n  In the course of the conference, we offered a long series of possible \ncompromises on the threshold test. We suggested that DOD at least show \nthat the INRMP provided a ``reasonable benefit'' for endangered \nspecies, or ``appropriate protection'' for endangered species--flexible \ntests that would have given the administration broad discretion to \nbalance military readiness concerns against environmental protection \nconcerns.\n  We were met with a complete stone wall. We were told that while the \nPentagon would of course be ``reasonable'' and take ``appropriate'' \nsteps, these words could not be put into statute. Any adjective, we \nwere told, would subject the Department of Defense to ``litigation \nrisk.'' Of course, the only standard that raises no litigation risk is \na standard that imposes no obligation. That appears to be the course \nthat is administration has chosen when it comes to environmental \nissues.\n  Similarly, on the Marine Mammal Protection Act, I believe that the \nNavy has some legitimate concerns about the application of the current \nstatute, but I was concerned that the language in the House bill went \ntoo far in trying to address those concerns. As I read that language, \nthe Navy would not even be required to seek a permit under the Marine \nMammal Protection Act unless its activities would disturb marine \nmammals populations to such a significant extent that there are \nreproductive or survival implications for the species. If for some \nreason this weren't enough, and a permit wasn't granted, the provision \nwould allow the complete exemption of activities that would have an \neven greater adverse impact on marine mammals.\n  I offered to work with the Navy to try to reach agreement on more \nbalanced language that would still address the Navy's concerns. The \nNavy initially encouraged such discussions, but the Department of \nDefense soon began to reject any change to the House language. As was \nthe case with the Endangered Species Act, the Administration rejected \nevery proposal that could have garnered broad bipartisan support in \nfavor of an approach that would impose virtually no obligation at all \non the Department of Defense to be environmentally responsible. I am \nconcerned that this approach could result in real and unnecessary harm \nto marine mammals and a serious backlash against the Navy--which could \nundermine critical readiness activities in the long run.\n  Finally, I am disappointed by the outcome of the conference on \nnuclear weapons issues. In my view, this conference report takes the \nUnited States in a dangerous new direction that marks a major shift in \nAmerican policy, is inconsistent with our longstanding commitment under \nthe Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, and undermines our argument to \nother countries around the world that they should not develop or test \nnuclear weapons. With this legislation and related actions over the \npast 2 years, the Bush Administration appears to be moving to change \nthe traditional thinking about nuclear weapons, to make nuclear weapons \nmore usable, and to see them as just another capability. Or, as a \nrecent article in the New York Times Magazine suggests, to make the \nunthinkable--thinkable.\n  Current U.S. law bans research and development of new nuclear weapons \nthat could lead to their production. The specific weapons covered by \nthe ban are so called low-yield nuclear weapons which have a nuclear \nexplosive yield of 5 kilotons or less. Five kilotons is roughly a third \nthe size of the nuclear bomb that was used at Hiroshima, which \nimmediately killed an estimated 140,000 people and left many more \ninjured. The Bush administration asked that this ban be repealed. This \nconference agreement would do so.\n\n  There is some satisfaction that the conference agreement includes \nlanguage adopted on the Senate floor, which would require specific \ncongressional authorization before the administration may engineer, \ntest, produce or deploy a low-yield nuclear weapon. However, this \nrequirement is a poor substitute for current law, which imposes a \ncomplete ban on the development of such weapons.\n  This conference report would also authorize the Bush administration \nrequest to continue work on a Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator, RNEP. As \nwith low-yield nuclear weapons, the Administration would be authorized \nto proceed with research, but would be required to obtain specific \nauthorization to engineer, test, produce or deploy the RNEP. The RNEP \nprogram would modify one of two existing low yield nuclear weapons to \ncreate a nuclear weapon that will penetrate rock. Both weapons being \nlooked at for possible modification are high yield nuclear weapons with \nyields that are approximately 30 and 70 times the explosive power of \nthe Hiroshima bomb.\n  At a time when the United States is trying to dissuade other \ncountries from going forward with nuclear weapons development, when we \nstrongly oppose North Korea's pulling out of the Nuclear \nNonproliferation Treaty, and when we are spending over a billion \ndollars to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons material and \ntechnology, these actions would send a terrible message. We are telling \nothers not to go down the road to nuclear weapons. But instead of being \na leader in the effort to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons, \nwe are recklessly driving down that same road. In short, the United \nStates is following a policy that we do not--and should not--tolerate \nin others.\n  This is an area where many of us have been deeply troubled by the \ndirection of this administration because it would seem at the same time \nwe are trying to dissuade other countries from going forward with \nnuclear weapons development, when we strongly oppose North Korea's \npulling out of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty and when we are \nspending over $1 billion to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons \nmaterial and technology, the actions we are taking here send the wrong \nmessage, which is continuing to go down a road of considering new and \ndoing research on new nuclear weapons and modernization of nuclear \nweapons.\n  We put something of a lid on it by specific language which the \nchairman introduced on the floor, which I very much supported and which \nrequires that before we move to a development stage in any new weapon, \nthat there be a specific authorization by the Congress that does give \nat least some protection, some certainty that we will not move to the \ndevelopment stage of a new modernized nuclear weapon without thorough \nconsideration of the Congress. That, at least, is some constraint on \nthat development.\n  Finally, again, I thank our chairman for bringing this bill to the \nfloor. It has taken tenacity and patience and all the other wonderful \nqualities he has to make it possible. He has a wonderful way of being \ninclusive and open in a way that is appreciated by everybody. It has \nbeen noted on the floor many times in the last few hours.\n  I also thank our ranking minority members, as well as the other \nmembers of our committee who chair the subcommittees, for all the \nsupport they have given to this bill throughout the year. It took a \nlong, long time for this bill to come to the floor and, finally, for us \nto come up with a conference report. We have a truly talented group of \nmembers on our committee.\n  Of course, as the ranking member, I focus on the other ranking \nmembers of the subcommittees, but I know I speak for Senator Warner in \nthanking all of the members of our committee. He has already thanked \nall the members of the committee for their work this year.\n  I thank our staff for their hard work, including Judy Ansley, Rick \nDeBobes, Chuck Alsup, Ken Barbee, Mike Berger, June Borawski, Leah \nBrewer, Jennifer Cave, David Cherington, Chris Cowart, Dan Cox, Madelyn \nCreedon, Mitch Crosswait, Marie Fab Dickinson, Brie Eisen, Evelyn \nFarkas, Richard Fieldhouse, Andy Florell, Brian Green, Creighton \nGreene, Bill Greenwalt, Carolyn Hanna, Jeremy Hekhuis, Bridget \nHiggins, Bruce Hock, Gary Howard, Andrew Kent, Jennifer Key, Greg \nKiley, Maren Leed, Gary Leeling, Peter Levine, Patty Lewis, Tom \nMacKenzie, Sara Mareno, Ann Mittermeyer, Lucian Niemeyer, Cindy \nPearson, Paula Philbin, Lynn Rusten, Arun Seraphin, Joe Sixeas, Christy \nStill, Scott Stucky, Mary Louise Wagner, Dick Walsh, Nicholas West, \nand Kelley Wilson.\n\n[[Page S14441]]\n\n  We could not have come to this position without our staff. If I can \nsingle out Rick DeBobes' work in particular, I know Judy will forgive \nme. This is his first year as staff director on our side, and Rick's \nwork has been nothing less than extraordinary. It is exactly what we \nhave come to expect from him.\n  I must also note Peter Levine, because of his continuous work. I \nprobably should not single out anybody other than Rick, but I think all \nthe members of the staff on this side will also understand why I single \nout Peter, in addition to Rick DeBobes, for the kind of work they have \ngiven this committee this year.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. I take note that \nPeter Levine is here and he has been referred to on our side as the \ndamage control expert, and he is very effective in these areas.\n  I must inquire of my distinguished colleague, was the long hand of \nDavid Lyles felt in this program, the former staff director of Senator \nLevin for these many years? I somehow see the fine hand of David Lyles.\n  Mr. LEVIN. His influence continues. He is now my chief of staff on my \npersonal staff. He takes, of course, a major interest in this area, as \nhe always has. I am sure Rick and Peter and all the others would say \nhaving David on my personal staff is a big plus.\n  Mr. WARNER. It is a big plus to us, also. I take this opportunity to \nthank all of the staff members listed by my good friend and colleague, \nSenator Levin.\n  Mr. President, I want to reach across the aisle, while nobody is \nlooking, and shake hands with my colleague. We have worked together \nthese 25 years and we are a pretty good team. It is a sheer joy to work \nwith him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/11/senate-section/article/S14441-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14441]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

ROCKHOLD\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, at a wreath-laying ceremony at Arlington \nNational Cemetery on this day--Veterans Day--nearly two decades ago in \n1985, President Ronald Reagan spoke about the responsibility we, the \nliving, have in remembering those who have died for us on the field of \nbattle. At that ceremony, President Reagan said this:\n\n       There is a special sadness that accompanies the death of a \n     serviceman [or woman], for we're never quite good enough to \n     them--not really; we can't be, because what they gave us is \n     beyond our powers to repay. And so, when a service [member] \n     dies, it's a tear in the fabric, a break in the whole, and \n     all we can do is remember.\n\n  Today, I come again to the floor of the U.S. Senate to remember an \nOhio serviceman who gave his life to protect us, to protect our \nfamilies, and to help liberate the Iraqi people. Army Private First \nClass Marlin Tyrone Rockhold, who proudly served with the 3rd \nBattalion, 7th Infantry Regiment of the 3rd Mechanized Infantry \nDivision, was killed on May 8, 2003, by a sniper in Baghdad.\n  He was 23 years old.\n  Marlin Rockhold--``Rocko'' to his family and friends--was born in \nHamilton, OH, on July 1, 1979. He attended school in Butler County and \ngraduated from Hamilton High School in 1998, where he was a well-liked \nstudent and member of the Hamilton Big Blue football squad. As his \ngrandmother, Eileen Henderson, described, ``Marlin just about always \nhad a smile. He was a person you just had to like.''\n  Though a kidder growing up, Marlin also had a quiet, determined, \nserious side. After graduation, he set out to realize a dream--a dream \nhe had since childhood. Marlin Rockhold's dream, was to join the \nmilitary. From the time he was a little boy, he wanted to become a \nsoldier. He wanted to see the world. He wanted to see a life outside of \nHamilton. He wanted to serve the country he so dearly loved.\n  And so, on March 4, 2002, Marlin joined the Army and was sent to Boot \nCamp at Fort Benning, GA. From there, he was stationed at Fort Stewart, \nGA. On January 20, 2003, he was sent to Kuwait and eventually went on \nto serve in Iraq as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  Mr. President, for as much as Marlin Rockhold loved the Army, he \nloved his family even more. In fact, two days before he joined the \nservice, on March 2, 2002, he married the love of his life, DaVonna. \nMarlin was thrilled to begin his family with her and her daughter, \nTherashia. He loved them both with every ounce of his being. They meant \nthe world to him. He devoted his life to them.\n\n  While he was in Iraq, Marlin often wrote letters to his wife and his \nfamily. In one letter to his grandmother, he wrote that no one wants to \nfight a war, but sometimes you do what you have to do.\n  Through his service in the Army, PFC Marlin Rockhold was doing what \nhe believed in. He didn't want to leave his family. He didn't want to \nfight a war. But Marlin Rockhold did what he felt he had to do. As Rev. \nLonnie Napier said at Marlin's memorial service:\n\n       He was willing to join the fight for the hopeless so that \n     they might be free.\n\n  Marlin Rockhold was a good soldier. He was a good man. Marlin's \nsister Brooke said he ``always was determined to be happy. Now he's \nwith the Lord. He's happy.''\n  I attended Marlin's funeral, and I am grateful to have had the chance \nto hear his family talk about the ``Rocko'' they so deeply loved and \nadmired. At the service, Marlin's brother Derrick said:\n\n       My brother is a hero, my hero, our hero. He is my \n     inspiration. My brother's legacy will live forever in our \n     hearts.\n\n  Without question, Marlin Rockhold is a hero, and his legacy will live \non through all who knew him and loved him.\n  In addition to his wife and daughter, left to cherish his memory are \nhis mother Mary, his father Gary, his stepmother Joan, his grandmother \nEileen, his four brothers, Keith, Derrick, Gregory, and Anton, his two \nsisters, Brooke and Kara, his in-laws Dorothy and Clarence and Demery \nand Patricia, and several aunts and uncles and nieces and nephews.\n  I know they will miss Marlin deeply. My thoughts and prayers are with \nthem all.\n  I would like to close with something Marlin's wife Davonna said. She \nsaid this:\n\n       I just want Marlin to be remembered--that he [won't] be \n     forgotten. I'll never forget him.\n\n  We, too, will never forget Marlin Rockhold. We will always remember \nhim because, as President Reagan said at the conclusion of his remarks \nat Arlington National Cemetery on that Veterans Day 17 years ago:\n\n       We owe a debt we can never repay. All we can do is remember \n     [the soldiers who have died] and what they did and why they \n     had to be brave for us. All we can do is try to see that \n     other young men and women never have to join them.\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/11/senate-section/article/S14441-3", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14441-S14442]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO BILL MAULDIN\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today on Veterans Day, we are reminded of \nthe sacrifices of all those who have served in our Armed Forces. We \nhonor them, we remember them, and we thank them.\n  Today I would like to talk about a veteran who proudly served in \nWorld War II, a veteran who died this past year, and a veteran who has, \nI think, great meaning for those who served in World War II. He was a \nsoldier who told the stories of World War II through these drawings. \nThat man, of course, is Bill Mauldin. He is remembered for depicting in \nhis cartoons the average World War II soldier, the person who was doing \nhis job, just trying to survive, trying to get home; the average World \nWar II soldier who won the war; the average soldier to whom we all owe \nso much.\n  While Bill Mauldin was depicting the soldier of that generation, in a \nsense he was depicting all those who serve and who have ever served.\n  Bill Mauldin passed away on January 22 of this year at the age of 81 \nfollowing a courageous battle against Alzheimer's disease.\n  World War II veterans felt and continue to feel an attachment to Bill \nMauldin because he really seemed to understand what a typical GI was\n\n[[Page S14442]]\n\ngoing through, and his drawings depicted that. Bill Mauldin's work as a \nmilitary and civilian cartoonist and writer brought a spirited, \ninsightful, and human touch to the issues and people whom he covered. \nHe is perhaps best known for two of the cartoon characters he created, \nWillie and Joe, whose adventures took them across various battlefields \nof World War II.\n  Willie and Joe were both young enlistees on the front lines of \ncombat, very much like Mr. Mauldin himself, a 1940 callup to the Army \nfrom the Arizona National Guard who spent a considerable amount of time \nin the North African and European battle theaters.\n  Willie and Joe were not the straight-edged soldiers we often find in \nofficial wartime publications or Hollywood films. Rather, these two \ncartoon heroes lived the lives of men defined by the difficult \nsurroundings and tasks at hand during World War II--soldiers resolved \nto give their all in the few matters they could control and resigned to \nhope for the best in those which they could not.\n  I think the late historian Stephen Ambrose said it best in the \nintroduction to a re-issue of Mauldin's widely read post-war cartoon \ncompilation entitled ``Up Front.'' According to Ambrose, Bill Mauldin's \ncartoons ``caught on and live on because in them everything is \naccurate. . . . Willie and Joe's boots and smelly socks, their baggy, \ndirty uniforms, their knives, rifles, ammunition, mortars, web belts, \ncanteens, beards, haversacks, helmets (with crease marks or holes), the \nrations--this is how it was.''\n  Ambrose really got it right. Mauldin's unique ability to capture the \nyoung soldier's perspective on day-to-day life during the war in an \ninclusive and patriotic manner earned his work the distinction of \nregular publication in numerous military newspapers, including Stars \nand Stripes and the 45th Division News. His work also won him the \nrespect of fellow soldiers across the globe, one of whom recently \ndescribed Willie and Joe as ``a secret weapon on our side.''\n  Willie and Joe were featured in Mauldin's first post-war compilation \nof cartoons and essays entitled ``Back Home.'' The success ``Back \nHome'' had in bookstores across the country propelled Mauldin to even \ngreater fame, winning him the opportunity to publish several more works \nand even act in a few motion pictures.\n  In fact, Mauldin is so well respected that in 1945, at the age of 23, \nhe received a Pulitzer Prize soon after Time magazine featured him on \nits cover. Following the conclusion of World War II, Mauldin began a \ncareer as a political cartoonist for several major U.S. newspapers, \nincluding the Chicago Sun-Times and then the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, \nstirring up high-profile issues along the way. He won a second Pulitzer \nPrize in 1959 for a cartoon he drew depicting the Soviet Union's harsh \ntreatment of renowned writer and Nobel Prize winner Boris Pasternak. \nBill Mauldin has touched my generation with one of his most famous \ndrawings, a drawing I certainly remember and I know anyone in my \ngeneration remembers. It was a drawing from now what has been 40 years \nago of a statue of Abraham Lincoln at the Lincoln Memorial with his \nface cupped in his hand, weeping, following the assassination of \nPresident John F. Kennedy.\n  I will not forget that image, and I am sure there are many Members of \nthe Senate and across this country who will not forget that, either.\n  Bill Mauldin was a creative, artistic genius who could capture so \nmuch about people and the human condition in the simplicity of his \ndrawings. He could capture in those cartoons what words alone could \nnot. Bill Mauldin had the gift and he used it well. On Veterans Day \nthis year, we should thank Bill Mauldin for that gift and for his \nservice to our Nation, for what he did to represent in drawings the \naverage GI in World War II--and in a sense the average GI throughout \nour long history as a country--for what he did to communicate to so \nmany the way life was for our troops.\n  I would also like to take this opportunity to send that same message \nof thanks on this Veterans Day to all of our current and former service \nmen and women. Whether on the islands of the South Pacific, in the air \nover France, or on land in France or in Germany, on the beaches of \nSicily, the mountains in Korea, the jungles of Vietnam, the deserts of \nKuwait, more recently in the caves of Afghanistan or the streets of \nBaghdad, our service men and women have defended America and they \ndefended our values with great valor. We must never forget that \nveterans served for us, they served for our children, for our \ngrandchildren, and for future generations not yet born.\n  Today on this Veterans Day our service men and women continue to \nserve around the world. We pause again tonight to thank our veterans, \nthank those who have served in the past, and to remember our service \nmen and women who are serving at this very hour tonight.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/11/senate-section/article/S14442-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14442]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CONGRATULATIONS TO EVERETT ``EP'' HOWE\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this Veterans Day, members of the Rapid \nCity and Ellsworth Air Force Base communities will gather to honor \nEverett ``Ep'' Howe for his lifetime of dedicated service. Today I \nsalute the life and work of one of South Dakota's finest patriots.\n  For nearly 70 years, Ep has dedicated himself to serving his \ncommunity and his country. He began his career in the public service, \njoining the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1921, and serving as Park \nRanger and U.S. Border Patrol Officer before joining the military in \n1944. He proudly served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1944 to 1948, \nincluding a tour with the 9th Marine Aircraft Wing during World War II.\n  Discharged as a Marine Sergeant, he returned to Rapid City, his wife, \nGrace, and a career in construction. To say that, in many ways, \nEllsworth Air Force Base is ``The House That Ep Built,'' is no measure \nof hyperbole. Not only has he donated land and raised money for the \nbase, he actually contributed to the construction of some of its \nbuildings. During his time with both Hacket Construction and Corner, \nHowe, & Lee Construction, he worked on a number of projects at what is \nnow Ellsworth, including the construction of the original Rapid City \nAir Force Base, which opened in 1942.\n  Throughout his life, Ep has been a tremendous supporter and friend of \nthe military. A longtime committee member of the South Dakota Employer \nSupport of the Guard and Reserve and of the Rapid City Chamber of \nCommerce Military Affairs Committee, he has been particularly dedicated \nto strengthening relationships between civilian and military \ncommunities. He has received several awards for his work in the \nmilitary community, including the Department of Defense ``Lifetime \nAchievement Award'' and the South Dakota National Guard Major General \nWilliamson Militia Award.\n  In addition to supporting the military, he has been a tireless and \ndedicated servant of his community. He has served on the South Dakota \nHighway Commission, the Rapid City Area Disaster Foundation, the YMCA \nBoard of Directors and Board of Trustees, and the American Legion. He \nhas also been a dedicated member of First Presbyterian Church in Rapid \nCity, the Rapid City Chamber of Commerce, and the local Elks Lodge. Not \nsurprisingly, Ep has received a number of awards for his work in the \ncommunity as well, including being named ``Mr. Rapid City'' for his \nlifelong service as a community leader.\n  On Veterans Day, a bust of Ep will be unveiled in Building 450 on \nEllsworth Air Force Base. It is only fitting that this bust will occupy \nthe building where leaders of the South Dakota National Guard regularly \nmeet. Ep's bust will look down on the proceedings and provide these \nleaders what he has provided so many South Dakotans over the years; a \nfriendly countenance, moral support, and a model for community \nleadership. I commend Ep for his lifetime of accomplishment, and offer \nmy deepest gratitude for the work he has done and continues to do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/11/senate-section/article/S14442-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14442-S14443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise to express my sympathy over the loss \nof James Wolf, a fellow Nebraskan and Specialist in the United States \nArmy. Specialist Wolf was killed on November 6, 2003, in Mosul, Iraq, \nwhen a bomb exploded near the convoy he was traveling in. He was 21 \nyears old.\n\n[[Page S14443]]\n\n  Specialist Wolf was an engineer assigned to the Headquarters and \nHeadquarters Company of the 52nd Engineer Battalion of the 43rd Area \nSupport Group, based in Fort Carson, CO. He was one of thousands of \nbrave American service men and women serving in Iraq who confront \ndanger everyday. Their tremendous risks and sacrifices must never be \ntaken for granted.\n  In October, Specialist Wolf spent 2 weeks of leave with his family in \nhis hometown of Scottsbluff, NE. While there, he visited his alma \nmater, Scottsbluff High School, and thanked students for writing to him \nin Iraq. Specialist Wolf leaves behind parents, Bob and Chris; brother, \nDavid; and sisters, Elli and Rachel. Our thoughts and prayers are with \nthem all at this difficult time.\n  In Iraq, Specialist Wolf assisted with the construction of housing \nand schools for U.S. soldiers and Iraqi citizens. He will be remembered \nas a dedicated soldier with an optimistic outlook on life.\n  For his service, bravery, and sacrifice, I ask my colleagues to join \nme and all Americans in honoring Specialist Wolf.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/11/senate-section/article/S14443-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14443-S14444]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statements were ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n\n\n                            SSG DANIEL BADER\n\n Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today in honor \nof SSG Daniel Bader, a member of the Air Defense Artillery Battery, 1st \nSquadron, 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment.\n  SSG Daniel Bader lived in Colorado for most of his life, but he \nalways loved Nebraska. As a child growing up in York he watched his \nfather put on his Reserve uniform for weekend duty. From his father's \nexample, Daniel Bader learned that sacrifice is part of life and \nserving your country is an honorable way to live life. While in high \nschool, Daniel Bader followed in his father's footsteps and joined the \nGuard himself and after graduation he went on to active duty. He \nexcelled in the Army, rising to staff sergeant in just 8 years. In \naddition to being a soldier and a patriot, Staff Sergeant Bader was \nalso a loving husband and father. In these family roles he also served \nhonorably. Daniel Bader will forever serve as an example for all \nAmericans of the kind of life in service one can live.\n  Staff Sergeant Bader was on his way home for 2 weeks' leave when his \nhelicopter crashed in Fallujah on November 2. He leaves behind his wife \nTiffany and a 14-month-old daughter Taryn Makenzie. A devoted family \nman, Daniel Bader had asked to be buried next to his grandfather at \nRose Hill Cemetery in Palmer, NE. I know my fellow Nebraskans and all \nAmericans join me in honoring and remembering Daniel Bader and the \nsacrifice he made for his family and our Nation.\n\n\n                       SSG CHRISTOPHER W. SWISHER\n\n Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today to honor \nSSG Christopher Swisher, a native of Lincoln, NE and a member of 2nd \nArmored Cavalry Regiment.\n  Staff Sergeant Swisher's mom once said, ``Chris was military from the \nday he was born. Knowing this keeps me going.'' As a young boy, \nChristopher W. Swisher wore camouflage T-shirts and dreamed of joining \nthe military. After graduating from Lincoln Northeast High School, he \nworked hard to overcome his dyslexia and joined the Army.\n  Chris Swisher came from a Nebraska family with a proud military \nbackground. His older brother Terry served bravely as a Marine in \nOperation Desert Storm. The brothers played war games as children, both \ndreaming of the day they could wear the uniform of the United States \nmilitary.\n  Staff Sergeant Swisher was killed on October 9, 2003 when his unit \nwas ambushed while on patrol in Baghdad. He was supposed to be home by \nthen, originally scheduled to return on September 29, but like many of \nour soldiers serving in Iraq, his tour was extended. His family was \ndisappointed but Chris Swisher was doing what he loved to do.\n  All Nebraskans grieve for the Swisher family and we offer them our \nthoughts and prayers. The Swisher family can take some comfort in the \nbrave words Chris spoke to his mother before he left for duty in Iraq: \n``I'm doing what I want to be doing because I'm protecting my family, \nmy home and my country.''\n\n\n                          po3 david j. moreno\n\n Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today to honor \nPO3 David J. Moreno, a member of the 4th Marine Division Detachment, \nNaval Medical Center, San Diego.\n  Petty Officer 3rd Class Moreno dreamed of becoming a doctor. The \nCalifornia native lived briefly in Gering, NE and attended the \nUniversity of Nebraska at Lincoln before joining the Navy. It was in \nthe Navy that he discovered his love for medicine. He earned his \nEmergency Medical Technical License and served the men and women of our \nArmed Services honorably as a Navy medic.\n  Petty Officer 3rd Class Moreno died from a non-hostile gunshot wound \nin Hamishiyah on July 17, 2003. David Moreno died while serving his \nnation in a job he truly enjoyed. His sacrifice, along with the \nsacrifices made by his brothers-in-arms in Iraq and elsewhere during \nthe global war on terrorism, serves as a reminder to Nebraskans and all \nAmericans that freedom and liberty do not come easy. The cost of \nfreedom and liberty is measured in sacrifice and David Moreno made the \nultimate sacrifice to preserve these ideals for the rest of us. His \nsacrifice for freedom, liberty and our Nation is remembered today as we \nsend our thoughts and prayers to his family in Nebraska and \nelsewhere.\n\n\n                         ssg brett j. petriken\n\n Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today to honor \nSSG Brett Petriken of Omaha, NE.\n  A member of the 501st Military Police Company, Staff Sergeant \nPetriken served his nation bravely. In times of war, danger lurks at \nevery turn and he knew this to be true, especially in a war zone like \nIraq. Staff Sergeant Petriken lost his life when a heavy equipment \ntransporter crossed the median and struck the Humvee he was in on May \n26, 2003, in Samawa, Iraq.\n  Brett Petriken is a shining example of a soldier who put his life on \nthe line to protect those he knew and loved and even those he didn't \nknow and love. His family should think of him and remember what is most \nimportant to them, his role in their lives. Americans should think of \nhim and remember that he died in the line of duty upholding the ideals \nof freedom and liberty and protecting the United States from the new \ninvisible foes that represent a tremendous threat to our nation. As a \nnation we are grateful to soldiers like Brett Petriken and others like \nhim who make the ultimate sacrifice so that others can live \nfree.\n\n\n                        SP NATHANIEL A. CALDWELL\n\n Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today to honor \nArmy SP Nathaniel A. Caldwell of Omaha. Specialist Caldwell, a member \nof the 115th Military Police Company, Army National Guard, was killed \nwhen his vehicle rolled over while responding to a civilian call on May \n21, 2003 in Baghdad, Iraq.\n  Specialist Caldwell joined the armed services shortly after September \n11 to serve his county. His commitment to protecting America at home \nand abroad is inspiring to us all. Nebraskans can look to Specialist \nCaldwell as an example of an American inspired to serve his Nation. He \ndid so bravely. His sacrifice will forever remind the nation of the \ndanger that comes with the duty to protect our Nation's interests and \nto preserve the flame of liberty for Americans and for all the world's \npeople.\n  I know I join all Nebraskans in offering our thoughts and prayers for \nhis family in Texas, Oklahoma, and elsewhere.\n\n\n                           CPT TRAVIS A. FORD\n\n Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today to honor \nCPT Travis A. Ford of Ogallala, NE. Captain Ford always gave 100 \npercent in everything he did. He excelled in high school sports and \nbrought his enthusiasm to the Yell Squad at Husker football games while \nhe attended the University of Nebraska at Lincoln.\n  As a Marine, he was selfless. A member of the Light Attack Helicopter \nSquadron 267, Marine Aircraft group 39, 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing, he \nvolunteered to fly extra shifts so that younger Marines could get some \nsleep in the early days of the war. When his AH-1W Super Cobra attack \nhelicopter crashed on April 4, 2003, during combat operations near \nBaghdad he became the first Nebraskan to give his life in Operation \nIraqi Freedom.\n  Captain Ford will be greatly missed and our thoughts and prayers are \nwith\n\n[[Page S14444]]\n\nhis family and friends in Ogallala, but Captain Ford will also be \nremembered for the shining example of patriotism, dedication and \ncommitment that he set as a brave member of the Marines.\n\n\n                             SP1 JAMES WOLF\n\n Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today in honor \nof SP1 James Wolf, a member of the Headquarters and Headquarters \nCompany, 52nd Engineer Battalion of the 43rd Area Support Group.\n  Specialist Wolf stopped in to visit the students at the Lincoln \nHeights Elementary School in Scottsbluff, NE when he was home on leave \njust a few short weeks ago. He wanted to thank all the students who had \nwritten letters to him while he was in Iraq and he told them how the \nletters they had written lifted his spirits and how he shared their \nletters with soldiers around him who did not receive any mail of their \nown.\n  He recently returned to Iraq where he was performing valuable work \nrebuilding schools, homes, and providing safe drinking water. \nTragically, he was killed on November 6, 2003 when an improvised \nexplosive device detonated near his truck convoy.\n  His death was a blow to the Scottsbluff community where he was \nremembered as a young man with a lot of spunk and someone who wanted to \nmake a difference. He is the son of Bob and Chris Wolf of Scottsbluff. \nHis mother said of him, ``He was very proud of what he did. He talked \nabout making it a career, and he had such a sense of purpose. It was \nawesome just to hear him.'' James' sister Rachel, a 2003 graduate of \nScottsbluff High, informed the school of her brother's death. Kirk \nBegley, principal at Scottsbluff High, said it was a ``sad, sad day \nwhen we had to let the staff know.'' Begley said James Wolf was ``just \nan all around great kid and was adamant about being a soldier.''\n  Specialist First Class Wolf will be missed greatly by his family and \nfriends and the entire Scottsbluff community. He will also be \nremembered as a soldier whose patriotism inspired his community. I \nwould like to express my deepest sympathy for the Wolf family and I \nknow all Nebraskans join me in remembering and honoring James' \ncontributions to Scottsbluff and his sacrifice on behalf of his \ncountry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/11/senate-section/article/S14444-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14444]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO THE 10TH MOUNTAIN DIVISION\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the 250 \noutstanding Vermonters who served in the 10th Mountain Division during \nWorld War II. I want to commend the Vermont Ski Museum for recognizing \nthe significant contributions of these exceptional men by inducting \nthem into the Ski Hall of Fame.\n  As a fellow veteran who grew up in the era of World War II, I \nremember President Roosevelt's call for volunteers. It came as no \nsurprise that when the military asked for skiers, trappers, and \nwoodsmen to serve in the 10th Division, many of those who responded to \nthe call of duty were from our own Green Mountain State. For a young \nboy in Rutland, VT, these men were my heroes.\n  The 10th Mountain Division distinguished itself in fighting on the \nisland of Kiska in Alaska and in the mountains of Italy. Recently we \nhave been reminded of the effectiveness of these soldiers on skis. At a \ntime when modern weapons and sophisticated technology seemed to \novershadow the 10th Division's skills, recent conflicts in Afghanistan \nand other parts of the world have shown us that much of war boils down \nto human fortitude and a single man against the elements. Modern \nwarfare has not proven to be more effective than the 10th Mountain \nDivision when it comes to fighting in these extreme elements over \nrugged terrain. We are coming back to basics, and hopefully military \nplanners will never doubt the necessity of divisions with skills like \nthe 10th as part of our national defense.\n  After the war, many of the veterans of the 10th Mountain Division \ncame home to leave their mark on the ski industry. Vermont was no \nexception, and the ski industry has flourished here due in part to the \npassion these individuals have for skiing. They are indeed members of \nthe Greatest Generation and their selfless contributions are evident \nthroughout our State.\n  I applaud the Ski Museum for acknowledging your individual \nsacrifices, your defense of our country and your contributions to \nskiing. It is a privilege for me to join the many others in honoring \neach of you. You continue to be my heroes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/11/senate-section/article/S14444-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14444]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE ARMED FORCES RELIEF TRUST\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an important \nprogram that significantly assists our men and women who are fighting \nabroad.\n  The war on terrorism is being fought on may fronts and around the \nworld. Today, there are more than 140,000 troops stationed in Iraq, \nAfghanistan, and many more around the world.\n  Many of these troops served in Afghanistan only to be almost \nimmediately redeployed to fight in Iraq. These extended deployments \nhave been trying for those left behind, But they have stepped up and \nmet the challenge. They have answered the Nation's call with enthusiasm \nand dedication.\n  In Colorado, the large deployment from Ft. Carson has shown just how \ndifficult it can be for many military families when our troops must be \nsent abroad. While the military is dedicated to taking care of its own, \nthe current situation abroad means needs of the family will only \ncontinue to escalate.\n  To address this, the four relief agencies representing the Army, \nNavy, Marine Corps, and Air Force recently combined into one umbrella \nrelief organization in order to better provide assistance.\n  The National Association of Broadcasters and its 1,000 television \nstation and 6,000 radio station members recently produced and disturbed \nPublic Service Announcements that encourage viewers and listeners to \ncontribute to the Armed Forces Relief Trust.\n  Broadcasters have a long history of involvement in this country's \nnational security. I commend them for dedicating airtime to this \nworthwhile cause.\n  Last year, together, the four relief agencies distributed $109 \nmillion to military families in need. I am confident that by \nstreamlining operations into one entity and with help from local \nbroadcast stations to get the word out, the Armed Forces Relief Trust \nwill be able to assist even more military families.\n  We are counting on our brave young men and women in the field. They \nare relying on the Armed Forces Relief Trust, and the trust is counting \non local broadcast stations. Local radio and television stations are \nperforming an invaluable public service through this program, and I \nsalute them.\n  Since today is Veterans Day, I also salute those who have already \nexperienced the hardships of war much like those currently stationed in \nIraq and Afghanistan. I believe the most important thing we can do for \nour veterans is say thank you for their service and sacrifice to our \ncountry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/11/senate-section/article/S14444-3", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14444-S14445]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NFL MILITARY AWARENESS INITIATIVE\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, on this Veterans Day I recognize a \nmilitary public awareness initiative that Mr. K. S., Bud, Adams, the \nfounder and owner of our NFL Tennessee Titans, played a strong role in \ninstituting this past weekend. Mr. Adams, a U.S. Naval Officer during \nWorld War II, and five other National Football League owners who also \nserved in the military during that same time, urged NFL Commissioner \nPaul Tagliabue to launch this campaign to help the hundreds of American \nfamilies of our brave military servicemen and women who have died for \nour country in the line of duty in Afghanistan and Iraq. Mr. Adams and \nhis fellow NFL owners urged NFL headquarters to initiate an awareness \ncampaign at NFL stadiums and on NFL game telecasts starting Veterans \nDay Weekend, November 9-11, to help bring attention to the difficult \nfinancial situation that our military dependents face in the days and \nweeks immediately after a serviceman's or woman's death in the Middle \nEast.\n  The other five NFL owners who served during World War II are Tom \nBenson, New Orleans Saints; Wellington Mara, New York Giants; Art \nModell, Baltimore Ravens; Alex Spanos, San Diego Chargers; and Ralph \nWilson, Buffalo Bills.\n\n[[Page S14445]]\n\n  As Commissioner Tagliabue said in announcing this new program: ``Our \nclubs recognize that the men and women of our Armed Forces are \ntremendous NFL fans. This program is one small way to repay that \nsupport to families who lose a loved one in defense of our country in \nthe Middle East. Our NFL owners, coaches and players speak with one \nvoice when it comes to this project.''\n  The campaign cornerstone is a new national TV and radio announcement \nproduced by NFL Films that aired on every NFL game telecast this past \nVeterans Day weekend. It is narrated by Vietnam veteran and former \nPittsburgh Steelers running back Rocky Bleier. The message encourages \nNFL fans to support the Intrepid Foundation's Fallen Heroes Fund, which \nprovides an immediate $10,000 grant to military families who have paid \nthe ultimate price with the loss of a member in Iraq or Afghanistan. \nThe following is the text for the television message narrated by \nBleier:\n\n       The National Football League family is committed to \n     supporting the courageous men and women serving in the U.S. \n     Armed Forces in the Mideast.\n       But the fight for freedom is not without loss.\n       And the NFL urges you to join us and the Intrepid Fallen \n     Heroes Fund in supporting the military families of those \n     heroes who have sacrificed their lives in the service of our \n     country.\n       Please visit www.nfl.com/heroesfund and help support those \n     families in need.\n\n  This program--and the $100,000 contribution that the NFL made to \nkickoff the initiative--is the latest in the NFL's continuing support \nof our U.S. military personnel. That tremendous NFL support dates back \nat least to World War II when 638 NFL players served in the military, \nincluding 19 who were killed in action. The NFL has worked with the USO \nfor decades in sending NFL players overseas to Vietnam, Korea and more \nrecently Iraq to let our courageous troops know that they are not \nforgotten.\n  I hope you will join me in applauding Mr. Adams and the NFL for their \nlatest ``Families Helping Families'' public awareness program and thank \nthem for their support of our brave men and women in uniform.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/11/senate-section/article/S14445-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14445]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          FISHERIES MANAGEMENT\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to draw attention to a \nlooming crisis for New England's groundfishermen. Last week, the New \nEngland Fishery Management Council voted to adopt a set of new \nregulations, known as Amendment 13. This package of regulations will \npermanently alter the character of New England's groundfish fishery, \nand will particularly harm the fishermen in my home State of Maine. \nThis sweeping change in fisheries management is largely unneeded; in \nfact, most stocks of fish in the groundfish complex are rapidly \nrebuilding. There is a much larger problem in the fishery management \nprocess that has subverted a system of rational management and forced \nthese unnecessary changes on our fishing industry. That problem is \nexcessive litigation.\n  Amendment 13, like many other regulations driven by excessive \nlitigation, will permanently harm Maine's fishermen and related \nbusinesses. Historically, numerous coastal communities in Maine have \ntaken part in and benefitted from the groundfish fishery. \nUnfortunately, regulatory changes will force many of Maine's smaller \ngroundfish boats out of the industry. Small fishing communities like \nStonington, Rockland, and Port Clyde which used to be home to many \ngroundfish vessels, are already suffering due to restricted access to \nfish stocks. The changes to these coastal communities clearly stem from \nregulations born of excessive litigation.\n  Further, these burdensome regulations will hurt boats of all sizes. \nMany small boats will not survive due to severe cuts in fishing time \ncombined with the long distances that must be traveled in order to \naccess fish stocks. In addition, Maine's larger vessels are leaving our \nStates, moving to southern New England ports, in an effort to survive \nthis latest round of regulations. The damaging effect of such an exodus \non Maine's fishing infrastructure, which is at a critical minimum, will \nbe irreparable. As Amendment 13 is put into place, revenues will \ncontinue to move south, and Maine's working waterfront will vanish, to \nbe replaced by coastal development.\n  The drastic sacrifices demanded of our fishermen might be worthwhile \nif New England groundfish were truly at risk. However, fish stocks are \nrebounding at a tremendous rate. For example, Georges Bank haddock \nbiomass figures have gone from less than 20,000 metric tons in 1994 to \nroughly 100,000 metric tons in 2002. Overall, groundfish biomass \nfigures have tripled since 1994. This fishery is a success story. \nUnfortunately, litigants refuse to agree. They have stolen management \nauthority away from the regional councils and given this power to the \ncourts, which are particularly ill-suited to make biological decisions.\n  Excessive litigation also diverts precious resources from the main \nmission of the National Marine Fisheries Service: fisheries management. \nEach year the Service spends time and money defending itself in the \ncourts. In fact, this year the Senate is considering appropriating $5 \nmillion to the National Marine Fisheries Service exclusively for the \npurpose of fighting litigation. This money could be better spent \nconducting research, if our management system was not engulfed in \nlitigation.\n  We all suffer when a management system is under siege from excessive \nlitigation. As in the case of Amendment 13, management plans are \ndeveloped under an aura of crisis where managers must meet court-\nappointed goals before court-appointed deadlines. What we need instead, \nis fisheries management developed with measure and reason. We need a \nsystem where the views of stakeholders are valued.\n  In 1976, Congress passed the Fishery Conservation and Management Act. \nOne of the strongest aspects of this act was the creation of regional \nfishery management councils. These councils rely on the participation \nof those who know the most about our Nation's fisheries. Unfortunately, \nsome advocacy groups have chosen to bypass the council system by \nproceeding straight to court. In fact, one of these groups has already \nthreatened to sue the National Marine Fisheries Service if they do not \nget what they want out of Amendment 13. This is truly discouraging, \nconsidering these regulations have yet to be published. Excessive \nlitigation should not continue to diminish the participatory nature of \nfisheries management by removing decision-making authority away from \nthose most qualified to manage our Nation's fisheries.\n  The Amendment 13 process is a clear example of why fisheries \nmanagement belongs in the hands of fisheries managers. The courts \nhanded our regional managers a set of impossible goals and an \nimpossible time frame in which to achieve these goals. Nothing but the \nimpossible can result from this situation, despite the efforts of \nregional managers to create a reasonable management plan. This entire \nprocess only demonstrates the weaknesses of regulation driven by \nexcessive litigation, and the need to take management decisions out of \nthe courts and place them back in the council system. That will require \nchanges in the law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/11/senate-section/article/S14445-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14445]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH.

HOGAN ON HIS RETIREMENT\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate one of \nOklahoma's finest soldiers, LTC Michael E. Hogan, who is retiring after \na distinguished career of over 20 years of exceptionally meritorious \nconduct in the United States Army. Lieutenant Colonel Hogan was \ncommissioned as a Second Lieutenant, Field Artillery, after graduating \nfrom the United States Military Academy. His first assignment was as a \nFire Support Team Chief, HHB, 2d Battalion, 6th Infantry Division, Fort \nOrd, CA. Demonstrating keen expertise and artillery skills, he moved \nthrough various positions in the unit, including Firing Battery Fire \nDirection Officer, Executive Officer, and Battalion Fire Direction \nOfficer. After developing and mastering the required skills as an \nArtilleryman through an assignment in Camp Casey, Korea, Lieutenant \nColonel Hogan was moved to Fort Sill, OK, where he assumed a role on \nthe faculty of the Field Artillery School.\n  In 1989, Lieutenant Colonel Hogan served as the Battery Commander for \nBravo Battery, 2d Battalion, with 105mm Howitzers, for almost 2 years. \nBecause of his expertise in artillery systems, he was moved to a \nposition as a test officer with the U.S. Army Operational Test and \nEvaluation Center. After further refining his skills in artillery \nsystems while performing as a test team chief, Lieutenant Colonel Hogan \nwas moved to a position as an executive officer with the 6th FA \nBattalion, Fort Sill, OK. In 1997, while in the position on the Corps \nArtillery Staff, Lieutenant Colonel Hogan was deployed to Haiti where \nhe served 6 months as the Joint Task Force Chief of Staff. Upon his \nreturn to Fort Sill, he was installed as the executive officer for the \n212th Field Artillery Brigade. After serving in this position for \napproximately 1 year, Lieutenant Colonel Hogan was sent to the Pentagon \nas a representative of the regimental staff of the Field Artillery \nCenter, with duty in the Office of the Chief of Legislative Liaison.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Hogan directly applied special talents and \nexpertise as a Hardware Congressional Liaison Officer in the Office of \nthe Secretary of the Army, Legislative Liaison Programs Division from \nMarch 2000 through February 2004. Lieutenant Colonel Hogan maintained a \nconstant liaison with professional staff members of the Senate and \nHouse Armed Services Committees on critical issues relating to army \nprocurement programs such as the Crusader Field Artillery System, \nStryker, and the Army's top priority, the Future Combat System.\n  Throughout these assignments, Lieutenant Colonel Hogan has provided \noutstanding leadership, advice, and sound professional judgment on \nsignificant issues that affected both the Army and Congress. His \nactions and counsel were invaluable to Army leaders and Members of \nCongress as they considered the impact of important issues. Lieutenant \nColonel Hogan's dedication to accomplishing the Army's legislative \nliaison mission has been extraordinary. He is truly an outstanding \nofficer who displays superb professional leadership skills and is \ntotally dedicated to mission accomplishment in the highest traditions \nof military service. I am proud to call him a constituent, and wish him \nwell in his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/11/senate-section/article/S14446-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14446-S14447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO COMMANDER WILLIE McCOOL\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to pay my respects to my fellow \nveterans. It is only through the leadership, dedication, and sacrifice \nof our men and women in uniform that we are able to enjoy the freedoms \nthat we value so much as Americans. We cheer our veterans at \nhomecomings and parades, and we grieve for them when they do not come \nhome. At critical times in U.S. history, as we are facing now, we \nunfortunately find ourselves grieving more for our military service \nmembers, than celebrating and honoring their service. Veterans Day \ngives us a chance to honor and thank all of these heroes.\n  On this Veterans Day, I would like to share the story of one such \nhero who touched many American lives--Commander Willie McCool. \nCommander McCool was killed earlier this year as he was piloting the \nColumbia Space Shuttle towards home. Recently, Commander McCool's \nfamily, Naval Academy classmates, and former cross-country and track \nteammates participated in a ceremony at the location where a memorial \nwill be placed in his honor. The essence of what that memorial will \nstand for was captured perfectly in a recent Washington Post article by \nWilliam Gildea, dated October 30, 2003.\n  On October 2, 1982, as captain of the Naval Academy's men's cross \ncountry squad, McCool led the midshipmen to a victory over Georgetown \nand Syracuse Universities, while setting a personal record for the 5-\nmile race of 24:27. On February 1, 2003, Commander McCool and the \nmembers of his crew perished when Columbia came apart over Texas, only \n15 minutes from landing.\n  The location of the planned memorial for Commander McCool will be 15 \nminutes from the finish line on the day he set his best time. The spot \nwas chosen to commemorate Commander McCool's life and acknowledge his \ncontributions to the country, the Navy, and the Naval Academy's cross-\ncountry program, as well as to recognize the positive impact that being \na Navy runner had on his life.\n  Before inviting his cross-country coach Al Cantello to the Space \nShuttle Columbia launch, Commander McCool sent a portrait of himself to \nCantello with the following inscription: ``Your coaching laid a \nfoundation of discipline, drive and passion that has carried me across \nthe many milestones of my life. With boundless appreciation, Willie.'' \nFrom that foundation, Commander McCool developed into a top-notch Naval \nOfficer and served our country in an exemplary manner. On this Veterans \nDay, I humbly thank Commander McCool, and his family, for his selfless \nservice and sacrifice for our country.\n  At this time, I ask unanimous consent that the October 30, 2003, \nWashington Post article regarding Commander Willie McCool be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Nov. 2, 2003]\n\n                   The Perfect Place To Honor a Hero\n\n                          (By William Gildea)\n\n       Sports doesn't have enough heroes, but Willie McCool is a \n     hero. The captain of the 1982 cross-country team at the Naval \n     Academy, he was known for smiling in the midst of a grueling \n     race as the effort showed on the faces of the other runners. \n     No matter the difficult, he always was happy. That really was \n     how he showed the way in whatever he did. As his coach, Al \n     Cantello, said yesterday morning, ``Everyone should meet a \n     Willie McCool in his lifetime.''\n       Cantello was driving out to the Academy cross-country \n     course to join relatives, former teammates and other friends \n     of McCool. They gathered on the crest of the hill at 8 a.m. \n     to honor the man they loved. McCool said from space on Jan. \n     30: ``From our orbital vantage point, we observe an earth \n     without borders, full of peace, beauty and magnificence. And \n     we pray that humanity as a whole can imagine a borderless \n     world as we see it and strive to live as one in peace.''\n       He was the pilot of the space shuttle Columbia, which broke \n     up as it reentered the earth's atmosphere Feb. 1.\n       ``Isn't this a great cross-country morning--crisp, perfect \n     for running?'' Mark Patterson, the 1983 team captain, said in \n     welcoming the people who assembled quietly on the hill. \n     There, they plan to have a memorial built in McCool's honor. \n     It will not be something grandiose, they said, because that \n     would not be representative of such a modest person as \n     McCool; it would be simple, but it would be big enough for \n     passing runners to notice, maybe to be inspired by, something \n     to prompt a thought.\n       The son of a Navy aviator, William C. McCool finished \n     second of 1,083 in the class of 1983. He went on for two \n     master's degrees, one from Maryland. During that time, he \n     often returned to the rolling course where he had worked out \n     twice a day during cross-country and track seasons. McCool \n     was one of many who thought of that five-mile route as a \n     special place. And he was one of those who remained grateful \n     to the man who put him on the course where he developed some \n     of his leadership skills. Before inviting his coach to the \n     Columbia launch, McCool sent a portrait of himself to \n     Cantello with the inscription: ``Your coaching laid a \n     foundation of discipline, drive and passion that has carried \n     me across the many milestones of my life. With boundless \n     appreciation, Willie.''\n       For the most part, the five-mile course follows the \n     perimeter of the Academy's golf course, across the Severn \n     from the campus. Jimmy Carter ran it as a midshipman. So have \n     numerous Olympians, tens of thousands of college runners, \n     countless others. But after Saturday, when McCool's widow, \n     Lani, and his mother, Audrey, were presented flowers at \n     the simple ceremony, the course seemed even more special. \n     It felt like hallowed ground.\n\n[[Page S14447]]\n\n       McCool was said to be an extraordinary test pilot. He did \n     small things well, too. He liked to make people happy. Capt. \n     Clyde Villemez, who was the naval officer representative for \n     cross-country in the early `80s, remembered him tenderly \n     escorting his 8-year-old daughter onto the dance floor at a \n     wedding reception. Villemez retains a vivid image of the two. \n     ``She was dancing on top of his feet,'' he said.\n       Ronnie Harris, who ran the 5,000 meters for Navy, missing \n     the 1996 U.S. Olympic team by just 25 hundredths of a second, \n     had the idea for a memorial. He was serving in Florida when \n     he heard of Columbia's fate. He did what many former Navy \n     runners did as they thought of their friend. ``I went for a \n     run,'' he said.\n       Now he was back on his favorite course, standing close to \n     where the marker will go.\n       ``This is a very beautiful spot. It's absolutely \n     gorgeous,'' Audrey McCool said.\n       It is not just any spot. It was chosen for a reason.\n       The last radio communication from the Columbia was received \n     about 15 minutes before the scheduled completion of the \n     mission. The crew of seven was 15 minutes from home.\n       McCool's friends measured back 15 minutes from the finish \n     line of the cross-country course based on McCool's fastest \n     time, in a meet with Georgetown and Syracuse on Oct. 2, 1982. \n     As it happened, they came to an idyllic setting, at the top \n     of a grassy hill, on a brief level stretch before a slope \n     leading to a narrow path through the trees.\n       That's where they will build the monument.\n       That's when he was 15 minutes from home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/11/senate-section/article/S14447-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO LTG GENERAL JOHN S.

After 36 \nyears of exemplary commitment and dedicated service to the United \nStates Army, General Caldwell is retiring.\n  General Caldwell's career has been vast in the command and staff \npositions he has held. Beginning as a Platoon Leader at Fort Meade, MD, \nin 1967 until his current assignment at the Pentagon, he has been a \nsteady and dedicated member of the United States Armed Forces.\n  A graduate of the United States Military Academy, West Point, NY, \nGeneral Caldwell's career has been one of dedication, service, and \nsacrifice. Upon graduation, he was commissioned in the Armor/Cavalry. \nHe has commanded armored cavalry units from platoon through battalion, \nhad combat duty with the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment in Vietnam, and \nserved two tours in the Federal Republic of Germany.\n  He has held a variety of other assignments including: Deputy Chief of \nStaff for Research, Development and Acquisition, Headquarters, Army \nMateriel Command; Director, Army Digitization Office, Headquarters, \nDepartment of the Army; Assistant Deputy for System Management and \nInternational Cooperation, Office of the Assistant Secretary of the \nArmy, Research, Development and Acquisition; Assistant Professor for \nthe Department of Engineering at USMA; Research and Development \nCoordinator, Office of the Project Manager, Abrams Tank Systems; \nOperations and Training Officer, S-3, for 2nd Squadron, 11th Armored \nCavalry Regiment; Operations Staff Officer and Deputy Chief of Staff, \nOperations, Plans and Training for the Army Staff; Research and \nDevelopment Staff Officer, Army Studies Group for the Office of the \nChief of Staff, Army; Chief, Strategy Application Branch of the \nStrategic Plans and Policy Directorate, J-5, for the Joint Staff, and, \nProject Manager, Abrams Tank Systems.\n  General Caldwell is often sought after for his knowledge and insight \ninto the critical issues facing our country today. He is a decorated \nsoldier, having received the following decorations and badges: \nDistinguished Service Medal, with Oak Leaf Cluster, Silver Star, \nDefense Superior Service Medal, Legion of Merit, with 2 Oak Leaf \nClusters, Bronze Star, Meritorious Service Medal, with Oak Leaf \nCluster, Air Medal, Army Commendation Medal, with Oak Leaf Cluster, \nArmy Achievement Medal, Ranger Tab, Joint Chiefs of Staff \nIdentification Badge, and Army Staff Identification Badge.\n  On this Veterans Day, I celebrate and applaud the distinguished \ncareer of LTG John S. Caldwell. A courageous soldier, fearless leader, \nand patriot, General Caldwell is much deserving of a relaxing and \nenjoyable retirement. My best wishes go out to his wife, Judy, his \nfamily and friends in this time of celebration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/11/senate-section/article/S14447-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        MEDIA CONSOLIDATION AND DIMINISHING INDEPENDENT CONTENT\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, in June of this year, the Federal \nCommunications Commission issued a decision relaxing a number of \nimportant rules that limit consolidation in the media industry. In the \nmonths leading up to that decision, and ever since, a bipartisan group \nof Senators has sought to sound the alarm about the dangers of \nunbridled media concentration. Those efforts eventually led to Senate \npassage of a resolution to reverse the commission's decision. But the \nbattle continues, and the outcome is uncertain,\n  Most of the debate on this subject has focused on the details of \nrules limiting the national reach of broadcasters and the local cross-\nownership of television, newspaper, and radio stations. But I would \nlike to call attention to another important dimension of media \nconcentration: the demise of independent producers, who are being \nbought up or driven out of business by the big networks and big \nstudios.\n  More and more, the television programming delivered to the homes of \nAmerican families is controlled by a handful of executives in a handful \nof corporate boardrooms. Independent writers and producers are growing \nscarce. Indeed, there soon may be only two remaining independent \nHollywood studies that produce scripted television programming. The \nothers have either disappeared or linked up with one of the major \nnetworks.\n  I think that having all programming produced by a few large media \nconglomerates could pose some real risks for creativity and diversity. \nThat is why I would like to commend my colleague from Arizona, Commerce \nCommittee Chairman John McCain, for his leadership in agreeing to \ncohost a dialogue with Chairman Billy Tauzin of the House Energy and \nCommerce Committee and representatives of studios, networks, writers, \nand producers.\n  I am confident that under the direction of Chairman McCain, this \ndialogue can produce positive discussion and concrete results, such as \nvoluntary guidelines to help ensure diversity, competition, and \nopportunity in the market for television programming. I look forward to \nparticipating.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/11/senate-section/article/S14447-3", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14447-S14448]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      WTO RULING ON STEEL TARIFFS\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, yesterday, the World Trade Organization \nupheld its earlier ruling that the steel tariffs imposed in March of \nlast year are illegal and in violation of global trade rules. As a \nresult of this ruling, the European Union threatened to impose trade \nsanctions on American imports sold in Europe, ranging from footwear to \nfruits and vegetables. The EU has said that it will impose duties of \n13, 15, 30 percent on these imports as soon as December 6 or at the \nlatest December 15, if the steel tariffs continue to remain in place. \nThe EU trade sanctions alone would amount to about $2.2 billion.\n  Unfortunately though, the EU is not alone. Japan has announced that \nit will join the EU in retaliatory trade sanctions against the U.S. \nChina, Norway and Switzerland have also notified the WTO that they will \npossibly impose trade sanctions against the U.S. if the steel tariffs \nare not removed.\n  There is plenty of evidence that if the steel tariffs are allowed to \ncontinue they will do more harm than good. On September 19, the \nInternational Trade Commission released its report on the effects of \nthe steel tariffs on steel consuming industries. Here is what they \nfound.\n  One-half of the steel-consuming firms that were surveyed reported \nthey had difficulty in obtaining steel in the qualities and quantities \nthey needed.\n  Almost one-third of these firms relocated or shifted production to \nforeign plants or facilities after the implementation of the tariff.\n  One-quarter reported that their customers had shifted to purchasing \nfinished parts or assemblies overseas as a result of the steel tariff.\n  Almost one-third of these firms also reported their contracts they \nhad in place to purchase steel were broken or modified after the tariff \nwas imposed\n\n[[Page S14448]]\n\nand reported a loss in profits due to these problems of approximately \n$190 million.\n  One-third of these firms reported longer lead and delivery times.\n  In addition, the report further highlighted the particular impact the \nsteel tariff has had on auto-parts suppliers. Tennessee is home to over \n950 auto-parts suppliers and they make up about one-third of all our \nState's manufacturing jobs.\n  Eighty-five percent of the auto-parts suppliers surveyed said that \ntheir steel prices in the US were higher than global prices.\n  Thirty-one percent reported that customers had shifted purchases to \nbuying finished parts or assemblies overseas as a result of the tariff.\n  Seventy-four percent reported changes in contract prices for steel \nand 55 percent reported that steel tariff was the only important factor \nin these changes in steel prices.\n  Seventy-nine percent reported an inability to pass on steel price \nincreased to customers.\n  All of these burdens have meant extra costs to steel consuming firms. \nExtra costs that have affected steel-consuming jobs all across America. \nThe steel tariff may have saved some steel-producing jobs but is has \nalready destroyed a lot more steel-consuming jobs.\n  The American economy is beginning to recover and I strongly believe \nthat this recovery is a direct result of the President's jobs and \neconomic growth plan. The last thing we need now is any new cost such \nas the steel tariff on a major manufacturing sector that slows down \neconomic growth. I fear that if the steel tariff remains that we will \nsee more plant closings during 2004 in Tennessee and across America.\n  I believe the President has made an honest good faith effort to save \nsteel jobs, but that it has backfired by destroying automotive and \nother steel consuming jobs. I hope that he decides that the best \ndecision that can make for the American worker is to end the steel \ntariff.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/11/senate-section/article/S14448-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14448]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n(At the request of Mr. DASCHLE, the following statement was ordered to \n                       be printed in the Record.)\n\n\n                 money laundering in syria and lebanon\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, while I support the enactment of the \nSyria Accountability Act, I am disappointed this legislation does not \ncontain any provisions to stop the scourge of money laundering from \nSyria and Lebanon.\n  Recently published reports state that $3 billion from Saddam \nHussein's Iraqi regime are currently being held in Syrian-controlled \nbanks in Syria and Lebanon and that these funds may have been used to \nfinance attacks on American forces in Iraq. If these allegations are \nproven correct, then the actions by the government of Syria are \nintolerable and unacceptable and demand a strong response by the United \nStates government to insure that funds stolen from the Iraqi people are \nnot used to help insurgents attack American forces and destabilize \nIraq.\n  Unfortunately, Syria and Lebanon have had a long history of being \ninvolved in terrorism and money laundering. The Secretary of State has \ndesignated Syria as a state whose government repeatedly provided \nsupport for acts of international terrorism and has provided designated \nforeign terrorist organizations, such as Hamas and Hizballah, with \nsanctuary. The State Department in its March 2003 International \nNarcotics Control Strategy Report--INCSR--has classified Syria as a \ncountry to be monitored for potential money laundering.\n  Lebanon remains one of the more sophisticated and well-capitalized \nbanking sectors in the Middle East. With its tradition of bank secrecy, \nthe extensive use of foreign currency, the influx of remittances from \nexpatriated workers, and a lack of financial accountability and \nenforcement, Lebanon has developed a financial environment conducive to \nlaundering the financial proceeds of international crimes such as \nnarcotics, counterfeiting and smuggling. The International Narcotics \nControl Strategy Report--INCSR--has designated Lebanon as a \njurisdiction of primary money laundering concern. The Financial Crime \nEnforcement Network--FinCEN--has conducted an analysis of the \nSuspicious Activity Reporting System--SAR--related to Lebanon for the \nperiod of January 2002 through October 2003. The FinCEN analysis has \nrevealed 286 SARs that could be linked to transactions associated with \nsuspicious or fraudulent wire transfer activities between Lebanon and \nother countries. Many of these transactions were structured in an \nattempt to avoid reporting requirements. Two of the reports indicate \npossible terrorist activities.\n  The United States has the largest and most accessible economic \nmarketplace in the world. Foreign financial institutions and \njurisdictions must have unfettered access to markets to effectively \nwork within the international economic system.\n  In 2000, I introduced legislation that became Section 311 of the USA \nPATRIOT Act which provides the federal government with the authority to \nleverage the power of United States financial markets to force \ncountries like Syria and Lebanon to reform and enforce their counter-\nmoney laundering and counter-terrorist financing laws. Section 311 \nprovides the Secretary of the Treasury with measures that are \ngraduated, discretionary, and targeted, focusing on international \ntransactions involving criminal proceeds, while allowing legitimate \ninternational commerce to continue unimpeded.\n  Earlier this year, I sent a letter to President Bush asking him to \ndirect the Secretary of the Treasury to identify both Syria and Lebanon \nas primary money laundering concerns under the authority provided in \nSection 311. I also asked that U.S. financial institutions be required \nto provide enhanced scrutiny of financial transactions from Syria and \nLebanon to ensure funds linked to international terrorists do not \noriginate from or pass through financial institutions in those \ncountries on their way to the United States\n  I also call on the President to develop an international strategy to \nstop the laundering of funds from Syria and Lebanon within the \nframework of the Financial Action Task Force--FATF, the European Union, \nthe G-8, and other multilateral forums.\n  I strongly believe that the United States must take any and all \nnecessary measures to stop international terrorist organizations--such \nas Hamas and Hizballah--and former members of the Iraqi government who \nmay be residing in Syria, Lebanon, and other countries in the area from \nsupporting terrorist activities in Iraq and elsewhere.\n  If the United States is to lead the world in the fight against \nterror, we must effectively use our own laws to cut off the flow of \nlaundered funds from terrorist groups through the international \nfinancial system. The measured use of Section 311 authority against \nSyria and Lebanon provides the United States an opportunity to \ndemonstrate leadership in the fight against international terrorism and \nmoney laundering. We cannot afford to fail in this endeavor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/11/senate-section/article/S14448-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14448-S14449]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FUNDING FOR AIRPORT PROJECTS\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, maintaining and improving this country's \nairports and aviation infrastructure is crucial to economic growth and \nopportunity at both the local and national levels. That is why it is so \nunfortunate that Congress has not yet been able to pass the Federal \nAviation Administration reauthorization legislation.\n  The fact is, this legislation need not have been controversial. But \nit was made controversial, because conferees went behind closed doors \nand made changes that contravene the clearly expressed will of both \nhouses of Congress.\n  My point today is not to rehash the substantive arguments on the \npoints under dispute. I simply want to stress that in no event should \nthis dispute be allowed to bring important airport and aviation \nprojects screeching to a halt. Instead, the responsible path is to \nrecognize that the controversial elements of the legislation may take \nsome time to resolve. In the meantime, both sides should agree to a \nshort-term extension of FAA funding programs, so that no aviation \nproject is held hostage to politics.\n  Senator Rockefeller has introduced a bill to provide for a 6-month \nextension of FAA funding programs, and I am signing on as a cosponsor. \nI hope that our colleagues will join in supporting this legislation, to \nensure that\n\n[[Page S14449]]\n\nfunding for local airports projects will not become a victim of \npolitical brinksmanship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/11/senate-section/article/S14449-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14449-S14450]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I hereby submit to the Senate the budget \nscorekeeping report prepared by the Congressional Budget Office under \nSection 308(b) and in aid of Section 311 of the Congressional Budget \nAct of 1974, as amended. This report meets the requirements for Senate \nscorekeeping of Section 5 of S. Con. Res. 32, the First Concurrent \nResolution on the Budget for 1986.\n  This report shows the effects of congressional action on the 2004 \nbudget through November 7, 2003. The estimates of budget authority, \noutlays, and revenues are consistent with the technical and economic \nassumptions of the 2004 Concurrent Resolution on the Budget, H. Con. \nRes. 95, as adjusted.\n  The estimates show that current level spending is below the budget \nresolution by $11.7 billion in budget authority and by $13.1 billion in \noutlays in 2004. Current level for revenues is $62 million below the \nbudget resolution in 2004.\n  Since my last report, dated November 4, 2003, the Congress has \ncleared and the President has signed the following acts that changed \nbudget authority, outlays, or revenues for 2004: Emergency Supplemental \nAppropriations Act for Defense and for the Reconstruction of Iraq and \nAfghanistan, Public Law 108-106; and, An act making further continuing \nappropriations for Fiscal Year 2004, Public Law 108-107. In addition \nthe Congress has cleared for the President's signature the following \nacts: Interior Appropriations Act, 2004, H.R. 2691; an act to \nreauthorize certain school lunch and child nutrition programs, H.R. \n3232; and, Military Family Tax Relief Act of 2003, H.R. 3365.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the following related information in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 10, 2003.\n     Hon.

Mr. President, today the city of Chicago, IL, is marking \nthe passing of a legend. Just yesterday, Chicago, and the rest of the \nNation as well, lost a giant--the famous Chicago Sun Times columnist \nIrv Kupcinet who died at age 91.\n  In the city of Chicago, there are few landmarks anyone thinks of, but \none of the great landmarks was Irv Kupcinet. He was a columnist not \nonly known across Chicago but across the Nation.\n  A native Chicagoan, Kup, as he was known to millions, said that even \nas a child he knew someday he would be in the newspaper business. But \nit wasn't until a shoulder injury ended his first National Football \nLeague season with the Philadelphia Eagles in 1935 that he turned to \njournalism, becoming a sports writer for the now defunct Chicago Times.\n  In 1948 that paper merged with a cross-town rival to create the Sun-\nTimes, the newspaper which Kup called home for the remaining 55 years \nof his life. And as any reader of his columns can attest, right up \nuntil the end, Irv Kupcinet still wrote with passion and wit about the \nsubjects on which he built his career--famous people and his native \nChicago.\n  Over the years, Kup's column was distributed to more than 100 \nnewspapers around the world and its author showered with innumerable \nawards. In 1982, he was elected to Chicago's Journalism Hall of Fame. \nThe city of Chicago renamed the Wabash Avenue bridge over the Chicago \nRiver in his honor in 1986.\n  In 1959, Kup became the host for the syndicated television show, ``At \nRandom,'' where he interviewed personalities ranging from Nobel Prize \nwinners and politicians to starlets and oddballs. Kupcinet estimated he \ninterviewed about 6,500 guests on the show, which aired every Saturday \nnight for 27 years, including former Presidents Richard M. Nixon, \nGerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, and other newsmakers such as Lenny Bruce, \nSenator Robert Kennedy, Yul Brynner and Malcolm X. The show won a \nPeabody Award for excellence in broadcasting and more than a dozen \nEmmys.\n  His other accomplishments were enough to fill several careers. He \ncontinued his relationship with football by officiating for the NFL. He \nbroadcast Chicago Bears football games on radio, with Jack Brickhouse, \nfor 24 years. He appeared in two movies by Otto Preminger, ``Advise and \nConsent'' and ``Anatomy of a Murder.''\n  But it was his power as a writer and his integrity as a person that \nset Irv Kupcinet apart. Kup did not dish the dirt that other celebrity \ncolumnists thrived on. Instead, he often took on subjects not typically \ncovered by his counterparts; topics such as race relations and \nveterans' issues. He was also a tireless worker for charities--raising \nfunds and lending his name to a host of charitable causes.\n  In 1939, Kup married the love of his life, a feisty redheaded \nNorthwestern University student named Esther ``Essee'' Solomon. The \ncouple had two children, Jerry and Karyn, who was known as ``Cookie.'' \nCookie was an aspiring actress and moved to Hollywood, where she died \nat the age of 22. Her murder was never solved, and Kup grieved the loss \nof his daughter for the rest of his life. His beloved Essee died just \ntwo years ago in 2001.\n  Today we woke up to a world without Irv Kupcinet, and we are all \nsomewhat poorer by that loss. But a little part of Kup will always be \nwith us. And his example is one worth noting.\n  If an aspiring columnist were to ask my advise on reaching the \nhighest levels of that profession, I would offer the following advice: \nstudy the life of Irv Kupcinet. Try to capture his passion, his \ncourage, his style. And never forget those things that came across in \nevery column he wrote--a love of story, a love of language, and a \ngenuine love of people.\n  Thank you Kup. We will miss you.\n  I close by saying a few months ago, Kup, who was then in a \nwheelchair, asked me if I would join him at his legendary luncheon he \nhad every Saturday at the Drake Hotel. I went to that luncheon. There \nwere about 12 gathered there--friends of Kup for a lifetime. I was the \nyoungest at the table by at least 20 years.\n  I listened as they regaled me with stories of America and Chicago, of \nsports, of horse racing, entertainment--everything that had made Kup's \nlife. It was a great lunch, and I will never forget it.\n  America is never going to forget Irv Kupcinet. The real question we \nnow face in Chicago is whether we can get up in the morning and face a \nday without Kup's column. By standing fast to his memory, standing fast \nto his values, I think we will be able to weather this storm and still \nmaintain a warm spot in our heart for the late Irv Kupcinet.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/11/senate-section/article/S14450-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14450-S14451]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    CONGRATULATING CHARLYE O.

JERALD TUNHEIM RETIRES FROM DAKOTA STATE UNIVERSITY\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and \nhonor Dr. Jerald Tunheim on the occasion of his retirement as the \npresident of Dakota State University in Madison, SD.\n  After receiving both his Bachelor of Science degree in Engineering \nPhysics and Master of Science in Physics from South Dakota State \nUniversity in Brookings, South Dakota, Dr. Tunheim briefly moved to \nStillwater, OK, where he received his Ph.D. in Physics from Oklahoma \nState University. He began his South Dakota teaching career at his alma \nmater in 1968 as an assistant professor of physics before becoming \nprofessor and Head of the Physics Department in 1980.\n  Dr. Tunheim has earned the respect and admiration of all those who \nhad the opportunity to work with him. His friendly demeanor and wealth \nof knowledge helped him develop close friendships with various \ncolleagues and students while establishing the legacy of Dakota State \nUniversity in South Dakota. Dr. Tunheim joined Dakota State University \nthree years after the South Dakota legislature changed Dakota State \nUniversity's mission to focus on computer and information systems \ntechnology as academic disciplines. In his term as President, there has \nbeen a 236 percent increase in enrollment and the number of computer \nmajors has soared from 109 in 1985 to over 1,000 today.\n  In his Letter from the President, Dr. Tunheim is proud to announce \nthat, ``with a proud heritage as its foundation, Dakota State has \nevolved to meet the needs of today's students with its innovative \napproach to education and a faculty with diverse backgrounds and \nexperiences. Dakota State offers its students the best opportunities to \nlearn and grow to meet the demands of their future.'' Over the years, \nDr. Tunheim has committed himself to helping Dakota State University \nstudents learn more about themselves and the world around them as he \nhas worked hard to help students find the best in themselves. Thousands \nof students over the years have benefited from Dr. Tunheim's commitment \nto higher educational excellence.\n  On the occasion of his retirement, I congratulate Dr. Tunheim for his \ntireless dedication to Dakota State University and his commitment to \nquality education. Dr. Tunheim has been recognized many times over for \nhis extraordinary career including being named Teacher of the Year \ntwice while at South Dakota State University. He was also chosen as one \nof the ``100 Influential South Dakotans for 1994'' is listed in \njournals such as American Men and Women of Science, Who's Who in \nAmerica, Who's Who in American Education, and Oxford Who's Who. In \naddition to the hours he puts in as President of Dakota State \nUniversity, Dr. Tunheim has spent his time on the Madison Area Chamber \nof Commerce Education Committee, Madison Area Chamber of Commerce Board \nof Directors, Council of Presidents and Superintendents of South Dakota \nSystem of Higher Education. Governor's Task Force on Vocational-\nTechnical Education, and the National Association of Intercollegiate \nAthletes Council of Presidents, among many others.\n  The lives of countless people have been enormously enhanced by Dr. \nTunheim's talent and leadership as President at Dakota State \nUniversity. The State of South Dakota is a better place because of his \ncommitment to and passion for higher education excellence and his \nachievements should serve as a model for other talented educators \nthroughout our state to emulate.\n  I wish Dr. Jerald Tunheim the very best on his retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/11/senate-section/article/S14451-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14451]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. LUGAR, from the Committee on Foreign Relations, \n     without amendment:\n       S. 1824.

A bill to amend title 37, United States Code, to provide \nfinancial assistance to State and local governments that continue to \npay employees who serve on active duty in a reserve component of the \nuniformed services; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today is Veterans Day--a day to honor the \nservice of those brave men and women who have fought for and defended \nour country.\n  This Veterans Day has special meaning as 130,000 Americans are \nserving in Iraq, and many in this country have lost loved ones in Iraq \nin the past year.\n  Americans can be proud of the soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines \nwho are serving today. They are continuing to show the courage, \ndignity, and bravery with which our veterans, who we honor today, have \nserved in the past.\n  That rich tradition includes those Americans who serve in the Guard \nand Reserves. In the 12 years since the first war in Iraq, more than \n525,000 members of the Guard and Reserves have been mobilized--more \nthan twice the number that were mobilized in the previous 36 years.\n\n[[Page S14453]]\n\n  When they are called up to active duty, they leave their civilian \njobs--and their civilian salaries--behind. Most take a pay cut--and are \nglad to do so to serve our country. But when that active duty service \nbecomes an extended tour of duty, the financial strain on the families \nleft behind can be enormous.\n  To close this pay gap, some State and local governments make up the \ndifferent between military and civilian pay for their employees who \nhave been activated. Unfortunately, with strains on State and local \nbudgets across the country--as well as the increased demand for more \npolice and firefighters to help fight terrorism and enhance our \nhomeland security--such payments to our Guards and Reservists are a \nfinancially difficult option--or not an option at all--for most State \nand local governments.\n  That is why I am today introducing the Service to the Country \nReimbursement Act. Under my bill, the Federal Government would \nreimburse State and local governments for the costs of paying the \ndifferent between the civilian salary and the military pay of a Guard \nor Reserves member who is activated for more than 30 days.\n  This legislation will encourage State and local governments to make \nthose payments in order to keep the families financially whole, \nensuring that the families of those who serve our country in the Guards \nand Reserves will not be financially penalized because of the service \nbeing made to our country.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me in this effort. And I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1845\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to establish a \npresumption of service-connection for certain veterans with hepatitis \nC, and for the other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce legislation I \nfirst introduced in the 105th Congress to address a serious health \nconcern for veterans--specifically, the health threat posed by the \nHepatitis C virus.\n  This legislation, the Veterans Hepatitis C Treatment bill, \nestablishes a presumption of service connection for veterans with \nhepatitis C, provided that certain conditions are met. This bill will \nenable veterans who contracted Hepatitis C in military service to \nreceive treatment for this condition by the Department of Veterans \nAffairs.\n  Under this legislation, veterans who received a transfusion of blood \nduring a period of service before December 31, 1992; veterans who were \nexposed to blood during a period of service; veterans who underwent \nhemodialysis during a period of service; veterans diagnosed with \nunexplained liver disease during a period of service; or veterans \nworking in a health care occupation during service, will be eligible \nfor treatment for Hepatitis C at VA facilities.\n  I have reviewed medical research that suggests many veterans were \nexposed to Hepatitis C in service, and are now suffering from liver \ndisease and other diseases caused by exposure to this virus. I am \ntroubled that many ``Hepatitis C veterans'' are not being treated by \nthe VA because they can't prove the virus was service connected, \ndespite the fact that Hepatitis was not isolated until 1989 and could \nnot be tested for until 1990.\n  Hepatitis C is a hidden infection with few symptoms. However, most of \nthose infected with the virus will develop serious liver disease 10 to \n30 years after contracting the virus. For many of those infected, \nHepatitis C can lead to liver failure, transplants, liver cancer and \ndeath.\n  And yet, most people who have Hepatitis C don't even know it--and so \nthey don't get treatment until it's too late. It has been estimated \nthat up to 70 percent of the approximately four million Americans with \nHepatitis C are unaware that they carry the virus. For those who know \nthey're infected, the\n\n[[Page S14454]]\n\nprognosis is promising--some estimates indicate that 50 percent may \nhave the virus eradicated.\n  Vietnam veterans in particular are just now starting to learn that \nthey have liver disease likely caused by Hepatitis C. Early detection \nand treatment may help head off serious liver disease for many of them. \nHowever, many veterans with Hepatitis C will not be treated by the VA \nbecause they must first establish a service connection for their \ncondition--a standard that is virtually impossible to meet.\n  My colleagues may be interested to know how veterans were likely \nexposed to this virus. Medical advances during the Vietnam War included \nrapid evacuation, improved transfusion and high rates of U.S. casualty \nsurvival in an era prior to Hepatitis C screening of the blood supply. \nBlood transfusion is one of the most common ways Hepatitis C is \ntransmitted. Medical transmission of the virus through needles and \nother medical equipment is also possible in combat. Medical care \nproviders who served in combat, where universal precautions and rubber \nglove use are often absent, were likely at increased risk as well, and \nmay have, in turn, posed a risk to the service members they treated.\n  Researchers have discovered that some blood sent from the U.S. was \ninfected with the virus. Researchers and veterans organizations, \nincluding the Vietnam Veterans of America, believe that many veterans \nwere infected after being injured in combat and getting a transfusion \nor from working as a medic around combat injuries.\n  Yet, veterans cannot establish a service connection because \nfrequently there were no symptoms when they were originally infected \nwhile in Vietnam. In addition, while medical records may show a short \nbout of Hepatitis, Hepatitis C was not known at the time and there was \nnot a test available to detect the virus.\n  The Hepatitis C infected veteran is essentially in a catch-22 \nsituation: the VA will not provide treatment unless a service \nconnection has been established, but the veterans cannot prove that \nthey contracted Hepatitis C in combat because the science to detect the \nvirus didn't exist. Without legislative authority to treat these \nveterans, thousands of veterans infected with Hepatitis C while in the \nservice will not receive VA health care testing or treatment.\n  I believe that in the long run we will actually save money by testing \nand treating this infection early on. The alternative is much more \ncostly treatment of end-state liver disease and the associated \ncomplications, or other disorders.\n  Former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, well respected both within \nand outside of the medical profession, has said: ``In some studies of \nveterans entering the Department of Veterans Affairs health facilities, \nhalf of the veterans have tested positive for [the Hepatitis C virus]. \nSome of those veterans may have left the military with the [Hepatitis C \nvirus], while others may have developed it after their military \nservice. In any event, we need to detect and treat [Hepatitis C] if we \nare to head off very high rates of liver disease and liver transplant \nin VA facilities over the next decade.''\n  Some may argue that further epidemiologic data is needed to resolve \nthe issue of service connection. I agree that we have our work cut out \nfor us, and further study should be done. However, there is already a \nsubstantial body of research which has firmly established that veterans \nhave a higher incidence of Hepatitis C when compared to non-veterans. \nWe should not ask those who have already sacrificed so much for this \ncountry to wait--perhaps for years--for the treatment they deserve \nwhile further research is being conducted.\n  Today is Veteran's Day and we will all take time to honor the \nsacrifices that these brave men and women have made to defend the \nfreedom of this country and ensure others could live in peace. These \nveterans shouldn't be asked to fight another battle for the benefits \nand respect that they have earned.\n  I hope this legislation will be a constructive step in addressing the \nhealth concerns of this Nation's veterans, and I look forward to \nworking with the Veterans Affairs Committee, the VA-HUD appropriators, \nand veterans groups to meet this emerging challenge.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORZINE:\n  S. 1847. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to establish a \ncomprehensive program for testing and treatment of veterans for \nHepatitis C virus; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today on Veterans Day to introduce \nthe Veterans Comprehensive Hepatitis C Health Care Act. This bill would \nfundamentally change the way the Department of Veterans Affairs is \naddressing the growing Hepatitis C epidemic, and would create a \nnational standard for testing and treating veterans with the virus.\n  Hepatitis C is a disease of the liver caused by contact with the \nHepatitis C virus. It is primarily spread by contact with infected \nblood. The CDC estimates that 1.8 percent of the population is infected \nwith the Hepatitis C virus, and that number is much higher among \nveterans. Vietnam-era veterans are considered to be at greater risk \nbecause many were exposed to Hepatitis C-infected blood as a result of \ncombat-related surgical care during the Vietnam War. In fact, data from \nthe Veterans Administration suggests that as many as 18 percent of all \nveterans and 64 percent of Vietnam veterans are infected with the \nHepatitis C Virus (HCV). For many of those infected, Hepatitis C can \nlead to liver failure, transplants, liver cancer, and death.\n  And yet, most veterans who have Hepatitis C don't even know it--and \noften do not get treatment until it's too late. Despite recent advances \nin treating Hepatitis C, the VA still lacks a comprehensive, \nconsistent, uniform approach to testing and treating veterans for the \nvirus. Only a fraction of the 3.5 million veterans enrolled nationally \nwith the VA Health Care System have been tested to date. Part of the \nproblem stems from a lack of qualified, full-time medical personnel to \nadminister and analyze the tests. Most of the 172 VA hospitals in this \ncountry have only one doctor, working a half day a week, to conduct and \nanalyze all the tests. At this rate, it will take years to test the \nentire enrolled population--years that many of these veterans may not \nhave.\n  To address this growing problem, I am introducing the Veterans \nComprehensive Hepatitis C Health Care Act. This legislation will \nimprove access to Hepatitis C testing and treatment for all veterans, \nensure that the VA spends all allocated Hepatitis C funds on testing \nand treatment, and sets new, national policies for Hepatitis C care. \nCongressman Rodney Frelinghuysen from New Jersey has introduced \ncompanion legislation in the House of Representatives.\n  The bill would improve testing and treatment for veterans by \nrequiring annual screening tests for Vietnam-era veterans enrolled in \nthe VA system, and providing annual tests, upon request, to other \nveterans enrolled in the VA system. Further, it would require the VA to \ntreat any enrolled veteran who tests positive for the Hepatitis C \nvirus, regardless of service-connected disability status or priority \ngroup categorization. The VA would be required to provide at least one \ndedicated health care professional--a doctor and a nurse--at each VA \nHospital for testing and treatment of this disease.\n  This bill would also increase the amount of money dedicated to \nHepatitis C testing and treatment, and would make sure these funds are \nspent where they are needed most. Beginning in FY04, Hepatitis C \nfunding would be shifted to the Specific Purpose account under the \nVeterans Health Administration, and would be dedicated solely for the \npurpose of paying for the costs associated with treating veterans with \nthe Hepatitis C virus. The bill would allocate these funds to the 22 \nVeterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN) based on each VISN's \nHepatitis C incidence rate, or the number of veterans infected with the \nvirus.\n  In addition, this bill will end the confusing patchwork of policies \ngoverning the care of veterans with Hepatitis C throughout the nation. \nThis legislation directs the VA to develop and implement a \nstandardized, national Hepatitis C policy for its testing protocol, \ntreatment options and education and notification efforts. The bill \nfurther directs the VA to develop an outreach program to notify \nveterans who have\n\n[[Page S14455]]\n\nnot been tested for the Hepatitis C virus of the need for such testing \nand the availability of such testing through the VA. And finally, this \nlegislation would establish Hepatitis C Centers of Excellence in \ngeographic areas with high incidence of Hepatitis C infection.\n  As I've said, many veterans do not even realize that they may be \ninfected with the Hepatitis C virus, and the VA is doing little to \nencourage them to get the critical testing they need. The VA currently \nlacks a comprehensive national strategy for combating this deadly \ndisease. With the passage of the Veterans Comprehensive Hepatitis C \nHealth Care Act, veterans will finally be provided with the access to \ntesting and treatment that they have more than earned and deserve. \nAdditionally, the Federal Government will actually save money in the \nlong run by testing and treating this infection early on. The \nalternative is much more costly treatment of end-stage liver disease \nand the associated complications, or other disorders.\n  The VA has known about the problem of Hepatitis C among veterans \nsince 1992, but they have not acted. We must address this critical \nissue for the brave men and women who have placed their lives in danger \nto protect the United States. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this crucial legislation.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1847\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Bend Pine Nursery Land Conveyance Act to \ndirect the Secretary of Agriculture to sell the Bend Pine Nursery \nAdministration Site in the State of Oregon; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill, with my \nfriend and colleague Senator Smith of Oregon, to amend the Bend Pine \nNursery Land Conveyance Act, enacted three years ago, authorizing the \nsale of the U.S. Forest Service Bend Pine Nursery to the community of \nBend, OR, for use as a public park and recreation facility.\n  In the original bill, Senator Smith, Congressman Walden and I sought \nto achieve some very basic objectives. We wanted the community of Bend \nto take title to a property which for many years had been a federally \nowned plantation for growing pine seedlings, and which will now make a \nsuperb park and ball field complex for the use of the community. At the \nsame time, the bill authorized the sale of several other properties in \norder to raise an account enabling the Forest Service to acquire a new \nheadquarters for the Deschutes National Forest.\n  In 1999, we drafted the original legislation in very close \nconsultation with the U.S. Forest Service based on the assumption that \nin so doing, the agency would have the necessary tools and direction to \nmove swiftly to implement the legislation. The intent of the \nlegislation was to have the Forest Service sell the property to the \nBend Parks District within a year of its enactment at the estimated \nvalue of the property at that time, $3 million.\n  Unfortunately, the goodwill built up throughout the drafting process \nwas squandered by the Forest Service. Two years of delays in the \nimplementation of the original legislation resulted in an appraised \nprice of $5.8 million as opposed to the $3 million this property was \nassumed to be worth when the original Bend Pine Nursery Land Conveyance \nwas enacted in 2000. This delay has been inconsistent with the intent\n\n[[Page S14456]]\n\nof the original legislation and runs entirely contrary to the interest \nof Bend taxpayers.\n  The community has always been more than willing to pay fair value for \nthis property, and their goodwill and their tax dollars should not be \nwasted any longer.\n  The bill I introduce today resolves the issues that stand in the way \nof implementation of this simple land sale in a fair manner, directing \nthe sale to move forward expeditiously for $3.5 million. That figure is \narrived at by assuming the $3 million value of the property on the day \nthe original Act was passed, allowing for inflation per the Forest \nService's calculations, and then deducting the value of acreage that \nthe Forest Service has decided not to sell and 15 acres the Forest \nService has the ability to transfer to the local school district at no \ncost.\n  I look forward to the expeditious resolution to this issue.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill to be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1848\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Eisenhower \n     signed into law the Act proclaiming November 11 as Veterans \n     Day (Public Law 83-380);\n       Whereas on October 8, 1954, in anticipation of the first \n     nationwide observance of Veterans Day in 1954, President \n     Dwight D.

Is there objection? The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, we have heard \na lot on our side about the CARE Act. Let me say we are strongly \ncommitted to it. We have worked with the majority on a bipartisan basis \nto avoid the policy disagreements and pass a bill that increases the \nresources desperately needed by the charitable community.\n  We strongly support the vital funding for the Social Services Block \nGrant. The Senate bill restores the Social Services Block Grant to full \nfunding of $2.8 billion. However, the House provides no such provision.\n  These grants are used to fund a range of social services, with \nrecipients ranging from children in need of day care or protective \nservices, to elderly or disabled individuals in need of home-delivered \nmeals.\n  These funds today are urgently needed. We have heard from \norganizations across the country and across the political spectrum that \ntell us how important this money is, including: America needs a \npowerful mobilization of civic energies and a substantial increase in \nresources, public and private, to confront widespread poverty and \nsocial problems. We also need closer and more effective collaboration \nbetween the Government and this country's community organizations.\n  It is because of our strong commitment to this funding and our \nconcern about what has been happening in conferences that we are here \ntoday. Democrats believe that through prompt passage of the reconciled \nCARE and Charitable Giving Acts, Congress will provide the leadership \nto translate these concerns to action.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I ask consent that the leader would modify \nhis request to provide for all the provisions of his request, except \nthe portion on going to conference. We stand ready now to pass this \nbill and send it to the House, just as we have done on several bills in \nthe past week--for example, the military tax bill. Just today we \namended and passed the Syrian Accountability Act. It is not unusual for \nthe Senate to send a measure to the House with an amendment, just as we \nare now suggesting with respect to H.R. 7.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the majority leader modify his request?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I object to the proposed modification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard with respect to the \nproposed modification.\n  Mr. REID. I object to the leader's request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 264, a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution regarding Veterans Day, which was introduced earlier \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 264) expressing the sense of the \n     Senate regarding Veterans Day 2003.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, November 11 was originally known as \nArmistice Day to celebrate the end of World War I. In 1938, Congress \ndeclared November 11 a national holiday in the hopes that the world \nwould never ever again see a battle so fierce and so devastating as \nthat First World War, but that was not to be.\n  Only a few years later, World War II broke out in Europe. America \nwould lose 407,000 servicemen in battle. Henceforth, the movement began \nto recognizes our heroes in uniform.\n  In 1954, President Eisenhower proclaimed November 11 Veterans Day. He \ntold the Nation at that time that it was his ``earnest hope that all \nveterans, their organizations, and the entire citizenry will join hands \nto ensure proper and widespread observance of this day.''\n  Today, nearly 50 years later, we join hands to pay tribute to that \nvery special group of people who have brought our country such honor, \nwhose courage and whose sacrifice have secured our\n\n[[Page S14459]]\n\nliberty: the men and women of the Armed Forces; people such as Senator \nDaniel Inouye, who fought so valiantly in World War II and earned the \nhighest award that can be bestowed, the Medal of Honor; Senator McCain, \nwho served with singular courage and sacrifice in Vietnam; Senator \nStevens, a World War II Air Force pilot, who earned two distinguished \nFlying Crosses, two Air Medals, and the Yuan Hai medal from the \nRepublic of China. John Warner, Chuck Hagel, and Fritz Hollings are \nalso Members of this distinguished body who served in battle with honor \nand with courage.\n  It is because of them and over 46 million veterans since our Nation's \nfounding that we are today free--free to debate in these Halls of \nCongress, free to raise our families with the values that we choose. It \nis because of the sacrifices of these special Americans that we have \nthe freedom to live as fully and as completely as our imaginations will \nallow, to realize those blessings of liberty.\n  The last 2 years have put these blessings in stark relief. On \nSeptember 11, when our enemies struck, and the billows of smoke were \nrising out of the World Trade Center and the Pentagon here in \nWashington, DC, and in that pulverized plane on a Pennsylvania field, \nwe saw that determined face of evil.\n  But as clear as the blue sky above--and who will ever forget that \nbright, stark, blue sky on that morning?--we saw the blessings of \nliberty. We relearned that freedom indeed is precious and that freedom \nmust be defended.\n  Since that day a new generation of men and women have heard the \ncalling--so young yet so brave. They are taking the battle to the \nenemy. The men and women in the Armed Forces are proving every day that \nAmerica is a courageous and a compassionate nation, and that our cause \nis just.\n  We are blessed to have such heroes among us. Today we honor them as \nwell. We are working with the President to improve our veterans' \nquality of life by securing the benefits afforded to them for their \nservice. Access to quality care is critical to our veterans. Veterans \nhospitals have been the focal point of veterans' health care delivery.\n  We are also working to improve the hospital system to allow disabled \nveterans to collect, over 10 years, the portions of their pensions that \nthey do not receive under current law. Veterans with combat-related \ninjuries and those who are considered 50-percent disabled would qualify \nfor these benefits. It is our intent to have this legislation enacted \nthis year.\n  For our future veterans, we have expanded funding to support our \ntroops. In the 2004 emergency Iraq-Afghanistan supplemental \nappropriations bill, military personnel salaries and benefits were \nincreased to $17.8 billion for Guard and Reserve troops activated for \nduty.\n  In addition, much of the funding in this supplemental appropriations \nbill will be used to support military operations and provide needed \nequipment to our troops overseas.\n  We are also working to help our fighting men and women by improving \nveterans health care and the TRICARE program for our armed services. \nThe recently enacted supplemental bill increases TRICARE benefits to \nthousands of members of the Guard and Reserve.\n  In these and other concrete ways, we are working hard to support \nthose whose serve us so ably. In doing so, we not only recognize their \ncontribution, we recognize the great purpose of our Nation.\n  In the midst of the Revolution, the great essayist Thomas Paine told \nhis fellow Americans:\n\n       These are the times that try men's souls. The summer \n     soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink \n     from the service of their country, but he that stands it now \n     deserves the love and thanks of man and woman.\n\n  Today we express our love and thanks to the men and women who have \nstood to defend our freedoms in battles past, and to all of the \nsoldiers today in the field, I thank you. America thanks you.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating to this matter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 264) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 264\n\n       Whereas tens of millions of Americans have served in the \n     Armed Forces of the United States during the past century;\n       Whereas hundreds of thousands of Americans have given their \n     lives while serving in the Armed Forces of the United States \n     during the past century;\n       Whereas the contributions and sacrifices of the men and \n     women who have served in the Armed Forces of the United \n     States have been vital in maintaining our freedoms and way of \n     life;\n       Whereas the more than 700,000 brave Americans who have \n     sacrificed their lives while serving in the Armed Forces of \n     the United States have ensured that the Nation, which is \n     founded on the principles of freedom, justice, and democracy, \n     shall endure;\n       Whereas Armistice Day was first proclaimed by President \n     Woodrow Wilson in 1919 to commemorate the November 11, 1918, \n     armistice between the Allies and the Central Powers that \n     ended the fighting of World War I;\n       Whereas on June 1, 1954, President Dwight D. Eisenhower \n     signed into law the Act proclaiming November 11 as Veterans \n     Day (Public Law 83-380);\n       Whereas on October 8, 1954, in anticipation of the first \n     nationwide observance of Veterans Day in 1954, President \n     Dwight D. Eisenhower issued a presidential proclamation \n     regarding that Veterans Day which states that ``[o]n that day \n     let us solemnly remember the sacrifices of all those who \n     fought so valiantly, on the seas, in the air, and on foreign \n     shores, to preserve our heritage of freedom, and let us \n     reconsecrate ourselves to the task of promoting an enduring \n     peace so that their efforts shall not have been in vain'';\n       Whereas on November 10, 2003, President George W. Bush \n     issued a presidential proclamation regarding Veterans Day \n     2003 which states that ``[t]oday, our veterans inspire new \n     generations of Americans as we work to defeat terrorism and \n     advance peace. In respect for and recognition of the \n     contributions our service men and women have made to the \n     cause of peace and freedom around the world, the Congress has \n     provided (5 U.S.C. 6103(a)) that November 11 of each year \n     shall be set aside as a legal public holiday to honor \n     veterans'';\n       Whereas in 2003 the Senate is in session on November 11 \n     despite that date being a public holiday to honor veterans; \n     and\n       Whereas it is proper that the Senate observe the day with \n     appropriate tributes and commemorations even as it conducts \n     the Nation's business: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate--\n       (1) that the war dead of the Nation, and veterans of the \n     Armed Forces of the United States, alive or dead, are to be \n     honored for their contributions and sacrifices to preserve \n     the Nation and the principles of freedom, justice, and \n     democracy that all Americans hold dear;\n       (2) that Veterans Day 2003 shall be commemorated with \n     appropriate tributes to all veterans of the Armed Forces of \n     the United States for their contributions and sacrifices, and \n     most especially to those who made the ultimate sacrifice; and\n       (3) that all Americans shall be encouraged to join the \n     Senate in honoring and paying tribute to veterans of the \n     Armed Forces of the United States, both on Veterans Day and \n     throughout the year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/11/senate-section/article/S14459-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14459-S14461]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  BIRTH DEFECTS AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES PREVENTION ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Res. 265\n\n       Whereas in late October 2003, southern California \n     experienced multiple simultaneous devastating wildfires that \n     destroyed\n\n[[Page S14462]]\n\n     thousands of homes, took many lives, and burned hundreds of \n     thousands of acres of grasslands and forests, exceeding the \n     devastation of any fires in the past century;\n       Whereas in the space of a few days, all of the resources of \n     local firefighting companies were called on to man fire \n     lines, first on 1 front and then on many fronts;\n       Whereas firefighters were thrown into extraordinarily \n     dangerous situations because of the fast-moving, fuel- and \n     wind-driven fires;\n       Whereas firefighters exhibited resilience and courage by \n     continuing to stay on the lines, often in back-to-back \n     shifts, while knowing, in some instances, that their own \n     families were in danger or that their personal homes had been \n     lost;\n       Whereas 1 firefighter, Steven Rucker, made the ultimate \n     sacrifice by giving his life;\n       Whereas the firefighters who were called initially were \n     later assisted by skilled and courageous pilots, who flew \n     water-drop flights in the most challenging wind and smoke \n     conditions, and by firefighters from throughout the State of \n     California and neighboring States;\n       Whereas additional emergency personnel, including law \n     enforcement and medical personnel, have coordinated with \n     local authorities and firefighters and have performed beyond \n     the call of duty in the preservation and protection of human \n     lives; and\n       Whereas members of the Armed Forces have once again met \n     their country's call to duty, providing valuable firefighting \n     assets and assistance to the emergency response efforts of \n     California: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes and honors all of the firefighters who \n     responded to the devastating outbreak of wildfires in \n     southern California in October 2003;\n       (2) recognizes and honors all others, including emergency, \n     law enforcement, and medical personnel, pilots, and members \n     of the Armed Forces, for their important contributions to \n     controlling the wildfires and keeping Californians safe; and\n       (3) commends the firefighters and other personnel for \n     dedicated service to the people of California.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/11/senate-section/article/S14462-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14462]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA MILITARY RETIREMENT EQUITY ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Tomorrow morning, the Senate will begin consideration of \nthe VA-HUD appropriations bill. This will be the last of the \nappropriations bills brought individually to the floor. We expect to \nhave amendments offered in the morning and therefore rollcall votes are \nanticipated tomorrow morning. It is my hope that we can finish that \nbill during Wednesday's session.\n  As previously announced, the Senate will recess from 12:30 to 2:15 \nfor the Democratic Party luncheon. Following that recess, there will be \n20 minutes remaining for debate before the vote on adoption of the \nDepartment of Defense authorization conference report. Immediately \nfollowing that vote, the Senate will vote on the adoption of the \nMilitary Construction appropriations conference report.\n  Tomorrow evening it is my intent to focus the Senate's attention on \nseveral judicial nominations. This debate will go forward. I do \nencourage all Members to participate. This will be an opportunity for \nall Members to express themselves with respect to these highly \nqualified nominees. I hope that if Senators have reservations on any of \nthese judicial nominations they would be present for this important \ndebate.\n  I have stated repeatedly on the floor that we need to give these \nnominations a very straightforward up-or-down vote. I will have more to \nsay on the plans for tomorrow night tomorrow but I do want to announce \nthat this important debate will begin tomorrow evening.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/11/senate-section/article/S14462-4", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14462]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
