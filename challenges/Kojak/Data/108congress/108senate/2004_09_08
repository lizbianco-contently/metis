Mr. President, I want to very briefly comment on an \nobservation that when I got home last night a lot of the media networks \nwere talking about; that is, yesterday the U.S. military deaths in \nOperation Iraqi Freedom surpassed 1,000. Each one of these deaths is a \nsacrifice for the freedom and liberty we enjoy each and every day, and \nit really has focused on the importance of what the war on terror is \nall about, as we see what is depicted in Russia and as we see what has \nhappened in Afghanistan and Iraq and really throughout the world and \nthroughout the Middle East.\n  I wish to make the point again that we all think--we all know it, but \nreally it does need to be said; we think it every day, but it does need \nto be said--that these brave men and women in uniform sacrificed their \nlives for the cause of freedom--freedom in this country and throughout \nthe world--and for the security and safety of their fellow Americans. \nWe owe them a deep debt of gratitude for their courage and for their \nvalor and their strength and their commitment to our country and to \nthese ideals of which we every day take advantage.\n  As President Bush has reiterated time and time again, and as he \nmentioned in an early morning meeting we had--a bicameral, bipartisan \nmeeting that finished 15, 20 minutes ago--our cause is to fight the \nenemy on his soil before he can strike us here at home.\n  Because of our bold action, and, yes, the sacrifices this country has \nmade, terrorists will no longer find safe harbor in Iraq. Because of \nour determination, Saddam Hussein now sits in a prison where his only \nplotting and planning is to defend himself before a war crimes \ntribunal. Because of our resolve, Saddam's two sadistic sons, Uday and \nQusay, are dead, and many of his top lieutenants are dead or in \ncustody. Because of America and her many allies, no longer will the \ncivilized world be threatened by Saddam and his murderous ambitions.\n  From the very beginning, since President Bush launched Operation \nIraqi Freedom roughly a year and a half ago, our Armed Forces have \nperformed valiantly--from that first dramatic 3-week campaign that led \nto the fall of Baghdad, to the fighting that goes on right now in \nspecific regions where the insurgents are attempting to thwart Iraq's \npath to self-government.\n  The enemies of freedom will not prevail. The President, our Commander \nin Chief, has made it clear they will not prevail. This body has made \nit clear, our U.S. Government has made it clear, the enemy will not \nprevail. The enemies of freedom are going to fall. The people of Iraq \nwant democracy. Polls show over and over again that the majority of \nIraqis are optimistic about their future. Now they are finally free to \nrealize their dreams.\n  Our hearts do go out to the families who have lost loved ones in \nbattle, as well as to the thousands of men and women who have been \ninjured. The valor and courage of our young women and men in the armed \nservices are a shining example to all of the world, and we owe them and \ntheir families our deepest respect. They now belong to America's \npantheon of heroes who have given their lives for the cause of liberty.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and we will now have an hour of \nmorning business, with 30 minutes to each side.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/08/senate-section/article/S8926-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, some of us have come to the Chamber \ntoday: Senator Schumer, who handled the assault weapons legislation 10 \nyears ago in the House of Representatives as a member of the Judiciary \nCommittee; Senator Kennedy, who has been steadfast in support of this \nlegislation for literally decades; and myself, as the Senate author of \nthe bill. Ten years ago, the Senate, the House of Representatives, and \nthe President of the United States stood up for the safety of the \nAmerican people and against the National Rifle Association, and we \npassed one of the most important public safety measures this country \nhas seen, the Federal ban on assault weapons.\n  That legislation was designed to dry up the supply of assault weapons \nover time. That legislation was designed so that no legitimate gun \nowner would lose their gun, nor have any.\n  The assault weapons ban, although not perfect, represented the best \nwe could do to stem the growth and spread of these weapons throughout \nour cities and our States. That legislation is going to expire in 5 \ndays.\n  A couple of months ago the Senate took a vote. We know we have 52 \nvotes for its reauthorization for another 10-year period. Senator \nWarner of Virginia joined me in sponsoring that legislation on the \nfloor of the Senate. We also know that the legislation has been \neffective because gun traces to crimes committed with assault weapons \nhave declined by two-thirds in these past 10 years.\n  The American people have supported the ban and their support has \nnever waived. Today almost three-fourths of the American public \nsupports the ban, as do more than two-thirds of gun owners.\n  Law enforcement supported the ban in 1994, and their support has \nnever waived either. Every major law enforcement organization in the \ncountry supports renewing this ban, and countless individual chiefs \nof police, sheriffs, and line officers have put themselves on the line \nto express their support, too. In fact, many of these same officers are \nin town today to let Congress know how important the assault weapons \nban is to the safety of those who face these guns in the line of duty \nday in and day out.\n\n  This chart illustrates the percentage of banned assault weapons used \nin crimes, down by nearly two-thirds since passage of the 1994 act.\n  The NRA will say: The bill is cosmetic. It hasn't done anything. It \nhas been ineffective.\n  Then why do they make this legislation and its demise their No. 1 \npriority? This chart shows that they are wrong. In a moment, I will \ncite testimony from a former BATF analyst that says this legislation \nhas, in fact, been effective.\n  Presidents Clinton, Carter, Ford, and Reagan, and even Bush, have all \nexpressed support for renewing the ban. President Bush stated his firm \nsupport in his 2000 campaign. He has never publicly wavered from that \nstance. But 5 days from today, none of this support will matter. The \nassault weapons ban will be history, one more victim of the powerful, \nselfish NRA and its brutal lobbying tactics.\n  Because the President has steadfastly refused to put his money where \nhis mouth is and help us renew the ban, it is going to expire without \nso much as even a vote in the House of Representatives. We have asked \nthe President: Please use your leadership to convince the Speaker of \nthe House of Representatives to bring this bill to the floor. Please \nuse your leadership to twist some arms. If you support this, if you \nknow the American people support it, if you believe it makes for a \nsafer America, please help us.\n  We have cried out in vain. There has been no response from the White \nHouse. Instead, the President quietly awaits September 13 and hopes \nthat after he lets the ban expire, he can once again receive the \nendorsement of the NRA, because the NRA is not going to make their \nendorsement until the ban expires.\n  This is truly a dark day in the Senate's history, as we let this ban, \nwhich\n\n[[Page S8927]]\n\nhas worked so well and has saved lives, simply fade away.\n  I mentioned earlier that what the ban does is prohibit the \nmanufacture of large-capacity ammunition magazines, clips, drums, or \nstrips of more than ten rounds. It prohibits the manufacture and sale \nof 19 specific types of military-style assault weapons as well as a \nnumber of other guns based on a simple test to determine whether the \nguns were hunting guns or weapons of war.\n  Come next week, companies will once again begin to churn out large-\ncapacity ammunition devices, and powerful, easily concealed military \nweapons, all for civilian use. The NRA will try to hail this as a \nvictory for hunters, but the fact is, no hunter has lost their weapon, \nand no hunter has been limited by the assault weapons ban. The law \nspecifically, by name, exempts 670 hunting guns entirely.\n  It is also important to note that the ban grandfathered in every gun \nmade before 1994. No innocent gun owner lost their weapon. There was no \nconfiscation component to the bill. But by banning the future \nmanufacture of these guns, prohibiting the sale or transfer of any \nnewly manufactured gun, the bill's intent was to gradually dry up the \nsupply of these guns overtime.\n  I mentioned I would give you some Department of Justice data. I \nmentioned the proportion of assault weapons used in crime has fallen \nmore than 65 percent since the ban took effect. Let me give you an \nanalysis that was conducted by Gerald Nunziato, who for 8 years served \nas the special agent in charge of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and \nFirearms, the BATF's, national tracing center. This is not some fly-by-\nnight study. This is by the one person who knows what these numbers \nmean better than anyone. He found two things. First, as indicated by \nthis chart, he found that:\n\n       Assault weapons banned by name in the Federal Assault \n     Weapons Act have declined significantly as a percentage of \n     guns ATF has traced to crime, and in absolute number of \n     traces, since the Act was passed. Had this decline not \n     occurred, thousands more of those banned assault weapons \n     would likely have been traced to crime over the last 10 \n     years.\n\n  He also said:\n\n       The gun industry's efforts to evade the Federal Assault \n     Weapons Act through the sale of ``copycat'' guns has not \n     substantially undercut the positive effect of the statute in \n     reducing the incidence of assault weapons among gun crimes.\n\n  In other words, even though craven gun manufacturers tried to evade \nthe ban, those copycat guns did not replace banned guns in equal \nnumbers, at least when traced to crimes.\n  I want to spend a couple of minutes and explain to you about a \nshipment that was recently found by Italian customs. Some 8,000 AK-47 \nassault rifles were on their way from the Romanian port of Constanta to \nNew York City, according to press reports and BATF information, \napparently bound for a gun store in Georgia by the name of Century \nInternational Arms.\n  These guns had a value of more than $7 million--8,000 AK-47s.\n  It is believed by some that these guns were being shipped to the \nUnited States in anticipation of the expiration of the assault weapons \nlegislation. Though this shipment may very well have been illegal in \nany case under a 1989 Executive Order, think of one gun store buying \n8,000 AK-47s in anticipation of 5 days from today. Think of where guns \nlike these are going to go. Some are going to go to legitimate gun \nowners. Others are going to go to gang bangers. They are going to be \nsold out of the backseats of automobiles and on street corners to \ncriminals. They have become the weapon of choice for those who go up \nagainst the police. Mr. President, that is 8,000 AK-47s in one shipment \ncoming into the United States.\n  One advertisement now running in gun magazines is from a company \ncalled ArmaLite. They make postban rifles. As one can see from this \nadvertisement, ArmaLite is now offering a coupon for a free flash \nsuppressor for anyone who buys one of their guns. A flash suppressor is \nused to prevent the flash of the gun when it is fired. So if you are \nusing it, no one can see where you are, particularly at night, by the \nflash of the weapon.\n  Let me read what this says:\n\n       And by the way . . . ArmaLite's rifles are made to be \n     easily retrofitted with your flash suppressor and your other \n     pre-ban features so you don't have to wait if you're choosing \n     an ArmaLite.\n\n  They are giving a coupon for a free flash suppressor with every new \nweapon to keep in your pocket as a reminder to work with the NRA to get \nout the vote and to keep writing and calling your legislators. That is \nwhat we are up against: flash suppressors for votes in this country. It \nmakes me sick to my stomach.\n  The ad states:\n\n       It is not legal to install this on a post-ban rifle until \n     the assault weapons ban sunsets.\n\n  That will happen in 5 days.\n  A recent study by the Consumer Federation of America discovered that \nmanufacturers are also gearing up to manufacture large-capacity \nammunition clips.\n  This is the danger. Just yesterday in Geneva, OH, somebody stood in \nthe main thoroughfare and fired more than 50 rounds from a big clip. No \none could get to him to disarm him. Three people were wounded. He just \nstood there and fired the weapon indiscriminately.\n  One manufacturer told a caller from the Consumer Federation of \nAmerica that there is a pent-up demand for 50-round clips and larger. \nWho needs a 50-round clip? Hunting laws in every State restrict the \nnumber of bullets in a clip to under 10. Who needs a 50-round clip?\n  It is clear that time has run out. It is clear the President of the \nUnited States will not help, and this is truly a sad day for this \nNation.\n  My hope is if the ban expires and these guns and high-capacity clips \nonce again start to flood our streets, some common sense will return to \nWashington and we can then put the ban in place. But I want this Senate \nto know, Mr. President, that I do not intend to give up. Next year, I \nwill put a better law on virtually any bill I can find to do so, and we \nwill come back and back and back, and we will have armor because no \ndoubt tragedy will ensue.\n  The assault weapons legislation has worked. No legal owner has been \ndenied a weapon. No weapon has been confiscated. Yet the supply of \nthese weapons on the streets have declined. A dominant majority, \nupwards of 70 percent of the American people, support its \nreauthorization. We have bipartisan support in the Senate for its \nreauthorization. President Bush, please, if you care, if you are \nlistening, do something. The House can pass this. We have had the \ndebate in the Senate. It will only take a few minutes for the Senate to \ncast the same vote again, and then you can sign a piece of legislation \nthat we know makes this Nation safer.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains of my time?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Four minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair. I withhold the remainder of my \ntime and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I again congratulate my friends and \ncolleagues, Senator Feinstein and Senator Schumer, for the strong \nleadership they have shown on this issue and their continued \nperseverance and persistence in urging the House and Senate and the \nPresident to act. Unless the President and Congress act, the current \nFederal ban on assault weapons will expire in 5 days.\n  Semiautomatic weapons are killing machines with utterly no redeeming \nvalue in any sane community, and lifting this ban will put these \nweapons of death back in the hands of criminals and will give \nterrorists a new tool to attack America.\n  We know terrorists are now exploiting the weaknesses and loopholes in \nour gun laws. A terrorist training manual discovered by American \nsoldiers in Afghanistan in 2001 advised al-Qaida members to buy assault \nweapons in the United States and use them against us.\n  The failure to renew the ban this year will drastically undermine the \nsafety of our streets, our neighborhoods, and our schools, and \nstrengthen terrorists and other criminals. It would be a tragic and \nsenseless blow to the security of our homeland.\n  Terrorists already here in sleeper cells or coming in from abroad \nwill be able to buy assault weapons without background checks at gun \nshows and wreak terror throughout the Nation.\n  How can we possibly allow this essential protection against crime and \nterrorism to expire? How can we deliberately put the security of our \ncommunities in such new and needless jeopardy?\n\n[[Page S8928]]\n\n  The need for Presidential leadership has never been greater. We know \nwe have the votes for renewing the assault weapons ban in the Senate \nbecause we passed such an amendment in March by a bipartisan vote of 52 \nto 47. The Republican leadership in the Senate, however, refuses to \nbring the ban back for another vote, and the House Republican \nleadership refuses to act at all.\n  In the 2000 campaign, President Bush specifically pledged to renew \nthe ban, but now as the ban is about to expire, the silence from the \nWhite House is deafening. It is long past time for President Bush to \nlive up to his commitment.\n  President Bush has shown that when he wants something from this \nRepublican Congress, he gets it. When he wanted tax breaks for the \nwealthy, he got it. When he wanted another round of tax breaks, he got \nthem, too. We need that same commitment from President Bush when it \ncomes to protecting our families and securing our communities from \ndeadly assault weapons.\n  President Bush, the time to act is now. Congress awaits your call.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/08/senate-section/article/S8928-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8928]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, 16 months after President Bush declared \n``mission accomplished'' aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln, the fighting \nin Iraq continues and casualties continue to mount.\n  Yesterday we reached a mournful milestone that we never thought \npossible: 1,000 brave Americans have lost their lives in Iraq. Nearly \n7,000 more have been injured. The youngest of America's fallen soldiers \nwas just 18 years old. The oldest was 59. More than half had not even \ncelebrated their 30th birthday. They hailed from nearly every State in \nthe Nation. They are the best of America, and we are proud of each one. \nAlthough I disagree with the President about Iraq, I honor the service \nand sacrifice and dedication of each of these brave men and women.\n  It was wrong for the President to rush to war for such a deeply \nquestionable cause. We all know Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator, \nbut he did not pose the kind of immediate threat to our national \nsecurity to justify a unilateral and preventive war.\n  Despite the President's claim that Iraq is central to the global war \non terror, there was no persuasive pattern of ties or operational links \nbetween Iraq and al-Qaida. There were no nuclear weapons.\n  President Bush has stated that the war in Iraq was a catastrophic \nsuccess. He is right in one sense. The war has been a catastrophe. The \nwar has been a catastrophe for our fallen soldiers, far too many of \nwhom were sent to war with no plan to win the peace. The war has been a \ncatastrophe for their loved ones. The war has been a catastrophe for \nour Nation's standing in the world and for the war on terror, for it \ndistracted us from the real threat of al-Qaida in Afghanistan. It has \nmade the war on terrorism far harder to win and it has made America \nmore hated in the world than at any other time in our history.\n  We need honest solutions that will end the terror of Osama bin Laden \nand destroy al-Qaida. We need honest solutions that will bring the war \nin Iraq to a noble end and bring our troops home with honor. This \nadministration has had its chance and it failed the basic test of \ncompetence. It failed to deploy enough troops in Iraq to win the peace. \nIt failed at Abu Ghraib. It failed in issuing sweetheart deals to \nHalliburton. It has failed the basic test of Presidential leadership.\n  We need a new administration that will be honest with the American \npeople on national security and propose real solutions to make us safer \nand stronger.\n  How much time remains for the Democrats?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 8\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Whatever time remains I yield to the Senator from New \nYork, Mr. Schumer.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Before the Senator from New York begins, I do wish to \nuse my remaining 4 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 8 minutes 7 seconds \nremaining.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/08/senate-section/article/S8928-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8928-S8929]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I believe I have 4 minutes, which I very \nmuch appreciate and I want to thank my colleague from California for \nyielding the time and for her tremendous and unstinting leadership on \nthis very important issue.\n  If nothing happens, AK-47s, Uzis, and TEC-9s are going to be back on \nthe streets next week. That is a giant step backward. It is hard to \nbelieve that with all the progress we have made in the fight on crime, \nwith the reduction in crime, with the reduction in the number in law \nenforcement who are hurt and killed in the line of duty, with the new \nwar on terrorism upon us, that we are going to make it easy for anybody \nto get an AK-47, provided they have not been convicted of a felony. \nSomeone on a terrorist watch list will be able to walk into a store and \nget an AK-47.\n  What is going on in America? This should not be a contest. This bill \nshould have been renewed without a debate. Everyone who studied it has \nagreed it has been broadly successful. This President and the previous \nfour, from Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford to Bill Clinton and Jimmy \nCarter, are on record as being for this, and because of a small band of \npeople who are ideologues, who are extreme, we are not going to see \nthis happen.\n  This represents the dysfunction of American politics. When a country \ncannot deal with an issue in a straightforward, forthright way, when a \ncountry that has had success takes a step back because a narrow few \nhave some ideological notion that everyone should be entitled to have \nany weapon they want--some of them even believe a bazooka or a tank is \nokay--then something is wrong.\n  We need some leadership. We need the President of the United States \nto ask the House of Representatives to vote on the bill. We have not \nheard a peep out of him. We need some leadership from the leadership of \nthe House to allow the bill to be on the floor. The crime bill of 1994, \nfor all the ``sturm und drang,'' was one of the great governmental \nsuccesses of the last decade.\n  As we wrote it, our motto in that bill was tough on punishment and \nsmart on prevention. We brought a grand coalition from the most liberal \nto the most conservative to deal with the scourge of crime. The only \nreason there is not much of a fuss on this issue, regrettably, is \nbecause we have succeeded, because crime rates are lower and the large \nimpetus to do more has declined because of our success.\n  When one has success, the answer is not to undo that success. It is \nto continue what has been done, and we are not. It is a sign, in my \njudgment, of the weakness of our politics, and even of this Republic, \nthat the Senator from California and I are on the floor today as the \ngates are closing, pleading with our President and our colleagues to \nallow a vote to occur. This is not the America of which we should be \nproud.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nNew York. I remember my call to him 10 years ago over in the House \nsaying, ``Chuck, would you consider handling this in the House,'' and \nhe did. It was not easy. After the 1994 vote, the House repealed the \nassault weapons legislation, under pressure from the NRA. He stood \nfast--we stood fast--and the law continued. I am very grateful to the \nSenator and I want him to know that.\n  Going on at this very time is a press conference of law enforcement \nfrom all over the United States. One of the people who journeyed here \nfor this press conference is a man by the name of Lee Guelff. His \nbrother James Guelff was a police officer working out of Northern \nStation in San Francisco when a call came in that there was a sniper at \nPine and California Streets. Officer Guelff responded to the call. What \nhe found was a sniper, clad from head to toe in Kevlar, with military-\nstyle semiautomatic assault weapons, as well as over 1,000 rounds of \nammunition. He had his service revolver, and the shots were flying.\n  As he went to speed-load his weapon, he was hit in the head by a \nbullet of the hundreds of rounds this man fired. It took 150 police \nofficers to bring down this man clad in Kevlar at the corner of Pine \nand California Streets.\n\n[[Page S8929]]\n\n  These weapons are not for civilian use. These weapons all were \ndesigned for military use to kill large numbers of people in close \ncombat. Whether it is Geneva, OH, or Pine and California Streets in San \nFrancisco, these weapons do not belong in civilian hands.\n  I will show a few pictures of police officers who have been in \nsimilar status. Marion County, IN, Deputy Sheriff Jason Baker was shot \nwith an AK-47 during a traffic pursuit. He was following directly \nbehind the fleeing vehicle when the suspects shot him in the head with \none of the rounds from the AK-47. He died that day from gunshot wounds.\n  Lance Corporal Dana Lyle Tate and Corporal Dyke Coursen, Beaufort \nCounty deputy sheriffs, were shot and killed with an assault rifle \nafter responding to a domestic disturbance call. Everyone who knows law \nenforcement knows domestic disturbances are fraught with jeopardy. When \nsomeone has an assault weapon against a police officer entering that \nhouse, the police officers do not have a chance.\n  San Francisco police officer Isaac Espinoza, 29, was gunned down \nApril 10 of this year with an AK-47. His partner was wounded as well. \nThere were a number of bullets fired. He was shot in the back.\n  Los Angeles County Police Captain Michael Sparkes, just on August 10 \nof this year, was shot and killed while off duty in Rosewood, CA. He \nwas taking an early morning bicycle ride when he was confronted by two \nalleged gang members. The two men were attempting to rob Sparkes when \nan exchange of gunfire occurred. Captain Sparkes was shot multiple \ntimes with an AK-47 assault rifle containing a 40-round magazine of \nammunition.\n  Downstairs there are representatives from the Fraternal Order of \nPolice, the International Association of Chiefs of Police, Major City \nChiefs, the National Association of Police Organizations, the National \nAssociation of Black Police Officers.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank you. One last statement. Virtually all of law \nenforcement has implored us, has requested that we reauthorize this \nlegislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/08/senate-section/article/S8929-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8929-S8930]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE SEPTEMBER UPDATE\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, yesterday the CBO, the Congressional \nBudget Office, issued their September update. It just came out. I heard \nmy colleague and counterpart on the Budget Committee allude to it on \nthe floor of the Senate yesterday, and he did that with great talent \nbut maybe with a little different analysis than what I might give. So I \nthought I might give a little different presentation.\n  I think there is a lot of good news in this report. It also shows we \nhave some big challenges before us. CBO estimates for this year we are \ngoing to have a deficit of $422 billion. That is a record in nominal \nterms. But it is an improvement. CBO was just predicting 6 months ago \nit was going to be $470-something, so it is down $56 billion. The \ndeficits are moving down. That is good news. OMB projected earlier this \nyear the deficit was going to be $521 billion. Now they are down around \nthe $441 billion, so they project significant improvement. As a matter \nof fact, the number CBO just came up with is about $100 billion less \nthan what OMB, the Office of Management and Budget, had predicted at \nthe beginning of this year. So deficits are coming down. They are \ncoming down dramatically.\n  I think the good news is the budget we passed last year and the tax \npackage we passed, the economic growth package we passed last year, is \nworking. We should be proud of it. I have been in the Senate now for 24 \nyears. We pass a lot of different bills sometimes to stimulate growth \nor try to help the economy or try to do something that will have \nsignificant economic results. The bill we passed last year, the 2003 \ntax bill that President Bush signed in January, the tax bill that cut \nthe tax rate on capital gains and dividends to 15 percent, the tax bill \nthat accelerated the 2001 tax cuts and actually made them effective--\nthat bill worked. Most of those cuts had not actually gone into effect. \nSome did for lower rates, but upper incomes had not received a rate \nreduction. Middle-income people had not received but a 1-point \nreduction. We accelerated the 28 percent to a 25-percent rate, the \nmaximum rate to 35 percent, cut cap gains to 15 percent, and cut the \nrate on dividends to 15 percent. And guess what. It has worked. It has \nworked.\n  Since the President signed that bill, we have 1.75 million new jobs. \nThat is 1,750,000 new jobs created. We have had 12 months in a row \nwhere we have had new jobs created every month. We really did reverse a \ndownward trend, a decline.\n  We had a real chilling event on 9/11: our economy was hit. The \nfinancial structure of the United States was hit. We had a stock market \nthat burst, frankly, in March of the year 2000. The NASDAQ declined by \nabout 50 percent in the year 2000. Revenues to the Federal Government \nhad been declining dramatically. You add 9/11, to that you add the war \non terrorism.\n  Deficits are high. This Senator has spent the majority of my career \ntrying to rein in Federal spending and hold down deficits. These \ndeficits are very high. The good news is the deficit is coming down. \nBefore one can criticize, they have to understand what caused the \ndeficits. The deficits were caused by the market crash. When \nAlan Greenspan mentioned this a few years ago, he called it irrational \nexuberance in the stock market. That crashed. As a result, a lot of \nmoney, actually trillions of dollars of market value, was lost in the \nstock markets. That reduction applied to money coming into the Federal \nGovernment.\n\n  The money we received in the Federal Government, total receipts, was \nover $2 trillion in the year 2000. Last year it was about $1.78 \ntrillion. That was not because of the tax cuts we passed. It was \nbecause of the very soft economy, and it was because of 9/11. A lot \nconcurred at that time. President Bush realized that, this Congress \nrealized that, and I compliment my colleagues, especially Zell Miller \nfor that because he helped me cosponsor that bill we passed last year \nthat helped make this economic recovery happen.\n  The other good news in this report is CBO projected real economic \ngrowth this year of 4.8 percent. That is great. They project 4.2 \npercent for next year. That is super. That is real economic growth over \nand above inflation.\n  So the budget has worked. The tax bill we passed last year worked. \nNew jobs are being created, almost 2 million jobs in the last 12 months \nalone. So we have a lot of good news. The good news is the budget we \npassed last year has worked. We defeated over $800 billion worth of \nadditional spending, most of which was offered by my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle. We defeated that. The budget worked. The good \nnews is when we passed the Department of Defense appropriations bill \nbefore we adjourned for the August recess, we put in a budget provision \nthat caps domestic discretionary spending. That was part of the DOD \nappropriations bill. So we passed that part of our budget this year. \nThat is now the law of the land. Now we can pass our appropriations \nbills. We are going to take up the Homeland Security bill later this \nafternoon, and hopefully we will be able to pass it. We have budget \nrules that will work to enforce limitations on that bill and all other \nappropriations bills. So maybe now we can go ahead and complete our \nappropriations process.\n  I mention these things to point out that there is some good news in \nthis report. The report is also distorted because it says you have to \nuse present base lines. Present base lines assume that all spending \nwill continue to grow basically with inflation. This year alone, in the \nyear 2004, we are spending about $115 billion in Iraq and Afghanistan \nin the war on terror. We did that through supplementals. We will not \ncontinue doing that year after year, not at those levels. In that \nperiod of time we have been fighting a war. We have hundreds of \nthousands of troops who are engaged in that effort.\n  I was in Iraq a couple of months ago. We are training 210,000 Iraqis \nto take our place. I was in Afghanistan. We are training thousands and \nthousands of Afghanis, and we have 20-some thousand troops in \nAfghanistan. They will be taking our place so we will not have\n\n[[Page S8930]]\n\nto continue. We will not have supplementals near in this range. We had \na $87 billion supplemental last year, and $28 billion included in the \nDOD appropriations bill. We will not have that large an amount of \nadditional money to be used primarily to fight wars against terrorism \nin Iraq and Afghanistan. I am sure we will be spending some money. I am \nsure there will be some, but it will not be anywhere near that over a \n10-year timeframe. CBO assumes we will spend $114 billion inflated for \nthe next 10 years. That is over $1.3 trillion. Then, if you add \ninflation to that, in addition to that, and interest expense that they \nalso assume, that assumes about half of their negative projections.\n  I might mention, too, my colleague said we have to fix the AMT, and \nif you add that in and extend every tax cut out there, the deficits \nwill be terrible. I have a couple of comments.\n  No. 1, the President made a speech at the Republican Convention and \nsaid we need to reform the Tax Code. I will not be here, but I hope the \nnext Congress will take the President up on that.\n  The Tax Code needs to be reformed. AMT is living proof that the Tax \nCode needs to be reformed. I look at the Tax Code as about a foot tall. \nI always compare it to the Bible. The Bible is about an inch. Unlike \nthe Bible, the Tax Code contains no good news. I look at the Tax Code \nand it is complicated. It needs to be reformed. The President \nchallenged Congress to do it. The next Congress should take the \nPresident up on that. You can fix AMT. There are an awful lot of \nanomalies and so many inconsistencies in the Tax Code. You can't fix it \na paragraph at a time. You need to rewrite the entire thing. I think \nthat can be done.\n  You don't have to get in this debate--well, if we continue this or \nthat.\n  We have to extend the family tax provisions that expire at the end of \nthis year. There are three of them. There is a $1,000 tax credit per \nchild. That would revert to $700 per child if it is not extended. We \nneed to extend the marriage penalty relief to allow married couples who \nhave taxable incomes up to $58,000 so they will pay a 15-percent rate \non taxable income up to $58,000. If you do not do it, it will revert \nback to some $40,000. That is about a $900 tax increase on married \ncouples. Also, the expansion of the 10-percent bracket.\n  Those need to be done this year. They need to be done this month. \nHopefully this Congress will get that done. I expect we will. I am a \nconferee of that particular bill which is in conference. I am \noptimistic we will get that extended.\n  We need to reform the Tax Code. Some people say we need a higher \npersonal rate; we want to sock it to the wealthier people who are \npaying a 35-percent rate. That is the same rate General Motors pays. I \ndon't think wealthy people should have to pay more than the largest \ncorporations in the world.\n  I am in favor of reforming the Tax Code. I think the President is \nright on in that effort. Instead of trying to paint the most negative \npicture possible with a doomsday scenario of the deficit getting bad, \nassuming we are going to a war in Iraq every year, which is not going \nto happen, and assuming a lot of negatives that, frankly, I do not \nagree with, I think future Congresses can reform the Tax Code and do it \nwithout ``having higher tax rates'' on individuals than you have on \nGeneral Motors and other corporations.\n  The good news is CBO says deficits are falling. That is good. The tax \ncuts we passed last year, frankly, are raising more revenues than \npeople anticipated. That is good. CBO overestimated revenue. They kept \ntelling us we think it is going to be better. Revenue crashed when the \nstock market crashed. It took a lot of economic viability out of the \neconomy. When we introduced the tax bill last year, the Dow Jones was \nat 7,700. Because of the tax cut we passed last year, today the Dow \nJones is 10,300. The Nasdaq is up over 40 or 50 percent more than it \nwas when we introduced the bill a little over a year ago--almost 2 \nyears ago in January. We passed the bill in June of last year. We have \nseen very positive results in the stock market. We have seen very \npositive results in the economy with 4.8 percent growth. Now we have \nseen very positive results in employment with almost 2 million new jobs \ncreated, including in the manufacturing sector which has been on a 1-\nyear decline. We now see an uplift in the manufacturing sector as well. \nThe good news is the economy is growing. The bill we passed last year \nhas had a positive impact.\n\n  With the cooperation of Senator Stevens, we were able to put in a cap \non discretionary spending in the DOD appropriations bill. Now Congress \ncan move forward. That is half of our budget.\n  If somebody wants to know, the budget basically deals with how much \nmoney you are going to spend and how much money you are going to tax. \nThis takes care of the spending side of it and puts the cap on \nspending, replacing the cap we passed in the previous budget. It \nsupersedes that. Now we have a new cap on domestic discretionary \nspending of $821 billion. That is what we passed on the floor of the \nSenate. That is what we agreed to and that is what is now the law of \nthe land. I think that is good news as well. That will constrain \nspending. We will probably find out later this afternoon.\n  I think we have some good news on the economy. We have good news \nbecause the future deficits are falling. The economy is growing, and we \nhave a little work to do to finish the appropriations bills and to \nfinish action on a couple of tax bills this year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I certainly appreciate the comments of my \nfriend from Oklahoma. There are some positive things that have resulted \nafter a number of very difficult years. I certainly appreciate the \nleadership which he has given on the budget.\n  I wanted to talk a moment about Senate business. Of course, I suppose \nwe all have ideas about what we could do. We will be here for another \nmonth. Obviously, we can't do everything that is out there before us. \nClearly, there were a lot of items we couldn't complete partly as a \nresult of the fact that, frankly, we have not done as much over the \nlast year as we should have and could have done. Some of that, of \ncourse, has been because of the Presidential election which is still \nlooming before us. That has caused arguments on a lot of things which \nare more political than need to be. It is not unusual for the Congress \nto be political, of course. But I think to the extent it has been, it \nis more than usual. I hope we can move forward.\n  I was encouraged about what our leadership said yesterday as we try \nto move forward and try to actually cooperate on some things. \nUnfortunately, before the day is over I think we are back into the same \nold routine of trying to put the blame on everyone, and so on. The fact \nis we have work to do. We have an opportunity to do it. As I said, we \nwill not all agree on what they ought to be, but it seems to me the \nreal challenge before us is to set some priorities. We have a certain \namount of time. We can do a certain number of things. Admittedly, we \nwill have different ideas about what those priorities ought to be. I \nwanted to share that.\n\n  It seems to me it is important to do the things in a timely manner \nwhich have an impact on the economy--things Senator Nickles also talked \nabout. One is appropriations. Appropriations were intended to be done \nin July and August at the end of the fiscal year--at the end of \nSeptember. We are a little late on those. The Appropriations Committee \nhas been dealing with them for a long time. It seems to me that we \nought to be prepared to move forward within the budget. It is one of \nthe most important things.\n  I happen to believe energy is one of the most important things we \nhave to deal with, to have an energy policy which gives us some idea as \nto the direction we are going to take when we deal with the obvious \ndifficulties of energy. The cost of energy, the import percentages we \nhave to expect from overseas, with all of the unrest in the Middle East \nwhere some of it comes from--those are the kinds of things we need to \ndeal with. We have talked about it now for about 3 years. We have a \npolicy. A policy has been on the floor. Unfortunately, as it moved to \nthe floor the last time it was filibustered and we lacked the votes to \nget it passed. We need to pass it. In my view, that would have a great \nimpact on the highway bill.\n\n[[Page S8931]]\n\n  Again, we have had a highway bill for some time. We had a 6-year \nbill. It expired a year ago. Now we are proceeding monthly. We need to \nget a longer term highway bill in place.\n  As I traveled around my State of Wyoming last month, I probably heard \nas much about that as anything, how important the transportation system \nis to all of us. Coupled with that, of course, is the number of jobs \ndeveloped by having the opportunity to move forward.\n  I commend the chairman and his staff for working during the recess. \nWe had differences on what the spending level ought to be, which should \nnot have been that difficult because this spending is the result of \ntransportation. That is what those taxes are for; to expend those on \nhighway and related transportation is what it is all for. I understand \nwe are reaching some agreements on what that ought to be. We have had \ndifferences with the Senate and the House and the White House. But we \nneed to move forward.\n  Certainly, our State of Wyoming is particularly dependent on \ntransportation because the miles per capita are very large. We have \nlots of miles--not only used in Wyoming but used by others with a \nrelatively small population. It is very important to us. The economic \nimpact, of course, is very important. For every $1 billion spent, \n47,000 jobs are created--and created quickly.\n  One of the problems, of course, is much of the highway construction \nis done by contracting. If the highway departments within the States do \nnot know what their funds are going to be, it is impossible for them to \ngo ahead and do contracting in the future. It is also very seasonable. \nMost of the work in the West and the mountain States has to be done in \nthe good weather periods. We need to do something with that.\n  The Energy bill, as I mentioned, is a total bill. It is not just one \nor two little things. It has to do with research and the alternative \nresources of energy in the future. Whether it is wind or conversion of \ncoal to diesel or to hydrogen, it deals with alternative energy as well \nas renewable. It deals with efficiency and conservation and the use of \nenergy. We can make great strides in that area. It also has to do with \nthe encouragement--giving incentives to domestic production, which, of \ncourse, is very important.\n  We need to make some changes. We need to utilize coal more, for \nexample, because it is our largest resource of fossil fuel. It can be \nconverted into other fuels--diesel, hydrogen, or whatever. We need to \nuse coal to generate electricity rather than gas because gas is so \nflexible and it can be used for other things. Coal can be used \neconomically in a clean way as well.\n  There is nothing more important than to have an idea. This was one of \nthe first things that was done at the White House, and we have done it \nhere. I have been on that committee. Yet we have not been able to get \nit done. Now it is at the desk. All we need to do is bring it up and \nmove forward.\n  There are a lot of other things that are very important. We will have \nto decide whether we want to get things done or whether we want to \ncontinue to argue. There is nothing wrong with having different ideas, \nvoting on them, and reaching a conclusion. We have great challenges \nahead and only a short time in which to complete them. I certainly urge \nMembers to put their energies into those priorities and complete them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI. How much time remains for our side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 8 minutes 45 seconds.\n\n\n                                  jobs\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, the economy is getting stronger. The economy \nhas shown 12 straight months of job gains. Last month, payroll \nemployment increased by 144,000 jobs. Nearly 1.7 million new jobs have \nbeen created over the past year. The unemployment fell to 5.4 percent--\nthe lowest rate since October, 2001. We have laid the groundwork for \nthe economic recovery we are experiencing today. We have ensured the \npresence of more capital in our economy which has led to the creation \nof more jobs for our workers.\n  President Bush's economic policies continue to create new jobs and \nmove the economy forward. This all adds up to good news for the \nAmerican people. We have weathered the storm and are poised to enter a \nnew period of prosperity.\n  However, I have to caution you about some roadblocks that stand in \nthe way of prosperity for our workers and businesses alike. The first \nroadblock is a gap between the skills our workforce has and the skills \nour employers need. The second roadblock is the Democrats' obstruction \nof legislation that will help close this skills gap. First, I will talk \nabout the skills gap so you can understand just how damaging the \nDemocrats' obstruction is to our workers and our economy.\n  It may surprise you to learn that many good jobs in this country \nremain unfilled because employers can't find workers with the skills \nthey need. According to a 2003 survey by the Center for Workforce \nPreparation, an affiliate of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, half of the \nemployers reported difficulty in finding qualified workers. The problem \nis greatest for small employers. Small business--our greatest source of \neconomic growth--can't create jobs if they don't have the skilled \nworkers to fill the jobs.\n  The gap between the demand for high-skilled workers and the supply \nwill only widen in the future. Looking ahead 2 years, only 30 percent \nof the employers surveyed by the Center for Workforce Preparation \nbelieve the skills of their workers will keep pace. This skills gap \nblocks the pathway to better jobs and better lives for American workers \nand their families.\n  This skills gap also threatens the ability of American businesses to \ncompete in a more complex, global economy. When Federal Reserve \nChairman Alan Greenspan testified before the Senate Banking Committee, \nhe said that ``what will ultimately determine the standard of living in \nthis country is the skill of the people.'' Why is effective workforce \ntraining so important? Because in an increasingly knowledge-based \neconomy, people--their talent and their ideas--make the difference. \nHuman capital is a company's most important resource. The skills and \ningenuity of the American workforce will drive our economy in the 21st \ncentury and beyond. If we want to keep high-paying jobs in America, our \nchallenge is to equip our workers with skills the global economy \ndemands. We used to manufacture buggy whips. We do not make them \nanymore. People had to have new skills.\n  Unfortunately, the current workforce development system is not \neffectively equipping workers with the relevant skills. Without any \naction, technology and other advances will outpace the ability of \nAmerican workers and business to update skills needed to compete. We \nmust improve the Nation's job-training system created under the \nWorkforce Investment Act to better prepare American workers for the \ngood jobs of today and tomorrow. Only a systematic reform of our \nNation's job-training system will enable American workers and \nbusinesses to compete--and succeed--in the global economy.\n  There is good news. We have a bill that does this. It is a bipartisan \nbill that reauthorizes and improves the Nation's job-training system. \nIt will help retrain workers to fill the jobs needed in this country \nnow and in the future. It will link workforce development with economic \ndevelopment, recognizing that job training and job creation go hand in \nhand. It will partner the public workforce system with private sector \nemployers--including small businesses--and with training providers to \nbetter prepare workers for high-wage, high-growth jobs. And this \nlegislation will improve access to job training and employment services \nin all parts of the country. It will help an estimated 900,000 \nunemployed workers a year get back to work.\n  The good news is we have bipartisan legislation that does all of \nthis--legislation that passed out of the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee unanimously, legislation that passed on the Senate \nFloor unanimously. Where is the bill now? Here is the bad news. Here is \nthe roadblock. The Democrats won't let us send this important job-\ntraining bill to conference. They are stopping progress by refusing to \nappoint a conference committee, which is a committee made up of \nRepublicans and Democrats who would meet with the House to work out the \ndifferences between the House and Senate versions of the bill, and it \nwould not be the last action on the bill.\n\n[[Page S8932]]\n\nIf people do not like what happened in conference, it can be \nfilibustered.\n  An important jobs bill--a bill that will help American workers and \nbusinesses--is being held hostage to election year politics. If we \nreally care about keeping good jobs in this country, we need to send \nthe job training legislation to conference--and then to the President \nto become law.\n  I owe my constituents more than this. I think we all do. We owe the \nAmerican people an open legislative process, a process they expect and \ndeserve from us. This is not just an academic question of Senate rules \nand procedures. A bill that would help put Americans back to work or \nfind better jobs now lies in legislative limbo.\n  I was reminded just how important job training is to the lives of our \nworkers and the strength of our businesses and communities during a \nconference held in Wyoming this summer. In June, I attended the Wyoming \nSummit on Workforce Development. This was a conference designed to \nteach people how to bring business and jobs to Wyoming. In Wyoming, a \nlot of our people are leaving the State to find better jobs elsewhere. \nWe know that we have to create the kind of good jobs with good futures \nthat will keep our people in Wyoming. To do that, Wyoming needs workers \nwith skills the new, global economy calls for.\n  One of the speakers at the summit was a consultant, Robert Ady, who \nadvises companies where they should relocate or open new operations. \nAccording to Mr. Ady, a key location factor for a light manufacturing \nbusiness is the presence of a qualified workforce. Whether a company \ndecides to open a plant in Cheyenne or China depends upon a qualified \nlocal workforce. A skilled workforce can make the difference between \nsuccess and failure in the new, global economy. It makes the difference \nfor our workers, for our companies, for Wyoming and for the United \nStates as a whole.\n  Almost 200 business participants from around the State attended the \nWyoming Summit on Workforce Development. For Wyoming, having 200 \nbusiness people in one place at one time is a real accomplishment. It \nshowed the need and commitment our businesses have to workforce \ndevelopment. These 200 business participants--most from small \ncompanies--represented at least 200 opportunities for Wyoming workers \nand communities. They are looking to us to put the tools in place to \nkeep the American dream alive in communities across Wyoming and the \nrest of the country.\n  There is an American dream. It is to have a family, have a nice home, \nand have a good job to support that home and family. Prior to my coming \nto the Senate, my wife and I owned a small chain of shoe stores. As a \nsmall business owner, I saw firsthand the impact that job training can \nhave on achieving the dream. We had an employee--a Vietnam veteran--who \nwent through a workforce training course and ended up managing and then \nbuying two stores from us. He's an example of what you can do with \neffective job training if you teach workers to dream at the same time.\n  We have to give workers--and businesses--the tools to turn the dream \ninto reality. Job training under the Workforce Investment Act can turn \nthe dream into reality for millions of American workers. By blocking \nlegislation that improves job training, my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle are blocking the pathway to new and better jobs for \nAmerican workers. They are blocking the pathway to prosperity for \nAmerican families and American businesses.\n  The job-training bill, known as the Workforce Investment Act, is a \ncentral part of a combination of federal education and training \nprograms that provide lifelong learning for the workforce of today and \ntomorrow. The job-training bill, together with the Carl D. Perkins \nVocational and Technical Education Improvement Act when I recently \nintroduced, and the Higher Education Act offer the resources that are \nneeded to help prepare students of all ages for jobs in high-wage and \nhigh-skill occupations. In this technology driven global economy, \neveryone is a student who must adapt to changing workforce needs by \ncontinuing to pursue their education. In turn, Congress must ensure \nthat education and job training are connected to the needs of business, \nincluding small businesses, now and into the future.\n  I conclude by urging my colleagues on the other side of the aisle--in \nfact, I urge the Democratic leader to lead--to allow the appointment of \nconferees to the job training legislation known as the Workforce \nInvestment Act. The cost of this obstruction is the loss of important \nlegislative efforts that will be felt by American people as it harms \nthe integrity of the legislative process itself.\n  I hope our bipartisan efforts on the bill can continue. I hope \nregular order is restored to the appointment of conferees so we can \ncraft the final version of this legislation and get 900,000 people back \nto work. If we really want to keep good jobs in this country, the \nDemocrats would agree to send this important bill to conference. Our \nworkers and our businesses deserve this bill. They deserve more than \nthis election year political obstruction. They deserve the tools needed \nto keep American workers and businesses the best in the world.\n  Mr. President, how much time is left before the next action?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to discuss the issue of the \nreimportation of prescription drugs. I do that because we have a very \nshort time remaining in this Congress. We actually began last evening \nwith a couple of votes. I read this morning that the majority leader \nwould like to finish by October 8. There are very few days in which to \nadvance some of these issues. The issue of reimportation of \nprescription drugs is a very important issue.\n  We pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. Many \nof my constituents who live in North Dakota go across the line and \npurchase identical prescription drugs, FDA-approved prescription drugs \nfrom Canada, the same pill put in the same bottle made by the same \ncompany sold in Canada and the U.S. The difference is price. One \nexample is Lipitor, a very popular cholesterol-lowering drug. If you \nbuy Lipitor in Canada, it is $1.01 per tablet. If you buy it 5 miles \nsouth of the Canadian border, it is $1.82 per tablet, nearly double the \nprice for the American consumer. That is the case with drug after drug, \nwhen you compare.\n  A group of us--Senator McCain, myself, and many others--has been \nworking on reimportation legislation that would allow more than just \npersonal use reimportation to come across from Canada, and I have \ntalked to Senator Frist at great length about this issue.\n  On March 11 of this year, about midnight, when we were in session \nthat evening dealing with the budget, Senator Frist and I reached \nagreement. He put in the Record that he would announce that in \nconsultation with the chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions, along with Senator Dorgan, Senator \nStabenow, Senator McCain, Senator Cochran, and others, that the Senate \nwould begin a process for developing proposals that would allow for the \nsafe reimportation of FDA-approved prescription drugs. Now we face the \ntime period when, nearing the end of the session, we have not yet had \nthat vote. There is a bill at the desk that was passed by the House of \nRepresentatives. That is one possibility. The other would be bipartisan \nlegislation Senators McCain, Stabenow, others, and I\n\n[[Page S8933]]\n\nhave introduced. Still other opportunities might be an amendment to \nanother bill.\n\n  The reason I take the floor at this moment is in this morning's \nCongressional Quarterly, it says:\n\n       It appears increasingly unlikely that the Senate will vote \n     this year on legislation that would allow Americans to import \n     prescription drugs from abroad, despite wide public support \n     for the idea.\n       An aide to [Senate] Majority Leader Bill Frist . . . said \n     Tuesday that consensus on permitting the practice remained \n     elusive and that the issue could get swamped by more pressing \n     issues leading up to Election Day.\n\n  That was from the majority leader's aide.\n  Senator Grassley was quoted as saying that Senator Frist, the \nmajority leader, ``is intentionally keeping drug reimportation off the \nSenate floor because it would pass by a wide margin.'' That is a direct \nquote from Senator Grassley.\n  I have spoken at great length with Senator Frist about this issue. I \nknow others have different views and they have their own interests. But \nI believe there has been a commitment for us to at least try to have \nvotes on reimportation. Some of us feel very strongly about it. It is \nnot partisan because we have Republicans and Democrats who have joined \non a bipartisan piece of legislation.\n  It is my hope that in the coming days we will find a way either to \ntake the bill that is at the Senate desk, which is a bipartisan House-\npassed bill allowing for the reimportation of prescription drugs, or \nalternatively to have an opportunity to vote on the bipartisan \nlegislation we have developed here in the Senate.\n  I have said many times, my own view is that the pharmaceutical \nindustry is a big industry. They do a lot of good. They produce \nlifesaving medicines. But miracle medicines offer no miracles to those \nwho can't afford them. It is unfair that we pay the highest prices in \nthe world for prescription drugs.\n  I believe one way to begin putting downward pressure on prices is to \nlet the market system work. The market system would do for our country \njust as it does in Europe where they have something called parallel \ntrading. Parallel trading means that for approved prescription drugs, \nif you are in Germany and want to buy a prescription drug from Spain, \nthat is not a problem, you can do that. If you are in France and want \nto buy a prescription drug from Italy, that is not a problem. The \nparallel trading plan works in Europe, works for the safety of the \nEuropean consumer.\n  Why should the American consumer not be able to purchase or why \nshouldn't pharmacists from our country not be able to purchase an FDA-\napproved drug from a licensed pharmacist in Canada? That is the \nabsurdity of all this. A pharmacist from Grand Forks, ND, cannot go to \nthat one-room pharmacy in Emerson, Canada, a licensed pharmacy in \nEmerson, and purchase that Lipitor at a savings and pass the savings \nalong to the American consumer.\n\n  We want to change the law to allow that to happen so that pharmacists \nand licensed distributors can access FDA-approved drugs that are sold \nin every other country in the world at a lower price and bring them \nback and allow the savings to be passed along to the American consumer. \nUltimately, what it will mean is a repricing of those drugs in our \ncountry. The market system will force a repricing and a lowering of \nprescription drugs prices. That is the goal, and that is what the \nresult would be if the market system is allowed to work.\n  Again, we are only talking about FDA-approved drugs. We are not \ntalking about anything other than FDA-approved drugs that were produced \nin FDA-inspected plants, sold by a licensed distributor and pharmacist \nin Canada and/or the United States.\n  That is the issue. I came to the Senate floor only because I saw the \nstatement this morning by Senator Frist's staff suggesting that maybe \nthis won't get done. Again, I refer the majority leader to March 11, \nthe statement in the Congressional Record in which the majority leader \nsaid: The Senate will begin a process for developing proposals that \nwould allow for the safe reimportation of FDA-approved drugs, not \n``maybe'' but that would allow for the reimportation. The fact is, I \nfeel there is a commitment here, and my hope is that commitment will be \nkept in the coming couple of weeks as we work to finish our work in \nthis Congress.\n  We have a lot to do. There is a lot of politics running around this \nChamber. My hope is that on big issues and important issues, we can \ndecide we want to do the right thing and engage on issues that are \nimportant to this country and important to the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/08/senate-section/article/S8933-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8933]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing Appropriations Committee staff members and detailees be \ngranted the privilege of the floor during the consideration of the \nfiscal year 2005 Homeland Security appropriations bill and any votes \nthat may occur in relation thereto: Less Spivey, Carol Cribbs, Kimberly \nNelson, James Hayes, Avery Forbes, Brian Glackin, Chip Walgren, Scott \nNance, Alexa Sewell, Peter Edge, and Sean MacKenzie.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, we are now on the Homeland Security \nappropriations bill for the next fiscal year, 2005.\n  For the information of Senators, this morning the President signed \nthe supplemental appropriations bill the Senate passed last night. The \nPresident had requested a supplemental for the Disaster Relief Fund of \nthe Federal Emergency Management Agency. Because of the pressure on \nthat fund, the Agency would have run out of money this morning if the \nCongress had not acted in response to the President's request on \nyesterday.\n  The House acted and the Senate approved the supplemental \nappropriations bill for the Department. So I am happy to make that \nreport to the Senate. There was some discussion of that issue last \nnight, and I appreciate the cooperation and the support of the Senate \nin taking the action we did.\n  We are now prepared to consider the full year appropriations bill for \nthe Department of Homeland Security.\n  We have some opening statements we will make. Senator Byrd is the \nsenior Democratic member of this subcommittee, as well as the full \ncommittee of the Appropriations Committee. He has a statement he wishes \nto make.\n  After opening statements are made, we will be happy to consider any \namendments Senators wish to offer. We hope to be able to complete \naction on this bill as soon as reasonably possible. By the end of the \nweek would be great, if we could accomplish that. But if not, I think \nwe will have the support of the leader and the chairman of the full \ncommittee to continue to work on this bill until we do finish it.\n  It is a matter of great importance that these agencies and this \nDepartment know what the funding levels are going to be for the fiscal \nyear that begins very soon, October 1. We certainly need to take action \nin a timely way for orderly planning for the use of those funds that \nare appropriated by the Congress for this important work.\n  Protecting our homeland is a very important--there is no more \nimportant action by the Federal Government, in my opinion. So I hope we \ncan consider this bill with a sense of serious deliberation and work \nhard to complete action in a timely fashion.\n  I appreciate very much the cooperation of Senators who are letting us \nknow about suggestions they have for changes in our bill as reported by \nthe\n\n[[Page S8934]]\n\nAppropriations Committee. We will consider them, and we will accept \nthose that we can accept. We hope we will be able to have the full \ncooperation of all Senators in that respect.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/08/senate-section/article/S8934-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8934]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

It has \nbeen said, and I will say it again, we are doing everything we can on \nthis side to limit amendments. There are people who have amendments, \nand we want them to be able to offer them to this most important piece \nof legislation.\n  We just finished a leadership meeting, and those there who had a \nnumber of amendments indicated they would be willing to agree to short \ntime agreements on them. I think it is something on which we can move \nforward.\n  I know Senator Byrd has a statement that is--I won't say long, but it \nis weighty. I think it would be better if we came back after the break \nand let him begin his statement. Personally, I want to be here to do \nthat. I would agree to be in morning business until 12:30 p.m. with the \ntime evenly divided, and come back at 2:15 p.m. If it is all right with \nSenator Cochran, Senator Byrd can have the floor at 2:15 p.m.\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

It is the culmination of a lot of \nhard work by all of the members of our subcommittee, as we conducted \nhearings to review the proposed budget from the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, and as we listened to those who have responsibilities for \nmanaging the various directorates and other agencies and activities \nthat come within the ambit of the responsibilities of the Homeland \nSecurity Department.\n  We learned a lot in the hearings. We learned about new procedures \nthat were being developed and deployed. We learned about new \ntechnologies that were being explored. In the bioterrorism area, we \nwere learning about the research that is being done to make our \ncapacity more sophisticated and capable of protecting the health and \nsafety of all Americans from attacks in that area.\n  We have been challenged as we have never been challenged before to \nlook again carefully at how we go about protecting the citizens of our \ngreat country. The experience of September 11, of course, stays in our \nmind as something that is unthinkable. The fact that it did happen is \nstill unbelievable, and we realize that we have the responsibility--\nrepresentatives of the people of this country serving in Congress \ntoday--to try to get it right so that kind of thing can't happen again.\n  We are blessed to be served in the administration by people such as \nTom Ridge, the new Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. \nThe President recommended this new Department be created. The Congress \nresponded. The Governmental Affairs Committee, on which I served at \nthat time, dealt with the challenge of the legal framework of defining \nthe responsibilities of a new department and what activities would come \nunder the Department. We brought together under this one Department 22 \ndifferent Federal agencies, or at least parts of 22 different agencies. \nSome, such as the U.S. Coast Guard, were transferred underneath the \njurisdictional responsibility of the Department to help make our effort \nmore coherent, more effectively and efficiently managed, and to achieve \nthe goal of making our country safer and more secure for the citizens \nwho live in the United States. I think we have made great progress.\n  This bill specifically provides funding of $33.1 billion for the \nDepartment of Homeland Security for this next fiscal year, 2005. This \nis the second appropriations bill to fund the Department which began \nits operations short of a year and a half ago. The new Department has \nmade substantial progress to merge the agency functions and the \nemployees who were transferred under its responsibilities and to \nundertake its new duties to better secure and more effectively protect \nour great Nation.\n  We also have seen a new system put in place called the US VISIT \nProgram to screen visaholders and to stop potential terrorists and \nthose who may be dangerous, because they have committed crimes in the \npast, from entering our country to start with. US VISIT, through \nbiometrics and other new innovations, has already identified, \napprehended, or arrested more than 400 individuals. Through the science \nand technology directorate, the Department has aggressively moved \nforward on the successful testing of the first commercial portal \nmonitors and handheld radiological identifiers to detect the smuggling \nof materials which could be used to build weapons of mass destruction. \nFederal air marshals have been deployed. State-of-the-art technologies \nhave been introduced, and cockpit doors have been modified to increase \nthe safety of air travel.\n  I know there can be criticism leveled at the efforts of the \nTransportation Security Administration which has been the agency \nidentified with the responsibility for overseeing aviation security and \nmany other areas of responsibility. But let me remind Senators--and \nthis is contained in our committee report--I invite the attention of \nthe Senate to the report, on page 31, where we talk about aviation \nsecurity. My good friend, the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, \nmentioned people who might bring in bombs or material that can be used \nas explosives to blow up planes and otherwise harm us.\n\n       The Transportation Security Administration aviation \n     security account [in this legislation] provides for Federal \n     aviation security by employing the most efficient screening \n     of all passengers and baggage, deployment of onsite law \n     enforcement, continuation of a uniform set of background \n     requirements for airport and airline personnel, deployment of \n     the most current explosive detection technology, and creation \n     of a model workplace.\n       The aviation security activities include funding for \n     Federal and private contract passenger and baggage screeners, \n     including personnel compensation and benefits, training, and \n     human resource services; passenger checkpoint support; air \n     cargo security; procurement and maintenance of explosive \n     detection systems; and checkpoint support.\n\n  I suggest that the $4,386,083,000 for aviation security contained in \nthis bill is designed to meet the needs we have for improved and safer \nair travel, working with the airlines who are spending\n\n[[Page S8935]]\n\ntheir own money in many of these and other areas. I suggest we have the \nsafest air transportation system in the world. And we are going to \ncontinue to monitor the activities. We are going to continue to engage \nin oversight and interaction with the Federal agencies involved, as \nwell as Department of Homeland Security officials, to see that we stay \non course and that we continue to upgrade, improve, and take advantage \nof the latest technologies to guarantee the safety and security of \nAmerican citizens.\n  Looking at another area, efforts have been undertaken to increase our \nstockpile of antibiotics, vaccines, and other medications to protect \nAmericans in the event of a terrorist attack and to identify and \ndevelop new countermeasures to protect Americans against new biological \nthreats. Today our first responders, those who work at the fire \ndepartments, the police departments, the emergency medical centers, \nhave been provided with resources from the Federal Government to buy \nnecessary equipment, to increase training to better protect our \ncommunities throughout the country.\n  Including the resources in this bill we are presenting today to the \nSenate, over $12 billion will have been appropriated to our State and \nlocal partners across the country, over $2.5 billion to firefighters \nalone.\n  The Department of Homeland Security has made important strides in \nthis last year. The bill we present to you today will allow the \nDepartment to continue to build on its success and make our Nation even \nmore secure.\n  If Senators look at the provisions in the bill, they will see that it \nreflects suggestions made by Senators on both sides of the aisle. This \nis a bipartisan bill. It is not a Republican bill or a Democratic bill, \nit is an American bill. It is a bill to protect the safety and security \nof all Americans. Our committee held hearings and listened to every \nsuggestion made by all Senators for the levels of appropriations for \nall of these activities.\n  This is the second year of this bill, as I said, but I think we have \nmade important strides forward. I particularly thank again the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia for his cooperation, his \nsupport, and his assistance during the development of this bill and the \nconduct of our hearings and the presentation of the final work product \nto the Senate today.\n\n  I am going to close my remarks--and I will be prepared to receive any \nsuggestions for changes in the bill or amendments or other statements \nfrom Senators--by quoting from something Tom Ridge said with which I \nwas particularly impressed. Our Secretary of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity said:\n\n       Homeland security is about the integration of a nation, \n     everyone pledged to freedom's cause, everyone its protector, \n     and everyone its beneficiary. It's about the integration of \n     people and technology to make us smarter, safer, more \n     sophisticated, and better protected. It's about the \n     integration of our national efforts, not one department or \n     one organization, but everyone tasked with our Nation's \n     protection. Every day, we work to make America more secure. \n     Every day, the memories of September 11th inspire us to live \n     our vision of preserving our freedoms, protecting America, \n     enjoying our liberties, and securing the homeland.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, the Senate now has before it the fiscal year 2005 \nHomeland Security appropriations bill. I commend subcommittee Chairman \nCochran and I commend him highly. I commend his staff for their work on \nthis important legislation. We had an excellent series of hearings this \nyear that I believe helped the subcommittee to produce a bill that \ncontains significant improvements to the President's request.\n  I also commend the thousands of men and women who are on the front \nlines of homeland security. We need to give these men and women the \ntools they need to do their jobs in order to support their strong \ncommitment to serve the Nation every hour of every day of every week of \nevery month.\n  On August 1, 2004, Secretary Tom Ridge increased the threat level for \nNew York, New Jersey, and our Nation's Capital, to Code Orange, a high \nrisk of terrorist attacks. This is the sixth time since September 11, \n2001, that the threat level has been increased to Code Orange.\n  On July 14, Acting CIA Director John McLaughlin said, ``In the Summer \nof 2001, we had ample warning of attack, but we didn't know anything \nabout specificity: timing, targets, and so forth. But we did have \nconviction that something big was coming at us. We have that same \nconviction now.''\n  On July 8, Secretary Tom Ridge and FBI Director Robert Mueller \nannounced that al-Qaida cells are operating in the United States and \nthat multiple simultaneous attacks are possible before the November \nelections.\n  In late May, the Attorney General announced that he had credible \nintelligence from multiple sources that al-Qaida plans to hit the \nUnited States hard in the next few months.\n  In the weeks following the Madrid railway bombings, the Washington \nPost reported that the President informed the Republican congressional \nleadership that he was all but certain that terrorists would attempt a \nmajor attack on the United States before the November elections.\n  It is past time that we begin debating this legislation as we \napproach the 3 year anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks and as \nCongress reviews the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. The \nCommission concluded that the terrorists who are intent on doing us \nharm are so cunning and agile, and sufficiently knowledgeable about \nthis country that they would schedule their attacks when Congress was \nin session. These reports also indicate that on September 11, 2001, our \nGovernment agencies were not prepared to deter or respond to such \nattacks. I believe that we are still not prepared.\n  The bill before the Senate provides $33.1 billion, a level that is \n$896 million above the President's request. Regrettably, the allocation \nthat is available for homeland security programs is inadequate. This is \nnot a criticism of Chairman Cochran, nor is it a criticism of full \ncommittee Chairman Ted Stevens.\n  The fact is that limits placed on homeland security funding by the \nBush White House constrain our ability to address known threats to the \nsafety of the American people.\n  In response to the danger of terror attacks so often invoked by the \nPresident, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, \nand the FBI Director, it is hard to believe that the President would \nnot request supplemental appropriations for securing our mass transit \nsystems, for screening airline passengers for explosives, for \ninspecting more containers coming into our ports, for increasing \ninspections of air cargo, or for increasing the number of Federal air \nmarshals. When the threat level was elevated to Code Orange, why did \nthe President not seek a supplemental? Why does he not amend his fiscal \nyear 2005 budget request to increase his anemic 2-percent proposed \nincrease for the Department of Homeland Security? Why in Heaven's name?\n  Why, indeed, does the Department seem satisfied with a go-slow, \nbusiness-as-usual approach to homeland security? The Department issued \nadvice to mass transit systems for improving security, but provided no \nfunding to increase law enforcement presence, or to deploy canine \nteams. Despite a 6-percent increase in airline flights this year, the \nDepartment has allowed the number of Federal air marshals to shrink \nprecipitously--by 9 percent--and the President's budget would result in \neven deeper reductions next year. Despite concerns about the safety of \nour borders, the Department, in March, imposed a hiring freeze on \nCustoms officers and immigration inspectors. What could possibly drive \nsuch decisions?\n  Millions of dollars that Congress approved for port security, bus \nsecurity, and hazardous materials grants 11 months ago have not been \nawarded. Why? Millions of dollars that Congress approved in February of \n2003, 18 months ago, for the purchase of additional emergency equipment \nfor the 28 Urban Search and Rescue teams have not been spent. Why? \nHaving this money sit in Washington, DC, does not make American \ncitizens any safer.\n  As a result of the President's decision not to seek supplemental \nappropriations, the Transportation Security Administration was forced \nto cut funding for training passenger and baggage screeners and for \npurchasing equipment for airport checkpoints by $38\n\n[[Page S8936]]\n\nmillion. I am one Senator who believes that this administration is \nplaying with fire.\n  It has been 2\\1/2\\ years since Richard Reid, the so-called shoe \nbomber, tried to blow up an aircraft in flight over the ocean with \nexplosives that he carried onto the aircraft. Just 2 weeks ago, two \nRussian planes were simultaneously blown out of the sky. Preliminary \ninvestigations indicate that the planes were destroyed by explosives \ncarried onto the planes by passengers. The 9/11 Commission concluded \nthat we must give priority attention to screening passengers for \nexplosives. Are we any closer to deploying a national system that could \ncheck passengers for explosives? The answer is no.\n\n  It has been over 2\\1/2\\ years since the Congress passed the USA \nPATRIOT Act and set a goal of tripling the border patrol and customs \nofficers on the northern border. Have we met the goal? Again, no. We \nare 1,428 officers short of the goal.\n  It has been nearly 3 years since 9/11, when police and firemen in the \nWorld Trade Center could not talk to each other on their radios. As the \n9/11 Commission concluded, many first responders failed to get the \norder to evacuate the towers, causing hundreds of them to perish. Are \nwe any closer to providing police and firemen across the nation with \ninteroperable communications equipment? Sadly, the answer is no.\n  The EPA has estimated that there are 100 chemical plants in this \ncountry, each of which, if attacked, could harm over 1 million people. \nIn February of 2003, the National Infrastructure Protection Center, \nwhich is now part of the Department of Homeland Security, issued a \nthreat warning that al-Qaida may attempt to launch conventional attacks \non nuclear or chemical plants. A year and a half later, has the \nDepartment actually hardened the security of the chemical plants? You \nguessed it, no.\n  I simply do not understand why this administration thinks that \nhomeland security is not important enough to fund. The President \ncampaigns on being the best candidate to protect this Nation, yet each \nand every budget that he sends to Capitol Hill shortchanges the safety \nand security of whom? You guessed it, the American people.\n  Similarly, I am very concerned that we are about to make the same \nmistakes with our Nation's intelligence services.\n  The 9/11 Commission offered a large number of proposals to change our \nintelligence system, each of which needs to be carefully evaluated. \nSome may work and some may not, but adopting them all lock, stock, and \nbarrel without carefully scrutinizing each proposal simply to beat the \npolitical clock is a surefire recipe for disaster. We should not create \nsheer chaos and bureaucratic turf battles within the very structure \nthat is trying to ferret out another attack before it happens.\n  For instance, last month, the President signed three Executive Orders \nto begin implementing the 9/11 Commission reforms. But the Bush \nadministration has not sent a single budget amendment to the Capitol to \npay for those changes. Where is the money to operate the new National \nCounterterrorism Center that the President created by Executive Order? \nAnd if there is no new money, isn't the President just reshuffling the \ndeck chairs? Is this the same old story being played out?\n  This is what we have seen with homeland security. There is great \nfanfare when the President signs a homeland security authorization \nbill. But then the appropriations bills and amendments are rejected by \nthe Bush White House as ``extraneous spending''--the very amendments \nthat would keep the promise of the administration's fanfare. When are \nwe going to break this cycle of false promises to the people of this \nNation?\n  Our intelligence services have problems that must be addressed. We \nhave far too few people on the ground in key places on the globe. We \nhave terribly inadequate intelligence technologies. We do not have \nsufficient backup facilities for our one-of-a-kind intelligence assets. \nThe FBI Director has told every person who would listen about the \ncritical vulnerabilities that he must address to meet today's threats. \nYet, instead of taking on these tasks which we know must be done, this \ngovernment seems all too eager to satisfy itself with shifting boxes \nand creating bureaucracies.\n  In the legislation before the Senate today, we try to break that \ncycle. The $896 million increase that is in the Senate bill will help \nto address some of the gaps in the President's homeland security \nbudget. The bill includes $150 million for mass transit security, \nnone of which was requested by the President. Instead of cutting port \nsecurity by 62 percent, as proposed by the President, we are providing \nat least a modest increase over last year for port security. We are \nproviding $98 million more than the President requested for replacing \nthe Coast Guard ships and planes that are deteriorating at a dangerous \npace. Funds are included to stop the loss of Federal air marshals. \nAdditional funding is also provided for air cargo security and \nexplosives-detection equipment and for additional radiation detectors \nthat can be deployed at our ports.\n\n  We continue to fund effective programs that the President wanted to \ncut or reorganize, such as the fire grants program and the All Hazards \nEmergency Management Performance Grants program.\n  In addition, the bill contains an important protection for the \nprivacy rights of Americans. I thank Chairman Cochran for his support \nof my amendment in subcommittee concerning CAPPS II, the Department's \nproposed new airline passenger profiling system. By restating the \nlanguage that was in the 2004 act, this bill allows testing of the \nproject to move forward, but ensures that the system will not be \ndeployed until GAO confirms that privacy rights will be protected, that \nan appeals process is in place, that the data in the system is \naccurate, and that the data is protected from unauthorized use. On July \n15, Secretary Ridge announced that CAPPS II, in its current form, would \nnot be deployed. I am encouraged that he finally got the message that \nthe Congress has been sending him for over a year about balancing our \nneed for protection with our rights to privacy. On August 26, the \nDepartment announced a replacement program called Secure Flight, but \ndetails are not yet available. I look forward to hearing the details of \nthe plan so that we can determine whether the privacy rights of our \ncitizens are protected.\n  With the limited funds that were made available to the subcommittee \nunder our allocation, Chairman Cochran has produced a good bill. And I \ncommend him for it.\n  However, this Nation faces a turning point, as we are challenged, \nonce again, by the threat of attack on our shores. We know that \nterrorists live among us. Yet we do not know where they will strike, we \ndo not know when they will strike. We do not know. What we have are \nwarnings from the Attorney General, from the FBI Director, and even \nfrom the President that al-Qaida is planning an attack here within our \nshores. Are we prepared to prevent such an attack? Are we prepared to \nrespond to such an attack? Look at the funding levels and decide.\n  The bill that is before the Senate contains an increase of about 5 \npercent above the fiscal year 2004 level. The President is certain that \nAmerica is going to be attacked again soon, yet the Senate is debating \na bill that provides for a 5-percent increase. If an attack occurs, it \nwill be on the head of this White House to explain why they pinched \npennies with homeland security.\n  Congress has a responsibility to protect the Nation. So does the \nPresident. The country's serious vulnerabilities demand that we invest \ndollars where they are most needed.\n  That is why I intend to offer an amendment to this bill to target \nincreased funding to those programs that have the most impact on well-\ndocumented vulnerabilities, such as rail security, port security, \nchemical security, fire and other first-responder programs, and border \nprotection.\n  Mr. President, more than 95 percent of the Nation's overseas cargo \nmoves through our ports. The U.S. Coast Guard estimates that a one-\nmonth closure of a major U.S. port would cost our national economy $60 \nbillion. We inspect only 9 percent of the cargo containers that come \ninto our seaports. The 9/11 Commission concluded that we must do \nbetter, and I agree. In order to\n\n[[Page S8937]]\n\nhelp secure those ports, the Coast Guard estimates that $1.1 billion is \nrequired to implement the Maritime Transportation Security Act in the \nfirst year, and $5.4 billion over 10 years. Yet the President requested \nonly $46 million for port security grants, and this bill only provides \n$150 million. We need to do more.\n  On March 11 of this year, terrorists attacked commuter trains in \nMadrid, Spain, killing nearly 200 innocent passengers. The President \nhas not requested a dime for mass transit security. We should be \ninvesting in additional guards, better training, additional canine \nteams and better surveillance. Chairman Cochran has initiated a $150 \nmillion program for mass transit security, but the Senate Banking \nCommittee has reported a bill authorizing over $3.5 billion for fiscal \nyear 2005 for mass transit security and the Senate Commerce Committee \nhas reported a bill authorizing $1.2 billion for rail and Amtrak \nsecurity. Americans use public transportation over 32 million times per \nworkday. We need to do more.\n\n  The Hart-Rudman report on the terrorist threat in this country \nrecommended a $98 billion investment in equipping and training for our \nfirst responders over the next 5 years. Yet, this bill cuts first-\nresponder funding below the levels enacted last year. The committee \nreport calls on the Department to finally issue Federal guidelines to \nassist State and local governments in making wise purchases with first \nresponder funding, but guidelines are not a substitute for money. The \nbill would reduce first-responder funding by $778 million from the \nfiscal year 2004 level, including cuts in the fire grant program. That \nis not acceptable.\n  This is a good bill but it simply does not do enough. My amendment, \nwhich I shall offer, will not simply throw money at homeland security. \nIt will address specific, known vulnerabilities. It will fund a number \nof the security weaknesses identified by the 9/11 Commission.\n  Last week, the President said:\n\n       This election will also determine how America responds to \n     the continuing danger of terrorism--and you know where I \n     stand. Three days after September 11, I stood where Americans \n     died in the ruins of the Twin Towers. Workers in hard hats \n     were shouting to me, ``Whatever it takes.'' A fellow grabbed \n     me by the arm and he said, ``Do not let me down.'' Since that \n     day I wake up every morning thinking about how to better \n     protect our country. I will never relent in defending \n     America, whatever it takes.\n\n  Whatever it takes? Well, Mr. President, it takes more than empty \npromises to protect this country from attack. If President Bush meant \nwhat he said last week, he would not accept a bill that cuts funds for \nfirst responders, that leaves first responders unable to communicate, \nthat leaves airline passengers worrying about whether a fellow \npassenger has the means whereby to destroy the plane, whether a \npassenger has brought explosives on board, or that fails to adequately \ninvest in securing our ports, our chemical facilities, and our trains.\n  Again, I commend Chairman Cochran for his work on this important \nlegislation. He conducted hearings. He conducted fair hearings. I \nencourage Members to bring their amendments to the floor so that they \ncan be considered and so that we can bring this bill to final passage \nand go to conference. We need to get a good freestanding bill to the \nPresident's desk. We have waited far, far too long.\n  Mr. President, I ask the Senate to support this bill.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, we are considering a must-pass \npiece of legislation, the Homeland Security bill. Because of that, it \nis an appropriate vehicle to amend to pass other must-pass \nappropriations. The appropriation I am speaking of is hurricane relief \nfor the battered State of Florida and, in some cases, parts of Georgia, \nas well, but particularly the State of Florida because of not only one \nhurricane but two hurricanes. Hopefully, the good Lord is not going to \nmake it three hurricanes.\n  Hurricane Ivan is on a track, as of the latest advisory from 11 this \nmorning from the National Hurricane Center, to come across Jamaica, up \nover the western side of Cuba and into the Gulf of Mexico, which is \nalmost the identical track Hurricane Charley took 4 weeks ago.\n  Let us hope if it continues on that track that it continues on into \nthe Gulf and does not take a right turn, which is what Hurricane \nCharley did, hitting the coast of Florida at Ground Zero, which was \nPunta Gorda, FL, with winds of 145 miles an hour coming straight off of \nthe Gulf of Mexico and right up Charlotte Harbor.\n  We cannot do anything about that because that is the forces of Mother \nNature, but what we can do is respond as a Federal Government in times \nof natural disaster emergency.\n  We started that process last night when we passed a $2 billion \nsupplemental appropriation. That is not nearly enough for the first \nhurricane, let alone the second hurricane. The $2 billion appropriation \nwas a figure the President requested, which is the ordinary procedure. \nSenator Graham of Florida and I had first ballparked only the FEMA \nportion at $2.5 billion and requested that of the President. The \nPresident chose a $2 billion figure and it is our normal custom, in \ntimes of national emergency, to go with the President's request. So \nwith bipartisan unanimous support, we passed a $2 billion appropriation \nlast night. That was quite timely because FEMA's coffers were running \ndry today.\n  Four weeks ago, FEMA had only $837 million in its emergency disaster \nrelief fund. As of Monday, when I met with the FEMA director and his \nregional director who is now in place in a headquarters in Florida, \nthey were down to less than $100 million and they were not able to pay \nbills and order supplies because they were fast running out of money. \nThanks to the majority leader and minority leader and the leadership of \nthe various committees of this body, the Senate passed what had been \nsent over from the House and $2 billion has now replenished the \nemergency disaster relief fund.\n\n  That is going to be used pretty quickly. That was only for FEMA. That \ndoes not say anything about the $500 million we are estimating through \nthe Department of Agriculture in crop losses and all of the assistance \nfrom the Department of Agriculture not only for crop losses but for \ndamage to equipment and buildings. Of course, that does not say \nanything about assistance to the Department of Transportation, where \nthere was significant damage to airports in Florida, including the \nOrlando International Airport that got hit not once but twice.\n  That does not even say anything about a lot of that assistance that \ncomes through the Small Business Administration, which is not only \nassistance for businesses but assistance to individuals, as well as \nlow-interest loans to help people get back on their feet. That does not \nsay anything about assisting the American Red Cross, which has been \ndown there not once but twice now in helping people who are walking \naround in a daze with no power, with a home that has been completely \ndestroyed.\n  So in times of natural disaster, the costs begin to mount up. I will \ngive a means of comparison. Twelve years ago in the monster hurricane, \nHurricane Andrew, that savaged south Florida, it was a hurricane that \nwent over a relatively unpopulated part of the State, south Miami, \nsouth Dade County, the city of Homestead, but then it exited over the \nEverglades, an unpopulated part of Florida. Yet, 12 years ago, the cost \nof that hurricane to the Federal Government, just for FEMA, was $2.9 \nbillion. The total cost to the Federal Government, including all of \nthese other agencies, some of which I have mentioned, was over $6 \nbillion, some $6.3 billion.\n  We are now dealing with not one hurricane, which was not as \ndestructive as Hurricane Andrew for comparison, but now we are dealing \nwith the second hurricane.\n  Now I will speak about this second hurricane, Hurricane Frances. By \nthe time it hit the shore at Fort Pierce, its winds were down to 105 \nmiles an hour. There were gusts of up to 120 miles an hour and those \ngusts were recorded at the Cape, what we refer to as the Cape,\n\n[[Page S8938]]\n\nCape Canaveral, the Cape Canaveral Air Force station at the Kennedy \nSpace Center. That center sustained considerable damage. The big \nvehicle assembly building, which used to be the largest building in \nvolume in the world when it was constructed in the 1960s, used today to \nstack the space shuttle vertically to all of its component parts, was \nravaged to the point of losing 1,000 panels, each panel being 10 feet \nby 4 feet, a total of over 50,000 square feet that is now open into the \nbuilding.\n  I do not need to paint the picture of the disaster that could occur \nif this third hurricane were to come and hit the Kennedy Space Center, \nwith the thousand huge, open windows allowing the forces of Mother \nNature to go inside the vehicle assembly building. That could set back \nthe American space program considerably if there were significant \ndamage.\n  I had a little prayer session in the Commerce Committee with the \nadministrator of NASA today about what we are going to do about this \nand how NASA itself has got to be a part of this emergency \nappropriation, as the Department of Defense was 12 years ago when \nHurricane Andrew did so much damage to Homestead Air Force Base. So, \ntoo, we have this problem at the Space Center. By the way, it is not \nonly the vehicle assembly building.\n  There is no excuse for why the building that manufactures the \ndelicate silicon tiles that go on the underbelly of the Space Shuttle \nOrbiter was ripped apart when these winds came across the Cape. My \ncolleagues should see pictures of it. Our ability to produce the \nthermal protection system for the space shuttle was savaged by these \nwinds. There is no excuse for not having a building that is constructed \nto withstand hurricane force winds, and I have asked NASA to answer to \nthat. The fact is, it has happened and it is going to have to be \nrepaired, as is the roof of the building that handles the central \ncomputers that has now been ripped off. What I am saying is there are \ngoing to be a lot of costs because Mother Nature has dealt us a very \nsavage blow.\n  The gentleman handling this legislation is the distinguished Senator \nfrom Mississippi, who is also an expert in agricultural appropriations.\n  I am sure the Senator has already gotten the reports that the first \nhurricane savaged the citrus crop 100 percent. Even more, because the \nyoung trees that snapped, that were loaded down with fruit, by the way, \nnow have to be pruned back. So the loss of the orange crop is not just \nthis year, 100 percent of the crop, but that loss will be sustained \nover several years as those pruned-back orange trees will take years to \ngrow back. So that is the agricultural loss.\n  If that were not enough--let me call this to the attention of the \nchairman of the Agricultural Subcommittee of the Appropriations \nCommittee. If that were not enough, here comes the second hurricane, \nand it ravages another part of the citrus growing region in Florida \ncalled the Indian River citrus region, where the delicacy fresh \ngrapefruit is grown. There is no telling, I have not gotten the \nestimates of what happened, but if it is like the first one, even those \ngrapefruits still on the tree, with the root rot going on with the \nfloods, it is likely it is a 100 percent loss as well.\n  We can see the extraordinary destructive force of nature that has hit \nus. Lord forbid a third one, Ivan, comes to our State. We don't wish it \nto go to anybody's State.\n  Floridians are tired; they are stressed; they are hot; their patience \nis wearing thin. Yet they have been very appreciative of the response. \nOne of the lessons that we learned from Hurricane Andrew was that it \nwas total chaos afterward. One level of government was not talking to \nanother level. That has been changed. There is communication and \ncooperation efficiently going on between all levels of government. \nHowever, when you get hit not once but twice, with the possibility of a \nthird time, then the human endurance and the ability to respond to \nnatural disaster begins to have a finite limit.\n  If there is one reason for the Federal Government to exist, it is to \nhelp its people in times of disaster. I will later on be offering some \namendments to this bill. Most of what I have proposed here I would \nprefer that we strip off this bill and we handle it as a freestanding \nbill so it doesn't get mired in all of this. But I am only going on the \ninstructions that the majority leader has given me, which is that we \npassed the $2 billion last night and he wanted to--and it was his \nwords, many times over--attach it to the Homeland Security bill. So we \ncan discuss what is the appropriate venue.\n  I yield to the distinguished Senator from Mississippi.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I am happy to compliment the distinguished Senator for \nhis description of the damages in Florida. We are all keenly aware, \nbecause the of the images on television, and the description in the \nnewspapers, conversations with friends and family members in that \nState, how terrible those storms have been and the devastation that has \nbeen caused.\n  One thing that reminds me of the history of my own State is the \nterrible force of the wave action. I can remember when Hurricane \nCamille struck the Mississippi Gulf Coast in, I think, 1969, that storm \ndid more damage than any other hurricane that had ever hit that part of \nthe gulf of Mexico. I recall going down to the gulf of Mexico and \nvisiting that area, seeing how devastating the damage was and how long \nit took to recover from it. As a matter of fact there are still scars. \nThere is one shrimp boat about 2 blocks inland now that is sitting \nthere as a reminder of the force of that hurricane.\n  The fact of the matter is, and the Senator is correct, the $2 billion \nthe Congress has approved for a supplemental appropriation for the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency is targeted just to the Disaster \nRelief Fund. This is, as the Senator knows, to provide emergency \nassistance of food, shelter, debris cleanup--taking care of the \nemergency situation that exists. That fund was going to be exhausted \nthis morning when the President signed the bill appropriating this \nadditional money. So, with this funding, that account is taken care of.\n  As the Senator indicates, there is a lot of other damage that is \noutside the jurisdiction of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. \nThe Department of Agriculture and other Federal agencies may have \nresponsibilities and they may not have sufficient funds to meet all the \nneeds for which some people are entitled to reimbursement or some kind \nof disaster relief under Federal law. For that reason the President \nindicated in his request to Congress which he submitted on September \n6--and I'll read this. He said:\n\n       The enclosed request requires immediate action by the \n     Congress to ensure that the immediate response efforts to \n     these recent disasters continue uninterrupted. I anticipate \n     making a further request in the coming days that will provide \n     for a comprehensive response and recovery effort addressing \n     the impact of both of these hurricanes. In addition, federal \n     government agencies will continue their response and recovery \n     efforts using existing resources and programs.\n\n  What we get from that is the President is submitting and, we have \nbeen advised by the President's staff, that in the coming days there \nwill be another supplemental appropriations bill requested by the \nPresident. It will not be the bill that we are considering today, \nthough. This is the annual appropriations bill that funds the entire \nDepartment of Homeland Security, Coast Guard, the Secret Service--the \n22 various agencies that are combined within the ambit of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  I suggest to the Senator we would welcome any suggestions he has for \ninclusions in the additional supplemental that will be before the \nCongress soon, at the request of the President.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the Senator for his comments. It would \nbe this Senator's preference that we have an emergency supplemental \njust for the hurricane damage, including all of these agencies as well \nas--I didn't even mention the Army Corps of Engineers. We had severe \nbeach erosion; in some cases, beaches disappearing. I just mentioned, \nfor example, citrus, but we are talking about huge losses in nurseries, \nin vegetables, in cattle, hogs, the oyster/clam industry, timber--just \nto mention a few. It would be this Senator's preference clearly to have \na stand alone supplemental. However it was Senator Frist, the majority \nleader, who called me saying he wanted to use this vehicle, the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, to which to attach those\n\n[[Page S8939]]\n\nadditional emergency supplemental requests.\n  If there is a change in that, and I get assurance that in fact this \nother legislation will move because of the necessity of it--I remind \nyou the $2 billion last night was just FEMA for the first hurricane, \nCharlie. That doesn't address all these other agencies and it doesn't \naddress FEMA for the second hurricane, Hurricane Frances.\n\n  I will certainly work with the Senator. But I am one way or another \ngoing to make sure we have this appropriations request before the \nSenate under the emergency conditions that we find ourselves facing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Schumer is here. He has a very \nimportant amendment to offer. I think we could probably agree on a time \nfor debate. We of course will ask the majority what time we want to \nvote. But I gather the Senator from New York would be in agreement to a \ntime limit on his amendment.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague from Nevada. I would be happy to \nset a time limit and then have a vote on the amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Could the Senator give us an idea about how much time it \nmight take? Senator Cochran usually likes to work under time \nagreements. Could we have a general idea?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. That is fine with me. Maybe we could have a few minutes \nfor the majority and a few minutes for the minority.\n  Mr. REID. We have a general idea about how much time it would take. \nIf we could have a vote sometime before 5 o'clock?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, before we start agreeing on times for \nvotes, that is above my pay grade. We have a distinguished majority \nleader, and we will have to consult with him and other Senators.\n  Mr. REID. I did mention that, but to give Members an idea of when \nthere might be a vote, Senator Schumer is ready to offer his amendment.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. It depends on what his amendment is. We may all rejoice \nand vote for it. Who knows? Again, we may not.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. If my colleague will yield, I can assure him it is a \ngood one.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. President. I will be offering an \namendment on nuclear security in a few minutes. But first I would in \ngeneral address this bill.\n  Let me first say at the outset I am glad we are doing this bill now. \nAs you know, many of us on this side of the aisle asked that this bill \ncome up much sooner. But to do it right here as our first order of \nbusiness when we return from the summer break after the two conventions \nI think is very good. I am glad we are on this bill.\n  The second point I would make is this: I don't think anyone on this \nside--certainly not the senior Senator from New York--wants to obstruct \nor not have this bill pass. We want it to move forward. So there is no \nintention to delay. As my good friend from Mississippi has seen by my \nasking for a short period to debate this amendment, having spent 18 \nyears in the House of Representatives, 45 minutes is a lifetime there, \nbut here in the Senate it is a relatively short amount of time. There \nis no intention for dilatory tactics or anything of that sort.\n  I believe, being head of our Democratic Task Force on Homeland \nSecurity, and having talked to many of my colleagues about further \namendments, my friend, our chairman of the Subcommittee on Homeland \nSecurity Appropriations, will find similarly short time limits are \nbeing called for. That is all the good news. The bad news is many of us \nthink this amendment being brought before us is woefully inadequate. I \nwould like to discuss that in general.\n  I have been quite hawkish on the war on terrorism, having supported \nthe President's request to go into Iraq. I supported the $87 billion \nand I believe we need a strong and muscular foreign policy overseas. \nMistakes are often made. We should do a lot better in terms of those \nmistakes. But inaction is perhaps the greatest mistake of all.\n\n  I am for fighting a vigorous war on terror overseas. I believe what \nour President said--former President Bill Clinton--is exactly right. To \nhave strength and intelligence--that is exactly what he said, something \nto that effect--are not mutually exclusive categories when fighting a \nwar on terror. If we are fighting a strong war on terror overseas, we \nare certainly not doing it here at home.\n  If I had to choose perhaps the greatest weakness of this \nadministration in its war on terror, it would be the inadequacy of what \nwe are doing here at home. The bottom line is this: We get a lot of \nrhetoric. We don't get the focus, the thoughtfulness, or the resources, \nthe dollars to do what we need to do. Sure, if you think this is a 20-\nyear plan, maybe we are doing enough. But we sure don't think it is a \n20-year plan when we go overseas, nor should we. It is not a 20-year \nplan here.\n  Let me say this. This is my own view. We have a window in this global \nwar on terror. In other words, my view is that this war on terrorism we \nface can be described in a single sentence; that is, the very \ntechnology which has blessed our lives and accounted for so much of the \nprosperity we have seen over the last two decades here at home has an \nevil underside, and that is that small groups of bad people can get \nhold of that technology and use it for terrible purposes. You can be in \na cave in Afghanistan, and as long as you have a wireless connection to \nthe Internet you can learn as much about America as any of us knows. If \nyou took 500 random people anywhere on the globe from the most highly \nintelligent and well-read and studied to maybe the guy who sweeps the \nfloors at night and injected them all with an evil virus so that they \nall decide to spend the next 5 years figuring out how to do terrible \ndamage to the United States and then implement it, the odds are too \nhigh they can succeed.\n  This is not simply a war against al-Qaida. Al-Qaida is the first \ngroup who learned how to use this technology to cause the terrible \nevents in the city from which I hail and which I so love. Al-Qaida is \non the run. We have not done enough maybe in Afghanistan and Pakistan, \nbut clearly al-Qaida is weaker today than it was then. But it is only a \nmatter of time before new groups--maybe the Chechens, maybe the East \nTimorese, maybe even the skinheads in western Montana--figure out they \ncan use this technology and do terrible damage. So we have a window. It \nmay be 2 years, it may be 4 years, it may be 6 years, but it sure as \nheck ain't 10 or 20 where we can tighten up our defenses, because even \nthough we have to fight the war on terror overseas we also have to \nprepare a defense at home.\n  If 500 people can do such terrible things, the odds we will be able \nto catch all of them before any of them implement the first strike \nagainst us is rather small.\n  Like anyone who follows sports knows, to win a game you need a good \ndefense and a good offense. Whether you agree with this administration \nor disagree, you can't take away that they are focused on that offense. \nWhen it comes to defense, they are not home. They would be ranked as \none of the worst defenses around. I have tried to figure out why this \nis, why we are doing so little on homeland security at home; why when \nit comes to our ports or our trucks or our rails or our borders, we are \nmaking such slow and halting progress, almost grudging progress, if you \nwill.\n  I am not a person inside the brain of the President or his chief \nadvisers, but having talked to people who have worked there and left--\nsome of them in disgust--I can tell you that part of it is a lack of \ndesire to spend the dollars necessary. Spend whatever it takes \noverseas, fine; spend whatever it takes here to make us secure, the \nmoney is not there.\n  There is also the mistrust of Government, a sort of antigovernment \nview that Government is not a good thing, that Government is not going \nto do it right, that Government should be the place of last resort. \nUnfortunately, when it comes to the war on terror, it is only the \nGovernment that can do it, whether it be overseas or here at home.\n  But as a result, this administration, in my judgment, whatever grade \nyou give them in fighting the war overseas, would get a D or an F in \nmost areas in terms of fighting the war here at home.\n  Let me give some general places where we are not close to doing\n\n[[Page S8940]]\n\nenough. Regarding the air, we have done a good job making sure another \nSeptember 11 does not happen specifically in the way it did; in other \nwords, simply bolting the cockpits of all our planes greatly cuts down \nthe average of a plane being hijacked. Putting air marshals on the \nplanes makes a great deal of sense. We have made progress inspecting \nbaggage and luggage. In fact, I think the TSA has done a good job and \nis an example that Government can do a good job. They are doing better \nthan the private sector did when they were hiring people at minimum \nwage who hardly spoke English. However, even in the air we are \nvulnerable to terrorists using shoulder-held missiles and taking down \nour planes. We can stop that.\n  There will be an amendment offered here either by me or by somebody \nelse that will push us to do more, much more quickly. Are we doing \nnothing in these areas? Absolutely not. We are doing a little bit. \nAgain, if you believe that we can take 20 years to tighten our defenses \nbefore, God forbid, terrorists strike again, that is fine. If you \nbelieve we have a window that may be 3 or 4 or 5 years, it is a \ndereliction of duty. It is a dereliction of responsibility, the same as \nnot protecting our troops overseas.\n  Take the rails. We learned in Madrid that terrorists may want to hurt \npeople by blowing up trains and railway stations. The best way they do \nthat, the most efficacious way, is by using regular explosives. We have \nthe technology to develop devices that can be like smoke detectors. \nThey can be put on every railroad car, in every railway or subway \nstation. If someone walks in with nitrates, they will be detected. We \ndo this, of course, on airplanes. We have sniffing devices which are \nnow used in a few airplanes. I went through one of the devices in \nRochester. It works well. That does not work for crowded trains and \ncommuter rails and subways. We can increase the technology and it can \nbe like a smoke detector. Place it on the ceiling, and it goes off if \nsomebody carries explosives, thereby thwarting a blowing up of a train \nor a railroad station. We are not doing that.\n  Nor are we protecting the egress and ingress at most of our train \nstations in case, God forbid, something blows up. Penn Station, the \nbusiest rail station in the country, still has tunnels a mile and a \nhalf long without ventilation and without escape routes. Two or three \nyears ago we allocated $500 million to improve that. Only $100 million \nhas been spent.\n  My colleague from California, Senator Boxer, will have an amendment \non rail security that will address some of these concerns. She and I \nwill be talking about that.\n  What about the ports? We are still only inspecting, at best, 5 \npercent of all incoming containers. I was speaking to a few people who \nrun the container operations in parts of New York. They say it is more \nlike 1 percent that we are inspecting. Who knows what is in the \ncontainers? Shoulder-held missiles, nuclear weapons, terrorists \nthemselves. They caught someone actually in a container trying to \nsmuggle himself into Toronto. We do not inspect these containers. \nAlmost anything can be in them. Again, the technology is there to do \nmore, quicker, and better inspections, to detect explosives or \nbiological or radiological compounds and to put a lock on the container \nso it cannot be opened again and something be placed in it. My \ncolleague from Washington will be offering an amendment on port \nsecurity.\n\n  How about trucks? We have learned al-Qaida is now using truck bombs \nas a weapon of choice. This is what our intelligence picked up when we \nhad the last scare that said something might occur during the political \nseason, either at the conventions--which, thank God, it didn't--or \nmaybe closer to the political season. There were indications that truck \nbombs might be used. There are things that can be done, things that are \ntechnologically available and feasible to deal with truck bombs. We \ncan, for instance, require any truck that carries hazardous material \nhave a GPS system so we know exactly where they are going. If they go \noff course, we will know. If they are stolen, we will know. A truck was \nstolen in Pennshauken, NJ, my neighboring state, that contained \nhazardous material. It is missing. It has been missing for 3 months. \nWho knows who has it. The odds are it was robbery, but it is always \npossible someone for far more evil purpose was stealing that truck.\n  In Brazil, a country hardly as technologically advanced as we, every \ntruck has a GPS system. When they go off course, it cuts off so the \ntruck cannot run any further if they are worried. Brazilian truck \ncompanies did this to prevent theft. Why aren't we requiring it here? \nThe cost is minimal. Put a GPS system in your new Cadillac, it costs a \ncouple hundred bucks more. We can do the same thing for trucks.\n  We can have some controls on how ammonium nitrate is sold, which is \nused in truck bombs. We cannot stop it or limit it; our farmers need \nit. But certainly when someone buys a lot we could require they \nidentify themselves and call an 800 number to make sure they are not on \na terrorist watch list or a previously convicted felon.\n  We can put taggants in the explosions. With nanotechnology, the \nmarking devices are very tiny and do not interfere with either the cost \nor the effectiveness of the explosive. That way, we can find out who \ntried to buy certain materials. It serves as a deterrent, as well. We \nare doing virtually none of that.\n  By the way, there will be an amendment on truck security.\n  Are our chemical plants secure? Absolutely not. My colleague from New \nJersey, Senator Corzine, has been the leader on this issue. His State \nis one of the leading chemical producing States in the country. A \nterrorist can easily scout out a chemical plant and make plans to blow \nit up, creating huge damage. All these areas are not areas where we do \nnot know what to do. We know what to do. They are not areas where the \ntechnology is not yet able to be developed. It is able to be developed.\n  I have talked to experts in all of these areas until I am blue in the \nface. We do not have the urgency coming from this administration when, \ntime and time and time again the Senator from West Virginia, who has \nbeen such a leader on this issue, Senator Byrd, or any who have been \nfocused on this area, have brought amendments to the Senate to provide \nthe dollars to make these things feasible, we have been told we do not \nhave enough money.\n  I ask, would most Americans rather see these things being done and \nhave maybe half a percent less cut on the top tax rate? In other words, \nsay we go, instead of from 39 to 35.5 percent, that would give us \nenough money to do all of these things. This is not a political choice. \nThis is hardly pork. This is protecting our homeland every bit as much \nas providing our soldiers overseas with the weaponry, the backup, that \nthey need. Yet no one is home. There is some rhetoric, but every time \nthe dollars aren't there, there is not the focus, there is not the \nalarm, the sense of urgency some Members feel.\n  As we debate this bill, many Members will offer a series of \namendments on each of the areas I have talked about and then some \nothers.\n  These amendments are not intended for any political purpose. They are \nintended out of a sense of urgency, out of a sense of anxiety, out of a \nsense of even anguish that we are just not doing enough. I will be here \nmaking sure we vote on every one of these amendments. It will probably \ntake us a day to debate them all, a full day, and if others say we do \nnot have that kind of time, I would argue we do. If the majority leader \nthinks we have to work late to consider these amendments, so be it. But \nwe are just not doing the job.\n  One final issue which I will be bringing up is our first responders. \nOur hospitals, our police departments, our fire departments--Senator \nMikulski will have an amendment on the fire grants--are stretched. They \nhave done a great job in their respective areas. Our police do a great \njob on the war on crime. Our fire departments keep us safe. Our \nhospitals are more and more advanced. But each of them has been asked \nto do special things since 9/11. Each of them has new burdens placed \nupon them and we are not giving them the dollars they need to do it.\n  Now, you may say, well, let the localities pay for it. But the \nhospitals in the localities are not paying. With Medicare and Medicaid \nreimbursements what they are, with the HMOs being more and more \nefficient, they do not have the money on their own. So if we do not do \nit, no one will.\n\n[[Page S8941]]\n\n  With police and fire, it is not much different. We all know how our \nlocalities' budgets are strapped. We all know that the property taxes \nare a huge burden on people. To ask them to raise the property tax \nburden to do this means it either will not be done or will not be done \nin the full way that it should. Yet we are not helping our first \nresponders: our police, our firefighters, our hospitals.\n  So there will be another amendment, I neglected to mention, which I \nwill offer to increase funding overall for first responders. Senator \nMikulski will have an amendment on the fire grants. But the bottom line \nis this: There is, as I said, a dereliction of duty, a dereliction of \nresponsibility on homeland security. This administration almost has a \ndisconnect. Dollars do not matter when it comes to fighting the war \noverseas, when it comes to defending our soldiers. Dollars cannot \nbecause their lives are precious. But dollars almost are the end-all \nand be-all when it comes to homeland security, and we do not do close \nto what we should be doing.\n  So in terms of my general remarks, I look forward to debating this \nbill. I hope some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will \njoin us in supporting these amendments.\n  The bottom line is very simple: No one knows how the war on terror is \ngoing to twist and turn over the next generation. That is why I tend to \nlike proactive policies both abroad and at home. But no one is a \ngenius. There are a few geniuses, but not enough of them. No one can \nforesee the future, so we do not know what is in store for us. We \ncertainly want to cut down the odds of a terrible, terrible incident \noccurring again the way one did on 9/11 in my city.\n  I wear this flag in memory of those who we lost. I put it on \nSeptember 12, and I wear this very flag every day. I knew some of the \npeople. I was friends with a firefighter who died, a guy who I played \nbasketball with in school who died, a businessman who helped me as I \nwas on my way up politically. So it is sort of personal. But the \nanguish I feel is maybe one-tenth the anguish, one-one-hundredth the \nanguish, one-one-thousandth the anguish of the families who live with \nthis every day. But they would want us to do everything we can, and we \nare not.\n\n  It is my hope this debate will, at the very least, elucidate places \nwhere we are not doing what we should, and maybe even provide the kind \nof dollars, resources, and focus that have been so sorely lacking thus \nfar.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3580\n\n  With that, Mr. President, I now send an amendment to the desk to \naddress the critical issue of nuclear security in our ports in terms of \nresearch and development.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. Schumer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3580.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, a point of order. I have no objection to \nthe dispensing of the reading of the amendment, but a point of order. \nIs there already an amendment pending from the Senator at the desk? Is \nthis the second amendment or is this a different amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are no other amendments pending.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nreading will be dispensed with and the amendment will be considered as \nread.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To appropriate an additional $150,000,000 for port security \n                    research and development grants)\n\n       On page 19, strike ``$2,845,081,000'' and all that follows \n     through ``grants;'' on page 20, line 11, and insert the \n     following: ``$2,995,081,000, which shall be allocated as \n     follows:\n       ``(1) $970,000,000 for formula-based grants and \n     $400,000,000 for law enforcement terrorism prevention grants \n     pursuant to section 1014 of the USA PATRIOT ACT (42 U.S.C. \n     3714): Provided, That the application for grants shall be \n     made available to states within 45 days after enactment of \n     this Act; that States shall submit applications within 45 \n     days after the grant announcement; and that the Office of \n     State and Local Government Coordination and Preparedness \n     shall act within 15 days after receipt of an application: \n     Provided further, That each State shall obligate not less \n     than 80 percent of the total amount of the grant to local \n     governments within 60 days after the grant award; and\n       ``(2) $1,550,000,000 for discretionary grants for use in \n     high-threat, high-density urban areas, as determined by the \n     Secretary of Homeland Security: Provided, That $300,000,000 \n     shall be for port security grants;''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, this amendment deals with, to me at \nleast, the greatest nightmare that--how much time does our side have, \nMr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no pending order for time.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Oh, we did not have a time agreement? Thank you, Mr. \nPresident. I only intend to take another 10 to 15 minutes on my own, \nand then maybe if my colleague from Mississippi speaks in favor of the \namendment I will not even speak further. But if he speaks against it, I \nwill try to answer what he has to say.\n  Mr. President, if you think of all the terrible things that \nterrorists could do to us--and there are so many you almost run out of \nmental space thinking about them--perhaps the worst that I can imagine \nis that a nuclear weapon, and I am not talking about a dirty bomb, \nwhich would be bad enough, but a real nuclear weapon would be smuggled \ninto this country and exploded anywhere in the country, but \nparticularly in one of our large cities.\n  The damage would be unimaginable. It is guessed if it were even a 10-\nkiloton device--smaller than the devices that were exploded in \nHiroshima and Nagasaki--that over 100,000 people would die immediately, \nhundreds of thousands more in the next month, and then perhaps even \nmillions over the years from the radiation. The economic loss would be \nincredible, not just in the city where it was exploded but wherever the \nwind currents blew in terms of where the radiation blew. It would \nprobably, in many ways, change the way of life that we cherish for \nevery American, no matter in what part of the country you lived.\n  So it seems to me we should be doing everything we can to prevent a \nnuclear weapon from being exploded here. Part of that, of course, is to \ntry to buy up the nuclear weapons we know parts of the former Soviet \nUnion have had and a few other countries have had. We should be funding \nNunn-Lugar. But the amendment does not go to that. The other is to \nprevent them from being smuggled in.\n  There is good news and bad news about nuclear material. The good news \nis, in terms of detection, every one of them emits something called \ngamma rays which can be seen and detected through metal, through \nanything but lead. Lead is very heavy, so it is hard to detect a device \ntotally surrounded by lead. And then you can detect lead anyway.\n  The bad news is, right now the detection devices we have are not very \nproficient. They still have to detect the nuclear material at \nrelatively close range. A Geiger counter needs 3 feet. Some of the \nother ones that have been developed need a little bit more space.\n  They are not foolproof, to say the least. I have talked to scientists \nin my State at Brookhaven National Laboratory and to scientists in many \nother States, and devices could be developed that, No. 1, detect any \nkind of nuclear materials from 70 or 80 feet away and detect them in a \nfar more foolproof way than the present devices.\n  Now, the only way a nuclear device can be smuggled into this country \nvery easily--the only remaining way--is in large containers that come \ninto our ports by the tens of thousands every day or in a truck that \ngoes over the Mexican or Canadian border.\n  It is very easy to imagine that we could place these detection \ndevices on every crane that loads a container coming to our country. \nYou may say: Well, there are thousands of cranes all over the world. \nThat is true, but already we only allow containers to come into this \ncountry that are loaded from 15 ports. I do not have the list of them, \nbut it is Antwerp, Singapore, places such as that. You do not want to \ndetect them here because then they could be exploded while the ship \napproaches our shores and is not yet here. It could be placed on every \ntoll booth. We would basically prevent any nuclear weapon from being \nsmuggled into the country.\n\n[[Page S8942]]\n\nBut the devices that really work well and can detect radiation far \nenough away and do it well and sensitively are not yet developed.\n\n  Scientists say that with a couple of years of research they can do \nit. They right now detect small amounts of nuclear material in \ncyclotrons and atom smashers at a great distance, but those devices are \ntoo large and delicate. They can't be bounced around very much to work.\n  All it takes is spending some dollars, maybe $150 million, maybe $250 \nmillion--it sounds like a lot, but it is not in terms of the $1.7 \ntrillion budget--and then installing them in the ways that I have \nstated.\n  I have tried for 3 years to get this body to do it. A few years ago \nwe accepted an amendment that would have at least put in $150 million \nfor these devices. But when it came back from conference, only $35 \nmillion was left. Guess what. That was in the 2003 budget. They still \nhaven't spent it. Is that amazing? It is $35 million to start on this \nresearch, and Homeland Security still has not let the contracts.\n  What is going on here? This is a huge catastrophe that could, God \nforbid, happen, and we are just asleep at the switch.\n  This amendment seeks to rectify that. This amendment will provide all \nof the necessary funding to develop the devices and then install them \nin places we need them. My guess is the whole process would take 2 to 3 \nyears, if we really put the energy and the muscle into it. It is true \nthat there are a few places where we are doing this with rudimentary, \nmore primitive types of detection devices. Yes, one of them is in my \nharbor, Howland Hook on Staten Island. I have visited. I see how it \nworks. It is better than nothing. But it isn't close to good enough. \nThat is one container port, and there are 40 or 50 in New York alone.\n  We all know the terrorists have access to the Internet, and they know \nexactly where nuclear devices are being detected, the few ports that \nthey are, and the huge number where they are not. They also know that \nthe detection devices could be a lot bigger.\n  What we really want to do is develop a super Geiger counter, one that \ncan detect nuclear materials from a distance and one that is more \naccurate. Again, you put it on every crane that loads a container bound \nfor the U.S., on every toll booth that has a truck that will go into \nthe U.S., you have dramatically reduced the odds of this type of \ncatastrophe occurring.\n  Is there anyone who doesn't believe we should do that? Is there \nanyone who thinks the funding we are asking here, which is an \nadditional $150 million, isn't worth the cost? Yet my guess is that \nwhen we have this rollcall vote in a short while, people will just \nmarch up to the podium and vote no, and there is no good answer.\n  I hope my colleagues will not do that. One hundred fifty million \ndollars is not going to break this bank. It is quite broken already. It \nis not going to break it much further, and it will do a world of good.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I hope, if we are \ngoing to support the amendment, that we will see it through in \nconference and not do what happened a couple of years ago where it was \nknocked out in conference and a much smaller amount of money was \nprovided for and then that money was not spent.\n  I am ready to sit down. I know my colleague from Mississippi wants to \nmove the bill forward. I do not disagree with that. I think the \nargument is pretty clear and pretty succinct. I hope we will be off to \na good start on this bill by supporting this amendment and by not \nignoring homeland security, particularly a catastrophe that could occur \nif a nuclear weapon were smuggled into this country.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3580, As Modified\n\n  Mr. President, I have a modification of my amendment at the desk, and \nI ask unanimous consent that it be so modified. It is just changing one \nnumber.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator has that right. The \namendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n       On page 19, strike ``$2,845,081,000'' and all that follows \n     through ``grants;'' on page 20, line 11, and insert the \n     following: ``$2,995,081,000, which shall be allocated as \n     follows:\n       ``(1) $970,000,000 for formula-based grants and \n     $400,000,000 for law enforcement terrorism prevention grants \n     pursuant to section 1014 of the USA PATRIOT ACT (42 U.S.C. \n     3714): Provided, That the application for grants shall be \n     made available to states within 45 days after enactment of \n     this Act; that States shall submit applications within 45 \n     days after the grant announcement; and that the Office of \n     State and Local Government Coordination and Preparedness \n     shall act within 15 days after receipt of an application: \n     Provided further, That each State shall obligate not less \n     than 80 percent of the total amount of the grant to local \n     governments within 60 days after the grant award; and\n       ``(2) $1,350,000,000 for discretionary grants for use in \n     high-threat, high-density urban areas, as determined by the \n     Secretary of Homeland Security: Provided, That $300,000,000 \n     shall be for port security grants;''.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. It is actually a reduction in the amount of money by $50 \nmillion.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this deeply significant but, in terms \nof dollars, modest amendment so we can cut down the odds of a nuclear \nweapon being smuggled into this country and, God forbid, creating a \ncatastrophe.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, it is always instructive to listen to the \ndistinguished Senator from New York talk about programs and activities \nthat are of major concern to his constituents, particularly in the New \nYork City area, but New York State generally. We appreciate his \nobservations and his expression of concern about technologies and \nadvancements and new ways of protecting the citizens of his State and \nour country against nuclear threats or other threats to our security. \nWe think the Department has made important progress in these areas, \nanalyzing and understanding the technologies that are available.\n  We have included, for example, encouragement for additional \ninvestigations in this area. I am reading from page 84 of the committee \nreport now. It says:\n\n       The Committee expects a significant expansion of the \n     Countermeasures Test Bed being conducted with the Port \n     Authority of New York and New Jersey in testing technologies \n     to detect radiation/nuclear threats to include railway, \n     general aviation facility monitoring, expanded roadways \n     coverage, and an additional seaport.\n       The Committee is aware of technology proposals developed \n     with national laboratories to facilitate the inspection of \n     containerized cargo for fissile materials as a part of the \n     normal off-loading process at the Nation's seaports.\n\n  The Department is focused on the importance that we all believe \nshould be paid to this area of interest and concern. We know that \nexisting technologies are being deployed by agencies at ports of entry, \nincluding the U.S. Coast Guard and the Bureau of Customs and Border \nProtection. They provide an effective nuclear countermeasure system, \nbut continued focused development can considerably extend these \ncapabilities in order to develop technologies for application to \nspecific locations, including those in the intermodal transportation \nsystem, in the maritime domain, at border ports of entry, and in the \naviation industry.\n  Specifically, the committee included in this section of the bill to \nwhich this amendment is directed great latitude in approving grants \nthat can be the subject of applications from not only States but local \njurisdictions such as port security areas.\n  Of the total provided by the committee for urban area security \ninitiative grants, $150 million is for port security grants; $150 \nmillion is included for rail and transit security grants; $10 million \nis available for inner city bus security grants for the improvement of \nticket identification, the installation of driver shields, the \nenhancement of emergency communications, and further implementation of \npassenger screening; $15 million is also included for trucking industry \nsecurity grants to continue the Highway Watch Grant Program.\n  This committee had the responsibility of trying to help ensure that \nacross the broad range of urban area security concerns funds were \navailable for grants to local areas and to States to deal with these \nnew challenges.\n  The committee believes the Department's practice over the past 2 \nyears to allocate appropriated funds could be improved. We suggested, \nfor example, that they all not be made available\n\n[[Page S8943]]\n\nearly in the fiscal year but to leave some opportunities for later \ngrantmaking authority so that if any new discoveries or intelligence of \nrecent terrorist threat information became available, these funds could \nbe targeted to higher risk areas and where we would get more for our \nmoney.\n  It is easy to offer an amendment to double an appropriation, and that \nis what this amendment does. We have $150 million in the bill for this \none particular grant program within the broad urban area security \ninitiative grants. What the Senator from New York is doing is asking \nthat be doubled.\n  You can just about go through this bill, I suggest, and find every \nincremental amount that is in this bill and pick out one and offer an \namendment to double it and make a good persuasive case why it would be \nbetter off if we could spend twice as much money as we have allocated \nfor that one activity. That is a pretty easy argument to make. But it \nis also a cheap shot, and the reason I am calling it a cheap shot is \nthat we have within this Urban Area Security Grant Program $1.2 billion \nfor discretionary grants to high-threat urban areas. The Secretary has \nto make these decisions on the basis of the applications and the \nproposals that are submitted to the Department.\n  If we in the Congress are going to go back through the bill and try \nto second-guess every one of these accounts and double it and ask for a \nvote, you could easily double the whole cost of the bill. We have a \n$33.1 billion bill. It probably would be harder to get a vote to double \nthat to $66 billion, but you could make some arguments why we could \nspend that amount of money. But could we spend it in a thoughtful way \nthat would efficiently and responsibly use the taxpayers' dollars in \nthis area of concern, homeland security?\n  We have had 2 years of experience in writing this bill. Last year, we \nended up having to make points of order on the basis of the fact that \nsome of the amendments were in excess of the allocation that was given \nto this subcommittee.\n  I understand the full committee has been meeting this afternoon \nduring the last hour to review the amount of funding that would be \navailable to each subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee. \nAnd I understand soon, if it has not already been done, there will be \nfiled with the Senate this allocation, and this subcommittee will have \na limited amount of money to use in writing this bill.\n  I am not suggesting we have gotten the cart before the horse, but I \nam suggesting that before we vote on this amendment, I want to be sure \nI know what the allocation amount is for this subcommittee. It is not \njust targeted to the amendment of the distinguished Senator from New \nYork that I do this, but any amendment that would come in and double an \namount without any more justification than it would be good if we could \nspend twice as much as we are spending. And that is really the \nargument.\n  Sure, it would be good if we could spend twice as much as we are \nspending in a lot of areas, but we have to make the choices within a \nframework of funds available to the committee for a wide range of \nactivities, all of which are very important. We have to choose among \nprograms of the U.S. Coast Guard, programs of the Transportation \nSecurity Administration, of the Secret Service, of the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency, and many others whose accounts are funded \nin this annual appropriations bill.\n  I am hopeful we can withhold action on this particular amendment and \nlet us have an opportunity to review the committee's work.\n  So awaiting the further advice of the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee or his staff, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum be dispensed with so I might answer my friend from \nMississippi.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I make this point. We were here 2 years \nago, and a year ago, and my good friend from Mississippi, with the same \neloquence, made the same argument: The amount of money is the amount of \nmoney we have; yes, we could double it, but let's leave it up to the \nwisdom of the Department and the committee.\n  We did that, and in the last year, we have had no money spent on \ndeveloping better nuclear detection devices. That is a cheap shot? In \nall due respect to my colleague from Mississippi, and I would say in \nall due respect this could happen in New York and it could happen in \nHouston, TX, and blow over to Mississippi--this could happen anywhere \nin the country, and I am sure just as I would want to protect the \ncitizens of every other State, so would my colleague from Mississippi.\n  This is hardly an urban issue. Chernobyl did not occur in an urban--\nit may have been in an urban setting, but it ruined millions of acres \nof farmland, which I know my colleague cares a great deal about, as do \nI.\n  We are asking not for $33 billion, although maybe that would be \nspent. If I were the President, I would spend a lot of time figuring \nout what we needed and then spend it. I would not just ask for extra \nmoney. This is a small amount of money, $150 million, specifically \ndirected to nuclear security, when in the past we have not done it. And \nmy colleague argues we have enough money and leave it to the wisdom of \nthe Department to do.\n  By my good friend's logic, we should not have a Congress. Let's have \none broad allocation for homeland security and let them do what they \nwant. And let's not even look, if they do not do something we all think \nis necessary, and come back and say let them do it again.\n  This is not a typical request. This is not something that just \nbenefits one specific area or one specific company. This is dealing \nwith one of the greatest dangers America faces, and spending a small \namount of money after we have learned that Homeland Security will not \ndo it themselves seems to me to be a reasonable request.\n  I greatly understand my colleague's nose-in-the-tent argument: If I \nam for this, well, I have to be for it for so many other things. But I \nask him to look at the substance of this amendment and its cost, and I \ncannot think of an argument against it.\n  Yes, there is $1.2 billion for all kinds of threats. This is the \ngreatest threat we face, perhaps, and there is no specific money that \nsays we have to do this. In the past, when we have had these broad \ncategories, again Homeland Security has done virtually nothing. Why, I \ndon't know. I have asked them. They say: Yes, we are working on it, \njust as my good friend from Mississippi has said, but nothing happens.\n  So we wait another year and another year. I hope we do not have to \nwait until something terrible happens. That is not what anybody wants. \nTo say that Congress should not be modifying what the administration \nhas done says we should not have a Congress, and to say that this \namendment is either frivolous or regional or unnecessary does not make \nany sense to me.\n  If my colleague could assure me that the Homeland Security Department \nwould do this out of the existing allocation, I would say, sure, but we \nhad that kind of assurance 2 years ago. My friend, the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, Senator Stevens, said to me: You are right. \nLet us make sure we get this done.\n  Well, it has not been done. So I would simply say, I know the \ncommittee has labored under what the administration has sent them on \nthe issue, for instance, of rail security. Where the Rail Association \nsays we need $6 billion to thoroughly protect our rails, the \nadministration asked for zero, and the committee comes up with $150 \nmillion. That is a lot better than zero but is not close to what we \nneed.\n  I say to my friend from Mississippi, the bottom line is, my premise \nis we are not doing enough, we are not spending enough dollars, and we \nshould have a significant increase.\n  When we came and found we needed $25 billion more for the war in \nIraq, nobody said, well, we could double the number, let's not. Nor \nshould they have. Well, it is the same thing when it comes to homeland \nsecurity. The difference is, it is not a day-to-day issue. Nothing \nhappens, nothing happens, nothing happens, nothing happens, thank God, \nand then something terrible happens and we say, why did we not do it?\n\n[[Page S8944]]\n\n  I am trying to prevent that scenario. I am trying to prevent it for \nmy city and my State and the Senators' cities and the Senators' States, \nand everybody.\n  So I ask that my colleagues look at this amendment. Do not be swayed \nby the logic, well, if we double this one we will have to double every \none. Let us look at every one and see what we need. Certainly this one, \nwhich is $150 million more, aimed at a specific program that no one \ncould object to, makes a great deal of sense. I hope it will pass. I \nurge my colleagues to vote for it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the Senator talks about we have sort of \nrubberstamped what the President has asked for in some of these areas. \nWe have agreed with the President on some of his initiatives because we \nthought he was right, but when we thought the administration was wrong \nor where they have requested funds, as he pointed out, in the railroad \narea, for security programs there, this committee has recommended and \nthe Congress has agreed to add funds over and above what has been \nrequested by the President.\n  In this particular area, where the Senator is coming in now and \ndoubling the amount of money we have in this one particular grant \nprogram--we have appropriated for this program almost $500 million, \nspecifically for port security grants, since fiscal year 2002. We are \naddressing this issue. This is the point, and I am not apologizing for \nthe decisions this committee has made and that have been ratified by \nboth Houses of Congress and approved in the appropriations conference \nreport. We have appropriated almost $500 million specifically for this \nprogram. We have asked for another $150 million this year. That is not \nenough, he says; double it.\n\n  We can talk about it on and on and on and go into all the other \naccounts that involve security in urban areas, high threat areas, but \nwe have to realize there is a limit. Some Senators think we can come in \nand double the amounts in individual accounts and it will not matter, \nbut if we keep on doing that before this bill is passed, we will have \nadded no telling how much to the deficit. We would have put the \nadministration in a position where they are going to have to either ask \nfor deferrals or recisions of funds. If they cannot possibly get grants \nout to people who are qualified to use the money or can justify the use \nof the funds, we cannot pour the money on the ground, and I am not \ngoing to stand here and go along with suggestions that amount to \nspending more because it sounds as if we are going to be doing more. It \ndoes not necessarily follow.\n  I am hopeful we will have in place within the next few minutes some \ninformation about the total allocation of funding to this committee, \nbecause without that we can continue to add money for individual \naccounts in this bill for the rest of today and tonight and on into the \nweekend and then we will have to go back through and start striking \nfunds that have been added so we will be consistent with the allocation \nto the subcommittee.\n  What I am asking the Senate to do, and the reason I put in the \nsuggestion for a quorum when I first made the point of order, is to \nawait the advice of the Committee on Appropriations. I am told they \nsent the information over electronic device, but we need it written on \npaper so Senators can read it and can understand what the limitations \nare. So I am hopeful we can await the advice of the full committee on \nthe action that has been taken today. I would appreciate it very much.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I indicated earlier that the Senate \nAppropriations Committee met earlier this afternoon to approve the \nsubcommittee funding allocations. The allocations approved are the same \nas those provided earlier by the full committee, for this \nsubcommittee's information. For Homeland Security appropriations, the \napproved fiscal year 2005 discretionary spending allocation is $32 \nbillion in budget authority and $29.873 billion in outlays. The bill \nreported by the committee is at the $32 billion discretionary budget \nauthority allocation and $144 million below the outlay allocation. The \nallocations for this bill are $897 million in budget authority and $730 \nmillion in outlay above the President's request, showing the priority \nthe committee has placed on Homeland Security accounts and its \nappropriations.\n  This is a fiscally responsible allocation and Members will be \nrequired to provide offsets for any additional spending proposed by \namendments to be added to this bill, or the amendment will be subject \nto a 60-vote Budget Act point of order, I am advised. Therefore, I make \na point of order against the Schumer amendment under section 302(f) of \nthe Congressional Budget Act that the amendment provides spending in \nexcess of the subcommittee's 302(b) allocation.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: My friend from \nMississippi said the outlays were still $144 million below what had \nbeen allocated by the committee. If I were to ask unanimous consent to \nmake this amendment instead of $150 million, $144 million, within the \noutlays, would a point of order still lie?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I think the Senator asked for a \nparliamentary inquiry. I don't have standing to rule on parliamentary \ninquiries. That is the responsibility of the Chair.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask the Chair. Given the Budget Act, if this amendment \nwere to be modified instead of $150 million of new money, given what we \njust heard, if the outlays were below $144 million, below the full \ncommittee allocation to the subcommittee, would a point of order still \nlie?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is advised that depends on whether \nit would affect the change in outlays as well as budget authority. It \nis the understanding of the Chair that there is no room with regard to \nbudget authority.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Continuing my parliamentary inquiry, that would mean a \npoint of order would lie even if we were within the outlays?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Just one further parliamentary inquiry: If we said zero \nbudget authority but $144 million in outlays, would that be in order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would have to check with the Budget \nCommittee on the specific numbers.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I imagine it is not. So pursuant to \nsection 904 of the Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable \nsection of that act for purposes of the pending amendment and ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nvote on the motion to waive in relation to the pending Schumer \namendment at 4:45 p.m. today, with the debate until that time equally \ndivided in the usual form.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have. The question is on agreeing to the \nmotion to waive the Budget Act.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Akaka), the \nSenator from New York (Mrs. Clinton), the Senator from North Carolina \n(Mr.\n\n[[Page S8945]]\n\nEdwards), and the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) are \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins).

The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy], for himself, Mr. \n     Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Jeffords, and Mrs. \n     Feinstein, proposes an amendment numbered 3581.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To prohibit funds from being used to process or approve a \n  competition under Office of Management and Budget Circular A-76 for \n   services provided as of June 1, 2004, by certain employees of the \n  Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services of the Department of \n                           Homeland Security)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. None of the funds appropriated by this Act may be \n     used to process or approve a competition under Office of \n     Management and Budget Circular A-76 for services provided as \n     of June 1, 2004, by employees (including employees serving on \n     a temporary or term basis) of the Bureau of Citizenship and \n     Immigration Services of the Department of Homeland Security \n     who are known as of that date as Immigration Information \n     Officers, Contact Representatives, or Investigative \n     Assistants.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I have offered this amendment on behalf \nof myself, Senator Nelson of Nebraska, Senator Jeffords, Senator \nLieberman, and Senator Feinstein.\n  I rise today to offer an amendment that would end an ill-advised \nattempt by the Department of Homeland Security to privatize jobs that \nare vital to keeping Americans safe. This amendment would prohibit DHS \nfrom spending money to contract out immigration information officer, \ncontact representative, or investigative assistant positions. I am \npleased to have Senators Ben Nelson, Lieberman, and Jeffords as \ncosponsors. The House voted for this exact amendment earlier this year \nby a vote of 242 to 163, with 49 Republicans supporting it. I trust \nthat we will have a similar bipartisan majority in the Senate.\n  Immigration information officers, IIOs, are responsible for screening \napplications for immigration benefits for fraud and for performing \ncriminal background checks on applicants. There are more than 1,200 \nIIOs and contact representatives around the Nation working for the \nCitizenship and Immigration Services, CIS, branch of DHS. The work they \ndo in attempting to discover and prevent immigration fraud--and prevent \ndangerous people from abusing the immigration system--is clearly \n``inherently governmental,'' making them an inappropriate target of a \nprivatization effort.\n  As our Nation continues to face the threat of terrorism, CIS carriers \na heavy burden in its attempt to process immigration and naturalization \napplications while ensuring that terrorists--along with other \nfraudulent actors--do not abuse our immigration system. Information \nofficers have played a vital role in meeting this burden. Indeed, the \nagency's own job description requires that IIOs have the ``[s]kill to \nidentify fraudulent documents in order to prevent persons from \nappealing for benefits for which they are not eligible,'' a skill that \nis obviously all the more important in this era. They are also required \nby DHS to have ``[k]nowledge and skill in interviewing techniques and \nobservation of applicants in order to determine if an applicant is \nmisrepresenting the facts in order to appear eligible for a benefit.'' \nI am offering this amendment because I believe that weeding out \npotential fraud in our immigration system must remain a responsibility \nof Government employees, especially when the perpetrator of the fraud \nmay be a dangerous criminal or terrorist.\n  In addition to their security-related work, these IIOs perform duties \nthat are directly related to achieving President Bush's goal, stated \nduring his 2000 campaign and since, of providing more efficient \nservices to lawful immigrants. IIOs increase efficiency by, as their \njob description states, exploring ``all avenues of assistance available \nto the customer; determin[ing] the benefit most advantageous if more \nthan one exists, and try[ing] to motivate the customer to file the \nappropriate application(s).'' IIOs also have extensive knowledge and \nuse discretion in their positions--they are required to have \n``knowledge of the exclusion and deportation regulations'' and \n``knowledge and familiarity with the immigration and nationality \nlaws.'' As CIS continues its efforts to reduce the backlog faced by \nimmigration applicants to 6 months, the last thing we should be doing \nis replacing knowledgeable immigration professionals with inexperienced \ncontract workers.\n  Should a private contractor win the work currently performed by IIOs, \nthat contractor will be responsible for adjudicating immigration \nbenefits and detecting fraud and criminal activity, requiring the \ncontractor to make decisions that are both sensitive to national \nsecurity and have a huge impact on the lives of millions of immigrants. \nThis would be a bad idea in any era, but it is particularly \ninappropriate now.\n  I have a personal interest in this issue because about 100 fine \nVermonters currently work as IIOs. I know the fine work they do, and I \nknow that my staff and, indeed, all of our staffs rely on them and \ntheir counterparts throughout the country when we are seeking to help \nour constituents. I know that our Nation will be better off if these \nfine men and women remain in their current positions.\n  Thirty-five members of this body are already on record in opposition \nto contracting out the IIO positions. We wrote to Secretary Ridge a \nyear ago, seeking the cancellation of the A-76 process. I have since \njoined with Senators Lieberman, Byrd, and Kennedy in obtaining \ndocumentation from DHS about its decision to launch the A-76 process to \nhire private contractors to perform the work currently done by IIOs. \nThe documents the Department has provided have proven illuminating. \nThey have shown that officials within CIS did not think there should be \nprivate sector competition for these jobs, and believed that the IIOs \nwere performing inherently governmental work. These officials took \ntheir concerns to the leadership at DHS, but their views were \noverruled, and the competition proceeded.\n  Grant Thornton and PEC Solutions, outside consultants hired by DHS, \ndrafted memoranda and presentations to demonstrate that going forward \nwith the job competition was unwise. These views, too, were ignored.\n\n[[Page S8946]]\n\n  The decision to contract out these positions is all the more \ndisturbing because it has the hallmarks of a decision made simply to \nmeet a quota. The Bush administration set a goal of privatizing 15 \npercent of Government jobs shortly after it took office. When the \noriginal decision to submit the IIO positions to competition was made, \nthey were still INS and Department of Justice employees. According to a \nsenior official at CIS, that original decision was made when the Office \nof Management and Budget informed DOJ that it had only hours to submit \n1,200 positions that could be privatized. Only James Ziglar, then the \nINS Commissioner, even knew that the IIO positions would be submitted \nto OMB.\n  After the INS was transferred to DHS, the new Department had to \ndecide whether to continue with the competition. DHS announced its \ndecision to subject the jobs to competition in August 2003, and DHS \ndocuments suggest that the 15-percent goal remained a major factor in \nthe decision, with the leader of the DHS privatization office referring \nto the need to meet OMB's 15-percent goal as recently as October 2003. \nThis was true even though Congress prohibited agencies in February \n2003--10 months earlier--from applying or enforcing any numerical goals \nor targets for subjecting employees to public-private competition, and \neven though the administration grudgingly announced it would abide by \nthe law forbidding this quota in July 2003.\n  This amendment would also protect the jobs of investigative \nassistants. These CIS employees work in the Fraud Detection Unit, \nsearching a variety of private, governmental, and criminal databases to \nfind information about applicants for immigration benefits. These \npositions were created in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, \nattacks, to ensure that only qualified personnel would have access to \nhighly sensitive databases. Despite the nature of the position and the \ncircumstances under which it was created, DHS has demonstrated interest \nin privatizing these positions as well. This amendment would put a stop \nto that misguided effort as well.\n  In conclusion, this amendment would protect Federal employees who are \ntrying to weed out fraud in the immigration system and assist lawful \nimmigrants seeking benefits to which they are entitled. It had \noverwhelming bipartisan support in the House, passing with nearly 50 \nRepublican votes. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Madam President, I will summarize what this is about for my \ncolleagues. There is an attempt to privatize a number of jobs in the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. These jobs are vital to our American \nsecurity. I do not believe they should be privatized. A majority of the \nother body feels the same way.\n  My amendment would prohibit DHS, the Department of Homeland Security, \nspending money to contract out immigration information officer, contact \nrepresentative, or investigative assistant positions. That is why I am \nglad Senators Nelson of Nebraska, Lieberman, Jeffords, and Feinstein \nhave cosponsored this amendment.\n  This is not a partisan issue. The House voted for this exact \namendment. They just copied the wording of it. They voted overwhelming \nfor it, 242 to 163, with 49 Republicans supporting it. I hope we will \nhave similar bipartisan support in the Senate.\n  Let me explain immigration information officers. We call them IIOs. \nThey are the people who screen applications for immigration benefits \nfor fraud. They perform criminal background checks on applicants. There \nare more than 1,200 of these IIOs and contact representatives around \nthe Nation. They work for the Citizenship and Immigration Service, a \nbranch of DHS.\n  The work they do in attempting to discover and prevent immigration \nfraud and prevent very dangerous people from abusing the immigration \nsystem is clearly inherently governmental.\n  This is not a custodial service. This is not a landscape service. \nThese are things preventing immigration fraud. It is clearly inherently \ngovernmental. So it should not be part of a privatization effort.\n  As we all know, our Nation continues to face the threat of terrorism. \nCIS carries a heavy burden to attempt to process immigration and \nnaturalization applications, but they have to ensure that terrorists, \nalong with a lot of fraudulent actors, do not abuse our immigration \nsystem. They play a vital role in meeting this burden. In fact, the \nagency's own job description requires that ``they have the skill to \nidentify fraudulent documents in order to prevent persons from \nappealing for benefits for which they are not eligible.'' That is a \nskill obviously all the more important in this era.\n  They are also required by DHS to have knowledge and skilled \ninterviewing techniques in observation of applications. What they have \nto do comes from years of experience. They have to be able to find \nthose people who are seeking a benefit who are not eligible.\n  I have spent a lot of time on immigration matters and I believe that \nweeding out potential fraud in our immigration system is a major \nresponsibility of our Government. It is a major responsibility of our \nGovernment employees. We do not turn it over to somebody else, \nespecially when the perpetrator of that fraud could be a very dangerous \ncriminal or a terrorist. I do not want to have it turned over to Fraud \nCatchers USA. I want it within our Government so we know what standards \nare being followed.\n  They also perform duties that are directly related to achieving \nPresident Bush's goal of providing more efficient services to lawful \nimmigrants. They increase efficiency, explore all avenues of assistance \navailable to the customer to determine the benefit most advantageous \nwhen more than one exists, again based on vast experience.\n  The administration wants to reduce the backlog faced by immigration \napplicants to 6 months. Well, suddenly putting in a whole new service \nto do it makes little sense. If a private contractor does it, that \ncontractor is going to be responsible for adjudicating immigration \nbenefits and detecting fraud and criminal activity that will require \nthe contractor to make decisions that are sensitive to our national \nsecurity. It is also going to have a huge impact on the lives of \nmillions of immigrants. I think this would be a bad idea in any era, \nbut with the terror threat we face now, I think it is a very bad one.\n  The amendment would also protect the jobs of investigative assistants \nwho work in the fraud detection unit. These positions were created in \nthe aftermath of September 11 attacks. Despite the nature of the \nposition, despite the circumstances under which it was created, DHS has \ndemonstrated interest in privatizing these positions as well. I think \nthat is a mistake.\n  As I said, this passed overwhelmingly in the other body, Republicans \nand Democrats alike supporting it. I hope we would do the same.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Nebraska on his feet, and I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, I have cosponsored, as my \ndistinguished colleague from Vermont has indicated, an amendment to the \nHomeland Security appropriations bill, and I ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Harry Reid of Nevada be added as a cosponsor.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. I believe this is a matter of great \nimportance to the security of our country. The amendment would \neliminate funding for an A-76 competitive outsourcing study of \nimmigration information officer, contact representative, and \ninvestigative assistant positions within the Bureau of Citizenship and \nImmigration Services, or the BCIS, at the Department of Homeland \nSecurity.\n  As a general principle, I do not oppose privatization of Government \njobs where doing so clearly is in the best interest of the most \nefficient use of taxpayers' dollars and is in the best interest of not \nonly our Government but of the taxpayers. I do believe, though, that \nthere are some types of jobs that can and should be performed by \nGovernment, as well as some jobs and services that can be performed by \nprivate contractors. I believe that deciding which jobs are appropriate \nfor privatization should be a very careful and deliberative process. It \nshould not be done to meet arbitrary quotas. In the\n\n[[Page S8947]]\n\ncase of these particular BCIS jobs, I believe DHS has made a mistake in \nsubjecting them to an A-76 study.\n  In this instance in particular, I do not believe privatizing these \nparticular jobs is appropriate or will best serve the interests of our \ncountry. I believe these jobs are intricately tied to the national \nsecurity of our country and therefore are inherently governmental. \nThese jobs require a high level of discretion and of very specific \nknowledge of immigration laws to determine who is eligible for \nimmigration benefits. These workers are charged with weeding out fraud \nin the immigration system and identifying those with criminal histories \nor those who could be potential terrorists. These are the types of jobs \nthat are inherently governmental in that they are vital to protecting \nour country from security threats.\n  The DHS's own job descriptions for these positions illustrate why \nthese positions are inherently governmental. For example, immigration \ninformation officers are required to have the ``skill to identify \nfraudulent documents in order to prevent persons from appealing for \nbenefits for which they are not eligible.'' They are also required to \nhave ``knowledge and skill in interviewing techniques and observation \nof applicants in order to determine if an applicant is misrepresenting \nthe facts in order to appear eligible for a benefit.''\n  In addition, according to the DHS's own job descriptions, workers in \nthese positions are exposed to highly confidential information and may \nat times be exposed to national security information. They must \nexercise their discretion by observing and questioning individuals for \nthe purpose of determining if those individuals are attempting to \nsubmit applications under fraudulent situations and reasons. This can \nlead to the arrest or detention and subsequent deportation of those \naliens and may lead to the prosecution of cases.\n  In Nebraska alone, there are 100 workers within the BCIS performing \nthese functions, and I have heard from them directly about why they \nbelieve their duties are inherently governmental. Quite frankly, I \nagree with them. I believe it would be unwise, especially in our \ncountry's current heightened state of alert to terrorist threats, to \noutsource jobs that are so closely linked to the security and safety of \nour country. Weeding out potential fraud in our immigration system must \nindeed remain a responsibility of Government employees, especially when \nthe perpetrator of the fraud may be a dangerous criminal or a \nterrorist.\n  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to support Senator Leahy's and my \namendment and prevent these jobs from being privatized.\n  I thank the Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3582 to Amendment No. 3581\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Thomas] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3582 to amendment No. 3581.\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To require the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit to \n Congress, at least 60 days prior to award, a report on the results of \n   an Office of Management and Budget Circular A-76 competition, to \ninclude estimated savings, performance improvements, and the impact on \n                 jobs and Federal Government employees)\n\n       Strike all after the word ``Sec.'' and insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __. None of the funds appropriated by this Act may be \n     used to make an award, pursuant to a competition under Office \n     of Management and Budget Circular A-76, to a source for the \n     performance of services that were provided as of June 1, \n     2004, by employees (including employees serving on a \n     temporary or term basis) of the Bureau of Citizenship and \n     Immigration Services of the Department of Homeland Security \n     known as of that date as Immigration Information Officers, \n     Contact Representatives, or Investigative Assistants unless--\n       (1) the Secretary of Homeland Security submits to Congress, \n     not later than 60 days before making such award, a report \n     that describes--\n       (A) the performance requirements for the services;\n       (B) the estimated savings to be derived from the \n     performance of such services by that source;\n       (C) the actions that are to be taken to effectuate the \n     transition to performance either by Federal Government \n     employees under the applicable most efficient organization \n     plan or by a contractor, as the case may be; and\n       (D) the strategy for mitigating the adverse effects of such \n     award, if any, on Federal Government employees; and\n       (2) the making of the award to that source will not result \n     in the closure of an immigration information service center \n     that was in operation on June 1, 2004.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I offer this as a second degree to the \npending amendment of the Senator from Vermont. The amendment \nspecifically restricts the Department's ability to conduct competitions \nunder President Bush's competitive sourcing initiative, which is an \nintegral part of his management agenda. As a strong supporter of the \ncompetitive sourcing process and consistent advocate for a smaller and \nmore efficient government, I offer this second degree to ensure that \nany attempts to restrict the Department of Homeland Security in \nimplementing its competitive sourcing efforts are limited.\n  The positions in question, immigration information officers, have \nbeen identified by the Department as noninherently governmental \nfunctions. They have been identified by the Department in that \ncategory. They are commercial activities and can be performed in the \nprivate sector without endangering our homeland security efforts.\n  The Department of Homeland Security is simply complying with the FAIR \nAct by subjecting these positions to public/private competition in \norder to determine if they could best be performed by the private \nsector or remain in house. This competition was initiated by the \nDepartment of Justice prior to the transfer to DHS. It is critical to \nsignificantly improving first line services associated with processing \nimmigration applications and benefits. DHS is in the process of \ncompleting its competition in these very positions, and the amendment \nof the Senator would prohibit DHS from completing this competition. \nNumerous studies have confirmed that competitions create opportunities \nfor innovative, improved data management, economic, and performance \nimprovements. They are confident that competition has already provided \na powerful incentive for both the public and the private sector sources \nto identify new and better ways of meeting the requirements.\n  This information has to do with these positions. The IIOs are GS-5s, \n7s, and 8s, with supervisors at the GS-9 level, who perform only first \nline procedural processing for a range of immigrant applications/\nbenefits. They are not performing inherently governmental work, are not \npolicymakers or regulators, do not bind the Government to a course of \naction. Adjudicators, who have authority to investigate, correct, \noverrule and make final decisions regarding immigration status, are a \nseparate function within the Citizenship and Immigration Service, but \nare not covered by this proposed, or any other, DHS competition.\n  The DHS has opened its commercial activity currently performed by \nGovernment employees to competition from the private sector in order to \nimprove services, improve the opportunity for innovation, improve \nlevels of security, and create the possibility of cost savings. The \nGovernment and private sector will compete for the work based on \nquality and cost.\n  The agency has written that on a governmentwide basis, competitions \ncompleted in fiscal year 2003 are estimated to generate savings and \ncost avoidances of over $1 billion over the next 3 to 5 years. The \nHouse version of the bill contains a provision that would block DHS \nfrom using competition to choose the best public or private sector \nsources to handle tasks associated with the processing of immigration \napplications. We understand an amendment may be offered on the Senate \nfloor that would preclude public-private competition and turn back DHS \nefforts to significantly improve customer service for immigrants. If \nthe final version of the bill were to contain such a prohibition, the \nPresident's senior advisor would recommend he veto the bill.\n  We have been through this a number of times. It always is presented \nas if these are replacing Government jobs\n\n[[Page S8948]]\n\nwith private sector jobs which, first of all, I don't think is a bad \nidea but nevertheless that is not the case. This is competition. This \nis an opportunity for both those in the Government service and in the \nprivate sector to have an opportunity to deal with these administrative \nfirst level jobs--these are people who do not make the decisions, they \nsimply go through the details of this--and to allow this agency to \ncontinue to seek to make their work more effective and more efficient. \nSomehow, every time this comes up we have this opposition to this \nprogram that has been in place, is in place, and the fact is it has \nalready been proven to save considerable amount of money. It is already \nproven in most cases, as a matter of fact, because of the improvement \non the part of the Federal employees; they remain there through the \ncompetition.\n  It just seems to me it is a mistake for us to get into this program \nand say you can't do that anymore. Clearly these people are not the \npeople who are decisionmakers. They are the folks who are doing the \nadministrative work that brings it to the decisionmakers.\n  Additionally, my amendment would not result in the closure of any \nimmigration service centers or district offices currently in operation, \nwhich appears to be the concern of some of the sponsors.\n  I hope we can take a long look at this and that we can try to allow \nthis program of efficiency, of cost saving, to be continued by this \ndepartment. Let them make the decision as to who can best do this task.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I have great respect for the Senator from \nWyoming. He is a friend. I understand what he is saying. Unfortunately, \nthe reason why this position was not taken in the other body is what he \nhas asked for is something they could do anyway, simply ask for a \nreporting requirement. What they have done, in asking for that, they \nsimply put it over for another 60 days and then do exactly what they \nwant. I don't think anybody questions the reporting that would come \nback from the very department that wants to do this would be to say: Do \nwhat you want to do. They accept the report, they accept the way it \nwill be done. Rather than needing 60 days, they could probably do it in \n6 minutes.\n  What I am concerned about is the reason why there is such a \nbipartisan support for this in the other body--not for the gutting \namendment of the Senator from Wyoming but for our amendment--was this \nmakes sure that these very critical services are in the hands of \nGovernment agencies.\n  There are jobs that can be privatized but I think sometimes we \nprivatize what we should not. We sometimes privatize law enforcement \nand we have seen some of the problems we have had in our prisons when \nwe have done that. Otherwise we privatize investigations and we find \nthat people have their records and their reputations ruined by private \ncompanies that do not meet the standards they are supposed to follow \nand afterwards they say, Sorry, we made a mistake.\n  Frankly, if you vote for the second-degree amendment you are voting \nto outsource positions that are critical to our security. We have had \n35 Senators who have already written to Secretary Ridge, asking him not \nto do this. Basically the second-degree amendment simply says tell us \nwhy you think you should do it and just go ahead and do it anyway.\n  I hope we would not vote for it.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I strongly support the amendment offered \nby Senator Leahy, myself, and other colleagues that would prohibit \nopening up the Immigration Information Officers, IIO, position for \ncommercial competition.\n  This position was opened for commercial competition after a \ndetermination that the IIO position was not performing an ``inherently \ngovernmental activity,'' and thus capable of being filled through \ncommercial competition. This decision was fundamentally flawed and \nwill, if implemented, be an impediment to national security.\n  While a very basic description of the functions performed by an IIO \nmight include telephonic and written responses to questions from the \npublic, a closer look at the duties actually performed by IIOs results \nin a more varied list of duties. My staff and I have had the pleasure \nof being helped by IIOs on numerous occasions over the years in our \nattempts to assist my constituents. It is my experience, that IIOs not \nonly provide basic immigration information to the public, but they also \nhave the ability to advise petitioners on the type of petition to file; \nthey have the authority to correct mistakes made in Citizenship and \nImmigration Services, CIS, records and computer systems; they can \nreject petitions for various reasons; and it is my understanding that \nmany IIOs adjudicate petitions.\n  As anyone who is familiar with United States immigration law knows, \ninterpreting regulations and offering advice is a complicated business. \nWhen dealing with immigration law, the potential is great for making a \nmistake that could severely impact a business or a family for a \nlifetime. Thus, it is inconceivable to me that CIS would consider \nopening this position to commercial competition.\n  In the interest of security, following the 2001 terrorist attacks, \nthe Federal Government decided that airport passenger screeners should \nbe Federal employees. Consistent with that decision, I believe that \nmaintaining the IIO position as a Federal employee position strengthens \nour protection against future terrorist attacks.\n  In reality, IIOs have the ability to determine who can or cannot \nremain in this country. When dealing with the public, they draw from a \nwealth of institutional knowledge that benefits not only the \npetitioner, but also the entire Nation. IIOs also have access to agency \nrecords and can, in fact, modify such information when appropriate.\n  For many years, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, INS, \nstruggled to live up to the word ``service'' in its name. It is my hope \nthat at the beginning of this new era, with the creation of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, including the CIS, we will not weaken \nour ability to provide persons seeking immigration benefits with the \nservice they deserve. Having the important duties of Immigration \nInformation Officers performed by individuals selected through \ncommercial competition will only hinder the service provided, not \nimprove it.\n  A similar amendment passed in the House of Representatives during its \nconsideration of the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations \nbill this year, and I am hopeful that my Senate colleagues will join us \nin supporting this important amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, it occurs to me that this is an issue \nthat probably ought not be on this bill. As a matter of general \nprinciple, it is a legislative decision. It seems to me the committee \nof jurisdiction would probably be the committee chaired by the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer.\n  Having said that, that doesn't make this amendment go away by itself. \nWe have to dispose of it. We have to deal with it. Frankly, I am \nconfused about how the amendment got added to the House Appropriations \nCommittee bill. I am told it was an amendment offered on the floor and \nit was adopted by the House. This seems to me an amendment that ought \nto be at least discussed in conference. If we adopt the Leahy amendment \nwithout changing it at all, then we are stuck with the language, it \nseems to me. I don't know how you get away from having this provision \nin the final version of the bill, and this appropriations process would \nhave been subverted and it would have been distorted.\n  This is not an appropriations amendment. We are not talking about an \namount of money to be appropriated for any particular purpose. \nImmigration services are provided, of course, by the Department of \nHomeland Security and apparently the Department feels it ought to have \nflexibility in the administration of that program. We are singling out \nan employment circular to prohibit its effectiveness on an \nappropriations bill. I think it is fairly convoluted.\n  I don't like the process. The Senator from Wyoming comes in and \noffers a modification, which basically requires the Department to \nprovide information on its intentions.\n  It must submit to Congress not later than 60 days before making an \naward.\n\n[[Page S8949]]\n\nThis is an award for providing services under the auspices of the \nBureau of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Before it makes an \naward to someone to provide these services, it has to go through \ncertain steps and make this disclosure to the Congress.\n  It seems to me that this is an appropriate place to at least call \ntime out and let us put this issue on hold and give the Appropriations \nCommittee an opportunity to consider it in conference. We would have to \nresolve the differences between this amendment and this provision in \nthe Senate and the one adopted by the House.\n  I fully support the amendment offered by the Senator from Wyoming.\n  Let me add one other note. The administration submits to the \ncommittee after we write a bill in the Appropriations Committee a \nStatement of Administration Policy. Looking at their Statement of \nAdministration Policy on the bill as reported by our Appropriations \nCommittee, you get down to the bottom of page 2 where it talks about \ncompetitive sourcing, it states:\n\n       The administration has adopted a reasonable and responsible \n     approach for ensuring the fair and effective application of \n     public-private competition. On a government-wide basis, \n     competitions completed in fiscal year 2003 are estimated to \n     generate savings, or cost avoidances, of more than $1 billion \n     over the next 3 to 5 years. The House version of the bill \n     contains a provision that would block DHS from using \n     competition to choose the best public or private sector \n     source to handle basic administrative tasks associated with \n     the processing of immigration applications and benefits. We \n     understand an amendment may be offered on the Senate floor \n     that would also preclude public-private competition and turn \n     back DHS' efforts to significantly improve customer service \n     for immigrants. If the final version of the bill were to \n     contain such a prohibition, the President's senior advisers \n     would recommend that he veto the bill.\n\n  So I can't stand idly by and see this provision be included in the \nbill and risk the veto of this Homeland Security appropriations bill \nthat we have worked very hard to craft, after hearings and hearings, \nand with the good assistance of other Senators on the subcommittee such \nas the distinguished Senator from Vermont. I would hate to see all of \nour work go for naught and have to start over with a vetoed bill.\n  I am urging Senators to vote for the Thomas amendment and let us take \nthis issue to conference and see if it can be resolved in a way that \ngets the bill signed and takes care of the concerns expressed by the \ndistinguished Senator, my very good friend from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I have served for over a quarter of a \ncentury on the Appropriations Committee with the distinguished senior \nSenator from Mississippi. I hope this doesn't hurt him back home when I \ncan state unequivocally that nobody works harder than he does. Nobody \nis more conscientious in going through legislation. I know he has \nworked very hard on the appropriations bill before us. As he knows, I \nhave supported him in the subcommittee on a great deal of measures in \nthis bill. We have similar views.\n  On the question of vetoes, I can remember the last time a piece of \nlegislation I was working on with the White House, saying they would \nveto legislation if we put in the TRICARE provisions to provide health \ncare for our National Guard and Reserve members and their families, \neven at a time when an extraordinary, unprecedented number of National \nGuard and Reserve members were being called up for the war in Iraq and \nwere being required to serve way beyond the time anyone ever \nanticipated. Nobody could understand why the White House would do that \nwhich basically undercuts the brave men and women who are going over \nthere. Fortunately, Republicans and Democrats came together in this \nbody and the other body and passed the legislation with very strong \nbipartisan support and somehow the veto threat disappeared.\n  I suspect the same thing. This bill is not going to be vetoed on this \nissue. I understand the threats. I have been here for 30 years, and I \nhave seen Democratic Presidents and Republican Presidents and \nadministrations. It never comes through the Presidents. It says their \nsenior advisers would recommend a veto threat. I have seen hundreds of \nthese in my 30 years I have been in the Senate. I have probably seen \nabout a dozen vetoes come out of the hundreds and hundreds of threats, \neven though they have been ignored.\n  The distinguished chairman of the subcommittee has a responsibility \nto bring that forward. But he knows, as I do, that we hear veto threats \nalmost as though they were being printed and cranked out when any bill \ncomes along.\n  I think it never would have passed a body as tightly controlled by \nthe Republicans as the House of Representatives, it would never have \npassed with the overwhelming support had they really thought there \nwould be a veto.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the distinguished Senator from \nWisconsin, Mr. Feingold, be added as a cosponsor to my amendment to the \nunderlying amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I would say only this: If the Thomas \namendment is adopted, it effectively kills the Leahy amendment and \nallows the outsourcing to go forward on what is a critical governmental \nresponsibility.\n  As I have said before, I would be happy to see a private enterprise \nstake. As we know, this administration has dramatically increased the \nnumber of Government employees. They went down substantially during the \n8 years of President Clinton's administration, and they have increased \nmore than any time in a dozen years by this administration. Maybe they \ncould look for areas of outsourcing but not outsourcing in those areas \nthat are critical to our lives and our national security and fight \nagainst terrorism.\n  I am perfectly willing to go to a vote on the Thomas amendment, but I \nwould remind everybody that it kills the Leahy-Nelson et al amendment \nand allows at a time of heightened terrorist threat the Department of \nHomeland Security, which dramatically increased the number of \nemployees, to take some very key governmental employees and turn them \nover to the private sector and say the private sector can handle our \nsecurity from terrorists who might try to come in under the immigration \nrubric better than our own Government could do.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, are we going to vote? Fine. I would like \nto be able to make a closing statement pretty much as my friend from \nVermont did.\n  I want you to remember that this is an effort that is being made \nthroughout the Government to try to find a way to be more efficient. It \nis not outsourcing; it is competition; and whoever does the best job \nends up doing this activity.\n  I further remind you that these are not people who make decisions \nwith regard to terrorism. These are the people who do the detail work \nand report to folks who make the decisions.\n  I also remind you that this Department is in the process of doing \nthis now, is willing to come to the Senate as we proceed and report \nwhere they are. This is part of the program that has been ongoing. It \nhas been proven to work. We ought to continue to do it here.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have a situation where an amendment has \nbeen offered. Eventually, there will be a vote on the amendment offered \nby Senator Leahy and Senator Nelson. It may not be tonight. Before this \nbill is finished, they have a right to have their amendment heard, \nwhich it has been, and voted on.\n  Everyone should understand this amendment will not go away. People \nwill vote on outsourcing. That is the way it is. So everyone \nunderstands, there will be another opportunity for Senators Nelson and \nLeahy to offer the amendment. If the majority wants to second-degree \nthe amendment and filibuster their own bill, we would have to do it \nsome other time.\n\n[[Page S8950]]\n\n  We, in good faith offered, an amendment. Time was very limited. These \ntwo men spoke very short periods of time. There are many others who \nwanted to speak, but in the context of what the two leaders said, we \nshould try to move this bill along. We tried to do that. At least we \nshould have an opportunity to vote on these amendments.\n  It appears the majority is attempting to not allow us an opportunity \nto vote on this amendment. And it will happen, sooner or later.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, so there is no illusion about who is \nresponsible for suggesting we have a vote on the Thomas amendment, it \nis me. It is not the majority leader. As the manager of this bill, I \nthink we ought to follow the regular order. The Senator from Vermont \nlaid down an amendment. The Senator from Wyoming offered an amendment \nto the amendment. It is in order.\n  We have had a debate on it. He is entitled to a vote on his \namendment. We ought to have it. If his amendment prevails, then we vote \non the amendment as amended. Nobody is going to filibuster the bill on \nthis side. I am not going to. I am not going to filibuster my own bill \nbecause of this amendment. I want people to understand it is not this \nbig an issue. It is not going to bring down the Senate and block \nconsideration of this bill as far as I am concerned.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I wonder if I might ask the senior distinguished Senator \nfrom Mississippi a question. He has said this matter has to go to \nconference. He is absolutely right. He will hold the majority votes in \nthe conference. Why not this: Why not set both the Thomas amendment as \na freestanding amendment, the Nelson-Leahy, et al, amendment, as a \nfreestanding amendment, take them both to conference?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I will give a quick answer. I am not going to, by \nunanimous consent, deprive any Senator of a right to offer an \namendment. That is what I would be doing if I would, by agreement, say \nthat you can offer an amendment and have a vote on it without any other \nSenator having an opportunity to modify it.\n  That is not in the rules of the Senate. It is inconsistent with the \ntraditions of the institution to do that.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The reason I suggest it is because the Senator from \nWyoming is in the Senate, and it is his amendment. That way he could be \npart of it.\n  The Senator from Mississippi is absolutely right. We go forward with \na vote--I was suggesting a way to save having to put the other \namendment up at another time. It still becomes a matter of conference. \nIf the distinguished Senator from Mississippi wishes to go forward with \nthe vote on the Thomas, that is fine with me.\n  I would state, as I have before, that is a defeat of the underlying \nNelson-Leahy, et al, amendment which will come up in another form at a \nlater time. I am perfectly willing to go ahead and vote now.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the second-degree amendment \noffered by the Senator from Wyoming.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Akaka), the \nSenator from New York (Mrs. Clinton), the Senator from North Carolina \n(Mr. Edwards), and the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) are \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander).

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof myself, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Jeffords, and \nMrs. Feinstein, and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy], for himself, Mr. \n     Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Jeffords, and Mrs. \n     Feinstein, proposes an amendment numbered 3584.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To prohibit funds from being used to process or approve a \n  competition under Office of Management and Budget Circular A-76 for \n   services provided as of June 1, 2004, by certain employees of the \n  Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services of the Department of \n                           Homeland Security)\n\n       At the end of the amendment add the following:\n       Sec. __. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Act \n     none of the funds appropriated by this Act may be used to \n     process or approve a competition under Office of Management \n     and Budget Circular A-76 for services provided as of June 1, \n     2004, by employees (including employees serving on a \n     temporary or term basis) of the Bureau of Citizenship and \n     Immigration Services of the Department of Homeland Security \n     who are known as of that date as Immigration Information \n     Officers, Contact Representatives, or Investigative \n     Assistants. This section shall take effect one day after the \n     date of the bill's enactment.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if I could have the attention of the \nmanagers, we have had the basic debate on this amendment. I ask that we \nhave 2 minutes on each side and then go to a vote, if that is \nagreeable. I will make that request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we have 4 minutes equally divided and \nthat it then be in order to request the yeas and nays and go to a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I do not know what the amendment is. It \nwas sent to the desk. It would be nice to know what it is so we would \nknow whether we should agree to the unanimous consent request to limit \n2 minutes to a side.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I apologize. I thought the distinguished Senator from \nMississippi had been advised of this amendment. It is basically my \nunderlying amendment as freestanding.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. If this is an \namendment that has already been before the Senate and to which an \namendment has been added, is it in order for the Senator to put before \nthe Senate the same amendment as an amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is in order because the amendment is now in \na different posture as a second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I have no objection to the request for \nthe time agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as I said before, the amendment I have \noffered is the same amendment that passed overwhelmingly in the House \nof Representatives, with strong Republican support.\n\n[[Page S8951]]\n\nIt says on these very critical--very critical--steps based in the \nformer INS in which they try to weed out possible terrorists on \nimmigration applications that this not be contracted out to a private \ncompany but be done by professionals. That is really the bottom line. \nWe can talk about it for hours. We have had the debate before.\n  I withhold the remainder of my time, and I will ask for the yeas and \nnays once time is yielded back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time is not yielded back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. We just voted on this same issue. We have voted on it a \ndozen times. What we have here is an effort by this Government to try \nto be more efficient, more cost saving, by having competition. That is \nwhat is involved.\n  Let me say that these immigration information officers are GS-5s, 7s, \nand 8s, with supervisors at the GS-9 level, who perform only first-line \nprocedural processing. They are not performing any ``inherently \ngovernmental'' work. They are not policymakers or regulators. They do \nnot bind the Government to a course of action. This is already underway \nin this administration. They have looked at doing this. Who knows who \nis going to do it more efficiently? We are saying to the Government \nthat you cannot do that. You have to leave things the way they are, and \nwe don't want to have any opportunity to do things better than we have \nbeen doing them. That is what it is all about. I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I strongly urge Senators to vote against the Leahy \namendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, do I have time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 56 seconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we are talking about people who attempt to \ndiscover and prevent immigration fraud, prevent dangerous people from \nabusing the immigration system. This is inherently governmental. We \nhave kept inherently governmental things like law enforcement within \nthe Government. We should do it here with these 1,200 immigration \ninformation officers who contact representatives around the Nation. We \nhave an inherent body of expertise that we need in this fight against \nterrorism.\n  I yield back my remaining time and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  All time is yielded back.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from \nVermont.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Akaka), the \nSenator from New York (Mrs. Clinton), the Senator from North Carolina \n(Mr. Edwards), and the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry), are \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

the House of Representatives \n     that--\n       (1) a system of due process exists whereby aviation \n     passengers determined to pose a threat and either delayed or \n     prohibited from boarding their scheduled flights by the TSA \n     may appeal such decision and correct erroneous information \n     contained in CAPPS II or Secure Flight or other follow on/\n     successor

Madam President, this amendment makes necessary \ntechnical changes in the bill language authorizing the Government \nAccountability Office--GAO--to perform review activities to verify air \ncarriers' calendar year 2000 security costs and makes funds available \nto GAO for this purpose.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3587\n\n  This amendment makes a technical correction to the bill in \nconformance of Public Law 108-271 renaming the General Accounting \nOffice the Government Accountability Office.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3588\n\n  This amendment makes technical corrections to bill language for the \nGovernment Accountability Office to report on the progress of the \nSecure Flight program.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). Without objection, the \namendments are agreed to.\n  The amendments (Nos. 3586 through 3588), en bloc, were agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, while the distinguished manager of the \nbill is in the Chamber, I wonder if the Senator would agree--I talked \nto him personally, but so Senator Byrd knows--that Senator Byrd could \noffer his amendment during morning business in the morning. Would that \nbe appropriate?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, it is certainly OK with me for Senator \nByrd to offer his amendment any time he wants to offer it. We are not \nputting one Senator in front of another. But he is the distinguished \nranking member of the subcommittee, and we would be happy to see him \noffer his amendment when he wants to in the morning.\n  Mr. REID. I would say through the Chair to the distinguished manager \nof the bill that Senator Byrd is planning to be here when morning \nbusiness finishes around 10:30 tomorrow. Our next amendment in order \nwill be that offered by Senators Dodd and Stabenow on first responders. \nThat would be the next one that we would offer, just so the \ndistinguished manager of the bill knows that.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. If it suits Senator Byrd, it suits me. There are some \namendments on the list that we have been reviewing hoping to agree \nthose would be the only amendments in order to the bill. I don't know \nhow close we are to reaching an agreement on that or whether the acting \nleader is empowered to sign off on those agreements. We probably should \nwait until Senator Byrd is here though.\n  Mr. REID. We are working on a list of amendments, and we are not \nready to do it at this time, but maybe tomorrow sometime we could do \nthat. We will do our very best.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I encourage Senators to let us know if \nthey intend to offer an amendment to this bill. We would like to have a \nfinite list of amendments so we can expedite final conclusion of this \nbill tomorrow or as soon as possible.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I have sought recognition to discuss an \namendment which I have been discussing with the manager of the bill \nwhich would allocate $50 million for high-risk organizations as defined \nunder section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code with the priority \nof that $50 million to be determined by the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity. The $50 million figure is firm, and there is no doubt that \nthere will be a need for more than $50 million. This is a start. This \nis a start on the protection of 501(c)(3)s and the discretion of the \nSecretary of Homeland Security is limited to establishing the priority \nfor the use of the $50 million. The Secretary does not have the \nauthority to put up the $50 million. The $50 million will be firm under \nthis amendment, with the discretion of the Secretary to establish the \npriority.\n\n  This amendment, which is currently being reworked, is expected to \nhave $50 million dedicated for assistance to nonprofit organizations as \ndefined under section 501(c)(3) of the IRS Code 1986 which are at high \nrisk of international terrorist attack, with priority funding to be \ndetermined by the Secretary of Homeland Security.\n  An earlier draft of this amendment was to be cosponsored by Senator \nMikulski, Senator Santorum, Senator Murray, Senator Lugar, Senator \nKennedy, and Senator Lieberman, but they are not being added as \ncosponsors at this point because they have to look over the change in \nwordage. But the substantive thrust is exactly the same, to provide $50 \nmillion for these 501(c)(3) institutions which are at high risk.\n  The Director of Central Intelligence has stated that al-Qaida has \nturned its attention to so-called ``soft targets.'' Al-Qaida's \nwillingness to attack soft targets of all kinds has been made readily \napparent with the attacks in the United States, England, Canada, Spain, \nGermany, Iraq, Tunisia, Kenya, Morocco, and Turkey, including an \nInternational Red Cross building, synagogues, train stations, hotels, \nairplanes, restaurants, nightclubs, and cultural and community centers.\n  There is broad national support for this initiative with the \nfollowing organizations illustrative of the support: the American \nAssociation of Homes\n\n[[Page S8953]]\n\nand Services for the Aging; the American Jewish Committee; the American \nJewish Congress; the American Red Cross; the American Society of \nAssociation Executives; the Association of Art Museum Directors; the \nAssociation of Jewish Aging Services of North America; Independent \nSector; National Assembly of Health and Human Service Organizations; \nNational Association of Independent Colleges and Universities; Theater \nCommunications Group; Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations; United \nJewish Communities, representing 155 Jewish federations; the United \nSynagogue of Conservative Judaism; the United Way of America; and the \nYMCA of the United States of America.\n  This assistance would be delivered pursuant to pending legislation \nwhich Senator Mikulski and I have introduced as Senate bill 2275 which \nwas marked up by the Governmental Affairs Committee and is now on the \ndocket of the Senate.\n  I would have waited until tomorrow to make this presentation, but I \nwill be traveling with President Bush in Pennsylvania so I will not be \nhere to offer the amendment. The amendment has been discussed, as I \nsay, with the manager. I believe it is going to be accepted, but it \ncannot be offered at the present moment because the senior Senator from \nWest Virginia, Senator Byrd, has an amendment which he intends to offer \nwhich is broader in scope and, if enacted, may well cover this \namendment. It is hard always to say what is going to happen if any \namendment is offered in the future, but in the event the Byrd amendment \nis not accepted, then this amendment will be offered.\n  To repeat, I think it will be acceptable to the managers; however, no \ncommitments were made. If the Byrd amendment is not accepted, or voted \nfor and adopted, this amendment may still be in order, depending on the \nprecise language of the amendment to be offered by Senator Byrd.\n  I wanted to lay out the provisions. It is very important that \nchurches, synagogues, YMCAs, and other religious institutions have some \nspecified protection under this Homeland Security bill.\n  The authorizing legislation which Senator Mikulski and I produced has \nbeen marked up and approved by the Governmental Affairs Committee. It \nauthorizes some $100 million. But in discussions with the manager, the \n$50 million figure appears to be acceptable. We want to proceed on that \nbasis.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Maritime Patrol Aircraft Requirements\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I seek recognition for the purpose of \nengaging Senator Cochran, Chairman of the Homeland Security \nAppropriations Subcommittee, in a discussion on the U.S. Coast Guard's \nDeepwater program.\n  The chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Cochran, has the good \nfortune of representing a coastal State on the Gulf of Mexico very \nsimilar in geography to my State of Alabama. The chairman is an \noutstanding steward and supporter of the United States Coast Guard and \nin particular the ongoing Deepwater modernization program in the Coast \nGuard. This bill addresses numerous issues related to Deepwater and I \nappreciate the chairman's support and leadership on this vital issue to \nevery coastal State, as well as the Nation.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Senator from Alabama for his kind words. He \nis both a colleague and a neighbor to my State of Mississippi. As \nneighbors, our two States have a strong appreciation for a strong and \ncapable Coast Guard.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I note that this bill contains a provision to address a \ncontinuing issue of concern over the provision of Maritime Patrol \nAircraft assets for the United States Coast Guard. Last year, the \nchairman wisely and judiciously included funding in his bill for a \nthird Maritime Patrol Aircraft. This year, the subcommittee bill \nincludes a total of $15.25 million for the Maritime Patrol Aircraft \nrequirement. This amount, together with available balances from \nprevious appropriated funds for maritime patrol purposes, will enable \nthe Coast Guard to place the third CN-235 Maritime Patrol Aircraft \nunder contract and to fund long-lead items for the next series of CN-\n235 aircraft to be purchased, thereby reducing the cost of these next \naircraft.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. As the Senator from Alabama is well aware, the Coast \nGuard has been moving slowly on the Maritime Patrol Aircraft \nModernization pending a review of their requirements for specific types \nof aircraft throughout the Coast Guard. I am very sensitive to the \nSenator's concerns with this slow pace of Maritime Patrol Aircraft \nmodernization. I would say to the Senator, that I firmly believe and am \ncommitted to the Coast Guard's modernization effort under the Deepwater \nprogram, which includes the Maritime Patrol Aircraft requirement.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I thank the chairman for his support for the Maritime \nPatrol Aircraft and the recognition of the importance of the CN-235 to \nthe Coast Guard's mission requirement to achieve maritime domain \nawareness through aerial surveillance. Clearly, the security of the \nUnited States is improved through any effective means to push our \nborders farther out and extend our zone of security. The CN-235 is one \nsuch effective method of extending our borders.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I share the Senator's assessment that the extension of \nour maritime surveillance is critical to our security interests. The \nCoast Guard selected the CN-235 as the optimal solution for the \nMaritime Patrol Aircraft mission and I continually encourage the \nCommandant to aggressively pursue the modernization of all assets to \naddress the mission needs of the Coast Guard. It is clear that the \nMaritime Patrol Aircraft requirement has been delayed due to the Coast \nGuard review and I support any expedited effort to ensure that the \nlong-term maritime patrol mission requirement is addressed.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I thank the Senator for his time and attention and I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, the pending Department of Homeland \nSecurity appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2005, S. 2537 as reported \nby the Senate Committee on Appropriations provides $32.867 billion in \nbudget authority and $30.736 billion in outlays in Fiscal Year 2005 for \nthe Department of Homeland Security. Of these totals, $867 million is \nfor mandatory programs in Fiscal Year 2005.\n  The bill provides total discretionary budget authority in Fiscal Year \n2005, of $32 billion. This amount is $1.05 billion more than the \nPresident's request, it matches the 302(b) allocations adopted by the \nSenate Appropriations Committee, and is $2.812 billion more than Fiscal \nYear 2004 enacted levels excluding Fiscal Year 2004 supplemental \nappropriations.\n  I commend the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee \nfor bringing this legislation before the Senate. I ask unanimous \nconsent that a table displaying the Budget Committee scoring of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            H.R. 4567, 2005 HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS\n    [Spending comparisons--Senate-reported bill (Fiscal Year 2005, $\n                               millions)]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                            General\n                                            purpose  Mandatory    Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill:\n  Budget authority.......................    32,000        867    32,867\n  Outlays................................    29,729        863    30,952\nSenate committee allocation:\n  Budget authority.......................    32,000        867    32,867\n  Outlays................................    29,873        863    30,736\n2004 Enacted:\n  Budget authority.......................    29,188      1,020    30,208\n  Outlays................................    26,771        850    27,621\nPresident's request:\n  Budget authority.......................    30,950        867    31,817\n  Outlays................................    28,990        863    29,853\nHouse-passed bill:\n  Budget authority.......................    32,000        867    32,867\n  Outlays................................    29,813        863    30,676\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                    SENATE REPORTED BILL COMPARED AT:\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority.......................  ........  .........  ........\n  Outlays................................      -144  .........      -144\n2004 Enacted:\n  Budget authority.......................     2,812       -153     2,659\n  Outlays................................     2,958         13     2,971\nPresident's request:\n  Budget authority.......................     1,050  .........     1,050\n  Outlays................................       739  .........       739\nHouse-passed bill:\n  Budget authority.......................  ........  .........  ........\n  Outlays................................       -84  .........       -84\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to \nspeak for 15 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S8954]]\n\n                          Intelligence Reform\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Madam President, there are now fewer than 72 \nhours from this hour, on this Wednesday afternoon, until we observe the \nthird anniversary of the terrorist attacks on this Nation when 19 \nhijackers took control of commercial airliners, converted them into \nweapons, and struck the symbols of our economic and military might.\n  When the House and Senate Intelligence Committees began the Joint \nInquiry into the attacks of September 11, the first witness we called \nin public session was Kristen Breitweiser. Kristen's husband Ronald, \nwho worked in the World Trade Center, was one of the 3,000 innocent \nlives lost that day. In his memory, she helped found the family group \nSeptember 11th Advocates.\n  In her brave testimony, she described her husband's last words to \nher. She described her daughter placing flowers on an empty grave. On \nher right hand, she was wearing her husband's wedding band--charred, \nscratched, but intact--recovered from Ground Zero with a part of her \nhusband's left arm.\n  Her testimony was deeply moving. Her closing words presented a call \nto action. This is what she said:\n\n       All we have are tears and a resolve to find the answers \n     because we continue to look into the eyes of our young \n     children who ask us why.\n       We have an obligation as parents and as a nation to provide \n     these innocent children with answers as to why their mother \n     or father never returned home from work that day.\n       We need people to be held accountable for their failures.\n       We need leaders with the courage to take responsibility for \n     what went wrong.\n       Mistakes were made and too many lives were lost.\n       We must investigate these errors so that they will never \n     happen again.\n       It is our responsibility as a nation to turn the dark \n     events of September 11th into something from which we can all \n     learn and grow, so that we, as a nation, can look forward to \n     a safe future.\n\n  As we debate the scope of reforms of our intelligence community, I \nhope we will keep in mind the challenge laid down by Kristen \nBreitweiser and the others whose lives have been touched by this \ntragedy.\n  Today, and over the next several days, I want to discuss with my \ncolleagues the question of whether we have met her challenge. I, for \none, do not believe we have. And then we need to look at the question \nof where do we go from here?\n  I will start my discussion this evening with a look at the history of \nour intelligence efforts and what that history tells us about the \nchallenge of the future.\n  While America has understood the utility of intelligence since Paul \nRevere's midnight ride from Boston to Lexington, warning that the \nBritish were coming, America has never embraced intelligence. It was \ncontrary to a nation that had fought a 7-year war to secure liberty \nfrom the very things that were the stock and trade of King George III's \nintelligence gathering: the late night knock on the door to separate a \nhusband, father, or son from a frightened family; the use of torture to \ndiscover the rebellious plans of patriots; the clandestine search of \nprivate effects without notice or permission.\n  So it is of little surprise that the United States was the last \nadvanced nation in the world to establish a permanent civilian \nintelligence agency--not until 1947--and that came only after two world \nwars when we realized that a new era--the cold war--was dawning.\n  When the Berlin Wall came down, the Soviet Union dissolved and the \ncold war ended, we had lost our single clear enemy, and our \nintelligence capabilities were allowed to wither.\n  There was no reliable and consistent source of funding for \nintelligence agencies, and the agencies failed to anticipate and adapt \nto the new threats of the 21st century.\n  That is clear from what we have come to know about the attacks of \nSeptember 11. All Americans now realize that in this new world, an \nattack can come not only from an army of an enemy, but also in the form \nof a boat, a backpack, or a vial.\n  Now all Americans realize that intelligence has become a crucial \nshield, an evermore integral part of our national and personal \nsecurity.\n  In this century, effective intelligence will be more important than \nit has ever been to this Nation for six reasons.\n\n  First, our adversary is different from any we have engaged in the \npast. It is not a nation but a tribe of tribes united by an ideology. \nThe terrorists are not constrained by the global standards and values \nof the West but are instead a foe for which death and an afterlife in \nparadise are the highest goals of life. To know this enemy is essential \nto defeating this enemy, and Americans will be dependent on effective \nintelligence to gain that knowledge.\n  Second, we learned on September 11 that the Atlantic and Pacific are \nnot the protective barriers to our domestic security they have been in \nthe past.\n  Our new enemy was capable of insinuating 19 or more of its trained \nkillers into our Nation, where they were able to refine a plan, \npractice and execute the most deadly attack on the continental United \nStates in our history, and to do all of that in anonymity.\n  America will look to alert intelligence to do what two oceans can no \nlonger do: protect us here at home.\n  Third, America can no longer abide by the rule of never striking \nfirst, waiting only until we have been acted upon. The consequences of \nwaiting for threats to gather is too risky. But to be anticipatory, to \nbe preemptive, requires the highest quality of intelligence, or we risk \nsomething else--the loss of lives of soldiers and civilians and the \nloss of our global credibility.\n  If we are to adhere to a doctrine of preemption, we have to be \ncertain we know what it is we are preempting. We cannot afford to be \ndeceived, manipulated, or blinded by ideology, as we have been in Iraq, \nor to waste time and resources fighting threats that are not real.\n  Fourth, sound intelligence will enhance our long-term security. \nAmerica's political, economic, and security interests now span the \nglobe. A vigilant intelligence community will alert us to emerging \nthreats against our interests beyond the homeland. Through both \nstrategic and actionable intelligence, we will be better able to \nconfront terrorist threats abroad before those threats materialize at \nhome.\n  But we face threats beyond terrorism--most especially the spread of \nweapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons. Accurate and \nactionable intelligence is absolutely necessary if we are able to make \nwhat many think is inevitable, an attack in the United States by \nterrorists with nuclear weapons, preventable.\n  Fifth, effective intelligence is important to maintaining our \ninternational relationships. Success in the 21st century will require \nalliances with nations that share our vision and our values, if not our \nviews on all subjects. Credible information upon which wise judgments \ncan be founded must be the bedrock of those alliances.\n  Sixth and finally, with better intelligence, our Nation and its \nleaders will be more able to focus on the challenges of the future \nrather than the failures of the past. The pace of technological change \nwill only continue to accelerate, and the rising tide of globalization \nwill lead to a new and complex web of relationships between state and \nnonstate actors. Better intelligence will help us keep up with the pace \nof change as we continue to identify new challenges.\n  For all of these reasons, in the 21st century, intelligence will have \na role to play in almost every way we seek to provide greater security \nat home and advance our interests abroad.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Madame President, there are times in history when one \nperson can and does make a difference.\n  The recent death of Sally Kabisch reminded me of one such person and \none particular period of time.\n  Sally Kabisch dedicated herself to a remarkable career of \nconservation. She worked at various times as a grassroots organizer and \nadvocate for conservation efforts in Nevada, California and Alaska.\n  One of Sally's great achievements was in Nevada.\n  Perhaps more than any other citizen, Sally is responsible for \nNevada's Forest Service Wilderness bill, which I had the opportunity to \npass through Congress in 1989.\n  From 1986 until President Bush signed the Nevada Wilderness Act on \nDecember 5, 1909, Sally was an indomitable and ever-optimistic force \nfor protecting wild places in Nevada.\n  She worked doggedly to build support for wilderness. She organized, \nshe advocated, and she traveled.\n  As she worked to pass that law, she was patient, positive, \nenthusiastic, stubborn and determined.\n  As her friend and another great advocate for Nevada's outdoors, Marge \nSill, says, ``she was a constant inspiration to all of us.''\n  Sally's husband Tom Kizzia and her children Emily and Ethan know what \nthe rest of us should remember: One person can make a difference.\n  Sally was one person who made a great difference. Nevada and America \nare better and wilder for it, forever.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/08/senate-section/article/S8955-3", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8955]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             INTERNATIONAL MARIACHI CONFERENCE AND FESTIVAL\n\n  Mr. REID.

For performers, such as the \nmembers of Mariachi Cobre, Mariachi Los Arrieros del Valle, and the \nClark County School District Mariachi Task Force, the event will offer \nan opportunity to promote their culture and showcase their musical \ntalents.\n  I salute Mr. Trujillo, Ms. Neal, and the Clark County School District \non establishing the International Mariachi Conference and Festival, and \nextend my best wishes that this event will enjoy a successful future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/08/senate-section/article/S8955-4", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8955-S8956]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH.

Private First Class \nSkinner courageously gave his life on August 26, 2004, in support of \nOperation Iraqi Freedom when he was shot during a heavy exchange of \ngunfire in Najaf, Iraq. Private First Class Skinner is survived by his \nfather Randy Skinner, his mother Laura Hamann, his older brother James \nand his younger sister Stephanie. This brave young soldier was only 20 \nyears old. In his short life he made a lasting impression on his \nfriends, family and fellow soldiers.\n  I ask my colleagues in the Senate and my fellow Americans to join me \ntoday in paying tribute to my fellow Iowan, Private First Class \nSkinner, for his sacrifice on behalf of our country. My deepest \nsympathy goes out to his family and friends. Private First Class \nSkinner was a great man that dedicated himself to his duty as a \nsoldier. Private First Class Skinner told his grandmother that he \njoined the Marines because ``They're over there fighting for me and my \ncountry, I want to go over there and fight for you and my country.'' \nPrivate First Class Skinner is the example of a fine man and a strong \nsoldier. I salute him for his sense of duty and his service to the \nAmerican people.\n  We can all be proud of this extraordinary soldier. He did not die in \nvain, but died for his country that he loved to serve. Private First \nClass Skinner has entered the ranks of our Nation's greatest patriots. \nHe will always be honored as a hero who gave the ultimate sacrifice for \nliberty.

Madam President, I take this opportunity to congratulate \nall of the athletes who competed in the 2004 Summer Olympic Games in \nAthens, Greece. The Olympic Games celebrate years of training, struggle \nand perseverance in overcoming obstacles and striving to become the \nbest. It was wonderful to see so many athletes from across the globe \ncome together in peaceful competition.\n  Greece did a tremendous job of hosting the Games. The scenery was \nbreathtaking, and the venues were spectacular. These Games were \nespecially notable because of the return of the Olympics to its \nbirthplace in Greece. The historic legacy of Greece was particularly \nnoteworthy for the marathon competitors who began their journey in the \nancient city of Marathon, the original location of the event, and for \nthe shot-put competitors who competed in the original Olympic stadium \nin Olympia.\n  Over a 16-day span, the Olympic spirit was embodied by the athletic \nprowess and grace displayed by the best athletes our country has to \noffer, including many from Michigan. Michigan continued our long \ntradition of contributing world-class athletes to both the Summer and \nWinter Olympic Games with athletes competing in 13 different sports in \nthis year's Games. It was inspiring to witness their total effort, and \nin many cases, the realization of their dreams. There are legions of \nyoung athletes who watched these Games and will continue to dream and \nstrive to one day represent their country with the same pride, grace \nand determination that was on display at these Games.\n  I am particularly proud of the 28 individuals from Michigan who \ncompeted for the United States in the 2004 Athens Olympics. All of the \nathletes on Team USA achieved amazing feats to qualify for these Games. \nThe Michigan Olympians included Martin Boonzaayer in judo; Tim Broe in \ntrack and field; Swin Cash in basketball; Tara Cunningham in \nweightlifting; Andre Dirrell in boxing; Kate Johnson in rowing; Kara \nLynn Joyce in swimming; Klete Keller in swimming; Dan Ketchum in \nswimming; Rachel Komisarz in swimming; Kate MacKenzie in rowing; Tom \nMalchow in swimming; Kate Markgraf in soccer; Jamie Nieto in track and \nfield; Carly Piper in swimming; Andy Potts in the triathalon; Jasna \nReed in table tennis; Ruth Riley in basketball; Dathan Ritzenhein in \ntrack and field; Artour Samsonov in rowing; Jeff Smoke in canoe/kayak; \nDaryl Szarenski in shooting; Sheila Taormina in the triathalon; Lindsay \nTarpley in soccer; Paul Terek in track and field; Peter Vanderkaay in \nswimming; Steve Warner in rowing; and Lauryn Williams in track and \nfield. This outstanding group of athletes brought honor to our State \nand Nation and accounted for a total of 15 medals for the United \nStates: eight gold, five silver, and two bronze.\n  In addition, competing at these Games were nine other athletes with \nties to Michigan: Michael Phelps in swimming, who will be attending the \nUniversity of Michigan, U of M; Alan Webb in track and field, who \nattended the U of M; and Venus Williams in tennis, who lived in \nMichigan, competed for Team USA. In addition, six athletes with \nMichigan ties competed for other countries: Courtney Babcock for Canada \nin track and field; Carlos Delfino for Argentina in basketball; Chris \nDemetral for Greece in baseball; Andrew Hurd for Canada in swimming; \nKevin Sullivan for Canada in track and field; and Nick Willis for New \nZealand in track and field.\n  Every two years we watch the Summer and Winter Games to catch a \nglimpse of these extraordinary athletes' struggles and successes. An \nOlympian's life is about sacrifice, about showing up to grueling \npractices day after day, about working hard to become the best in the \nworld. It was riveting to watch these Games unfold. In Athens, as is \nthe case in every Olympiad, there were many amazing moments that will \nresonate in our minds for years to come. Let me take a moment to \nhighlight a few of them.\n  Representing the WNBA Champion Detroit Shock on the gold medal \nwinning women's basketball team were Ruth Riley and Swin Cash. The \nwomen won the gold medal by going unbeaten, increasing their Olympic \nwinning streak to an incredible 25 games. Another notable achievement \nwas accomplished by Andre Dirrell of Flint, who won a bronze medal in \nthe middleweight division in boxing. Dirrell showed the heart of a \nchampion as one of only two U.S. boxers to win a medal in these Games.\n  First-time Olympian Lauryn Williams of Detroit won the silver medal \nin the 100-meter sprint. In an extremely close race, Williams edged out \na Jamaican runner to finish with the silver and a personal best time. \nIn addition, Kate Johnson, from the U of M, won a silver medal as part \nof the women's eight rowing team. The team set a world record in one of \ntheir preliminary heats en route to winning their medal.\n  On the soccer field, the U.S. women's team took the gold medal with \nan extremely thrilling 2 to 1 overtime victory over Brazil. Michigan \nresidents Kate Markgraf and Lindsay Tarpley helped the team achieve \nthis victory over the tough Brazilian team. Tarpley, a midfielder from \nKalamazoo, tallied one assist against Greece and scored the first goal \nin the gold medal match against Brazil. Markgraf of Bloomfield Hills, \nstarting in all six games as a defender, helped her team remain \nundefeated. This was her second time representing the United States in \nthe Olympics.\n  Another heart pounder came in the men's 4x200 meter freestyle \nswimming relay. The U.S. men's team, which included Peter Vanderkaay \nfrom Royal Oak, Klete Keller from Ann Arbor, U of M alumnus Dan Ketchum \nand future Wolverine Michael Phelps, held off a strong Australian team \nto win the gold and set an American record. In addition to this golden \nperformance, Keller won the bronze medal in the 400-meter freestyle, \nand Michael Phelps won an additional five gold and two bronze medals to \nestablish himself as one of the stars of this or any Olympiad.\n  For the women's swim team, Kara Lynn Joyce from Ann Arbor won a \nsilver medal as a part of the 4x100 meter medley relay team. \nAdditionally, Joyce, along with teammate Rachel Komisarz from Warren, \nwon a silver medal in the 4x100 meter freestyle relay. Another victory \nwas secured by the women's 4x200 meter freestyle relay team, which \nincluded Komisarz and Carly Piper from Grosse Pointe Woods who swam in \nthe finals. In the finals, the U.S. women broke the world record.\n  The athletes with Michigan ties who represented other countries had \nmany\n\n[[Page S8957]]\n\nnotable achievements as well. Second baseman and Troy resident Chris \nDemetral, a Greek American, assisted the Greek baseball team to a 7th \noverall finish. In men's basketball, Carlos Delfino, who was drafted by \nthe World Champion Detroit Pistons in 2003 and will be joining the team \nthis year, competed for the Argentinean Olympic team.\n  Our athletes were supported by a great number of coaches and staff \nwho made their success in the Games possible. The coaches with ties to \nMichigan include Bob Bowman of the U of M in swimming; Larry Brown of \nthe Detroit Pistons in basketball; Todd Dagenais of Michigan State \nUniversity in volleyball; Steven Fraser from the U of M in wrestling; \nKevin Jackson from Jackson in wrestling; Al Mitchell of Northern \nMichigan University in boxing, and Jon Urbanchek of the U of M in \nswimming. In addition to the coaching staff, three U of M alumni were \ninvolved in the administration of the Games. Jeffrey Benz is the \ncurrent general counsel and Abigail Tompkins is a member of the United \nStates Olympic Committee, USOC. Thomas Miller is the current United \nStates Ambassador to Greece. All of these individuals worked tirelessly \nto assist the athletes in their pursuit of greatness at these Games.\n  I know I speak for all Michiganians in expressing appreciation and \ncongratulations to all of the Michigan athletes, coaches, and \nadministrators who took part in the 2004 Summer Olympic Games. The \nGames last a few short weeks, but the memories will be ingrained in the \nminds of all who saw them and shared vicariously in the efforts of \nthese great athletes. For their commitment, drive and competitive \nspirit, I congratulate all the athletes of the 2004 Olympic Games, but \nit is with particular pride that I salute the athletes and coaches from \nMichigan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/08/senate-section/article/S8957-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8957]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           2004 OLYMPIC GAMES\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I am sure that my colleagues will join \nme in congratulating the American athletes who competed in the 2004 \nOlympic Games in Athens, Greece.\n  The Olympics have a rich history, with records dating the first \nOlympic Games to 776 B.C. in Olympia, Greece. The early athletic \ncontests allowed youths to highlight their physical prowess, with \nvictory reflecting well upon the competitor's home city. The modern \nOlympic Games have endured for over a century, through times of war and \npeace, and this year, the Olympics returned to its origins.\n  The symbols of the Games--the motto, the flames, the rings--carry \nimportant meanings. The Olympic motto ``citius--altius--fortius'', \nwhich is Latin for ``faster--higher--stronger'' encourages all to \nstrive to achieve their personal best. The Olympic flame, lit by the \nsun's rays in Olympia and passed around the world, burns bright while \nthe competitions continue. The five Olympic rings represent the five \ncontinents, interwoven to demonstrate the universality of the Games.\n  Being an Olympian is a tremendous honor, and I commend the many \nathletes who represented our Nation well. America's 2004 Olympians are \nsome of the finest athletes in the world. Dedicated to their sport, \nthese individuals often devote years of their lives to training for the \nultimate experience of competing in the Olympics. All competed well, \nand their hard efforts were rewarded as a remarkable 103 medals were \nearned by Americans in Athens.\n  I would like to particularly recognize the Olympians from my home \nState of Wisconsin. Fifteen athletes competing in the 2004 Olympic \ngames have ties to Wisconsin, and I am proud of their efforts. These 15 \nathletes traveled to Athens to compete in a variety of sporting events, \nevents that ranged from rowing to gymnastics to the modern pentathlon. \nIt is my honor to recognize these fine competitors from Wisconsin:\n  Chris Ahrens. A graduate of Whitefish Bay High School and two-time \nOlympian, Chris earned a gold medal this year as a member of the men's \neight rowing team.\n  Deirdre Demet-Barry. A seven-time national cycling champion \noriginally from Milwaukee, Deirdre competed in women's cycling while in \nAthens.\n  Rebecca Giddens. A kayaker since age 10, this Green Bay native earned \nthe bronze medal in the women's K1 flat kayak slalom.\n  James Gruenwald. Originally hailing from Greendale, James competed in \nhis second Olympics in the men's Greco-Roman wrestling competition.\n  Dennis Hall. A proud cheesehead and Plover resident, Dennis competed \nin the men's Greco-Roman wrestling for his third Olympics.\n  Paul Hamm. A native of Waukesha, Paul won gold and silver medals in \nmen's gymnastics events in his second Olympic Games.\n  Morgan Hamm. As a member of the U.S. men's gymnastics team, this \nWaukesha native helped lead the team to a silver medal.\n  Ben Holbrook. Ben is originally from Hartland and competed in the \nMen's quadruple sculls rowing competition in Athens.\n  Beau Hoopman. Raised in Plymouth, Beau rowed at the University of \nWisconsin and won a gold medal in Athens with the men's eight rowing \nteam..\n  Mary Beth Larsen-Iagorashvili. A graduate of Mukwonago High School \nwho attended Marquette University, Mary Beth competed in the women's \nmodern pentathlon.\n  Garrett Lowney. Athens was the second Olympic Games at which this \nFreedom resident competed in men's Greco-Roman wrestling.\n  Erin Mirabella. Erin, a native of Racine and former student at UW-\nParkside, won the bronze medal for her performance in women's track \ncycling.\n  Jeff Nygaard. Jeff showed his Wisconsin roots when he named Brett \nFavre as a favorite athlete. From Madison, Jeff competed in men's beach \nvolleyball.\n  Andrew Rock. A student at UW-La Crosse, Andrew won a gold medal as a \nmember of the men's 1,600 meter relay in Athens.\n  Matt Smith. A graduate of the University of Wisconsin, Matt currently \nserves our country as an infantry captain for the U.S. Army. He \ncompeted as a rower in the men's lightweight four.\n  Neil Walker. A swimmer originally from Verona, Neil earned two \nOlympic medals--a bronze in the men's 4 x 100 freestyle relay and a \ngold medal in the men's 4 x 100 medley relay.\n  Mike Wherley.

Mr. President, I rise today to say thank you \non behalf of the millions of citizens of my State who have been \naffected by the incredible events of the last month.\n  Thank you to all of the State and local officials who took quick and \ndecisive actions that saved many lives. Thank you to the first \nresponders who helped citizens evacuate and continued working to keep \npeople safe throughout these major storms. Thank you to the thousands \nof volunteers from the Red Cross, who staffed hundreds of shelters that \nserved as the only safe haven for many Floridians. Thank you to the \nprofessionals from FEMA and the Small Business Administration, who \nactivated immediately and began to respond in a manner I have not \nwitnessed before.\n  I did a workday as a hurricane recovery volunteer in Port Charlotte, \nFL, on August 31, assisting Red Cross volunteers to distribute midday \nmeals to people who were still without power and then going door-to-\ndoor with FEMA workers for follow-up damage assessments. I was moved by \nthe gratitude on the faces of people fighting to\n\n[[Page S8958]]\n\nrecover some degree of normalcy in their lives, even as they face \ndaunting odds--roofs open to the sky, shattered windows, no air \nconditioning, their possessions scattered and broken.\n  Every June 1, the citizens in my State prepare for another hurricane \nseason. Some have lived in Florida all their lives and are very well \nversed in hurricane procedures. Some are new residents and have never \nbeen through a large storm. Nothing, however, could have prepared \nFloridians for the recent series of devastating events which started \nwith Tropical Storm Bonnie striking the panhandle in early August, \nfollowed by Hurricane Charley crashing into Florida's west coast on \nAugust 13, and continued with Hurricane Frances attacking the entire \nState this past weekend. Now we are tracking Hurricane Ivan, which is \nagain headed in our direction.\n  It is remarkable that these massive storms, which impacted nearly all \nof the 67 counties in the State of Florida, have caused only 29 \nconfirmed fatalities. Hurricane Charley, a category 4 storm with winds \nin excess of 135 miles per hour, and Hurricane Frances, a category 2 \nstorm with winds near 100 miles per hour, could have been much \ndeadlier. However, while human losses were mercifully low, Florida's \ninfrastructure suffered greatly.\n  Now we must move forward and look toward cleaning up and rebuilding \nour homes and businesses. I applaud the Senate's quick approval of \nsupplemental appropriations of $2 billion in emergency assistance \nthrough both FEMA and the Small Business Administration. After \nresponding to these major events in my State as well as the recent \ntropical storm in Virginia, FEMA is stretched extremely thin and needs \nan influx of funds to keep operations up and running and planning for \nthe long-term recovery.\n\n  In the last three weeks alone, FEMA has issued over $100 million in \nindividual assistance funds to Florida residents. Over $2.7 million of \nthat has already been allocated for Hurricane Frances' victims, while \nthe storm is still moving up the Eastern seaboard. The SBA has already \napproved over $23 million in disaster loans from Charley and with a \nfiling deadline for assistance extended until October 12, 2004, we \nexpect that number to increase exponentially.\n  The supplemental appropriations bill passed yesterday is only the \nfirst installment of badly needed funds for recovery. We must get an \naccurate assessment of the damage and determine the appropriate amount \nof funding needed and the appropriate Federal agencies to assist \nspecific sectors of the State in rebuilding.\n  The physical infrastructure needs must be determined. How much damage \ndid the road network suffer? Early estimates from Charley alone total \nover $65 million for the Federal-aid system. Several Florida airports \nsustained major damage, which totals nearly $34 million. These are just \na few quick estimates. Across the board, we need to determine the \nextent of damage to Florida's infrastructure from both Charley and \nFrances--the highway and transit network, airports, seaports and \nschools.\n  Additionally, our Florida growers have been devastated. Early \nestimates top $225 million in citrus losses for Charley alone, with \nover 40 percent of the citrus crop lost. It is too early to tell, but \nlosses from Frances could top $800 million. The crop insurance program \nwill not be able to cover losses of this magnitude. Congress must step \nin to help Florida farmers.\n  These examples are just a small snapshot of the needs of our State. \nAs we determine the amount of damage in other areas, we will need to \nappropriate funds for other Federal agencies, such as Army Corps of \nEngineers, Housing and Urban Development, Health and Human Services, \nDepartment of Defense, NASA and others.\n  We must move quickly to put together an accurate assessment of the \nimpact that these storms have had on the State of Florida and respond \nto this need with adequate Federal funding. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues in the coming days to achieve this goal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/08/senate-section/article/S8958-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8958]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              THE BENIGNO FAMILY AND BRAIN INJURY RESEARCH\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nBenigno family of Clifton, NJ, for their tireless efforts to advance \nthe cause of brain injury research.\n  Nearly 20 years ago, Dennis and Rosalind Benigno's 15-year-old son, \nDennis John, was struck by a car while walking home from a football \nphysical. Dennis John suffered severe, long-term brain injuries in the \naccident. Now 34, Dennis John cannot walk or talk. He communicates with \nhis eyes and laughter, and seems to understand when his parents talk to \nhim. Dennis and Rosalind have made a life of caring for their injured \nson.\n  Their personal tragedy, however, is not the end of the story. Mr. \nBenigno has turned tragedy into action. He has been a passionate \nadvocate on behalf of his son raising awareness and promoting research \nefforts that offer the prospect of a cure for traumatic brain injury. \nThe Benignos founded the Coalition for Brain Injury Research, which has \ndonated more than $125,000 in the past 2 years to the study of brain \ncell repair. They raise funds through walkathons and a lectures series, \nand Mr. Benigno has traveled throughout the country for research \ndollars.\n  Mr. Benigno has also turned to his elected representatives in New \nJersey and Washington, DC. His efforts have led to the creation of the \nCongressional Brain Injury Task Force, cochaired by my good friend \nCongressman Bill Pascrell. For the last 6 years, Mr. Benigno has also \nlobbied local, State, and Federal legislators to support legislation \nthat would create a dedicated source of funding for medical research \ninto traumatic brain injuries.\n  His work has begun to pay off. On January 2 of this year, Governor \nMcGeevy signed the Brain Injury Research Act into law. With this \nlegislation, New Jersey becomes the first State in the Nation to create \na funding stream for researchers devising treatments and cures for \nbrain injuries. The act is expected to raise more than $3 million a \nyear for brain injury research from a $1 surcharge on motor vehicle \npenalties.\n  Dennis John is one of more than 5.3 million Americans who currently \nsuffer disabilities from brain injury, according to the Centers for \nDisease Control, CDC. Every year, 200,000 people sustain brain \ninjuries, a number that exceeds the incidence of HIV/AIDS and breast \ncancer. Right now, there is no cure. In fact, brain injuries are the \nonly catastrophic illness for which scientists have yet to readily \nidentify a cure as their research goal. The Brain Injury Research Act, \nfinally, offers hope to the hundreds of thousands who suffer from brain \ninjuries that an effective therapy may be in sight.\n  While religious authorities, ethics scholars, and we here in the \nhalls of government continue to debate the implications of stem and \nfetal cell research, the Benigno's remain focused on one thing--\nsupporting the research efforts that may find a cure for their son and \nothers like him. As we make decisions that have the power to spark or \nextinguish the hopes of millions that the cures they pray for may be \nfound, we should keep the Benignos in mind.\n  One point is very clear--this new law and the hope it nurtures are a \ncredit to Mr. Benigno's dedication, courage, and perseverance. He is an \ninspiration to all of us, and a testament to what one determined \ncitizen can achieve in our democracy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/08/senate-section/article/S8958-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8958-S8959]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n        HONORING THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE LOUISVILLE STUNNERS\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

Madam President, today I give thanks to the \nmembers of my National Parks Committee in Delaware for all of their \nefforts, time, and dedication in attempting to establish a national \npark in Delaware.\n  Delaware is the only State that does not have a national park, \nnational monument, national historic site or any other unit of the \nNational Park Service. It is through the hard work of the members of \nthis committee that we have narrowed down the search in recommending \nthe first national park in the First State.\n  I began the process of trying to establish a national park in 2002. \nMy staff and I took suggestions from the public via surveys, a web \npoll, and phone calls. We received hundreds of responses, and \nsuggestions ranged from Fort DuPont to Cape Henlopen State Park to the \nUnderground Railroad to the World War II Towers. After several months \nof hearing what the public recommended, I established the National \nParks Committee in 2003.\n  The committee was comprised of 12 people, including Dr. James Soles, \nthe head of the committee, Dr. Wilma Mishoe, Ms. Norma Lee Derrickson, \nthe Honorable John Schroeder, Mr. O. Francis Biondi, Mr. Ernst \nDannemann, Dr. Linda Johnson-Gilliam, Ms. Jane Richter, Ms. Maria \nMatos, Mr. Ruly Carpenter, Mr. Bill Powers and Mr. Edwin Mongan III. \nFor several months, the members met and discussed extensively each of \nthe suggestions offered by the public. They held workshops in each \ncounty whereby the public could attend, participate and offer \nsuggestions. They took a tour of the proposed sites to determine which \nlocation would make the best national park.\n  After months of deliberation, the committee came to its final \nrecommendation: the creation of ``The Delaware National Coastal \nHeritage Park.'' This National Park would memorialize the rich and \ndiverse history of Delaware's coastal areas, bringing that history and \nrelated attractions into sharp focus for area residents and visitors \nalike.\n  This park would be unique among national parks in both its physical \ndimensions and its theme. Physically, the park would be comprised of a \nseries of four interpretive centers. The centers would largely direct \nvisitors to already existing attractions related to the theme of the \npark--that is that Delaware's coastal region is comprised of a series \nof historic, cultural and natural interwoven threads that hold great \nsignificance in the history of both Delaware and the United States.\n  The concept of the unit recognizes that Delaware's coastal region is \na near perfect microcosm of America's coastal regions and that they \nhave always played a key role in human activity. It recognizes that the \nfabric that makes up our Nation is in turn made up of many threads of \nhuman and natural activity and that most of those threads have their \norigins in coastal regions like Delaware's.\n  In the First State, these threads start with the development of the \nearliest human settlers in the area and run through to some of the most \nsophisticated human activities of modern times. Among the most \nsignificant are the history of the first European settlers in the \nDelaware Valley who built Fort Christina in 1638, the development of \ncoastal defenses from the beaches of Cape Henlopen on the Atlantic \nOcean to Pea Patch Island in the Delaware River and, the successful \noperation of the Underground Railroad, by which thousands of enslaved \nAfricans found their way to freedom along Delaware's ocean, bay and \nriver coastline. Other threads include: the history of the Native \nAmerican tribes such as the Lenni Lenape in what is now Delaware, the \narrival of the Finns and the Swedes at the Rocks in Wilmington, the \nincreased influence of the English and Dutch as European immigration \ngrew, the development of transportation and commerce along the same \nwaterways starting with the earliest explorers and extending to today's \nultra modern Port of Wilmington, the expansion of modern industry \nincluding the early gunpowder factories of Irenee DuPont, the rise of \nthe chemical industry and today's two modern auto assembly plants and \nthe credit card giants that dominate Wilmington's skyline, Delaware's \nsignificant contributions to the development of our constitutional \nrepublic, including Delaware's historic vote at the Golden Fleece \nTavern in Dover to ratify the Constitution of 1787, making it the first \nState to do so, and the beautiful and ecologically important natural \nareas along the coast that are already preserved as wildlife refuges.\n  These threads will be highlighted and showcased in a format unique to \nthe National Park system. The park will be structured much like a \nseries of four bicycle wheels, each with a hub and spokes. The hubs \nwill be interpretive centers located strategically along the coast \nline. The spokes will be the multitude of attractions and sites that \nrelate to the various threads described above.\n  The ``gateway'' or ``headquarters'' hub will be located on the 7th \nStreet Peninsula at the site of the original Fort Christina. Within a \nshort walking distance of the existing Fort Christina State Park is the \nOld Swedes Church, the oldest Episcopal Church in America in continuous \nuse; the Kalmar Nyckel, a replica of the ship that carried early Swedes \nto our shores; Tubman-Garrett Park, located at a point in Wilmington \nwhere escaping slaves swam across the Christina River as part of their \njourney on the Underground Railroad, and other attractions. As a hub, \nit would provide information, recommendations and directions about \nother sites in the Wilmington area that relate to the threads of the \ncoastal region.\n  A second hub would be located in the City of New Castle. It would \nprovide information on attractions in the city's renowned historic \ndistrict as well as related attractions in New Castle County such as \nFort Delaware State Park on Pea Patch Island and Old St. Anne's \nEpiscopal Church in Middletown, originally founded in 1705.\n  A third would be located in Kent County, along the coast of the \nDelaware River. It would provide information on the existing preserved \nnatural areas such as Bombay Hook and on the myriad other attractions \nin Kent County that are integral parts of the threads highlighted by \nthe park. These would include the John Dickinson Mansion, Dover's \nhistoric Green and others.\n  The fourth and final hub would be located in the Lewes area and would \nprovide information on the numerous historic sites and natural areas \nthat have made Sussex County's coastal region so pivotal to Delaware. \nThese would include the Zwaanendael Museum, the Fenwick Lighthouse, and \nthe Georgetown County Courthouse.\n  Together, these four interpretative centers would direct visitors to \nthe many existing attractions that help us understand and appreciate \nthe entire fabric of our society, a fabric woven from the many threads \nof Delaware's coastal region.\n  It is through the dedication and hard work of these sixteen members \nthat this park is even a possibility. Each of the members took time out \nof their busy lives to help with this important project marking \nDelaware's history. I thank them, along with several members of my \nstaff, for all their hard work and congratulate them on a job well \ndone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/08/senate-section/article/S8959-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8959-S8960]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           IN RECOGNITION OF THE VOICES OF DETROIT INITIATIVE\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I would like to take a moment to \nrecognize the Voices of Detroit Initiative, VODI. VODI provides an \nopportunity for people living in Detroit and Wayne\n\n[[Page S8960]]\n\nCounty, who do not have insurance, to improve their health. VODI has \nemerged as an extraordinary leader in Michigan's efforts to provide \nbetter health care access for the uninsured. The Robert Wood Johnson \nFoundation, RWJF, recognized VODI for its efforts and awarded them a \ngrant as part of RWJF's Urgent Matters initiative to increase \nunderstanding of the health care safety net and improve the efficiency \nof emergency care.\n  Over a quarter million residents are without health insurance \ncoverage in Detroit and Wayne County. This lack of insurance has severe \nimplications on patient health and the availability of resources to \ncare for the uninsured, most of whom are low-income working people. As \na result, more than 50 percent of emergency room visits are for \nproblems that could have been treated outside of the emergency room.\n  VODI is a coalition between Michigan's leading systems: Henry Ford \nHealth System, Detroit Medical Center, St. John Health, Oakwood \nHealthcare and Federally Qualified Health Centers. The Federally \nQualified Health Centers are made up of Advantage Health Centers, \nCommunity Health and Social Services, CHASS, and Detroit Community \nHealth Connection, and the Detroit and Wayne County Health Departments. \nTogether these leaders work to connect the uninsured with a provider or \nclinic that can provide direct care on an ongoing basis, a ``medical \nhome.'' Health care services at these sites are provided to VODI's \nmembers on a sliding-fee scale. VODI also engages in multiple \nactivities to promote better health care access for the uninsured, \nincluding a pharmacy assistance and medication review program, a \ntobacco use reduction program, and care management services to assist \nclients with managing their chronic health conditions.\n  On behalf of the people of Michigan, I am pleased to express \nappreciation to the Voices of Detroit Initiative for their untiring \nleadership in coordinating and leveraging scarce resources on behalf of \nthe underserved and uninsured and to honor the organization, its staff, \nand its partners as they continue to work to fulfill their lifesaving \nmission.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/08/senate-section/article/S8960-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8960]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO MR. WALTER HAMBLIN\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, I pay tribute today to the life \nof Mr. Walter ``Sam'' Hamblin of Demossville, KY.\n  Sam served his country in the Army for 22 years. He enlisted as a \nprivate, but worked his way through Officer Candidate School before \nretiring with the rank of major. He served with distinction during the \nVietnam war and provided important service both at his station in Texas \nand at the Pentagon in Washington, DC.\n  Sam chose to retire near his family's home in Kentucky, adopting the \nfarm life and raising his children. Family and service were very \nimportant to Sam. Six generations earlier, Pierce Dant Hamblin crossed \nthe Delaware River with General Washington during the Revolutionary \nWar. His great grandfather, Henry Clay Hamblin, served in the Kentucky \n7th Regiment during the Civil War. And Sam's father, Walter Hamblin, \nserved in the Navy during World War II. Through the years, the Hamblins \nhave been known as defenders of the Commonwealth.\n  During Sam's retirement--and in between attending local sporting \nevents and taking care of his growing family--he continued to travel to \nWashington and lend his expertise to the American military. He was also \nthe manager and owner of the Peaselburg Inn of Covington. And he still \nfound time to write country music songs with his son, Samuel.\n  Unforunately, Sam developed thyroid and throat cancer 5 years ago. \nAfter fighting hard against cancer, Sam died Friday, July 23, 2004 at \nhis home.\n  I am proud of Sam Hamblin's distinguished service. He honored the \nlegacy and traditions of the Hamblin family and served our country \nwell. My thoughts and prayers are with his family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/08/senate-section/article/S8960-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8960]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      AMERICAN LEGION OF OSAGE, IA\n\n Mr. HARKIN.

The Osage \nband was chosen to represent Iowa in the parade at the dedication of \nthe new World War II Memorial.\n  It was necessary for the band to raise $65,000 so that all members \ncould participate in this great event. The American Legion Family of \nOsage agreed to host a breakfast and to match funds that were raised \nthat day. A number of Legion members cooked meals, with band members \nserving the food.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to provide for \nthe establishment of a unified combatant command for military \nintelligence, and for other purposes; to the Select Committee on \nIntelligence.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nestablish a unified combatant command for military intelligence within \nthe Department of Defense. This bill is designed to complement several \nother pieces of intelligence reform legislation that have been, or will \nbe introduced, all of which call for the creation of a National \nIntelligence Director who will oversee our intelligence community and \nbe separate from the position of Director of the Central Intelligence \nAgency.\n  The very essence of my bipartisan bill is to bridge the gap between \nthe National Intelligence Director and the array of military \nintelligence entities that he or she will have to deal with, either \nthrough direct budget authority or coordination with to ensure all of \nour intelligence priorities are being properly resourced. The goal of \nmy bill is to make the National Intelligence Director as effective as \npossible, ensure our military men and women get the best intelligence \npossible when they are risking their lives to protect our freedoms, and \nto better integrate our military and civilian intelligence officials \ninto one team.\n  Let me explain the rationale for this bill and how it will help \nstrengthen the overall intelligence collection and analysis of the \nUnited States.\n  Currently, there are 15 recognized members of the Intelligence \nCommunity, eight of which are in the Department of Defense. The \nDepartment of\n\n[[Page S8965]]\n\nDefense is not only the largest user of intelligence; it is the largest \ncollector as well. These are realities that won't appreciably change, \nregardless of how we reform our Intelligence Community.\n  The centerpiece of almost all intelligence reform legislation is the \ncreation of a National Intelligence Director, as proposed by the 9/11 \nCommission and endorsed by President Bush. However, I strongly believe \nthat to make the National Intelligence Director really effective and to \nmake our Intelligence Community function more efficiently, quickly, and \nbe more responsive, the vast intelligence elements and capabilities \nwithin the military need to be brought together under a single command.\n  I want to give the National Intelligence Director one point of \ncontact in the military, not eight. I want to give the Secretary of \nDefense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and our Unified \nCommanders one person to turn to for their military intelligence needs. \nI want the military services to resource and support a unified command \nfor intelligence in the same way they are supporting other functional \ncommands such as our Special Operations Command and the Transportation \nCommand.\n  Let me highlight some of the main provisions of this bill as they \npertain to the responsibilities of the commander of the military \nintelligence command, especially as they relate to the responsibilities \nof the National Intelligence Director. This bill specifies that the \nmilitary intelligence commander will: represent the Department of \nDefense in the Intelligence Community under the direction of the \nNational Intelligence Director; carry out intelligence collection and \nanalysis activities in response to requests from the National \nIntelligence Director; prepare and submit to the Secretary of Defense \nand the National Intelligence Director recommendations and budget \nproposals for military intelligence forces and activities; establish \npriorities for military intelligence in harmony with national \npriorities established by the National Intelligence Director and \napproved by the President; ensure the interoperability of intelligence \nsharing within the Department of Defense and within the Intelligence \nCommunity as a whole, as directed by the National Intelligence \nDirector, and respond to intelligence requirements levied by the \nNational Intelligence Director.\n  Let me reiterate that this bill is designed to complement broader \nlegislation creating the National Intelligence Director. I believe that \nit will make the National Intelligence Director more effective, better \nrepresent the needs of our warfighters to the National Intelligence \nDirector, and create synergies and economies of scale within the \nDepartment of Defense on intelligence issues. In short, this bill will \nmake our overall Intelligence Community more effective.\n  The Department of Defense needs to embrace our new intelligence team, \nheaded by the National Intelligence Director, not as eight separate \nmembers but as one. I am convinced that creating a unified command for \nmilitary intelligence will be good for the military, good for the \nNational Intelligence Director, and good for our country.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself and Mrs. Lincoln):\n  S. 2779. A bill to improve protections for children and to hold \nStates accountable for the orderly and timely placement of children \nacross State lines, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, Senator \nLincoln, to introduce a bill to improve the Interstate Compact on the \nPlacement of Children.\n  The Compact is a uniform law that has been enacted by all 50 States, \nthe District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. It establishes \norderly procedures for the interstate placement of children and fixes \nresponsibility for those involved in placing the child.\n  As the father of 8 children myself, I understand that all children \ndeserve and need a safe and supportive environment. The bill I am \nintroducing today will protect the safety of children who are placed \nacross State lines for foster care, adoption, or residential care. This \nbill will ensure informed placement decisions, including a full \nexchange of information between sending and receiving States and it \nwill set and enforce specific timelines for the permanent placement of \nchildren. The bill will also create Federal incentives to help foster \nchildren find safe and permanent homes.\n   It is estimated that some 20,000 children need to go to another \nState to find adoptive families. In such cases, safe and stable homes \nsimply cannot be found in the child's State of residence, where they \nare typically bounced from one foster home to another. The Interstate \nCompact on the Placement of Children (ICPC) is premised on the belief \nthat children requiring out-of-state placement will receive the same \nprotections and services that would be provided if they remained in \ntheir home States. Yet, the median time spent in the foster care system \nby children in need of out-of-State placements is 43 months; 2 full \nyears longer than the average time spent by an in-state-placed child.\n  The two primary reasons for an abused and neglected child to move to \nanother State are adoption or foster care placement, typically into the \ncare of relatives. The ICPC establishes uniform legal and \nadministrative procedures governing the interstate placement of \nchildren and outlines the many steps necessary to place a child out of \nstate. The ICPC is the best means we have to ensure protection and \nservices to children who are placed across State lines for foster care \nor adoption. However, the ICPC was drafted 40 years ago, and through no \nfault of their original authors, has begun to show its age. It has now \nbecome outdated and a barrier to the timely placement of children \nacross State lines.\n  Finding permanent homes for all children must be the highest priority \nof the foster care system. Children placed out of State need to be \nassured of the same protections and services that would be provided if \nthey remained in their home States. Circumstances which make interstate \nplacement of children necessary and the types of protections needed, \noffer compelling reasons for a mechanism which regulates those \nplacements and Congress should expeditiously revise the ICPC to better \nserve the interests of these children.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2779\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Orderly and Timely \n     Interstate Placement of Foster Children Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) Finding.--The Congress finds that the Interstate \n     Compact on the Placement of Children (ICPC) was drafted more \n     than 40 years ago, is outdated, and is a barrier to the \n     timely placement of children across State lines.\n       (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that the States should expeditiously revise the ICPC to \n     better serve the interests of children and reduce unnecessary \n     work, and that the revision should include--\n       (1) limiting its applicability to children in foster care \n     under the responsibility of a State, except those seeking \n     placement in a residential facility primarily to access \n     clinical mental health services; and\n       (2) providing for deadlines for the completion and approval \n     of home studies as set forth in section 4.\n\n     SEC. 3. ORDERLY AND TIMELY PROCESS FOR INTERSTATE PLACEMENT \n                   OF CHILDREN.\n\n       Section 471(a) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     671(a)) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``and'' at the end of paragraph (23);\n       (2) by striking the period at the end of paragraph (24) and \n     inserting ``; and''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(25) provides that the State shall have in effect \n     procedures for the orderly and timely interstate placement of \n     children; and procedures implemented in accordance with an \n     interstate compact approved by the Secretary, if \n     incorporating the procedures prescribed by paragraph (26), \n     shall be considered to satisfy the requirement of this \n     paragraph.''.\n\n     SEC. 4.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as ``Department of Homeland \n     Security Financial Accountability Act''.\n\n     SEC. 602. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Influential financial management leadership is of vital \n     importance to the mission success of the Department of \n     Homeland Security. For this reason, the Chief Financial \n     Officer of the Department must be a key figure in the \n     Department's management.\n       (2) To provide a sound financial leadership structure, the \n     provisions of law enacted by the Chief Financial Officers Act \n     of 1990 (Public Law 101-576) provide that the Chief Financial \n     Officer of each of the Federal executive departments is to be \n     a Presidential appointee who reports directly to the \n     Secretary of that department on financial management matters. \n     Because the Department of Homeland Security was only recently \n     created, the provisions enacted by that Act must be amended \n     to include the Department within these provisions.\n       (3) The Department of Homeland Security was created by \n     consolidation of 22 separate Federal agencies, each with its \n     own accounting and financial management system. None of these \n     systems was developed with a view to executing the mission of \n     the Department of Homeland Security to prevent terrorist \n     attacks within the United States, reduce the Nation's \n     vulnerability to terrorism, and minimize the damage and \n     assist in the recovery from terrorist attacks. For these \n     reasons, a strong Chief Financial Officer is needed within \n     the Department both to consolidate financial management \n     operations, and to insure that management control systems are \n     comprehensively designed to achieve the mission and execute \n     the strategy of the Department.\n       (4) The provisions of law enacted by the Chief Financial \n     Officers Act of 1990 require agency Chief Financial Officers \n     to improve the financial information available to agency \n     managers and the Congress. Those provisions also specify that \n     agency financial management systems must provide for the \n     systematic measurement of performance. In the case of the \n     Department of Homeland Security, therefore, it is vitally \n     important that management control systems be designed with a \n     clear view of a homeland security strategy, including the \n     priorities of the Department in addressing those risks of \n     terrorism deemed most significant based upon a comprehensive \n     assessment of potential threats, vulnerabilities, \n     criticality, and consequences. For this reason, Federal law \n     should be amended to clearly state the responsibilities of \n     the Chief Financial Officer of the Department of Homeland \n     Security to provide management control information, for the \n     benefit of managers within the Department and to help inform \n     the Congress, that permits an assessment of the Department's \n     performance in executing a homeland security strategy.\n\n     SEC. 603.
