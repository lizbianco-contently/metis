I wish to announce, assuming the Senator \nfrom New York and I can work out an understanding, there may not be a \nsecond vote. Members should be aware, there may not be the second vote. \nThe first vote will take place as scheduled.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. Will the Presiding \nOfficer state what is before the body right now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 5 minutes evenly divided on the \nHarkin amendment No. 32.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the omnibus bill that is before us \nvirtually eliminates the Byrne law enforcement grant program. This \namendment restores the funding to $500 million to the fiscal year 2002 \nlevel. There is no increase, but this at least holds it harmless.\n  On each Senator's desk is a table of how much each State's law \nenforcement would lose without the Byrne grant. These grants go \ndirectly to State and local law enforcement. It pays for regional drug \ntask forces, technology, forensics, prevention, and other valuable \nantidrug efforts in local communities.\n  I have heard from the National Sheriffs Association, the \nInternational Association of Chiefs of Police, the National Association \nof Police Organizations, and the National Governors' Association, who \nhave voiced strong support for this amendment.\n  At this crucial time in our history, we cannot afford to reduce the \neffectiveness of our Nation's law enforcement agencies.\n  I received a letter this morning from the head of the Kansas Bureau \nof Investigation, Mr. Larry Welch. I do not know him personally. He \nsaid:\n\n       Elimination of Byrne funding would be absolutely \n     devastating to Kansas law enforcement.\n\n  Mr. President, this amendment is needed by local law enforcement all \nover the United States, and I hope we adopt it overwhelmingly.\n  I yield to the Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor Senator Harkin's \namendment to restore full funding to the Edward Byrne Memorial State \nand Local Law Enforcement Assistance Program, a program which is used \nto fund crime and drug prevention programs in communities nationwide.\n  The bill before use today cuts the Byrne grant program by $500 \nmillion, in essence eviscerating it. I have trouble understanding why \nanyone would choose to decrease funding for a program that strives to \nimprove the criminal justice system and increase public safety.\n  Cutting this program has real consequences in my home State of \nDelaware. There, Byrne grant money goes to fund a wide range of \nsignificant drug abuse and prevention programs, juvenile crime \ninitiatives and other criminal justice projects, including: Delaware's \nKey and Crest programs, which help criminal offenders get off of drugs \nand decrease there chance of re-offending once they are released from \njail; drug treatment services for criminal offenders in drug court \nprograms; drunk driving patrols in Dover, DE; and drug prevention \nprograms such as ``Heroin Hurts'' which educates teens about the \ndangers of the deadly pure heroin available in my State.\n  The Byrne program is distributed as a block grant to each State, \nbased on a State's population. Delaware typically receives almost $2.5 \nmillion per year. It's critical funding, funding that secures the \nhometown and that helps keep our kids safe and drug-free.\n  I could go on about the good Byrne has done in Delaware. We have used \nByrne funds to create eight community-based crime prevention programs \naround my State. In New Castle County and Dover, these programs offered \ntraining and services to adults and youth in high crime areas. Another \nproject identified hate crime hotspots throughout New Castle County and \nincreased police services through a specialized hate crime unit to \nthose areas.\n  We have used Byrne funds to train prison officers, to improve our \ncriminal justice records, and to expand the Delaware State Police's \ncrime mapping project.\n  Byrne is an incredibly flexible law enforcement program. It's amazing \nto me that we would propose to eliminate it in this bill. I will fight \nthis cut, and I am pleased to stand with my friend from Iowa in \noffering this amendment to restore Byrne funds.\n  Mr. President, I cannot fathom why my colleagues are doing this. This \nis the single most popular, effective program that has existed in \nhelping State law enforcement. Everybody on that side knows that. It \nhas all the Republican attributes. It is flexible. It is one of those \nprograms that the States like very much.\n  The Presiding Officer from South Carolina knows how it works in South \nCarolina, and in this rush to be able to make room for these cockamamie \npriorities, what are we doing? We are cutting FBI agents. We eliminate \nthe Violent Crimes Task Force. The FBI cannot function in the States on \nordinary crimes such as bank robbery and interstate car theft. We cut \nanother 800 FBI agents, or thereabouts, under this proposal.\n  We are cutting the COPS program. I think my colleagues have it \nbackwards. I think this is the most cockamamie idea I have heard in a \nlong while. This narrow definition of a constitutional national defense \nis going to come back to bite us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent that Senators Jeffords, Murray, \nEdwards, Clinton, Graham, and Schumer be added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, unfortunately, the Edward Byrne Memorial \nState and Local Law Enforcement Assistance Program suffered a $500 \nmillion cut in this bill. Hundreds of law enforcement agencies \nthroughout Wisconsin depend on this money to fund a variety of crime \nprevention, drug interdiction, domestic violence, and many other \ncreative, anti-crime initiatives. In fact, Wisconsin received more than \n$9 million in Byrne formula grant funds last year.\n  Eliminating this source of funding will drastically impair local law \nenforcement's ability to combat crime. I am pleased to co-sponsor \nSenator Harkin's amendment to restore the Byrne formula grant program \nto last year's level of $500 million. We cannot leave our State and \nlocal law enforcement agencies out in the cold, especially at a time \nwhen we've asked them take on the additional responsibility of being \nthe first line of defense and the first to respond in case of a \nterrorist incident. The safety of our communities depends on local law \nenforcement's ability to do their job well. At the very least, we can \nassist them by restoring this funding.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I strongly support the Harkin amendment to \nrestore funding for the Edward Byrne Memorial State and Local Law \nEnforcement Assistance Program to its fiscal year 2002 level. I am \nconcerned that the omnibus appropriations bill before us eviscerates \nthe Byrne program. The Byrne program provides a flexible source of \nfunding to State and local law enforcement agencies to help fight crime \nby funding drug enforcement task forces, more cops on the street, \nimproved technology, and other anticrime efforts. Massachusetts \nreceived over $11.5 million in Byrne funding last year. On countless \noccasions I have heard from law enforcement officers from Massachusetts \nabout the value of the Byrne program to their crime-fighting efforts.\n  The war against terror has placed unprecedented demands on State and\n\n[[Page S1103]]\n\nlocal law enforcement to prevent terrorist attacks and to respond to an \nattack should one occur. But fighting the war on terror is not the only \njob that we expect police officers to do. We also expect them to combat \nthe prevalence of drugs in our cities and rural communities, we expect \nthem to keep our homes and families safe from thieves, and we expect \nthem to make us feel secure when we walk through our neighborhoods. We \nare well aware that the States are facing a severe fiscal crisis, some \n$75 billion collectively, what priority does it reflect to cut back on \nsupport to local law enforcement in this budget and security \nenvironment? A wrong-headed one, in my estimation.\n  This amendment is supported by the National Association of Police \nOrganizations, the International Association of Chiefs of Police, and \nthe National Governor's Association. I am proud to stand with these \norganizations in support of the Harkin amendment to restore funding to \nthe Byrne amendment.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor Senator Harkin's \namendment to restore full funding to the Edward Byrne Memorial State \nand Local Law Enforcement Assistance Program, a program which is used \nto fund crime and drug prevention programs in communities nationwide.\n  The bill before us today cuts the Byrne grant program by $500 \nmillion, in essence eviscerating it. I have trouble understanding why \nanyone would choose to decrease funding for a program that strives to \nimprove the criminal justice system and increase public safety.\n  Cutting this program has real consequences in my home state of \nDelaware.

It's amazing \nto me that we would propose to eliminate it in this bill. I will fight \nthis cut, and I am pleased to stand with my friend from Iowa in \noffering this amendment to restore Byrne funds.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President: I rise to comment on amendment No. 32, \nwhich would restore $500 million in funding for the Department of \nJustice's Edward Byrne Memorial State and Local Law Enforcement \nAssistance Program, the Byrne Grant Program.\n  There is no question we all agree on the importance of maintaining \nadequate funding for the Byrne Grant Program. The Byrne Grant Program \ndoes much to enhance State and local law enforcement, providing \ncritical grants which are needed to fight violent and drug-related \ncrime. In the last year alone, over $4 million was awarded to State and \nlocal law enforcement agencies in Utah to fight violent and drug-\nrelated crime.\n  As many of my colleagues, I was extremely disturbed to learn the \nresolution we have before us today contains absolutely no funding for \nthe Byrne Grant Program. Obviously, it is not in the interest of \nsupporting local law enforcement for that situation to stand.\n  Let me discuss another consideration. Appropriation have worked very \nto craft a bill that is fiscally responsible, that will balance the \nneed for spending against restraint, and that will help us restore a \nbalanced budget which is so vital to our country's economic security. \nThe amendment we have before us, offered by my good friend and \ncolleague, Senator Harkin, proposes to add $500 million to the bottom \nline of this bill, without an offsetting reduction which will keep the \nresolution within the total funding level acceptable to the President. \nThus, its passage would vastly exceed the carefully crafted Federal \ndiscretionary spending level agreed to by President Bush and \ncongressional appropriators last year and jeopardize the legislation we \nmust pass to ensure continued funding for virtually all of the \nGovernment except the Department of Defense.\n  I am relieved to hear our chairmen, Senator Stevens and Senator \nGregg, provide assurances that if the Harkin amendment were not \nadopted, they will restore the funds in the conference committee with \nthe House of Representatives. Based on those assurances, I will cast my \nvote to table the Harkin amendment.\n  Before I close, I wanted to also express my concerns about a \nprovision in H.J. Res 2 which dramatically restructures the section 8 \nHousing Choice Voucher renewal calculation. The resolution states that \ncontracts will be renewed based upon levels used in previous years to \ncalculate future housing payments and administrative fees. This formula \ncould result in a severe undercounting of the number of families likely \nto be served by vouchers in the upcoming year.\n  Housing Authorities are facing an ever-increasing series of \nchallenges, including increases in low-income and disabled eligibles \nand rising rental costs in many areas. Many of Utah's agencies who have \nreceived new voucher awards within the last six to 12 months are \nprojecting they will have inadequate funding to meet their needs.\n  As I read the resolution, any additional funding needed to support \nincreased costs will be a limited amount that is located within a \ncentral fund allocated by the Secretary. This could force Housing \nAuthorities to reduce staff, resulting in lost administrative fees, and \na reduction in the percentage of vouchers being used. It is my hope \nthat the conferees will be able to rectify this problem that could \nserve to undermine the successfulness of the Section 8 program.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am unable to support the amendment by \nmy colleague, Senator Harkin, to restore $500 million in non-\ndiscretionary funding to the Edward Byrne Memorial State and Local Law \nEnforcement Assistance Program. I am unable to do so not based on my \nopposition to the program, but rather due to the fact that the chairman \nof the Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens, has outlined a \nseparate strategy to restore this funding in conference.\n  The Edward Byrne Memorial State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance \nProgram provides funding to State and local governments to help make \ncommunities safe and improve criminal justice systems. Specifically, \nthe Byrne Program emphasizes the reduction of violent and drug-related \ncrimes and fosters multi jurisdictional efforts to support national \ndrug control priorities.\n  Byrne Program funds are awarded through both discretionary and \nformula grant programs. Discretionary funds are awarded directly to \npublic and private agencies and private nonprofit organizations, while \nformula funds are awarded to the States, which then award subgrants to \nState and local units of government as well as to agencies and \norganizations.\n  Senator Harkin's amendment would add $500 million to the overall cost \nof the Omnibus Appropriations bill, an amount which far exceeds the \nfunding cap on the bill which the administration is willing to support. \nChairman Stevens has explicitly stated that although this program was \ntaken out of the bill, additional money was put in its place because he \nis aware that the House of Representatives intends to restore funding \nfor this program in conference.\n  I have consistently supported the Byrne Program and similar programs\n\n[[Page S1104]]\n\nin the past, and have also worked tirelessly through the annual \nappropriations process to secure funds and grants for both rural and \nmetropolitan law enforcement agencies in the Commonwealth of \nPennsylvania and throughout the Nation. As the former District Attorney \nof Philadelphia, I understand the importance of Federal funds to local \nand state law enforcement agencies to help reduce crime and have \nconsistently supported increased funding for that purpose.\n  Based on the comments made by Chairman Stevens, I am confident that \nthis program will be restored in conference. Accordingly, I am unable \nto support my colleague's amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, what is the remaining time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 2\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. GREGG. If the Chair would advise me when I have reached a minute, \nthen I will yield to the chairman of the committee, the President pro \ntempore.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. First off, let's remember we have dramatically increased \nthe money in this bill by $2 billion which is going back to the local \npolice forces in this country. That is $2 billion. The Byrne program is \na good program, but it is a program that buys lights and cars. It is a \nprogram that is used for basically the day-to-day operation of the \npolice forces, and that makes sense when we can afford it.\n  This bill is structured in a way so that we can stay at the seven-\nfifty level. We expect the Byrne money to come back into this out of \nconference. But as a practical matter, to get to the seven-fifty level, \nwe thought it was more important to put $2 billion of new money into \nthe police agencies where they needed it, which is in the area of \nsupporting their efforts to fight terrorism.\n  I yield to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this is the time when we ask both sides \nof the aisle to trust us. We took out a program we know is going to go \nback into this bill and put additional money in another place because \nwe know the House will help us put it back in. This will help save \nanother portion of this bill that we support.\n  We have done this for years. The other side has done it, too. We know \nwhat the House wants. The House wants this back in. We want to convince \nthem the other money we have in here also is good.\n  I urge the Senate to give us the flexibility to deal with this bill \nin conference the way it is outlined. It is a very flexible bill. There \nare 11 bills in 1 amendment. I guarantee it will survive.\n  I pledge it will survive, but also what will survive is another $2 \nbillion we need for another program. This is part of that program. So \non the basis of trust, I ask my colleagues to trust us.\n  I move to table this amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  At the moment, there is not a sufficient second.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Is there any time remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time remaining on the Democratic \nside.\n  Mr. STEVENS. If the Senator wishes a minute, I ask unanimous consent \nthat he would have an additional minute.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I only need 30 seconds.\n  Mr. STEVENS. All right. Thirty seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I want to add Senator Dorgan as a cosponsor.\n  On the $2 billion that is in the bill, that is for first responders. \nThat does not go to the same entities we are talking about in the Byrne \namendment. That is the only point I want to make.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I agree it does not, but this money is going back in \nunder the negotiations strategy we outlined. I guarantee it is going \nback in, but give us some leeway to deal with this bill. It is an \nenormous bill.\n  Again, I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  At the moment, there is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Regular order. A voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays on the underlying amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  At the moment, there does not appear to be a sufficient second.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, the Senator from New York offered the \nnext amendment on which the yeas and nays have been ordered. As I \npromised last night as we wound up, we have reviewed Senator Schumer's \namendment, and he has drafted a modified amendment which he will offer \nand which we will accept.\n  I want to call to the attention of Senators that there are some of \nthese\n\n[[Page S1105]]\n\namendments that can be worked out, if we have a chance to work them \nout. We want to work with both sides of the aisle to try to accommodate \nthe desires of Senators with regard to these 11 bills in one amendment.\n  I yield to my friend from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nHollings, Dorgan, Kennedy, Graham of Florida, Biden, Clinton, and \nLautenberg be added as cosponsors of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 31, As Further Modified\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to further modify \nmy amendment with the changes that I now send to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 31), as further modified, is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To provide funds for research and development grants to \n               increase security for United States ports)\n\n       On page 719, strike ``,'' on line 14, and insert the \n     following:\n       Provided further, That, of such amounts provided herein, \n     $150,000,000 shall be available for the Secretary of Homeland \n     Security pursuant to the terms and conditions of section \n     70107(i) of Public Law 107-295 to award grants to national \n     laboratories, private nonprofit organizations, institutions \n     of higher education, and other entities for the support of \n     research and development of technologies that can be used to \n     secure the ports of the United States:\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I strongly support Senator Schumer's \namendment to add $150 million for port security research grants to the \nomnibus appropriations bill for fiscal year 2003. I cannot be here for \nthe vote, but if I were I would vote in favor of this amendment. We \npassed a comprehensive maritime security bill at the end of the last \nCongress because in the aftermath of September 11 it became apparent \nthat our Nation's ports were vulnerable to terrorist attacks. Our bill \nprovided for the creation of a port security infrastructure that will \nsignificantly increase the level of security at ports and maritime \nfacilities across the country. However, the bill was not funded through \nthe appropriations process and a funding mechanism has yet to be been \ndecided. The Schumer amendment would immediately release grant money to \nlaboratories and universities for the research and development of \ntechnologies which will help detect the presence of chemical, \nbiological, and nuclear weapons at our Nation's ports, something we \naddressed in the Maritime Security Act but have yet to implement.\n  There is no doubt that we will need to develop new technologies and \nimprove upon existing detection technology if we are to fully secure \nour ports against the threat posed by weapons of mass destruction. \nThere are simply not enough customs inspectors to search every piece of \ncargo that comes into the United States. We will need to have equipment \nthat can scan large cargo containers and detect explosives, chemical \nand biological agents, and any other substance that could conceivably \ncause harm. We will also need improved technology that will help \nofficials track, and keep track, of cargo containers from their point \nof origin to their point of destination. Calling upon our scientists \nand educators to develop new security technologies is essential if we \nare to effectively wage the war on terrorism. Given the inadequacies \nthat we know exist in our port security, I do not believe that we can \nafford to wait around to act. Senator Schumer's amendment is critical \nto the future of maritime security, and I urge my colleagues to vote \nfor its passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we are prepared to accept this amendment. \nWhat it does is it dedicates moneys that are already in the bill to the \nconsideration of the process of developing the system of detecting \nitems in cargo vans as they come into our country. It is a very vital \nsubject, and we are pleased to work with the Senator from New York.\n  I urge its adoption.\n  I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, I thank the Senator from Alaska, \nas well as the Senators from South Carolina, Washington State, and \nArizona for their help.\n  Let me explain it quickly to my colleagues and how it is changed. As \nmany of you know, something I have felt very strongly about is the \nability to detect nuclear devices as they might be smuggled into this \ncountry by terrorists, either on ships in the large containers or over \nthe Mexican or Canadian borders.\n  The scientists at our energy labs tell us they can develop or perfect \ndetection devices much better than Geiger counters, which is the only \ndetection device we have now that can prevent such devices from being \nsmuggled in, which could cause an unimaginable tragedy--if a nuclear \ndevice were smuggled into the country and exploded.\n  The original amendment added $150 million for research. Through the \ngood work of the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, we have now \nsimply said that that money will come out of TSA. He has graciously \nagreed to protect that in conference. I think it is a happy compromise \nthat solves the problem I have had getting research for this and the \nproblem he has had making sure there are no new allocations.\n  It tracks the language that Senator Hollings and Senator McCain put \nin the port security bill and now provides the funding without adding \nany additional funding. So I am glad we have a compromise and look \nforward to seeing this research proceed very quickly. We cannot afford \nto wait.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment, \nas further modified.\n  The amendment (No. 31), as further modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n\n       Mr. SCHUMER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it is my understanding the Senator from \nWest Virginia will offer an amendment. I would like to inquire from my \ngood friend if we could put a time limit on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if I may respond to my friend, I am willing \nto enter into a time agreement. I think that is good. I wonder how many \nof my colleagues will want to have 2 or 3 or 5 minutes. I do not want \nto leave my friends out of the equation. As far as I am personally \nconcerned, I could do with 45 minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we have an \nhour on the amendment; 45 minutes for the Senator from West Virginia, \n15 minutes for our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Is this the one on the across-the-board cuts?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Does the Senator wish to have no second-degree \namendments?\n  Mr. BYRD. That is fine, and an up-or-down vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We agree, no second-degree amendments and an up-or-down \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 36\n\n       (Purpose: to nullify all across-the-board rescissions \n     contained in this joint resolution.)\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume. \nAnd I send to the desk an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 36:\n       Strike title VI of division N.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Alaska has \nbeen very gracious in proposing that I, as the author of the amendment, \nhave 45 minutes and that he, the manager on the other side, have 15 \nminutes.\n\n[[Page S1106]]\n\n  My hearing isn't too good at this point. I am trying to clarify.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could ask the Senator from West \nVirginia to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding that on this amendment the Senator \nfrom West Virginia would control 45 minutes and the Senator from Alaska \n15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, let me thank my friend from Alaska again. He is, in \nShakespeare's words, ``a man after my own kidney.'' He offers me three \ntimes as much time as he intends to claim. What does that tell you? \nThat tells you he is a very fair man. And it also tells you he is very \nsure of his votes. We saw, yesterday, how well disciplined the \nRepublican majority is. Every man, every woman, right down the line--no \nvariation, no veering off course--straight to the object, no matter \nwhat the contents of the amendment, no matter what its attributes, \nvotes it down. I say this with all due respect to Senator Stevens. But \nhe is sure of his votes, which indicates to me that the other side has \ncaucused, they have said they are going to say no to every amendment we \noffer on this side. I respect them and I admire them for their \ndiscipline.\n  Now, Mr. President, to the amendment.\n  After the election--remember the election, my friend from Rhode \nIsland, who presides this morning over this Chamber with a degree of \ndiscipline and poise and aplomb that is so rare as a day in June--after \nthe election, the President of the United States threw down the \ngauntlet and insisted that total discretionary spending not exceed $751 \nbillion. He said: That is it. That is the line. That is the mark. No \nmore. That far but no further.\n  To meet this arbitrary target, Senator Stevens was forced to reduce \nthe 11 bills that were approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee \nlast July, on bipartisan, unanimous votes, by $9.8 billion. What a \nchange. What a change a few months can make.\n  These 11 bills were approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee \nlast July, when we had 15 Democrats, 14 Republicans, and--to the man \nand to the woman--we had a bipartisan vote, a unanimous vote, in \nsupport of these 11 bills. And now, because the President has drawn a \nline in the sand and sent the message to the Republican majority: Cut \nit. Cut it--and we see the discipline on the other side of the aisle--\neverybody is marching to the tune of the President of the United States \non that side of the aisle. So what he says goes. He says: That far. It \nwill go this far, and no further.\n  All right. So to meet this arbitrary target, Senator Stevens was \nforced to reduce the 11 bills that were approved by the Senate \nAppropriations Committee last July, on bipartisan, unanimous votes, by \n$9.8 billion. Let's see how everybody votes today.\n\n  This shortsighted and arbitrary ceiling on spending forced Senator \nStevens to make dramatic reductions in priority programs designed to \ndefend our homeland, educate our children, improve our transportation \nsystems, and strengthen our law enforcement programs.\n  The legislation before us also includes a 2.9-percent across-the-\nboard cut in all domestic programs. Get that, an across-the-board cut \nin all, not just some but all domestic programs. This provision, buried \nin 1,052 pages of legislative text, will exacerbate the cuts that are \nalready made in the bill. A cut of 2.9 percent now, or $11.4 billion, \nin domestic spending is no technical adjustment.\n  The President insisted that there be a vote on going to war with Iraq \nbefore the election. He insisted that he must have that vote. The \nRepublicans insisted that we must have the vote on Iraq before the \nelection so that the impending election would affect the outcome of \nthat vote. I wonder why they didn't say: Let's vote on the 11 \nappropriations bills before the election, with the across-the-board cut \nof 1.6 percent and then with the addition yesterday of 1.3 percent, \nmaking a total of 2.9 percent across the board. How would that have \nbeen before the election? How would that have been perceived before the \nelection if we had this vote then? If we could have only had the vote \nthat is about to come, if we could have had it before the election, \nwhat a difference that would have made.\n  Here we are now. This country is faced with a cut of 2.9 percent, or \n$11.4 billion, in domestic spending. This is no technical adjustment. \nThis is a real cut. Nor can it be fairly characterized as capturing the \nsavings from agencies operating under a continuing resolution for 4 \nmonths. Don't you believe that. The President's budget for fiscal year \n2003 was simply inadequate when it came to critical domestic programs. \nThe President proposed to freeze domestic spending, excluding homeland \nsecurity, and last summer the Senate Appropriations Committee approved, \non a bipartisan unanimous vote, an allocation that provided just enough \nadditional resources, about $11 billion, to cover the cost of inflation \nfor domestic programs. Every Republican on the Appropriations Committee \nvoted for that. Every Democrat on the Appropriations Committee voted \nfor that.\n  With those additional funds, the committee was able to restore \nessential funding for programs that the President proposed to cut, such \nas veterans medical care, highway funding for the States, education \nprograms, the new No Child Left Behind law, Amtrak, and State and local \nlaw enforcement.\n  Now what a change. Now the President has not only insisted on \nvirtually eliminating the $11 billion increase that the committee \napproved last summer, but by including this 2.9-percent cut in domestic \nprograms, spending will actually be cut overall by 1 percent. It is \nalso deeply troubling that some of this $11.4 billion across-the-board \ncut is being imposed on domestic programs to pay for increases in \nmandatory programs.\n  The mandatory side of the Federal budget is going through the roof \nunchecked, going through the ozone layer, while the domestic programs \nthat are being funded through the annual appropriations process are \nbeing squeezed--like I squeezed my grapefruit this morning. The \ndomestic programs that are being funded through the annual \nappropriations process are being squeezed.\n  Approximately $4 billion of the $11.4 billion across-the-board cut is \nincluded in the bill to pay for increased mandatory spending in \nMedicare, in assistance for needy families, and for drought relief. \nWhile these are important programs, should our veterans have to pay for \nthem with longer lines at hospitals and clinics? Hear me. I am asking \nyou, the people out there who are listening and watching through the \nelectronic eye, I am asking you. I am asking my friends on the other \nside of the aisle, while these are important programs, should our \nveterans have to pay for them with longer lines at hospitals and \nclinics? How many pregnant women and infants have fewer meals through \nthe WIC program? How about that? The silence is deafening.\n\n  Should we fail to meet our commitment to double the budget for the \nNational Institutes of Health over 5 years? I think not. And the \nSenate, based on previous votes, thinks not.\n  Once we start down this road of paying for increases in mandatory \nprograms by cutting domestic funding, where will it stop?\n  When I came to Congress more than 50 years ago, I seem to remember \nthat the Appropriations Committees of the two Houses controlled \nsomething like 90 percent of the domestic spending programs. My memory \nis not infallible, but it was a tremendous figure over today's. We have \nbeen hearing in recent years that the Appropriations Committees have \ncontrol over about one-third of the total expenditures.\n  Now what we are doing, with these mandatory programs, you might refer \nto them as backdoor spending. Congress, and the Appropriations \nCommittee, has absolutely no control over that. That change has come \nabout in my 50 years in Congress. Now what we are going to do is pay \nfor some of those mandatory programs with an across-the-board cut in \ndiscretionary spending.\n  Now, go back and face your constituents. I wish we had this vote \nbefore the election. This is the vote we should have had before the \nelection. Once we start down this road of paying for increases in \nmandatory programs by cutting domestic funding, where will it stop? \nThere will be no stopping it.\n\n[[Page S1107]]\n\nThere is only $385 billion of domestic funding for fiscal year 2003. We \nare talking about funding that is important to 290 million people in \nthis great Nation. Are we going to pay for the new prescription drug \nbenefit with cuts in domestic programs? Are we? There simply is not \nenough domestic spending in the entire budget to cover such mandatory \ncosts.\n  Let's be sensible about this matter. Let's forget politics for a \nmoment. An across-the-board cut of 2.9 percent is a real, honest-to-\ngoodness cut that would change people's lives across this Nation. Where \ndo you stand? Go back to your constituents, tell them where you stand.\n  What was the first question that was ever asked since the human race \nbegan? In reading the Book of Genesis, the first chapter, the first \nquestion ever asked was when God walked through the Garden of Eden in \nthe cool of the day, before the shades of night had fallen, and he was \nlooking for Adam and Eve. They had eaten of the forbidden fruit.\n  I know some people think it is old-fashioned to refer to the Holy \nBible. I don't. Right there in that first chapter of Genesis you will \nfind the greatest scientific treatise that was ever written, giving the \nchronology of creation, and the scientists don't dispute that \nchronology as it is laid down there. But God went through the garden \nand he asked: ``Adam, where art thou?'' Adam was hiding. He and Eve had \ngotten over behind some bushes. They were hiding. Can you hide from \nGod? They found they could not. But they were hiding over behind some \nbushes. God went through the garden and said: ``Adam, where art thou?'' \nI say to my friends, you are going to be asked by the people: Where \nwere you? Where were you? Where were you when these cuts took place? \nWhere were you?\n  Mr. REID. May I ask the Senator to yield for a question?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is aware, I am sure, that one of the groups \nbeing affected by these vicious cuts is American veterans. I was on a \ncable TV show today with the Officers' Association and the Veterans of \nForeign Wars. They talked about the tremendous needs of American \nveterans for health care and other benefits.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Is the Senator aware that what they have done already is a \n$693 million cut to American veterans' health care benefits?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. I am getting to that. I want Senators to answer the \nquestion from their veterans, where were you?\n  Mr. REID. Almost $700 million.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, where were you?\n  Mr. REID. Is the Senator also aware that in the Washington Post and \nall over the country today there are stories that in addition to these \ncuts, the VA is going to cut veterans' access further? I think it is a \ndisgrace to do to American veterans what this bill does, and I say to \nthe Senator--I am sure he is aware but I ask this question: Isn't this \nexemplary of the vicious cuts that are taking place in \nthis legislation?\n\n  Mr. BYRD. That is just one example, and it is a shameful--not just a \ndisgrace, it is a shame, a shame. This across-the-board cut is not a \ncareful choice. This cut would result in ham-handed reductions in \nveterans' programs, public health programs, education programs, and \nhomeland security programs. Yes, this is a shame.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the Senator, the reason I mention this is it is \ndescriptive, exemplary of what they are doing to the American people \nunder the guise of fiscal conservatism. If this is ``compassionate \nconservatism,'' then I don't want any part of it.\n  Mr. BYRD. If this is compassion, the shedding of tears means nothing. \nWhere is the compassion when it comes to spending money to send our men \nand women overseas, with all of this big, loose talk that we hear, and \nwe are spending money hand over fist. Nobody suggests cutting a nickel \nor a dime when it comes to putting money in the military. There is no \nacross-the-board cut there.\n  The taxpayers elect us to make careful choices. So I thank the \ndistinguished Senator for bringing out this inequity.\n  The Women, Infants and Children Program, which provides essential \nsources and nutrition to millions of low-income families, would be cut \nby $138 million. If food costs and program demands continue to climb, \nthis cut could mean that 224,689 eligible women, infants, and children \ncould be turned away from the WIC program later in the year.\n  At a time of heightened concern about the safety of our Nation's food \nsupply, the Food Safety Inspection Service would be cut by $22 million, \neliminating the salaries of 490 food safety inspectors.\n  Last fall, at an Intelligence Committee hearing, FBI Director Mueller \ntestified. He said:\n\n       I have a hard time telling the country that you should be \n     comfortable--\n\n  This is Mr. Mueller talking. The Director said that the FBI is \nfocusing on the threat of terrorists who would use military action \nagainst Iraq as a pretext to strike America. That is what he said. That \nis not what I am saying. That is what he said. Yet, this across-the-\nboard cut would result in the FBI losing 1,175 agents, including 188 \nagents through attrition, 90 agents through current vacancies, 110 \nagents that were requested in the fiscal year 2003 budget request, and \n787 agents from the agency would have to be laid off.\n  Yesterday, my friend, Mr. Gregg, the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom New Hampshire, said in so many words, but I think they all added \nup to this: The FBI is flush with cash. Well, after this across-the-\nboard cut, the FBI will be scrounging for pennies. How about that song, \n``Pennies from Heaven.'' I don't know where the pennies will be coming \nfrom, but they are going to be pretty scarce, that is sure.\n  At the same Intelligence Committee hearing, FBI Director Mueller, in \ndiscussing the potential for terrorist attacks in America, focused \nattention on certain high-risk sectors, such as transportation, energy, \nand agriculture. The FBI has sent warnings urging extra precautions in \nthose sectors. Yet, this across-the-board cut would reduce funding for \nsecurity at our nuclear powerplants by $18 million. This cut will \nresult in a reduction of more than $280 million in funding for the \nTransportation Security Administration and the Coast Guard, two \ncritical agencies whose mandates are to protect our airports and our \nports.\n  A reduction of this size will require the Coast Guard to conduct \nfewer port security patrols and further degrade their efforts in the \nareas of drug interdiction, marine safety, and fisheries patrol. Coast \nGuard ships will spend more time sitting at the dock for the lack of \nfuel, money, and operating funds.\n  The Customs Service would have to cut 1,600 positions, including \nagents and inspectors, at our Nation's seaports. Now this is serious. \nThis is not just play money. This is serious.\n  The administration has continually stated that places of national \ninterest have specifically been targeted by terrorists for attack, and \nyet this arbitrary cut would reduce funds for the U.S. Park Police, \nresulting in approximately 35 fewer Park Police officers at the very \nsame time that the agency is beefing up its antiterrorism efforts at \nour most visible national symbols, such as the Statue of Liberty, the \nWashington Monument, and the Jefferson Memorial.\n  With these additional cuts, total funding in the bill for homeland \nsecurity programs would be reduced to less than $24.4 billion. This is \nvirtually a freeze at the level for fiscal year 2002. At a time of \nheightened vulnerability at home, the FBI will be losing agents, the \nCustoms Service will be losing inspectors at our ports, the Food Safety \nInspection Service and the Food and Drug Administration will be losing \nfood inspectors, and the Immigration and Naturalization Service will be \nlosing Border Patrol agents.\n  In addition, the resources to help State and local governments train \nand equip first responders for potential terrorist attacks with \nbiological, chemical, or nuclear agents will be cut--that is right, \ncut--by 2.9 percent. Is this any way to govern? I think not.\n  Environmental cleanup activities would be cut by $203 million. Such a \ncut would delay short-term cleanup milestones at Hanford in Washington \nState, Savannah River in South Carolina, as well as in Idaho, in New \nMexico, in Nevada, in Ohio, in Kentucky, yes, and even at Rocky Flats \nin Colorado.\n  Let's talk about the Head Start Program. The Head Start Program would\n\n[[Page S1108]]\n\nbe cut by $192 million, eliminating services for 2,722 children, adding \nto the 2,800 children that the National Head Start Association claims \nwould be displaced by the President's budget. This cut would result in \nthe elimination of services to a total of 5,522 children in fiscal year \n2003.\n  The budget for the National Institutes of Health would be cut by $778 \nmillion, scuttling the plan to double NIH's budget over 5 years. A 2.9-\npercent cut would reduce VA medical care by $692 million. How about \nthat? This would result in 230,000 fewer veterans being treated and 1.8 \nmillion fewer visits by veterans to outpatient clinics.\n  Go to the veterans the next time you go home; go around your State \nand tell the veterans what you have done. Tell them you have cut the \nmoney for their clinics. Tell them you have cut the money for VA \nmedical care. Tell those veterans, look into their eyes, tell them we \nhave cut their money. Yes, I voted to cut it. I voted to cut it.\n  Last year, though, I did not vote to cut it. When we reported out \nthose bills last year, we supported it. So this would result in 230,000 \nfewer veterans--let me say it again, 230,000--being treated and 1.8 \nmillion fewer visits by veterans to outpatient clinics.\n  This cut would also result in 236,000 veterans remaining on VA's \nwaiting list to see a doctor because the VA would not be able to hire \nadditional staff to reduce the backlog of veterans waiting to see a \ndoctor. These across-the-board cuts are simply not acceptable. They are \nreal cuts.\n  If Senators care about health care for our veterans, if you care \nabout homeland security, if you care about the National Institutes of \nHealth, you should support this amendment regardless of political \nparty; you should support this amendment.\n  I urge Members to support my amendment to strike this arbitrary and \nill-considered cut.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time. How much time do I \nhave left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fourteen minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I understand the position of the Senator \nfrom West Virginia. However, I wish to state the policy of this \namendment that I have offered is that it does not go below the level of \nthe 2002 appropriations that are the basis for the continuing \nresolution is in effect now.\n  I took the position if we went below the funding level that is out \nthere now based on the 2002 level of appropriated funds, Members would \nsay: Wait a minute, we are better off to continue on the 2002 level. \nThe Senator's statement about what was cut are cuts from the proposal \nwe brought before, and I joined him in bringing that before the \nCongress last year.\n  We are not cutting any veterans. We are not cutting out anyone who is \nreceiving care now. We are cutting out the increase that would have \nbeen available under the bills that were pending before the Congress \nlast year.\n  As a practical matter, there may be some items where the programs had \nbeen ramped up because of a supplemental. We are working on the basis \nof the appropriated level of funds for 2002. In some instances, the \ncontinuing resolution does ramp up a little bit, as we found out with \nregard to an item that was before us last night in the amendment we \ndealt with just before we went home.\n  I do believe the Senator's amendment, as I understand it, strikes the \noffsets. We are back at the question of whether the Senate wants to \ndiscipline itself. We had no budget resolution last year. That was not \nthe fault of any action of the Appropriations Committee under the \nchairmanship of the Senator from West Virginia or myself. We had no \nbudget resolution. Had we had a budget resolution, we would have had a \nlevel of discipline, and that is the ceiling that had been established \nby the budget resolution.\n  The President sent a budget to the Congress, and it was limited to \n$750.5 billion. We have before us a proposal that limits that to $751.3 \nbillion because the President submitted a subsequent request and \namended his budget for the fire program of $825 million.\n  Lacking any other basis for a level of discipline, after the \nelection, Senator Byrd and I, Congressman Young, and Congressman Obey \ngot together and agreed we would hold the level of the President's \n$750.5 billion if we could get the bills done at that time. We did not \nget them done, and when we came back, the President asked me to join \nhim and asked if I would continue the quest for a limit at that level \nof $750.5 billion. He agreed at that time to give us the $825 million \nfor the fire program.\n  The offsets listed in title VI, which Senator Byrd would strike, are \noffsets that are necessary to achieve basically two things: One is the \nfull funding for the amount that can be spent of the election reform \nbill in the 7\\1/2\\ to 8 months that are remaining, a bill that is \nabsolutely necessary to be funded and put into place if we are to \navoid, or at least try to avoid the problems of the election in the \nyear 2000. This would modernize the election system throughout the \ncountry. This was a bipartisan bill that was passed, and this is its \nfunding.\n\n  Secondly, the tremendous drought disaster areas of the country demand \nhelp. We faced a problem of how to deal with that, so we added the \nmonies for drought and disaster to this bill and we offset it by an \nacross-the-board cut in all programs.\n  That, again, is dealing with the basic problems of the country in a \nway that we will take these to conference, and we hope to come out of \nthe conference with a bill approved by the House, that the President \nwill sign, that will not exceed the $751.3 billion level but will take \ncare of these and hopefully keep the two basic programs, drought \ndisaster and election reform, and hopefully stay within the level we \nhave agreed to try to achieve, and that is the $751.3 billion.\n  Our goal is to cover these, and we intend to cover them within the \nbill without across-the-board cuts. I do not know if we can get there. \nWe know the House disagrees with a series of things that the Senate \nadded. The Senate still has basic items above the President's budget \nrequest in most instances. So the House may want us to come down on a \nseries of those. We are going to conference, and for the first time we \nwill deal, through the full committee process, with 11 of the 13 bills, \nan enormous undertaking.\n  The only way we can get the two critical items to conference, in \norder to stay within our stated goal and demonstrate that we are going \nto stay within that goal to limit our expenditure to $751.3 billion, we \nprovide for an across-the-board cut. I personally think it is going to \nend up somewhere around 1 percent by the time we are finished.\n  If there is not a 1-percent slush in every item in this budget, then \nI really have not been here 34 years, going on 35. These bills are \nestimates, and we are reducing estimates by 1 percent in order to take \nto the President the final bill at the level he sees fit to set. I \nthink it is a legitimate objective.\n  Again, if we were not in the process of dealing with the post-9/11 \nsituation, if we were not in the process of building up to try to \nprotect the interests of our country abroad and our allies in terms of \nIraq, if we were not dealing with the problems in Korea, if we did not \nhave the problems we have abroad--they are all military in nature--we \nprobably would not have this problem because we have already passed the \ntwo bills, the military construction bill and the Defense \nappropriations bill.\n  Even in this bill we have given the President an additional amount of \nmoney for intelligence and activities with relationship to the problems \nI have mentioned, and we have emphasized the protection in training and \nequipment for our men and women who are in uniform. There is no \nquestion about that. That has strained the national budget, and it has \nled the President of the United States to urge us to hold this level to \n$751.3 billion.\n  I urge the Senate to defeat the Senator's amendment. I know across \nthe Senate, if this becomes final, people are going to say this is \ngoing to be down, that is going to be down, and that is true. There are \ngoing to be some accounts that are not as high as we would like to have \nthem, and as I would like to have them, but there is going to be a \nbudget the President will sign, and we can go on to the work of 2004.\n  We are trying to get behind us the problems of the last Congress. I \nreally\n\n[[Page S1109]]\n\nfeel very uncomfortable about the fact that we are trying to pass 11 \nbills that should have been passed by the last Congress, and I have \nbeen trying to do it in a way that no one says who shot John or why \nwould we not pass them. In my opinion, one of the main reasons is we \ndid not have a budget resolution. We did not have a budget resolution \nfor a lot of reasons.\n  In any event, we do not have one now, and the only way I know to get \nthis bill to conference is to insist upon maintaining the discipline \nthat is required to show we are going to get a bill to the President \nthat he will sign.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use my leader time to talk to this \namendment.\n  I compliment the distinguished Senator from West Virginia for his \namendment. I think this is one of the most important amendments we will \nvote on in this entire debate. He is simply restoring the across-the-\nboard cut, as he indicated and outlined. We are now at a 2.9-percent \nacross-the-board cut. That 2.9 percent represents at least $16 billion, \nover and above the other $5 billion that was cut, a total of $21 \nbillion from discretionary accounts.\n  We have done an analysis of what those cuts actually mean in real-\nlife terms. Those cuts mean the elimination of 1,175 FBI agents. There \nare 1,175 FBI agents who will lose their jobs if this cut goes into \neffect as it is now proposed.\n  The FBI Web site lists 10 priorities. The No. 1 priority is to \nprotect the United States from terrorist attack.\n  The No. 2 priority is to protect the United States against foreign \nintelligence operations and espionage. The No. 3 priority is to protect \nthe United States against cyberspace attacks in high-technology crime; \nNo. 4, combat public corruption at all levels; No. 5, protect civil \nrights.\n  Which of these priorities will be sacrificed as a result of the loss \nof 1,175 FBI agents? Would we do that to the military? Would we do it \nto the National Guard? Would we do it in any other context as we \nconsider the war on terror and the need to fulfill our constitutional \nresponsibility to protect and defend this country against all enemies, \nforeign and domestic? I do not think so. Why would we cut 1,175 FBI \nagents at this time?\n  We have had serious food safety issues over the course of the last \ndecade. I was chairman of a Subcommittee on Agriculture when the whole \nE. coli crisis broke out. I can recall so vividly families talking \nabout their children being poisoned as a result of E. coli. Why? In \npart, because we did not have enough food safety inspectors. This 2.9-\npercent reduction, this $21 billion, will cut 490 food inspectors from \nour system today. We will have 490 fewer food inspectors. This will cut \n230,000 veterans who are now getting medical services. How ironic it is \nthat as we send people to the Persian Gulf to fight for this country \nand we tell those who are already there we are going to cut them off; \nthey are not going to have the medical assistance; they are not going \nto get the care.\n  I cannot begin to imagine how, in the name of fiscal discipline or \nanything else, so long as that huge tax cut is out there, our \ncolleagues on the other side could possibly rationalize advocacy for a \ntax cut of that magnitude, leaving no millionaire behind, while we tell \nveterans they are not going to get medical services, while we tell the \nFBI, with all of its priorities, they are not going to have the kind of \nagent support for 1,175 FBI agents, we are going to eliminate their \njobs.\n  How in the world, with all the dangers there are in food safety, can \nwe say we do not need 500 food safety inspectors today?\n  That is what we are saying. That is what anybody is saying if they \nvote against Senator Byrd's amendment. I hope people will rethink this. \nAs I said, this whole budget business that we are facing now is \nbizarre. We cannot afford $6 billion for education. We cannot afford $5 \nbillion for homeland defense. We cannot afford the money for 1,175 FBI \nagents. But we can afford an $89,000 tax cut for 226,000 \nmillionaires. I do not get it. I hope our colleagues will follow the \nwise counsel and leadership of our colleague from West Virginia. Let's \nvote for the Byrd amendment. Let's put some sanity into the budget \nprocess, into these appropriations bills this year.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from West Virginia yield me time?\n  Mr. BYRD. How much time does the Senator want?\n  Mr. REID. Six minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield 6 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I very much appreciate our leadership laying out the \nproblem. Yesterday, instead of the FBI losing the number of agents it \nis losing today, 1,175 agents, it was 800. Each day, more FBI agents \nare lost because of this ridiculous procedure we are going through.\n  For my friend, and he is my friend, the Senator from Alaska, who I \ncare a great deal about--I have served with him all my time in the \nSenate on the Appropriations Committee--for him to say we are funding \nelection reform out of this, is that not good? It is money they are \nstealing from other accounts. Next, are they going to take care of \nprescription drugs by cutting off domestic discretionary spending?\n  Anyone who votes against Senator Byrd today is voting against the \nFBI, literally; 1,175 FBI agents will be eliminated.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield on my time?\n  Mr. REID. For a question?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Sure.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Where does the Senator get those figures? The FBI \nreceived $3.49 billion in fiscal year 2002 and this bill has $3.92 \nbillion. Beyond that we provided $158 million in the FBI joint task \nforce. Not one FBI agent will be fired. We will not increase, but not \none will be fired. Where does the Senator get those figures?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Alaska, how he or anyone else can \nwith a straight face say you can do an across-the-board cut--``across \nthe board'' means across the board, equal in every account in domestic \ndiscretionary spending--without money being lost, and without people \nlosing their jobs, that is what it is all about.\n  These budgets, most of them, most every budget we have in the Federal \nGovernment involves employee personnel.\n  Where do the figures come from? They come from our staffs. This comes \nfrom the staff of the Democratic leader.\n  We can dwell on things other than the FBI, but the FBI is being cut. \nTake our word for it. These across-the-board cuts are cutting into the \nvery heart of these programs. He talks about food safety inspectors. \nAnyone voting against Senator Byrd is saying food safety is not too \nimportant; we can do without approximately 500 food inspectors. Anyone \nvoting against Senator Byrd's amendment is saying there is going to be \nabout half a billion cut with Housing and Urban Development, which will \nmean 79,000 fewer families receive housing assistance.\n  To think you can take money from across the board and take care of \nelection reform and other programs without these programs being hurt is \nmystical.\n  There will be a cut in the Customs Service. Already they are to the \nbare bone. I visited the Customs Service in Las Vegas and I was \nastounded 5 years ago how few people worked in the Customs department \nin Las Vegas. In areas where they should have a lot of Customs agents, \nthere will be cutbacks. It will be about 1,600 Customs inspectors being \ncut back. This new cut means fewer agents at borders than prior to \nSeptember 11.\n  We worked very hard to ramp up the spending for NIH. Everyone should \nunderstand when they vote against Senator Byrd's amendment they are \ncutting the NIH by 44 percent, including in biodefense.\n  We estimate there will be about 2,800 children deprived of early \nchildhood education. This new cut on top of the original cuts in the \nBush budget leaves a total of 5,522 children without any services.\n  This $137 million cut in WIC will mean 225,000 women, infants, and \nchildren will be left without nutritional and health care services.\n  The VA is about $700 million, which will mean about 225,000 veterans \nwithout medical services.\n  I agree with Senator George Voinovich, my friend from the State of\n\n[[Page S1110]]\n\nOhio, quoted as saying just a few days ago ``as far as the eye can see, \nI see red.'' That is what this is all about.\n  For my friend, my good friend, from the State of Alaska, to talk \nabout this is a difficult job, that is an understatement. That is an \nunderstatement to try to come up with what they are doing. I heard my \nfriend from Alaska promise one of my colleagues: we will take care of \nit in conference. The House is quoted as saying they will have the bill \nless than we have. It is magic that I don't think exists \ncongressionally. It is magic that I don't think exists legislatively.\n  I say to the Senator from West Virginia, thank you very much. This is \nthe vote of this bill. We are asking they do away with the across-the-\nboard cuts. If they want to spend more money in these programs, get \nreal money--not funny money--because they are stealing from the \nAmerican people and trying to come up with a budget that is impossible \nand exists by magic.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has 8\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished Senator from North \nDakota, Mr. Dorgan.\n  Mr. DORGAN. This across-the-board cut is not a good idea. We need to \nmake the right investments in the right agencies, to protect the \nAmerican people, especially with respect to homeland security. These \nacross-the-board cuts are not the right thing to do. Everyone knows \nthat.\n  My colleague talked about the number of veterans that will be \naffected with respect to the diminished veterans health care, as well \nas the FBI. My colleague from Alaska, for whom I have great respect, \nsaid we will increase that budget. That is true. But if this is a cut, \nit is a cut. It is a cut below the anticipated level of spending in \nthese areas.\n  It has been said this morning that part of the reason for this is to \ngive farmers some help. Providing some money to help farmers who have \nexperienced disaster is very important. But we did that last year by a \nwide bipartisan vote in the Senate and proposed a $5.9 billion program \non an emergency basis. What is being proposed today, apparently--I read \nin the paper--is a $3.1 billion proposition that will send drought aid \nto farmers who never had a drought. I don't understand that. What are \nwe thinking about? Let's pass the disaster aid we passed last year for \nfamily farmers on an emergency basis, and then let's deal with the \nspending needs we have in this country. Yes, for the FBI, for the \nCustoms Service, for all of these agencies, especially those engaged in \nhomeland security.\n  Yesterday my colleague from West Virginia talked about the importance \nof homeland security. I understand what is going on. I understand the \nPresident has said, here is a marker; you have to meet that marker. So \nhe wants to cut spending in the FBI, the Customs, Veterans, Health and \nso on, in order to meet his marker.\n  But on the other hand, he says while we are short of money and cannot \nfund what we intended for these funds, let's have a tax cut of $675 \nbillion over 10 years. I don't understand the priority here. Either we \nhave a homeland security issue we need to respond to or we do not.\n  My colleague from West Virginia said earlier today the head of the \nFBI told us we are in as much jeopardy today as we were the day before \nSeptember 11 with respect to the potential threat from terrorists. If \nthat is the case, how can anyone say we cannot fully fund the needs we \nanticipated earlier with respect to the FBI, the Customs Service, and \nothers?\n  I understand what is going on. I understand someone had to bring to \nthe floor the President's marker with respect to spending, but it is \nnot right to do this across-the-board cut in order to meet that \nartificial level, especially at a time when the President says there is \nplenty of money for a $675 billion tax cut over the next 10 years. In \nterms of priorities, that is the wrong priority for this country.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment my friend and colleague from \nAlaska for his leadership on this bill. I have great respect for the \nSenator from West Virginia, and he is very consistent in wanting to \nspend more money in this bill. He tried yesterday and didn't win, so \nnow he says, let's eliminate the reductions across the board. The net \nimpact of that would be $11.4 billion this year. You might say that \nalso would increase the base that we put in the budget, so that would \nbe compounded every year, so this amendment would cost at least $120 \nbillion assuming no inflation--probably closer to $140- or $150 \nbillion--over those years.\n  I have heard my colleague say we are cutting the FBI. The FBI went \nfrom $3.4 billion to $4.1 if you add the two accounts together.\n  I heard my colleague say they are cutting the NIH. That went from \n$27.2 billion and received a $3.8 billion increase.\n  I just heard my colleague say we are cutting the VA; we are hurting \nveterans and veterans health care. Veterans care went from $23.9 and \nreceived a $2.6 billion increase, over a 10-percent increase.\n  When people are saying we are having cuts and it is going to cost \nthousands of jobs, it reminds me of somebody saying we are going to \ngive you $1,000. Then they say we changed our mind, we are giving you \n$900--you just lost $100. We are talking about big increases, funding \nthe priorities. I congratulate my colleague and urge my colleagues to \nvote no on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, fear is a terrible quotient in the \npolitical spectrum. And the fear that an across-the-board cut might \nreduce the level of spending today, spending under the 2002 \nappropriations level, is a great one.\n  But I can state to the Senate without equivocation, not one FBI agent \nwill be cut, not one will be lost. We have an increase, again, of \nnearly $500 million in the overall FBI level--rounded off a little bit. \nWe have another increase of $158 million for the Joint Terrorism Task \nForce. An across-the-board cut to those two increases, $436.5 million \nfor the FBI and $158.5 for the Joint Terrorism Task Force, is about $80 \nmillion. That still represents an increase for those two programs. An \nacross-the-board cut would not reduce the FBI at all--there would be no \nreduction. The Department of Justice would still receive an increase of \nwell over a billion dollars after the across-the-board cut.\n  I have respect for my friend with regard to facing the problem of an \nacross-the-board cut. It is an indiscriminate cut and that is why I \ndon't like it. It goes across the board and says take from each account \nso much money in order to achieve putting all the items you want to \ntake to conference into conference. But remember, it is a mechanism to \nget to conference.\n  I could eliminate all of the across-the-board cuts if I took out all \nof the add-ons from that side of the aisle, or take out all the add-ons \nfrom this side of the aisle, the Members' requests. If the Senate wants \nme to do it, I will put them in the Record. They total a considerable \namount more than 2 percent of the budget.\n  Under the circumstances, to accuse me of some strange tactic by \nhaving an across-the-board cut to accommodate those requests, take them \nto the conference with the House and see how much the House will allow \nus to add, for these Members to add, I think is a little duplicitous.\n  So before I am accused of cutting the FBI or cutting milk for babies \nor something such as that, keep in mind, if it keeps up, I will not put \nthem in. We could take every one of them out with just one single \namendment. If the Senate wants to do that, we wouldn't have any across-\nthe-board cut at all. Take the Members' accounts out of this bill and \nthere will be no across-the-board cut.\n  I suggest the defeat of the amendment of the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n  Mr. KERRY. I strongly support the Byrd amendment to strike title VI \nof\n\n[[Page S1111]]\n\ndivision N from the omnibus appropriations bill. Title VI includes a \nprovision which would impose a 1.6 percent across-the-board reduction \non all domestic spending. These cuts follow an earlier $9.8 billion \nreduction in domestic spending from the Senate Appropriations Committee \npassed spending bills. Together, these cuts will reduce domestic \nspending by more than $20 billion and will force punitive cuts in \nveterans health care, housing, education, homeland security, highway \nfunding, Amtrak, the National Institutes of Health, Head Start, WIC and \nother important national priorities.\n  Today, we are not meeting our promises to our veterans. The \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, VA, has consistently received \ninadequate resources to meet rising medical costs and a growing demand \nfor its health services. In November 2001, Secretary of Veterans \nAffairs Principi identified a $400 million funding shortfall for fiscal \nyear 2002. As a result of this shortfall, more than 300,000 veterans \nthroughout the country are on waiting lists for medical care, and many \nmust wait 6 months or longer for an appointment to see medical staff. \nAlthough Congress provided $417 million for veterans health care as \npart of the fiscal year 2002 emergency supplemental spending bill, \npassed in July 2002, the President agreed to spend only $142 million of \nthe approved funds. In addition to the fact that the VA health system \nmust now overcome the severely inadequate amount provided in fiscal \nyear 2002, the VA has also been operating at last year's funding level \nsince the onset of the 2003 fiscal year in October.\n  This funding crisis has forced the VA health system to resort to \nshort-term fixes, such as discontinuing outreach activities in an \neffort to reduce enrollment and instituting new regulations that \nrequire the rationing of health care. Moreover, the VA has already \nreduced services at a number of facilities throughout the country and \nhas closed some facilities altogether. It is crucial for the VA to \nreceive an increase in fiscal year 2003 medical care funding provided \nin both the Senate and House Appropriations Committee bills. Instead, \nthe Republican majority has decided to impose an additional 1.6 percent \nreduction to the already inadequate levels of funding for veterans \nservices.\n  Today, our Nation is facing an affordable housing crisis. For \nthousands upon thousands of low-income families with children, the \ndisabled, and the elderly, privately owned affordable housing is simply \nout of reach. Recent changes in the housing market have further limited \nthe availability of affordable housing across the country, while the \ngrowth in our economy in the last decade has dramatically increased the \ncost of the housing that remains.\n  The Department of Housing and Urban Development, HUD, estimates that \nmore than 5 million American households have what is considered worst \ncase housing needs. Since 1990, the number of families that have worst \ncase housing needs has increased by 12 percent, that is 600,000 more \nAmerican families that cannot afford a decent and safe place to live.\n  Despite the fact that more families are unable to afford housing, we \nhave decreased Federal spending on critical housing programs such as \nthe Public Housing Capital Fund, elderly housing, and Public Housing \nDrug Elimination Grants since fiscal year 1995.\n  Earlier this month HUD also announced plans to dramatically reduce \nthe amount of funding available for the operation of public housing by \nup to 30 percent. This would cost the city of Boston approximately $13 \nmillion in housing funding during fiscal year 2003. This additional \nacross-the-board cut would impose even further cuts in the operation of \npublic housing. This is simply unacceptable to those who depend upon \nhousing assistance.\n  These are just two examples of the arbitrary cuts will be imposed on \nevery domestic program, many of which already are inadequately funded. \nThat is why I strongly support the Byrd amendment and urge my \ncolleagues to support it as well.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, as the now ranking member on the Committee \non Veterans' Affairs, I must make my fellow Senators aware of the \nimpact of the proposed across-the-board cut in the appropriations for \nthe executive branch for fiscal year 2003 on the Department of Veterans \nAffairs and its ability to provide health care and benefits to our \nNation's veterans.\n  Yesterday morning we were talking about a 1.6 percent cut, of which \nVA's share would be over $424 million. But let me put that in context. \nThat would have meant that 125,000 fewer veterans will be seen in VA's \nhospitals, that 250 benefits claims adjudicators would lose their jobs. \nAnd it would mean that a hiring freeze would be in place across the VA. \nThese cuts are being put into place at a time when there are 235,000 \nveterans waiting over 6 months for an appointment at VA. It takes an \naverage of 200 days for a veterans disability claim to be decided. But \ntoday we are talking about a 2.9 percent cut across the board. VA has \nnot computed what this will mean to America's veterans yet.\n  Let me be more specific, so that my colleagues can understand the \nconsequence of this decision. The proposed 2.9 percent cut would cost \nthe Veterans Health Administration almost $695 million of the $2.4 \nbillion increase VA health care was slated to receive. The VA-HUD \nAppropriations Committee recognized VA's dire need for health care \nresources, and responded accordingly in a bipartisan effort last year.\n  Meanwhile, VA announced just today that in light of rapidly rising \nnumbers of veterans coming to VA for health care and prescription \ndrugs, they will have to cut off enrollment for a certain category of \nveterans. How can we possibly consider cutting funding now, in the face \nof such sharply rising demand for VA health care? There are over 44,000 \nveterans waiting half a year to see a doctor in my home State of \nFlorida right now--this is unacceptable. The system clearly needs \nhigher increases in funding, not decreases.\n  Mr. President, it is also important to point out that a vital segment \nof the VA health system will receive a drastic cut as a result of this \nproposal, VA research. This program is invaluable not only to the \nveteran community, but to the Nation as a whole. VA research is \nresponsible for advances such as the CT and MRI scans, the cardiac \npacemaker, and performing the first kidney transplant. The \ngroundbreaking dynamic of the VA research program also serves to \nattract leading researchers and physicians to VA. Reducing funding for \nthis program is a true disservice to all Americans.\n  On the benefits side, this is a true cut. The original Senate-\nreported amount of $992 million will be reduced by $29 million. VA has \nbeen battling a backlog of claims. It has been making some progress. \nThe VA Secretary has set a goal of deciding new claims within 100 days \nby the end of this fiscal year. He will not meet his target with this \nappropriation. As I said, FTE will be cut. There will be a hiring \nfreeze. While the Florida office is now doing slightly better than the \nnational average, it still takes 155 days to process a claim.\n  In addition, the nationwide overtime authorized at various regional \noffices to process disability claims will be severely curtailed. \nCurrently, each regional office is averaging 40 overtime hours per \nmonth. This overtime program has resulted in a reduction in the pending \nclaims backlog. An across- the-board reduction in overtime will mean \nthat veterans will have to wait longer to have their claims reviewed. \nThe accuracy in decisionmaking will drop. We must restore funding \nbefore the backlog grows again to unmanageable proportions.\n  As you all know, the veterans' population is aging rapidly. We are \nlosing over 1,200 World War II veterans per day. While the VA is \nattempting to make a special effort to adjudicate claims of veterans \nover the age of 70, every day a veteran dies while his or her claim is \nawaiting a decision.\n  I understand that there are many competing demands being placed on \nthe executive branch right now. But in a time when the White House can \nafford to offer a tax cut of $640 billion, and in time when we are \nasking the men and women in the military to go back into harm's way, \ncan we really afford to turn our backs on them when they return from \nwar?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has 5 minutes. \nThe Senator from Alaska has 11\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if I may have the attention of the Senator \nfrom\n\n[[Page S1112]]\n\nAlaska, nobody has accused the Senator from Alaska of anything that is \nwrong, any underhanded tricks, any tactics that are inappropriate. The \nSenator from Alaska is trying to do the bidding of this President. And \nthe bidding of the President is we will take an arbitrary figure.\n  Here are Senator Hollings and Senator Gregg and the members of their \ncommittees--they work hard. They determine what is right for the FBI \nand for the other items in their budget. They make that determination \nbased on their hearings, based on the testimony that is educed from \nthose hearings, based on common sense. These two Senators I have \nmentioned have been in this business for a long time. They know what \nthey are doing.\n  Then to come along with an arbitrary figure--I am not accusing the \nSenator from Alaska of anything. I would be the last to do that. If he \nwants to cut out the add-ons, let him do it. He can cut out mine if he \nwants and cut out his. We are not going to play blindman's bluff here. \nIf you want to, cut those out. Those add-ons are for the people we \nrepresent, for the installations in our home towns. We can defend those \nadd-ons. There is nothing I care about being secret on as to those add-\nons.\n  But what I am talking about here is the fact that we are not \nexercising good judgment based on facts. What we are doing is taking an \narbitrary figure that is set by this administration downtown, and the \ndistinguished Senator from Alaska is doing a good soldier's work.\n  I would never complain about the Senator from Alaska. But I would say \nto you, Mr. President, these are real cuts. These are real cuts. And it \nis unwise to cut across the board. That is not the way to make cuts. \nThat is not the way to reduce spending--across the board. That is \nunfair. It is unwise. That is what we are doing.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I yield.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator will yield----\n  Mr. BYRD. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has 2 minutes \n50 seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will be brief. I just want to buttress what the Senator \nis saying about real cuts. Listen to this.\n  Mr. BYRD. Save me 1 minute, I say to the Chair.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The cut to NIH. We have worked hard here on a bipartisan \nbasis to double the funding in 5 years. This is the last installment \nthis year. The cuts we now have before us will cut $778 million out of \nthe NIH. That is more than the entire budget for research on \nAlzheimer's disease.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. It is more than the NIH's entire budget for research on \nbreast cancer.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. It is more than the NIH's entire budget, now get this, \nfor research on prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, Parkinson's disease, \nand muscular dystrophy all combined.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is a real cut. The Senator from West Virginia is \nright, that is big.\n  Mr. BYRD. And this amendment impugns the good judgment of the Senator \nwho is now speaking to me and his counterpart from Pennsylvania.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Senator Specter.\n  Mr. BYRD. Those two Senators have chaired that committee and they \nhave worked hard. They have used their good judgment based on the \ntestimony and based on the facts.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Precisely.\n  Mr. BYRD. They are saying to these two Senators and the members of \nthat subcommittee: Forget your experience, forget your wisdom, forget \nwhat you say. We are going to have an arbitrary figure. It doesn't mean \nanything; it is just a figure. And you are going to suffer. Your people \nare going to suffer--your people back home, my people.\n  It is unwise. It is unfair. It is unjustified. It is unreal. And I \nsay every Senator in this body ought to think, ought to look in the \nmirror when he or she casts this vote and be ready to go back home and \ntell his constituents or her constituents: I did it.\n  Mr. President, this record is going to follow Senators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. I reserve my 1 minute.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Senator is entitled to his last \nminute.\n  Let me tell the Senator about NIH. In fiscal year 2002, we had $23.45 \nbillion. In this bill, we have $27.15 billion. That is an increase of \nalmost $4 billion. An across-the-board cut takes out about $300 \nmillion. It does not reduce anything.\n  In my chairmanship----\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator will yield----\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am not yielding. In my chairmanship, when I was \nchairman before, we doubled NIH. I am proud of that. We have not \nreduced that level. We have increased it.\n  No Senator on this side need fear we are cutting one FBI agent, \ntaking one dollar away from the existing level of NIH, or taking one \ndollar away from anything. The guideline, again, was we kept the level \nof 2002 in every account.\n  That is a continuing resolution. To reduce the level that they are \ntraveling on now would be wrong. We are increasing every one by passing \nthose three bills. That is why we want to pass them.\n  Look at them. You can go down these Departments. Every one of them \ngets some kind of increase because of the fact we are going from 2002 \nto 2003. An across-the-board cut takes less than 2 percent out of all \nof them, if we have to do that when we come out of conference. We don't \nbelieve we will have to.\n  I really respect my friend from West Virginia. But I am carrying the \nPresident's torch, which is ``remember the deficits.'' People on this \nside reminded us of the deficits every day this last week. The \nPresident said: Remember the deficits. Get a guideline. Take my number \nfor a guideline. I said: We will do that. We will take your number, we \nwill take it to conference, and we will hold it coming out of \nconference and you will have a bill you can sign.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the President says, ``Remember the \ndeficits.'' I say remember the $1.6 trillion tax cut that was enacted \nby this body and the other body last year. I say, let us not enact a \n$670 billion tax cut that this President and this administration is \nsuggesting Congress pass. Tax cuts will add to the deficit.\n  This is where the deficit cuts lie. These are not mere computational \nexercises. These are not mere budgetary exercises. These are real cuts. \nThese mean something to the people out there in connection with their \nsafety, their health, their welfare, and the security of their \nhomeland. I say, Senators, look in the mirror when you cast this vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second. The question is on agreeing to the \namendment. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Nebraska (Mr. Hagel) \nis necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) \nis necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``Aye''.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are they any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 46, nays 52, as follows:\n\n                       [Rollcall Vote No. 7 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--46\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham (FL)\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--52\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n\n[[Page S1113]]\n\n\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Hagel\n     Kerry\n  The amendment (No. 36) was rejected.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I hope Senators will listen.\n  Rarely in recent memory has the United States faced more profoundly \nserious and complicated challenges to our global leadership. We are \nbeginning our second year of war in Afghanistan, our second year of \nchasing after Osama bin Laden, and at the same time the Pentagon is \nfeverishly mobilizing for possible war in Iraq. Meanwhile, North Korea \nis firing up its nuclear production facilities and warning of a third \nworld war in Asia if the United States dares to interfere.\n  Suddenly large swathes of both the Middle East and Asia are on the \nbrink of open warfare, and the conduct of U.S. foreign policy is facing \nenormous tests. Even our allies are questioning our real intentions and \nour ultimate ambitions. This is certainly not the time for rash words \nor hasty action, but it is most definitely the time to take a long and \nsober look at where the United States has been and where it may be \nheaded.\n  The administration's doctrine of preemption and the testing of that \ndoctrine in Iraq have thrust the United States into a new and \nunflattering posture on the world stage.\n  In many corners of the world, America the peacemaker is now seen as \nthe bully on the block. I believe it is time for this administration to \nreview our national security strategy and its take-no-prisoners \napproach to international relations. In working through the complex \nprocess of developing strategies to protect the world from terrorists \nand weapons of mass destruction, we must also work to restore the image \nof the United States to that of strong peacekeeper instead of \nbelligerent bully.\n  Terrorism is a global threat and it demands a global response. We \nmust seek cooperation, not confrontation. The contrast between the \nadministration's handling of the crisis in Iraq and its handling of the \ncrisis in North Korea is a perfect illustration of why a doctrine that \ncommits the United States to the use of preemptive force, unilaterally \nif necessary, to prevent unsavory regimes from acquiring weapons of \nmass destruction is a flawed instrument of foreign policy.\n  I am relieved that the administration, despite North Korea's alarming \nrhetoric, appears to fully comprehend the folly of a preemptive U.S. \nmilitary strike on a nation which we believe is a nuclear power.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the debate \nhas to be germane during the first 3 hours of the consideration of the \nbill under the so-called Pastore rule and that that be enforced.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Pastore rule, as I understand it, has \nrun its course. The Senator is talking about the Pastore rule.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask for a ruling from the Chair raising \na point of order that during the first 3 hours of legislation it has to \nbe germane to the pending legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). The Senator is \ncorrect that the Pastore rule requires that debate be germane during \nthe first 3 hours of consideration of the measure.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this debate is germane. I have not finished \nmy speech yet. I hope the Senator will show me the courtesy that I \nwould show him.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I raise the point of order that the debate \nis not germane at this time during the first 3 hours of the debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is entitled under precedent to a \nreminder under this rule.\n  Mr. BYRD. What is the Chair's ruling?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the rule, Senator, you are entitled to \none reminder about the germaneness.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, there is $3.9 billion in this bill in \ndefense funding for related activities. What I am saying, I think, is \nvery germane to what we are talking about. The Senator from Arizona \nhasn't shown me the courtesy of even hearing my speech.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, again I ask for a ruling of the Chair. The \nremarks the Senator from West Virginia is making are in a manager's \namendment and not included in the present bill.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am speaking about the defense of this \ncountry. This bill involves the defense of this country. There is $3.9 \nbillion in this bill for national defense.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia, the Chair has \nruled, is within the confines of the rule and the topic in question is \ngermane.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, let me go back in my speech and pick up where I was \ninterrupted. I have been in Congress more than 50 years. There have \nbeen 11,707 Members of the House and Senate since the Republic began. I \nam the fourth--only three Members, men and women, of all the 11,707 men \nand women elected to both Houses in the Congress exceed me. And here I \nam making a speech on what I consider to be important, and I think it \nis very germane to what we are talking about. We are talking about the \nnational defense of this country when we have this appropriation bill \nup. We are talking about the expenditures for the military in this \nbill. We are facing a situation in which we may be spending more and \nmore and more money for the military. I thank the Chair for the ruling. \nI am just sorry I was interrupted on this matter. I would not interrupt \nthe Senator from Arizona concerning germaneness on a speech he maybe \nmaking at any time. I would not do that.\n\n  I will back up and then pick up where I was interrupted. I am \nrelieved that the administration, despite North Korea's alarming \nrhetoric, appears to fully comprehend the folly of a preemptive \nmilitary strike on a nation which we believe is a nuclear power, and \nhas finally agreed to at least talk with the North Korean government \nand to work with other nations in the region toward a diplomatic \nsolution to the crisis.\n  The situation in Iraq, however, appears to be heading in the opposite \ndirection. Iraq, which, by all accounts, does not have nuclear weapons, \nand is presently the subject of scrutiny by U.N. inspectors, is under \nthe heavy threat of a preemptive U.S. attack. The airwaves are awash \nwith video snapshots of brave young American soldiers bidding tearful \ngoodbyes to loved ones. When it comes to Iraq, America's war machine \nseems to be cranked up to a fever pitch. This is going to cost money, \nreal money. We have talked about a 2.9 percent across-the-board cut \nhere in domestic discretionary spending. Nobody is saying anything \nabout a cut in military spending, no. I am not advocating that. I want \nto face up to the situation that confronts us. I want the American \npeople to start looking and listening to what is going on.\n  Ever since Congress voted last year to hand to the President the \npower to decide--we did that; Congress did that over my obstreperous \nobjection, vociferous objection; Congress did that. Twenty-three \nMembers of the Senate did not do that. Twenty-three Members decided to \nvote against handing this power over to the President, the power to \ndeclare war. Ever since Congress voted last year to hand to the \nPresident the power to decide why, when, how, and where we will wage \nwar against Iraq, the question of whether we should wage war has \nlargely been overlooked.\n  It is past time to remedy that omission. Where is the debate on the \nwisdom of actually resorting to force? Is that going to cost money? \nWhere is the debate? How much is it going to cost? How many men and \nwomen in the Armed Forces are we likely to lose? What may happen here \nat home in the\n\n[[Page S1114]]\n\nwar against terrorism? Where is the urgency? Why not let the inspectors \ndo their job? Why are our allies backing away?\n  Congress made a serious mistake in passing the open-ended use-of-\nforce authorization last year, but we only compound that mistake by \nsitting idly by while the Pentagon draws up war plans--costly war \nplans--and sends our young men and women abroad.\n  Now is the time for informed debate. Here we are about to go out for \na recess. It is time for us to look at this matter. It is facing us. \nNow is the time for informed debate, and now is the time for a public \nexamination of where we are headed and why.\n  The President has stated repeatedly that he has not decided whether \nto invade Iraq. We must take him at his word. It is my hope that he \nwill not rush to judgment. The situation demands a careful and thorough \nexamination of the views of our allies, the costs in money, the costs \nin lives, the risks before any final conclusion that war is the only \nrecourse.\n  Congress must be part of that debate. The United Nations must be part \nof that debate. A vote taken last fall should not constrain Members of \nCongress from reevaluating the situation in light of recent \ndevelopments. However bad it was--and it was very bad, I think--the \nuse-of-force resolution passed by Congress last October did not impose \nan oath of silence on Congress or on the American people. It did not \nprohibit the continued questioning of the administration's decisions \nwith regard to Iraq. This may be difficult to do when the war drums are \nbeating, but that is sometimes the uncomfortable role of the true \npatriot.\n  Mr. President, without so much as a whisper of debate, our Nation is \nactually mobilizing to attack a sovereign state before U.N. weapons \ninspectors have even made serious headway in their work. Is this what \nthe policy of preemption means: That we preempt evidence and move to \nattack based on suspicions?\n  The administration's new policy of preemption has repercussions far \nbeyond Iraq. Other nations are watching what we are doing. North Korea \nis one of those nations. Even Brazil is reported to be contemplating \nthe development of nuclear weapons as an insurance policy against \npossible attack.\n  Iraq and North Korea are both charter members of the President's \ninfamous ``axis of evil,'' and yet at the same time that the President \nis turning the heat up on Iraq, he and his administration have been \nvigorously downplaying the crisis in North Korea.\n  Iraq has at least allowed U.N. weapons inspectors into the country. \nNorth Korea threw them out. Iraq, to the best of our knowledge, does \nnot currently have nuclear weapons. North Korea, on the other hand, has \nbrazenly admitted that it is working to develop nuclear weapons, and \nthere is evidence that it already has some nuclear capability. Iraq at \nleast is going through the motions of cooperating with the United \nNations. Meanwhile, North Korea has announced its withdrawal from the \nNuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, threatened to resume missile testing, \nand declared that U.N. sanctions will mean war. Yet the United States \nis mobilizing for war with Iraq while politely tiptoeing around the far \nmore dangerous situation on the Korean peninsula.\n\n  The President, in the same breath that he assails Saddam Hussein, has \ngone to great lengths to assure the world he has no intention of \ninvading North Korea. Is it any wonder that our allies are scrambling \nto make sense of America's foreign policy? Is it any wonder that the \nnew image of the United States has caused turmoil and puzzlement even \namong our staunchest allies?\n  I am sure many of our friends around the globe wonder why diplomacy \ncan remain an option with a regime as treacherous and threatening as \nNorth Korea and yet can be taken off the table when it comes to a much \nweaker Iraq. I wonder if the administration has calculated enough the \nramifications of a military solution in Iraq not only in terms of \ndollars, but also in terms of bloodshed and hardship in the Middle East \nand terrorist attacks here at home.\n  What is the message we convey to the world if we are eager to apply a \ndoctrine of preemption on those countries with limited ability to \ndefend or counterattack and yet waffle over a preemptive response to \ndangerous regimes with the firepower to get back? Are we not, in \neffect, saying that nuclear weapons and long-range missiles can provide \nsmall countries with an insurance policy against a U.S. preemptive \nstrike? The unanticipated result of this doctrine of preemption may be \nto unleash a global scramble to acquire the means to deter the United \nStates from unprovoked attacks. We could be at the brink of a new type \nof arms race, unleashed by fear of a preemptive U.S. strike.\n  There are many risks to an inconsistent foreign policy that, in some \ncases, threatens the use of force as a first response and, in other \ncases, takes military action off the table entirely. Our national \ntreasure will be increasingly poured into bullets and bombs at a time \nwhen homeland security is an equally pressing concern, or even greater \nconcern. Our efforts to preach peace and restraint as a solution to the \nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict will be sabotaged by our own our own \nforeign policies. American citizens at home will face an increased \nthreat at the hands of terrorists lying in wait for the chance to \ncripple our economy and derail our war machine, and we will be \nincreasingly hard pressed to prevent terrorist destruction because our \nresources will be sucked up--sucked up--by the war machine that now \ndrives our foreign policy.\n  Additionally, if we stay the current course, thousands upon thousands \nof American families will face a painful uprooting. Many of the men and \nwomen who will be sent to Iraq are members of the National Guard and \nReserve. Military officials have said that the activation of National \nGuard and Reserve troops for a war against Iraq could exceed 100,000.\n  The impact of such a large activation will reverberate throughout the \nNation in communities large and small, in the small community of Sophia \nwhere I have lived and where I have voted for these many years. On \nJanuary 7, the Charleston, WV, Gazette reported that a speeding \nmotorist raced through three tollbooths and drove more than 75 miles on \nthe West Virginia Turnpike before any State troopers were available to \npursue him. The problem? The State Police force is suffering a severe \nshortage of troopers. The fear? The situation will get much worse if \nthe 51 West Virginia troopers who are also members of the Guard and \nReserve are called up for duty.\n\n  This problem is not unique to West Virginia. According to the \nCharleston Gazette, law enforcement agencies across the nation, whose \nmembers are heavily represented in the Guard and Reserve, are worried \nabout the impact of a war on their ability to protect the public. And \nlaw enforcement will not be the only profession to be affected by a \nReserve call-up. Members of the Guard and Reserve are not just part-\ntime soldiers--they are also full-time members of their communities, \nholding key jobs. Policemen, firefighters, paramedics, doctors, nurses, \nteachers--their professions run the gamut, and their absences when on \nactive duty leave significant voids for those left behind.\n  America will be at great risk of terrorist attack--we are told--if we \ninvade Iraq. Shortages among the ranks of health and public safety \nprofessionals diverted from their civilian jobs to go to war with Iraq \nwill leave Americans with a perilously thin margin of protection at \nhome just when they are likely to need it most.\n  We must not be in a rush to initiate war against Iraq. Saddam Hussein \nis certainly in no position to launch a strike against the United \nStates with thousands of our troops massed on his doorstep. Iraq will \nnot be able to rebuild its ailing military in the coming months or to \ncovertly produce weapons of mass destruction under the watchful gaze of \nthe U.S. military and the U.N. weapons inspectors. Today's headlines \nreveal that the UN inspectors discovered a cache of empty chemical \nwarheads in an ammunition dump. Who knows what tomorrow's inspections \nmay uncover. Where is the urgency that would drive us to preempt the \ninspectors before they have adequate time to fulfill their mission. \nWhile there is dwindling international support for using the initial \nfindings of the U.N. inspectors as a trigger point for\n\n[[Page S1115]]\n\ninvasion, there is great support for the overall United Nations arms \ninspection program. Saddam Hussein is politically isolated, and the \nworld is virtually unanimous in supporting the disarmament of Iraq. I \nsupport that disarmament.\n  To act precipitously now, however, without the full support of our \nfriends and allies, could cost the United States dearly in the long \nrun. Already, some of our strongest allies in the region, most notably \nTurkey, must chafe at U.S. pressure to join in the war on Iraq. \nAccording to a recent survey by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center, 83 \npercent of Turks oppose allowing U.S. forces to use bases in their \ncountry to attack Iraq. And yet our war plans call for the stationing \nof as many as 80,000 U.S. troops in Turkey. In Europe, the same poll \nfound that large percentages of the population believe that U.S. desire \nto control Iraqi oil is the chief reason that we are considering \nattacking Iraq. These perceptions can only serve to undermine our \nglobal influence in the years to come. If the U.S. can seize Iraq for \nits oil, what other nation might it decide to conquer? These thoughts \nmust be on the minds of those who question our new and belligerent \nforeign policy.\n  The possibility exists that the crisis in Iraq can be resolved \nwithout a shot being fired. With more time and increased diplomatic \nefforts, there is a chance that Saddam Hussein could be peacefully \nforced into exile. But first, the fever pitch of war rhetoric often \nheard from this White House must subside. If we fancy ourselves a \nsuperpower then we must behave as a superpower, with confidence, with \nwisdom, and with dignity.\n  Some very important dates are fast approaching. The first is January \n27, when the United Nations weapons inspectors are due to present to \nthe Security Council their first formal assessment of Iraqi compliance \nwith U.N. disarmament demands. Their interim report, delivered to the \nSecurity Council on January 9, confirmed that Iraq's weapons \ndeclaration was incomplete and insufficient, but the inspectors also \nreported that they have found no ``smoking guns.''\n  I was heartened by Secretary of State Colin Powell's statement that, \ndespite indications to the contrary, January 27 is ``not necessarily a \nD-Day for decision-making.'' We must give the inspectors adequate time \nto conduct a thorough search. While the White House continues to assert \nthat Saddam Hussein possesses weapons of mass destruction, it is \nimportant to note that the United States has just begun to share key \nintelligence information on the Iraqi weapons program with the U.N. \ninspectors. It will take time to pursue those leads. Even our \nstaunchest allies, including Great Britain, are urging the U.S. to slow \ndown on Iraq and let the inspectors do their work. The January 27 \nreport is the first, not the final, step in that process.\n  The second important date on the near horizon is January 28, when \nPresident Bush is due to deliver his State of the Union message. The \ndueling crises in Iraq and North Korea are grim reminders of his last \nState of the Union speech when the President branded those nations and \nIran an ``axis of evil.''\n  The President's rhetoric that evening was colorful, but events have \nproved that it was not wise. I note that the President is now saying \nthat he is ``sick and tired'' of Saddam Hussein. That is just the type \nof rhetoric we do not need at this volatile time. It only adds to our \nimage of bellicosity. President Bush must resist any urge to \npersonalize our foreign policy and tone down the supercharged public \nrhetoric which has been flying around for months. Whether George Bush \nis ``sick and tired'' is not the issue. Whether Robert Byrd is sick and \ntired is not the issue. It must not be perceived as the President's \nreason for sending American men and women to shed their blood in the \nhot sands of Iraq.\n  America must not be viewed globally as a reckless power which views \nthe world in terms of simply flattening the opposition. We must not \ncontinue to brandish our awesome military might, walk away from \ntreaties and cooperative agreements, and ignore nuances and \nsensitivities.\n  We are losing friends all around the world, and that is extremely \nrisky business in an age of globalism and terrorism. A great nation \nshould not have to rely solely on the force of its armies to inspire \nthe world's admiration. A great nation should inspire other nations by \nthe example it presents to the world.\n\n  The doctrine of preemption is likely to cause us trouble far into the \nfuture. Labeling whole countries as ``evil'' invites a response and \nrisks arousing hatreds and passions that are best left sleeping.\n  Setting the United States up as the ultimate judge of good and evil, \nwith the right to preemptively strike any nation which might pose a \nthreat in the future, is the fastest way one can imagine to make us not \nonly feared but also universally hated.\n  When one considers that a single angry person in a crowd with a vial \nof some dreadful, active virus is the equivalent of billions and \nbillions of dollars worth of U.S. military might, it becomes clear that \nwe are making the wrong choices on the foreign policy front.\n  When tensions across the globe are so high, the President would be \nprudent to measure his words carefully and reiterate for all the world \nto hear that he has not yet decided to attack Iraq, that he will fully \nengage in diplomatic solutions to the North Korean crisis, and that the \nUnited States will seek not to initiate war but to apply the soothing \nbalm of patience to an anxious world. I call upon this Administration \nto cool the rhetoric; reevaluate its doctrine of preemption; initiate a \nreturn to the peace table in the Mideast; and go back to the United \nNations for a final endorsement before we decide whether to unleash the \ndeadly dogs of war.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The galleries will refrain from making any \noutbursts.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 44\n\n             (Purpose: To strike section 211 of Division B)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. While I am waiting for the clerk, I mention that I was \ntold by the distinguished manager of the bill after the last vote that \nI would be recognized for the next amendment. That did not happen. In \nthe aspect of senatorial courtesy, I believe I have been given \nassurances that I would propose the next amendment. It is clear we are \non Friday at 12:30, and we have additional amendments, some 40 or 50 \namendments, that will require recorded votes. I think it is important \nat this time we move forward.\n  I intend to be brief in my description of this amendment and ask for \nthe yeas and nays at the appropriate time. I have an amendment at the \ndesk and ask for its reading.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 44.\n       Beginning with line 12 on page 138, strike through line 14 \n     on page 141.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment would strike section 211 of \ndivision B of the resolution. What section 211 of division B does is \npretty incredible. It would give the still-to-be created subsidiary of \nthe Malaysian-owned ``Norwegian Cruise Lines,'' owned by Malaysia, the \nexclusive right to operate foreign-built cruise vessels in the domestic \ncruise trade.\n  Effectively, the provision would allow Norwegian Cruise Lines, which \nbought the pieces and parts of two ``Project America'' cruise vessels \nfollowing the bankruptcy of a company called American Classic Voyages, \nto incorporate these parts into large cruise vessels that would be \nconstructed in foreign shipyards. Then, notwithstanding the Passenger \nVessel Services Act, the provision would allow the Norwegian Cruise \nLines to flag these vessels as if they were U.S.-built vessels and \noperate them in the domestic trade--guess what--requiring service in \nHawaii. The provision also allows the Norwegian Cruise Lines to bring \nover a third foreign-built ship to operate in the United States of \nAmerica, in direct violation of existing law.\n  As many of my colleagues know, I am no fan of the protectionist laws \nthat require domestic cruise ships to be U.S.-owned, U.S.-built, U.S.-\nflagged, and U.S.-crewed. However, I strongly object to waiving these \nlaws for only one foreign-owned company.\n\n[[Page S1116]]\n\n  These proposed vessels have a long and sordid history. The pieces and \nparts that NCL will build into cruise ships have cost the American \ntaxpayers close to $200 million dollars. Again, these parts were bought \nfollowing American Classic Voyages' bankruptcy, which had begun \nconstruction of two vessels in Ingalls Shipyard in Mississippi after \nsecuring loan guarantees from the Federal Government through an \nintensive lobbying effort.\n  Let me provide some history of American Classic Voyages' ``Project \nAmerica'' for the record: The project, which was to consist of the \nconstruction of two large cruise ships in the United States, received \nconsiderable political support over the last several years. This \npolitical support translated into language being included in the \nDepartment of Defense Appropriation Bill for FY 1998 that granted a \nlegal monopoly for its owner, American Classic Voyages, to operate as \nthe only U.S. flagged operator among the Hawaiian islands. In March of \n1999, the contract for Project America was signed with great fanfare in \nthe rotunda of this very building.\n  Intense lobbying also created the political pressure that helped \nsecure a $1.1 billion loan guarantee from the U.S. Maritime \nAdministration's (MARAD) Title XI loan guarantee program for the \nconstruction of these two vessels--which is, by the way, the maximum \nallowable amount.\n  Within the first year of construction on the first of these cruise \nships, the project was a year to a year and a half behind schedule. \nBoth American Classic Voyages and Northrop Grumman Corporation--Ingalls \nShipyard's parent company--were crying foul over construction problems \nand months of non-binding mediation over contract disputes.\n\n  On October 19, 2001, American Classic Voyages filed a bankruptcy \npetition under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The petition \nlisted total assets of $37.4 million and total liabilities of $452.8 \nmillion. The cruise line said in its petition that it has more than \n1,000 creditors, including the American taxpayers being represented by \nthe Department of Transportation.\n  Had the Project America vessels been completed, they would have been \nthe largest cruise ships ever built in the United States and could have \nsparked a new phase of commercial shipbuilding in this country.\n  Mr. President, none of that occurred. The failed project is one of \nthe most costly loan guarantees ever granted under the Maritime Loan \nGuarantee Program. I questioned the merits of the ``Project America'' \nat the time the special legislation was considered and went so far as \nto introduce an amendment to the FY 1998 Department of Defense \nAppropriation Bill to remove the monopoly language. Based on the \ninformation available at the time, I believed then that the project was \nmore likely to fail than to succeed.\n  Guess what? The project did fail. Project America resulted in the \nU.S. Maritime Administration paying out over $187.3 million of the \nAmerican taxpayers' money to cover the loan default for this project, \nand recovering only $2 million from the sale of some of the \nconstruction materials and parts. But now, the provision in the Omnibus \nis built around the scraps of that horribly failed pork project, which \nwould now go into the new venture.\n  Like ``Project America,'' the provision in this omnibus bill singles \nout one company; this time it is Norwegian Cruise Lines, for \npreferential treatment, and gives that company privileges enjoyed by no \nother. There has been no analysis, no discussion, no hearing, no debate \non the value of granting an exclusive exemption for this one foreign-\nowned company--exclusive exemption from the Passenger Vessel Services \nAct.\n\n  Over the last several years, I have worked with all sectors of the \nmaritime industry to look for solutions that would provide for a \nhealthy U.S.-flagged cruise ship industry calling on ports nationwide. \nWhile these efforts have not come to fruition, I am committed to \ncontinuing this work. But those efforts will be, and should be, taken \nin the committee charged with this responsibility, the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  The author of this language is a member of the Commerce Committee, \nand a valued one. I strongly urge him to bring this issue on the agenda \nof the Commerce Committee and maybe we can work this out, rather than \ntucking it in as a provision, without any debate, without any \ndiscussion, without any authorization at any time, in direct violation \nof existing law. It is a direct violation, an exemption from existing \nlaw, the Passenger Vessel Services Act.\n  Any proposed legislation from the Commerce Committee will be crafted \nin an open and inclusive manner, not behind closed doors as appears to \nhave occurred with section 211.\n  Aside from the procedural concerns I have, section 211 is \nfundamentally unfair. I firmly believe what is good for one corporation \nis good for all. Section 211, however, would create an uneven playing \nfield for cruise operators and, depending on how the language was \ninterpreted, also would create an uneven playing field for States by \nrequiring these vessels to operate only in Hawaii, leaving most coastal \nStates with no regular U.S.-flagged cruise ship service.\n  Following on the heels of the failed attempt by American Classic \nVoyages to build a large cruise ship in a U.S. shipyard--an effort \ndriven by lobbyists and special interests--I believe further efforts to \nexpand the U.S.-flagged cruise ship fleet should be accomplished \nthrough the normal legislative process after debate and open \nexamination. Any solution should benefit a broad section of the U.S. \nmaritime industry and all of our Nation's ports. In order to spur such \na debate, I offered that amendment to simply strike the special \ninterest provisions in the omnibus bill. We can do better than this \nprovision.\n  Let me just give a couple of quotes from the media, this one from the \nNew York Times, June 18, 2002:\n\n      Critics Christen Ship Project as an Off-Course U.S.S. Pork.\n\n       Two years ago, with waving flags and hula dancers swaying, \n     the government announced an ambitious program to build two \n     passenger cruise ships--the first in a United States shipyard \n     since the 1950's--and provided more than $1 billion in loan \n     guarantees to get the program going.\n       It did not hurt that the ships were to be built in the \n     Pascagoula, Miss., shipyard where the father of Trent Lott, \n     the Republican Senate minority leader, once worked. As a \n     result, Senator Lott became one of the strongest supporters \n     of the program, which was named Project America.\n       Today, the project is being derided as an example of \n     political pork gone wrong. What remains of Project America is \n     an unfinished hull the size of two football fields and pieces \n     for a second ship lying around. The hull is not floatable; it \n     has neither a completed bow or stern; and its future is in \n     doubt. The price to the government for the failed project is \n     $187 million--money the government is trying to recoup by \n     putting the half-finished hull on the market.\n  By the way, they did put it on the market. They sold it for $24 \nmillion, of which the American taxpayer got $2 million--1, 2--$2 \nmillion, in return for a $187 million default.\n  How can we come to this body and tell them that we ought to do \nanything but leave this issue alone for now? Haven't we done enough \ndamage to the American taxpayers? Isn't a $187 million default enough?\n\n       This dismal reality only confirms the worst fears of the \n     project's critics--and is a far cry from the high hopes of \n     those who backed it. Critics, who call Project America \n     corporate welfare, say it shows the dangers lurking behind \n     the tens of billions in loan guarantees the government has \n     extended to an array of businesses, among them airlines, the \n     housing industry and American exporters.\n       ``This has turned into a corporate welfare debacle.''\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       The Maritime Administration's loan program is intended to \n     support domestic shipyards by guaranteeing the debt issued to \n     finance commercial ship construction. Last year, the agency \n     guaranteed $362 million; in 2000, $885 million.\n       When a project fails--as happened after American Classic's \n     bankruptcy filing--the government steps in to pay off the \n     debtholders.\n  You know, the interesting thing about this, too, this outfit that \nstarted this Project America, is there is a billionaire who operates a \ncasino--riverboat. He is a billionaire. He didn't lose any money on \nthis deal. He didn't lose any money. The American taxpayer did, because \nit was so well crafted, thanks to special interest lobbying, that the \nonly exposure was to the American taxpayer--$187 million worth.\n\n[[Page S1117]]\n\n  It will be argued that September 11 was the cause of the downfall of \nthis magnificent project.\n\n       Even before Sept. 11, Project America had run into trouble. \n     It had fallen behind schedule and was far over budget. As a \n     result, Northrop Grumman, which owns the shipyard, took a $60 \n     million write-off from it and American Classic lost $100 \n     million. The yard itself will continue to make and repair \n     Navy vessels.\n       ``The project was behind schedule and millions in the \n     hole,'' said John Graykowski, former administrator of the \n     government's shipbuilding program. ``The terrorists' attack \n     masked this reality and perhaps allowed the emperor to \n     maintain his modesty.''\n\n  So any argument that it was September 11 that caused this porkbarrel \nproject to fail is simply not in compliance with the facts.\n  There have been a lot of articles written. There probably should have \nbeen more because of the incredible loss to the American taxpayer of \n$187 million--sorry, $185 million; we got $2 million back.\n  So now here we go. We take an omnibus appropriations bill of $400 \nbillion and we stick into it a little amendment that violates existing \nlaw, protects a Malaysian--gives a special break to a Malaysian-owned \nNorwegian Cruise Lines, and we are supposed to sit back and accept \nthat. I don't think so. I don't think so. Didn't we learn a lesson last \ntime, when Congress got involved, when there were a few of us who said: \nWait a minute, wait a minute, this is crazy; this is just crazy?\n  How many millions of Americans' taxpayer dollars do we have to spend \nbefore we stop this kind of activity?\n  There are a number of other aspects of this issue. The proposed \namendment will achieve the completion of Project America. My response \nto that--when Project America's earmark was pushed through in 1998, the \nproponents alleged that the goals were to develop a U.S-built, U.S-\nflagged cruise vessel fleet by authorizing the temporary operation of \nforeign-built cruise ships in the domestic trade.\n  The provision in today's omnibus appropriations bill totally \ndisregards the prior requirement that a company operating foreign-built \nU.S.-flag vessels in Hawaii trade build the U.S. vessels in the United \nStates. Now they will be built overseas. Instead, 211 will allow the \nconstruction of two vessels, using some parts of the failed Project \nAmerica project, but it would not accomplish the objectives of \npromoting U.S. shipbuilding, as was one of the alleged benefits under \nthe original project. When the Project America earmark was pushed \nthrough in 1998, it was limited to one company and two vessels. When \nProject America encountered financial problems and then bankruptcy, all \nof the alleged benefits to the country were lost and cost the taxpayers \nnearly $200 million.\n  If the sponsors are now seeking to achieve a new objective--the \noperation of U.S-flagged cruise vessels regardless of where they are \nbuilt--then the amendment should be expanded to allow foreign-built \ncruise vessels to operate under the U.S. flag in all the domestic \ncruise ship markets in order to increase the alleged economic benefits \nthat would result from U.S-flagged cruise vessels.\n  As far as military preparedness goes, we don't need to even bother to \ndiscuss that.\n  The proposed amendment will benefit the U.S. economy. It has really \nbenefited the U.S. economy a great deal so far.\n  The proposed amendment does not perpetuate the Project America \nmonopoly. As drafted, the provision creates a de facto monopoly for one \ncompany in the Hawaii cruise trade, arguably in the U.S. coastal cruise \nmarket. No other company under this proposal, under this legislation, \ncan operate foreign-built, U.S.-flagged--can, under this proposal, \noperate U.S.-flagged, foreign-built cruise vessels in the Hawaiian \nmarket or any other market. It is totally unrealistic to believe \nanother company will be able to secure financing to build a vessel in \nthe United States for operation in the Hawaii cruise trade in direct \ncompetition with the foreign-built, U.S.-flagged cruise vessels that \nwould be authorized to operate under this provision with far less \ncapital investment.\n  I will be glad to engage in more debate on this issue. This was a \nterrible thing we did to the U.S. taxpayers back in 1998 under a \nprocess that I have vehemently and strongly resisted because of these \nvery circumstances. Provisions are inserted in appropriations bills \nwithout hearing, without authorization, without scrutiny.\n  Then some of us have to come to the floor and object to them without \nfull and certain knowledge of the issue.\n  I promise you that if I had known for sure we were going to lose $187 \nmillion of the taxpayers' money, I would have filibustered.\n  I knew it was wrong and seriously flawed. I knew that some \nbillionaire who operates riverboats probably isn't very good in the \nbusiness of building massive cruise ships.\n  But we cannot continue this kind of activity. Just suppose that this \nis a good idea, that it is a great idea. Why are we putting it into an \nomnibus appropriations bill that is supposed to fund the functions of \nGovernment and not authorize in direct violation of existing law? How \ndo we justify that?\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, in 1997 Congress, as noted by my colleague \nfrom Arizona, enacted the U.S.-Flag Cruise Ship Pilot Project in an \nattempt to ``jump start'' the redevelopment of a U.S.-flag cruise \nindustry. As some of our colleagues know, the large oceangoing cruise \nships, so familiar in Miami and other United States ports, all operate \nunder foreign flag. This may be a startling fact when one considers \nthat after the Second World War, U.S. flag ships carried some 80 \npercent of the world's ocean borne cargo and most of America's seagoing \npassengers. Today, in stark contrast, less than 4 percent of all the \nworld's international cargo moves on ships flying the U.S. flag, and \nnot a single large oceangoing passenger cruise ship in the world \noperates under U.S. registry.\n  The enactment of what has become known as the ``Project America'' \nlegislation more than 5 years ago was intended to reestablish a U.S.-\nflag cruise ship industry. The benefits of creating a U.S.-flag cruise \nship industry have long been obvious. Such an industry would maintain \nAmerica's preparedness for a national emergency by developing a pool of \nqualified seafarers, help sustain a fleet of U.S.-flag vessels to \nsupport our military vessels and a maritime industrial base for times \nof national emergency, create tens of thousands of seagoing and \nshoreside American jobs, and stimulate the development of a U.S.-flag \ncruise ship tourism business with commensurate benefits to the U.S. tax \nbase, the U.S. economy, and U.S. employment.\n  These were among the guiding principles and objectives of our \nlegislative efforts to restore a U.S.-flag cruise ship industry through \nthe Project America legislation in 1997. Under the terms of that \nlegislation, the re-flagging of one foreign-flag cruise ship was \npermitted contingent on the operator contracting for construction of \ntwo new U.S.-built cruise ships--the first such vessels to be built in \nthe U.S. in more than 40 years.\n  The project, while proceeding with considerable difficulty, including \ndelays and increased costs in construction, ultimately became a victim \nof the September 11 attack on our Nation. The terrorist attacks \ndramatically impacted the U.S. economy, and caused financial \ndifficulties for the entire travel industry. In fact, passenger \nbookings for American Classic Voyages Co.--AMCV--the company that \nundertook Project America, decreased by as much as 50 percent, and \ncancellations of bookings increased by as much as 30 percent in the \nweeks after the attacks. Ultimately, as a result, AMCV filed for \nbankruptcy, and construction on the two Project America ships was \nhalted. The re-flagged vessel, the m/v Patriot, was transferred out of \nU.S. registry.\n  As a result of these events, thousands of seagoing and shoreside jobs \nwere lost including more than 1,000 crewmembers and cruise ship service \nproviders. Passengers experienced disruptions and lost fares. Yet, the \nU.S. government paid $185 million on a Title XI shipbuilding loan \nguarantee for the two cruise ships under construction at Northrop \nGrumman Ingalls Shipbuilding--\n\n[[Page S1118]]\n\nIngalls--in Mississippi. Project America came to an abrupt halt.\n  At the time the Senate considered the Project America legislation, \nthere were concerns, and in some cases opposition, expressed about \nFederal funds being spent for the construction of these ships and a \nproposed preference in market access for AMCV to serve the coastwise \ntrade among the islands that comprise my State. But no one--not one \nmember of the Senate--voiced an objection to the goal of further \ndeveloping a U.S. flag cruise industry that would ultimately provide \nthousands of seafarer and shoreside jobs for Americans. Those jobs, \nalong with the development of a qualified pool of seafarers that this \ncountry could rely upon in times of national emergency, should not \nbecome the permanent victims of the terrorist attacks. As our Nation \nrestores the buildings and facilities that bore the brunt of that \nattack, we must also assist in the recovery of economic causalities. \nSince the demise of Project America, I have searched for a solution \nthat would permit most of the objectives of the original legislation to \nbe accomplished, but without any further expenditure of Federal funds, \nwithout any Federal loan guarantees, and without the need for the \nmarket preference in the 1997 law.\n  Last year, the U.S. Maritime Administration and Ingalls put the \npartially constructed Project America ships up for sale. While the sale \nwas open to any offeror, Norwegian Cruise Line--NCL--the longest \nestablished of the U.S.-based cruise lines, placed a bid on the Project \nAmerica ships that far exceeded all others. After NCL committed to \nacquiring the hulls, I met with company officials to discuss the \npossibility of completing Project America in a way that would achieve \nmost of the main objectives of the original legislation without any \nfurther expenditure of Federal resources or any Federal loan \nguarantees. It is my hope that over time the United States will reap \nthe benefits of its investment.\n  In the course of those discussions, completing the vessels at Ingalls \ndid not seem possible. NCL asked Ingalls to bid on completing the \nvessels in Mississippi; however, the yard did not bid because it was \npreparing to build new ships for the U.S. Navy. Unfortunately, NCL's \nonly option was to complete the ships elsewhere. In the meantime \nhowever, more than 250 workers in Mississippi worked on the partially \ncompleted hull over the summer to make it seaworthy for towing overseas \nfor completion in another shipyard. It has become apparent that further \nlegislation is necessary to reestablish the project to achieve most of \nthe Project America goals, and to respond to concerns expressed by my \ncolleagues about the original legislation.\n  Therefore, this provision in the Omnibus Appropriations bill will \namend the original Project America authority. This provision, like the \noriginal Pilot Project, will apply only to cruise ships operating in \nregular Hawaii service. It was done that way because other areas did \nnot want to have this competition. My provision would allow for the \ncompletion of the first hull, with an option to complete the second \nhull, from the material acquired in conjunction with the Project \nAmerica ships that were under construction at Ingalls. Either or both \nof these ships may be completed in a non-U.S. shipyard experienced in \ncruise ship construction for operation under the U.S. flag in regular \ncoastwise service. These new U.S.-flagged cruise ships will be required \nto operate with American crews, be subject to all U.S. laws, including \ntax, labor and environmental laws, and be owned by a U.S. corporation \nwith United States citizens serving as chief executive officer and \nchairman of the board of directors, and with U.S. citizens controlling \nthe board. Like the original Project America legislation, this bill \npermits increased foreign equity involvement in the enterprise. While \nunder this new provision, the ultimate beneficial owner need not be a \nU.S. citizen, the requirement that the vessels be owned by an American \ncompany ensures that the ships' operations will be subject to all U.S. \nlaws and that the vessel assets of the U.S. company will be available \nto our Nation in times of national emergency.\n\n  Consistent with the original Project America legislation, the U.S. \ncorporate owner would have the right to reflag a modern foreign-built \nvessel under U.S. flag for operation in the coastwise trade to \nfacilitate a cost-effective and timely transition to U.S. registry. \nLike the newly built ships, the reflagged vessel must have a U.S. crew \nand be subject to all U.S. laws. Before operating under U.S. registry, \nhowever, two conditions must be met. First, the reflagged vessel must \nundergo a complete inspection to ensure compliance with all relevant \nFederal safety and public health laws of the United States that are \napplicable to U.S.-flagged cruise ships. Further, any refurbishing or \nremodeling that may be necessary to assure compliance with these \nFederal laws must occur in a United States shipyard. Second, the \nreflagged vessel may commence operating only after the first Project \nAmerica ship enters service. The U.S. Maritime Administration will be \ncharged with overseeing the implementation of this bill, but \nreimbursement for costs associated with this oversight shall be \nobtained from those who operate cruise ships under this new authority.\n  The result of this provision would be the introduction of multiple \nmodern U.S.-flagged cruise ships in regular Hawaii service. The ships \nwould employ as many as 3,000 U.S. seamen, and all would be subject to \nU.S. labor, tax, and environmental laws, unlike the major foreign \ncruise lines. In short, these proposed changes to the original Project \nAmerica legislation will still allow many of the original principles \nand objectives to be achieved, without additional cost to the American \ntaxpayer.\n  While the legislation is limited to Hawaii, at the request of other \nareas, the benefits go far beyond the shores of my home State. In \naddition to the thousands of jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars \nin economic activity generated nationwide, this provision will \nstrengthen our U.S. Merchant Marine. The ships operating under U.S.-\nflag will be assets available to the Department of Defense in time of \nnational emergency, and these U.S.-flagged cruise ship operations will \nsignificantly expand our pool of qualified seafarers that man civilian-\ncrewed military ships such as the Ready Reserve Fleet, a fleet of 76 \nU.S. Government-owned ships used to meet surge sealift.\n\n  The Department of Defense relies heavily on U.S. mariners to crew a \nlarge number of non-combatant vessels to deliver a wide range of \nsupplies to United States and allied forces around the globe. In fact, \nas much as 95 percent of the military's fuel, food, munitions, and \nspare parts would move by these ships in the event of a major war.\n  The media have chronicled the concerns of our Nation's military and \nmaritime officials about the Nation's ability to crew these non-\ncombatant ships because of shortages in the numbers of civilian \nAmerican seafarers. Most recently, in Defense Week, VADM David Brewer, \nCommander of Military Sealift Command, expressed ``concern'' that the \nlack of qualified seafarers might ``strain'' activation of the Ready \nReserve Fleet.\n  CAPT Bill Schubert, Administrator of the Maritime Administration, the \nagency charged with ensuring a viable Ready Reserve Fleet, has been \neven more blunt in his assessment of the circumstances last year in a \nBaltimore Sun article entitled, ``Shipping Crew Deficit Called Wartime \nRisk,'' where he said:\n\n       This is a very serious issue that needs to be addressed \n     now--today . . . I'm not comfortable right now that we have \n     the ability to respond to an emergency.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the Defense \nWeek and Baltimore Sun articles be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I think we should remind ourselves that \nnot too long ago there was a war we have referred to as the Yom Kippur \nwar that was fought in the Middle East. It was a war that involved the \nRepublic of Egypt and the State of Israel.\n  On Yom Kippur Day, a day of very holy significance in Israel, \nEgyptian troops went across the river, got into the Sinai, and were on \nthe verge of successfully carrying out the military mission. We \nreceived frantic calls from Israel to resupply their troops, because \ntheir troops had a 90-day amount of\n\n[[Page S1119]]\n\nammo, but because of the intensity of the combat, over half of that had \nalready been used.\n  We, therefore, called upon every American and American company that \nowned ships on the high seas but under foreign registry. There are \nhundreds upon hundreds of vessels owned by Americans or American \ncompanies that are registered in Panama, Liberia, or in someplace out \nin the Pacific in the trust territories. They do not pay taxes. They do \nnot hire American crews. But we felt that because they were Americans, \nthey might come to our aid. We wanted ships to carry these military \ngoods to help the Israelis.\n  When the word reached them that the Saudis would look upon this as an \nunfriendly act, the response from our fellow Americans, to help \nAmericans provide help to their allies, the Israelis, was absolutely \nzero. Not one ship responded. History shows, as a result, we had to \ncarry out cargo on C-5 aircraft, huge aircraft. Two of them were buzzed \nby Egyptian fighters. Every time I think of this, I shudder, because if \nany one of them had been shot down, the question arises, would we have \nbeen involved? In all likelihood, we would have been.\n  Therefore, the fact that after the end of World War II we carried 80 \npercent of all the cargo, and today less than 4 percent, should be of \nconcern to all of us.\n  What if the war many are suggesting might happen does happen and it \nbecomes not a minor war but a major war? Do we have the vessels to \ncarry necessary troops and equipment abroad? I believe that is a good \nquestion we should ask ourselves.\n  I do not suggest the Project America provision solves this problem. \nHowever, virtually every person engaged in the debate over seafarer \nreadiness would agree that a primary way to address the problem is to \npromote a viable U.S.-flag fleet. My provision does just that.\n  With international tensions rising, I believe we must do all we can \nto support the Nation's military readiness. My legislation would do \nthat by creating desperately needed American seafaring jobs that will \nsupport a military sealift.\n  To summarize, let me be clear what this section does. First, no \nFederal funds may be used to complete the Project America hulls. No \nFederal loan guarantees may be issued by the U.S. Government to perform \nwork on these ships. The preference in the original Project America law \nthat was criticized as limiting competition among the islands of the \nState of Hawaii does not apply to these ships. At this moment, if any \nAmerican company wishes to build a ship in the United States and carry \non the business in Hawaii or, for that matter, in any other port of the \nUnited States, that company may do so. Or if that company has a foreign \nflag vessel and believes that vessel should be reflagged to an American \nflag and would come before us, as we have in the past, it we may do so. \nThis does not close that door. It just gives it a jump start.\n  We need something to be done. As I pointed out, Federal safety and \nhealth inspections on the proposed reflagged vessel must occur in the \nUnited States shipyard, not abroad. All future maintenance on these \ncruise ships and any repairs needed in order to register the vessel in \nthe U.S. must occur in our shipyards. The U.S. Coast Guard safety \nregulations will govern ship operations, and U.S. mariners operating \nthe vessel will be subject to Coast Guard licensing. The U.S. Maritime \nAdministration will oversee the implementation of this legislation and \nrecapture that cost from the cruise line operators.\n  I want to stress to my colleagues and those in the maritime industry \nthat this provision will not adversely impact the Jones Act cargo \ntrades where the fleet is vibrant and growing. It is strictly limited \nto the large oceangoing cruise ships and then only those operating in \nthe regular Hawaii service where there are no U.S.-flag operations.\n  I would also like to stress I continue to support U.S. domestic \nshipping requirements that mandate U.S.-built, operated, and crewed \nvessels. I recognize that in certain circumstances, some degree of \nrelaxation of these requirements may be necessary to stimulate growth \nin the United States maritime industrial base. While this particular \nprovision is intended to fulfill the completion of Project America, and \npromote the use of large U.S.-flag passenger vessels in Hawaii, I have \nsupported legislation that will provide similar flexibility for large \npassenger vessels throughout the United States. This legislation was \nintroduced by my distinguished colleague from Arizona. I will continue \nto support such proposals that are crafted to strengthen our U.S. \nmaritime industrial base.\n  However, I feel we need to move forward expeditiously with this \nproposal to ensure we can realize some of the benefits of the original \nProject America legislation. Planning requirements and operational \nchanges necessary to complete this project to allow for the use as a \nU.S.-flag vessel must be made shortly or the vessels will be completed \nfor use under a flag of convenience or foreign flag.\n\n  Yes, some $185 million in Federal funds have already been invested in \nthis project as a result of the Maritime Administration loan guarantees \nthat were called upon when AMCV went bankrupt. A U.S.-based cruise \ncompany has taken the risk of purchasing the hull and related materials \nfrom Project America with no assurance that legislation could be \nenacted to obtain coastwise privileges.\n  Instead of simply building the ships overseas for operation under a \nforeign flag with foreign crews or seeking product exemptions to the \nPassenger Vessel Services Act to operate these ships, NCL has stepped \nto the plate and is willing to hire American crews, be subject to \nAmerican laws, and achieve some of the original benefits of Project \nAmerica.\n  I will be the first to admit that the original Project America \nfailed. There is no U.S.-built cruise ship ready for delivery on \nJanuary 23, 2003, which was supposed to have been the delivery date of \nthe first Project America ship. There is no work proceeding on a second \nU.S.-built cruise vessel, and the Federal Government is out $185 \nmillion for the title XI loan guarantee. While the economic downturn \nresulting from September 11 was the final nail in the lid of the \nProject America coffin, the troubles, as noted by my colleague from \nArizona, began well before that catastrophic event.\n  No one will dispute that U.S. shipyards are inexperienced in \nconstructing large oceangoing cruise ships. We recognized this and, \nthrough the original Project America, provided the incentive necessary \nfor an $880 million fixed price contract to build modern state-of-the-\nart cruise ships in the United States.\n  Throughout the process, the shipyard experienced significant problems \nin construction of ships. For example, within the first year of \nconstruction, the yard was experiencing a projected delay in delivery \nof approximately 1 year and an escalation in the price of outfitting \nthe interior of the ship by as much as $76 million. Eventually a \nnegotiated settlement was reached, extending the delivery dates, \nincreasing the price, and requiring additional project equity.\n  After the vessel owner's bankruptcy brought the work on Project \nAmerica to a halt, the partially completed vessels were auctioned. The \nsuccessful bidder, NCL, offered the Ingalls shipyard an opportunity to \nbid for completing the vessels, but Ingalls declined. The yard handled \npredominantly military construction and was not interested in \ncompleting the vessels. Instead, the yard retooled its operation to \nhandle an increased order book for Navy ships.\n  U.S. shipyards predominantly build Navy ships. Based on past \nexperience, the Government is more willing than the private sector to \nabsorb increases in the price tag or delays in delivery of the vessel. \nA commercial company requires more stringent pricing and schedule \ndiscipline to ensure that projects are economical.\n  With Project America, that discipline did not exist, and the shipyard \nopted to concentrate its efforts on government contracts. Other \nshipyards were in the same situation, with orderbooks filled with \ngovernment vessels.\n  I remain committed to our U.S. shipyards and believe they have an \nimportant role to play in the future of the U.S. cruise ship industry. \nMy provision will give shipyards additional business that they may not \notherwise get--any conversion work necessary for certification of the \nnew cruise ships, and any\n\n[[Page S1120]]\n\nfuture non-warranty repairs and maintenance must be done in U.S. \nshipyards.\n  If Section 211 is not adopted, the Federal Government will lose all \nfuture benefits from its $185 million investment. My provision gives \nAmerica another opportunity to jump-start a U.S.-flag cruise industry \nthat will bring the Government a return on its investment.\n  NCL is the only cruise line willing to step up to the plate today and \ncommit to a U.S.-flag, U.S. crewed operation.\n  We can choose to write off the Project America investment by not \nacting, and watching as these completed hulls are introduced into the \nbooming U.S. cruise market under a foreign flag, with foreign crews, \noperated by foreign corporations without direct benefit to the U.S. \neconomy or American workers.\n  But if we are to make good on any of that investment, we must act now \nto generate real and lasting economic benefit to our economy--and to \nrestore pride in the fact that the Stars and Stripes will once again \nfly on modern oceangoing passenger cruise ships.\n  By taking action now on Project America, we will begin to recover the \ninvestment our nation has made in these hulls both through revenues to \nthe U.S. Treasury in the form of individual income taxes, Federal and \nState corporate income and payroll taxes, and a broad range of other \nFederal and State taxes paid by the cruise industry--not to mention the \nbroader benefits this legislation will bring to our military \npreparedness and to our sagging economy.\n  No further Federal funds are required, nor are Government financial \nguarantees permitted. This legislation simply allows for the completion \nof Project America and for this company to set a shining example as a \nproud employer of U.S. seafarers and as a proud operator of U.S. flag \nships.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this effort so that we can revive our \nU.S.-flag cruise industry, increase our military preparedness, \nstimulate the economy, and create thousands of good jobs for Americans.\n\n                             Exhibit No. 1\n\n                   [From Defense Week, Nov. 12, 2002]\n\n         Force Protection Is Top Concern for Sealift Commander\n\n                           (By Nathan Hodge)\n\n       Protecting vulnerable cargo ships has become the main worry \n     for the three-star admiral in charge of the fleet that is \n     moving weapons and materiel in support of a U.S. military \n     buildup in the Middle East.\n       In an interview with Defense Week, Vice Adm. David Brewer, \n     commander of Military Sealift Command (MSC), said that force \n     protection is MSC's ``No. 1 priority.''\n       At some point, that could possibly mean embarking armed \n     guards aboard foreign-flagged ships that move sensitive U.S. \n     military cargo. Asked if that was the case, he simply said, \n     ``We're still working that issue,'' and declined to \n     elaborate. MSC operates a fleet of 120 noncombatant ships to \n     deliver a wide range of supplies to U.S. and allied forces \n     around the globe. In event of a major war, ships controlled \n     by MSC would move as much as 95 percent of the military's \n     fuel, food, ammunition and spare parts.\n       The command augments its own fleet by contracting with \n     commercial shippers. According to U.S. Transportation \n     Command, the United States military relies on commercial \n     ships--many under foreign flag-to meet as much as two-thirds \n     of its sealift requirements.\n       In an ideal world, said Brewer, the U.S. military would \n     move all its cargo under U.S.-flagged ships. But he added: \n     ``Right now, we don't have enough. We've seen a steady \n     decline in U.S. flag shipping over the last 10 years. I think \n     . . . there's less than 125 U.S.-flagged [commercial] ships \n     now.''\n       That means increased reliance on foreign-owned ships for \n     military sealift, an issue that has prompted concern in \n     policy circles. In a July report, the General Accounting \n     Office said the Defense Department ``relinquishes control'' \n     of sensitive military cargo when it contracts out to foreign \n     ships.\n       When the U.S. military hires foreign-flagged vessels, there \n     are no armed U.S. guards on board. When the U.S. military \n     hires U.S.-flagged ships, sometimes there are guards on \n     board. But when GAO reviewed many shipments of weapons on \n     U.S.-flagged vessels, it found them unguarded.\n       Brewer stressed that U.S. cargo preference laws favor U.S.-\n     flagged shippers, who get the first opportunity to bid on any \n     of MSC's contracts for cargo movement. And he said that MSC \n     very closely scrutinizes all the commercial vessels, \n     including foreign ones, that carry military cargo.\n       ``If we cannot find a U.S. flag, we sometimes will embark \n     cargo or equipment on a foreign flag,'' he said. ``But in a \n     perfect world, we want a U.S. flag.''\n       When MSC does embark equipment aboard a foreign-flagged \n     ship, Brewer said, ``We watch those ships very closely and in \n     some cases embark our personnel aboard those ships to make \n     sure the cargo is secure.''\n       Asked if that included armed cargo supervisors, called \n     supercargoes, Brewer said: ``We're still working that issue. \n     Armed supercargoes is an issue we're still working.''\n\n\n                         investing in upgrades\n\n       An attack last month on an oil tanker off the coast of \n     Yemen spotlighted the vulnerability of commercial ships. In \n     an incident reminiscent of the attack on the USS Cole (DDG \n     67) in 2000, a small watercraft laden with explosives struck \n     the French supertanker Limburg, crippling the ship.\n       Brewer said MSC takes the threat to merchant vessels as \n     seriously as it takes the threat to military transport ships \n     and said his command would be investing more money over the \n     next several years to upgrade security on board its own \n     ships.\n       ``We're dedicating significant resources to, number one, \n     providing . . . force protection in terms of training and \n     equipment to budgeting a significant amount of money actually \n     through fiscal 2009 to make sure not only that we not only \n     install the latest technology in terms of hull-perimeter \n     lighting, intrusion detection systems, things of that sort, \n     but also to make sure that we have aboard ships any \n     technology that may be available in the future,'' he said. \n     ``So we are investing a lot of money.''\n       The technology upgrades are particularly important because \n     military transport ships, unlike Navy combatants, have small \n     crews.\n       ``MSC ships are `manned to mission,' '' he said. ``So that \n     means they're minimally manned. Therefore there's not extra \n     people on board our ships to be armed.''\n       Much of the money that MSC will invest is in equipment and \n     training. And Brewer said he was working closely with the \n     Navy's fleet commanders in terms of developing an across-the-\n     board force-protection policy for Navy ships.\n       ``So we're investing quite a bit of time and money into \n     force protection and we're working with the fleet in terms of \n     developing and refining force-protection policy,'' he said.\n\n\n                      beans and bullets to mideast\n\n       Meanwhile, MSC continues to charter vessels regularly to \n     move equipment and supplies. Earlier this month, MSC hired \n     out two commercial ships to move a large shipment (284 \n     containers full) of ammunition along with 28,000 square feet \n     of rolling stock (including armored vehicles).\n       The ships were headed for unspecified destinations in the \n     Middle East, said Marge Holtz, a spokeswoman for the command.\n       Brewer would not comment directly on deployments in support \n     of military operations or the destination of cargoes. But he \n     suggested that his command was keeping pace with the Navy's \n     increased operational tempo, including the recent deployment \n     of carrier battle groups to the Persian Gulf region.\n       ``Our workload has increased in the sense that we are \n     operating with the increased operational tempo with the \n     battle groups,'' he said. ``But basically we satisfy the \n     fleet's basic needs.''\n       Asked whether he is confident that his command can easily \n     be put on a war footing, Brewer said: ``Ramping up, because \n     of the planning we've put forth, . . . is not a problem.''\n       However, he did suggest that a full mobilization might put \n     a strain on the Ready Reserve Force, a fleet of 76 \n     government-owned ships kept in reserve by the Maritime \n     Administration to meet surge shipping requirements for the \n     military.\n       ``Where that would put a strain on the maritime industry is \n     if we have to activate the Ready Reserve Force ships,'' \n     Brewer said. ``And with the decrease in U.S.-flagged ships, \n     there's a concomitant decrease in U.S. mariners. So we're \n     working with the Maritime Administration and the unions in \n     making sure that if we have to go to war and activate the \n     Ready Reserve Forces, there are enough mariners to man those \n     ships.''\n       Most of those ships are kept in a ``reduced operating \n     status,'' with small crews aboard for maintenance.\n       ``If we have to take those ships to a full operating \n     status, there is some concern there, but we're working this \n     issue very diligently with the Maritime Administration and \n     the maritime unions and we feel we could satisfy any wartime \n     requirements,'' he said.\n       That point, he said, further reinforces the desire of the \n     government, the shipping industry and unions to increase the \n     number of U.S.-flagged ships.\n       In general, said Brewer, ``I want to see more U.S.-flagged \n     ships. Period. More U.S.-flagged ships, number one, will be \n     good for the economy. We are a maritime nation. More \n     importantly, it is essential for our national security. \n     Because [it means] the less we have to depend on foreign-\n     flagged shipping today.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Baltimore Sun, Jan. 13, 2002]\n\n   Shipping Crew Deficit Called Wartime Risk; Bush's Maritime Chief \nAcknowledges Worries on Readiness; ``A Very Top Priority'' New Reserve \n                 Force Among Proposals To Ease Shortage\n\n                           (By Robert Little)\n\n       The Bush administration is acknowledging, after years of \n     government denials, that the nation's ability to fight a \n     large-scale war overseas is in peril because of a\n\n[[Page S1121]]\n\n     crippling shortage of manpower in the U.S. merchant marine.\n       William G. Schubert, Bush's maritime administrator, said in \n     an interview that he does not believe the Pentagon could find \n     enough sailors to operate its cargo ships if military forces \n     were deployed for a sustained overseas campaign.\n       He plans to pursue several immediate remedies, including \n     pushing for the creation of a new Merchant Marine Reserve, \n     and said solving the manpower crisis will be ``a very top \n     priority'' of his administration.\n       ``This is a very serious issue that needs to be addressed \n     right now--today,'' said Schubert, a former merchant seaman \n     who was sworn in just over a month ago. ``We don't have time \n     to postpone this issue any longer, or there could be some \n     very serious consequences. I'm not very comfortable right now \n     that we have the ability to respond to an emergency.'' A \n     series of articles in The Sun last summer showed that a \n     shortage of U.S. merchant sailors, brought on by declines in \n     the nation's commercial shipping fleet, would leave many of \n     the government's cargo ships stranded in port during a \n     crisis.\n       A small military force like the one currently in \n     Afghanistan can be deployed and re-supplied with cargo planes \n     and helicopters. But during a large campaign involving tank \n     divisions and heavy machinery, such as the Persian Gulf war, \n     about 95 percent of the equipment, fuel and supplies must \n     move in ships.\n       the federal government keeps almost 100 empty cargo ships \n     scattered around the country for use is such an emergency, \n     and it plans to crew them with civilian sailors from the U.S. \n     merchant marine. A complete activation of the 76-ship Ready \n     Reserve Force and about two dozen other dormat sealift \n     vessels would require more than 3,500 mariners, all of them \n     culled from the nation's commercial shipping industry.\n       Despite denials of a shortage from government and military \n     officials, the series published in The Sun revealed that the \n     Pentagon recycles crew members, transferring them from ship \n     to ship giving each vessel a full crew just long enough to \n     pass a drill verifying its readiness for war. Some \n     mariners served on as many as five ships a year.\n       The series also showed that the federal government is \n     relying on retired sailors to fill in during a crisis, even \n     though it has no idea how many retirees are available, who \n     they are, where they live or what qualifications they have.\n       Since the articles were published, leaders from the \n     nation's merchant marine unions have acknowledged the \n     shortages, and two senior members of Congress have introduced \n     legislation to bolster the commercial shipping industry and \n     reverse its decline.\n\n\n                        ``that's a good start''\n\n       But Schubert's comments represent the first acknowledgement \n     from a federal official responsible for military sealift that \n     the shortage exists--and the first pledge to do something \n     about it.\n       ``If he's admitting that this is a big problem, then he's \n     the first one to do so. And that's a good start,'' said \n     retired Navy Capt. Robert W. Kesteloot, a former director of \n     strategic sealift for the Chief of Naval Operations who says \n     a growing manpower shortage was apparent at the Pentagon even \n     in the late 1980s.\n       ``It's about time someone over there started taking this \n     seriously,'' Kesteloot said.\n       The Navy is ultimately responsible for military sealift, \n     but it has little control over the crew members hired for its \n     dormant cargo ships because they are all temporary civilian \n     contractors, not regular employees. The responsibility to \n     maintain and preserve that work force rests with the U.S. \n     Maritime Administration, a division of the Department of \n     Transportation.\n       Previous maritime administrators have acknowledged concerns \n     about manpower but have all claimed that the military's cargo \n     ships can be fully crewed. Schubert's predecessor, Clinton-\n     appointee Clyde J. Hart, said in an interview last year: \n     ``It's a problem that should keep us up at nights, but it's \n     not a readiness problem. We can man the ships.''\n       But Schubert, who worked for the Maritime Administration \n     during the gulf war and watched it struggle to crew sealift \n     vessels more than 10 years ago, said he discounts even the \n     agency's latest survey, made public late last year, which \n     concludes that a sufficient supply of mariners is available.\n       ``I'd hate to put our national defense on the line based on \n     a statistical analysis,'' he said. ``It was a problem 10 \n     years ago, and the situation today has only gotten worse.''\n       The U.S. military has always relied on civilian merchant \n     mariners for moving supplies by sea. They are cheaper than \n     military personnel, because they are hired only when needed. \n     And Navy sailors aren't trained in the precise skills \n     required to operate cargo ships--and virtually all of them \n     lack the necessary licenses and certifications.\n       A typical merchant mariner works four months at sea, then \n     spends four months ashore, and few of them have permanent \n     jobs on the same ship. Jobs are handed out by the unions \n     based on how long a mariner has been ashore looking for his \n     or her next ship. When a mariner has been ashore long enough \n     to qualify for work again, most take whatever ship is \n     available at the time.\n       In a crisis, the Pentagon plans to add its ships to the \n     unions' list of commercial vessels looking for crew members, \n     luring sailors back to sea much sooner than normal.\n       That strategy worked for decades, when the U.S. merchant \n     marine dominated the globe and the fleet had thousands of \n     vessels. But since 1950, the U.S.-flagged commercial fleet \n     has shrunk from nearly 3,500 vessels to about 220. An \n     industry that once kept more than 160,000 sailors employed \n     now has fewer than 6,500 jobs.\n       Schubert said that correcting the manpower shortage will be \n     a top priority in his administration. He plans to appoint a \n     new deputy administrator with expertise in manpower and \n     recruitment, and conduct a new, detailed survey of the \n     merchant marine work force.\n\n\n                       Expansion of reserve force\n\n       Schubert has already met with Navy officials to discuss \n     creating a new merchant marine arm of the Naval Reserve. The \n     Navy has a Merchant Marine Reserve, but it includes only \n     ships' officers--not unlicensed seafarers that make up the \n     bulk of a cargo ship's crew.\n       He is considering making service on Ready Reserve Force \n     cargo ships an element of the service obligation for \n     graduates of the tuition-free U.S. Merchant Marine Academy. \n     And he wants to set up a program at the academy for emergency \n     mariner training, to counter shortages in a crisis. Schubert \n     graduated from the academy in 1974.\n       He also plans to oversee creation of a national database \n     listing contact information for anyone--active or retired--\n     with the Coast Guard qualifications necessary to work at sea. \n     Today the government relies solely on unions and word of \n     mouth to find mariners when they are needed.\n       But those are mostly short-term solutions. Lasting \n     increases in the number of sailors available to the military \n     can be accomplished only by altering the economic outlook for \n     shipping companies that choose to register their vessels in \n     the United States and hire American sailors, he said.\n       ``If we don't have programs or initiatives to promote the \n     profitability of the U.S. flag, nothing else will matter,'' \n     he said.\n       The Bush administration has not taken a position on a bill \n     before Congress that would lower taxes on American cargo \n     ships in hopes of luring more vessels to the U.S. fleet. That \n     legislation, sponsored by the senior Republican and Democrat \n     on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, is \n     awaiting a nearing in the House of Representatives.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote in \nrelation to the McCain amendment occur at 1:30 today, with the time \nequally divided in the usual form and with no amendments in order prior \nto the vote; further, that prior to the vote, Senator Landrieu be \nrecognized as in morning business for up to 5 minutes; further, that \nfollowing this vote, Senator Biden be recognized to speak for up to 20 \nminutes and Senator Brownback, for up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I ask the \ndistinguished manager and chairman, does he anticipate further votes \nfollowing the speaking?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes, we do expect further votes this afternoon. We have \nthe prospect of a Dodd amendment and a further amendment by the Senator \nfrom Arizona. So we have the prospect of continuing votes on through \nthe afternoon.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I do not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for the \naccommodation for me to make a few brief comments about the District of \nColumbia appropriations portion of this appropriations bill.\n  I have no amendment to offer, but I will make a few general comments \nabout a very small portion of this underlying bill, and I am mindful \nthat we are about to vote on Senator McCain's very important amendment.\n\n[[Page S1122]]\n\n  Obviously, there are pros and cons, but I wish to take this moment to \ntalk about a $512 million budget out of a $750 billion bill. It is not \na lot of money--well, obviously, it is a lot of money; $512 million is \nnot small change, but it is such a small percentage of the total amount \nof the appropriations bill. But for the 500,000-plus people who are \nresidents of the District, for the citizens of our Nation who look to \nthe District as truly what it is--their capital, our Nation's capital, \nand for the many hundreds of thousands and millions of people who \ntravel to this District every year--adults, senior citizens, children, \npeople of all ages, I thought I would take a moment to say a few brief \nwords.\n  I want to begin by thanking our chairman, now ranking member, of the \nAppropriations Committee for his help in crafting this important \nportion of this bill. The good Senator from West Virginia spent many \nyears as chairman of this subcommittee, and he knows well the issues \nabout which I am speaking.\n  I thank the chairman, Senator Mike DeWine from Ohio, for his \nleadership. We work very closely as chairman and ranking member. I \nthank him and his staff, Mary Dietrich, for all of their hard work in \npulling this portion of the appropriations bill together.\n  First, I wish to speak about a couple of big points. The District's \nbudget is in fairly good shape. It has taken effort on the part of \nCongress, Democrats and Republicans, as well as the mayor and his \npartners on the council, a lot of work by the business community and \ncivic organizations that have given suggestions and comments, as well \nas a structure that was put in place after the reform board moved on, \nto put in place a financial infrastructure that helps the District stay \non strong financial footing.\n  Are there challenges? Yes. Is every city in America challenged? Yes. \nEvery State, as the Senator most certainly knows from his State of \nTennessee, is challenged with budget constraints. But the District, \njust as every city in America, struggles with chronic problems of \nlosing a tax base and having to provide services for hundreds of \nthousands of people who come into the District each day yet do not pay \nthat full share of the tax and the political difficulty of finding an \nappropriate political solution.\n  Nonetheless, with all those challenges, this mayor and the city \ncouncil have gotten the District close to a balanced budget position, \nand because of that, a lot of the initiatives about which we have \ntalked in Congress are going to hopefully be brought to the forefront.\n  No. 1, in this budget, there is additional security for the District \nof Columbia. As our Nation's Capital, we should, as Members of \nCongress, along with the mayor and council, make sure we set as much \nmoney in place as we can to secure the many beautiful monuments and \nbuildings. Unfortunately, this is a target-rich district and needs \nextra money for security. Some, not all of what we need, but some of \nthat money is in the bill.\n  No. 2, the District has put forward a great and ambitious agenda for \nimproving their schools. I am proud to say there is $20 million to \ncreate, not for the first time, to expand a revolving fund for charter \nschools. As the schools improve, we are able to help create the kind of \nphysical environment that rewards excellence, and that is in this bill.\n  We have also created the first ever family court in the District to \ntry to cut down on child abuse and neglect, to help strengthen our \nfamilies and our neighborhoods, to create special judges who will pay \nattention to these very serious challenges and then support them in \ntheir efforts. I thank Senator Durbin particularly for his work in that \nregard. There are other provisions worth noting.\n  I am proud to submit a bill that works with the mayor and with the \ncouncil in a bipartisan way to help this city, which is so special to \nthe people who live here and so special to all of us, fulfill the \ndreams of how we want to see this city flourish and grow in the years \nahead.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee for \nputting forth efforts to create this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). The Senator's time has expired.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/17/senate-section/article/S1122-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1122-S1123]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS CONSENT--S. RES 23\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, on Wednesday, the administration made a \ndecision to oppose the University of Michigan's efforts to promote \ndiversity on the campus. In making the announcement, the administration \nsaid that Michigan's process amounted to a quota, and that the \nuniversity should look at other factors, such as economic and \ngeographic backgrounds. Their statement ignores the fact that both of \nthose factors, as well as others, are considered by the university and \ngiven the same weight as race.\n  I have made clear on other occasions what I and many of my colleagues \nbelieve: The Michigan system is not a quota; the Michigan system is \nconstitutional; and that President Bush made the wrong decision. Racial \nand ethnic diversity in our Nation's institutions of higher education \nis an important goal.\n  A student body that reflects the diversity of America is a valuable \nresource for all of our students. But kind words and lofty rhetoric \nalone cannot open the doors of educational opportunity or guarantee a \ndiverse student body.\n  We must show our commitment through our actions. That is why today I \nam asking consent that we adopt a resolution that supports the \nUniversity of Michigan. This resolution states that the Senate supports \nthe university's attempts to create a racially and ethnically diverse \nstudent body and directs the Senate legal counsel to file an amicus \nbrief on behalf of the entire Senate in support.\n  By adopting this resolution, we can show with our actions, not just \nour words, that we truly believe in the importance of racial and ethnic \ndiversity. I hope my colleagues will join me in this effort and \nsupport, certainly not stand in the way, of the resolution.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Judiciary Committee \nbe discharged from further consideration of S. Res. 23 and that the \nSenate then proceed to its immediate consideration; that the resolution \nand preamble be agreed to, en bloc; and that the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table, without intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I think all of us in the Senate would \nlove to see equal opportunity for all students. One of the great \nadvances we have made is to eliminate discrimination--formal \ndiscrimination--that we had in this country for a long time against \npeople of color, but I do not believe the answer to that is by \ninstituting something that, in fact, discriminates the other way. That \nis what the University of Michigan system does, to give someone, \nbecause of the color of their skin, 20 points toward the admission \nscore and someone with a perfect SAT score--to me the values that the \nadmission process should consider are where the person came from, the \nobstacles they had to overcome in their lives, their economic \ncondition, and their family situation.\n  There are many issues that are intangibles that should be considered \nin an admissions process. But when you compare this young girl from \nMichigan, who was the plaintiff in this case, who happens to be white \nand has overcome a lot in her life to reach the point where she could \napply to the University of Michigan and potentially be accepted, and \nyou may have someone who happens to be Hispanic or African American and \nmay have come from a privileged background, went to the finest private \nschools, and for them to get an advantage over someone who scratched \nand clawed through a very difficult situation seems to be unfair.\n  What the administration has done is tried to focus, as the President \ndid at the University of Texas when he was Governor of Texas, on trying \nto provide opportunity for all without putting forward discriminatory \nimpediments to people simply because of their gender, their ethnic \nbackground, or their race.\n\n[[Page S1123]]\n\n  To me, it is an opportunity-based system for people who have had a \ndisadvantaged life and I believe is a healing balm on this very \ndifficult undertone of racism that we have seen in this country.\n  Madam President, I think the administration is moving in a positive \ndirection, so I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I do not know what the agenda is. I \nknow the chairman of the Judiciary Committee has a different opinion.\n  Maybe the Democratic leader decided we are not going to be dealing \nwith the appropriations bill. We have an amendment on which we are \ngetting ready to vote. We were supposed to vote on it a couple of \nminutes ago. I guess people want to debate the Michigan case, but that \nis really not the issue before us. The issue before us is an \nappropriations bill.\n  Eleven out of the thirteen appropriations bills have not been passed. \nWe are trying to finish the appropriations bills. The chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee is trying to move the Senate forward. He has \nbeen asking for amendments. We are trying to consider amendments. We \nare getting ready to vote on an amendment, and the Democratic leader \nhas a resolution that says: We want to adopt a position opposite that \nof the President of the United States on the Michigan case, without \neven advanced warning and without allowing the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, who also has a resolution taking a different \nposition, to come forward.\n  There is a time and place to debate it, but this is not it. We should \nbe doing the business we have not completed from last year, and that is \nthe appropriations bill. I have a resolution, and I can do exactly what \nthe Democratic leader did. I can ask unanimous consent that we take the \nplaintiff's side of this case and ask that it would pass. I know it \nwould be objected to. It was actually drafted by Senator Hatch, so I \nwill leave that to him to elect to do.\n  It is kind of a waste of the Senate's time for people to take a \ncontentious issue and say: I am going to ask unanimous consent that we \ntake one side of that issue and try to pass it, knowing it would not \npass. I could make this same argument and know it would not pass. I \nthink we would be wasting the Senate's time.\n  I urge our colleagues to stay with the regular order and finish the \nwork we did not do last year, and that would be to deal with the \namendments that are pending and pass the unfinished business of the \nappropriations bills.\n  I shall not ask unanimous consent at this point, but if people want \nto pursue this, we can.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/17/senate-section/article/S1123-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1123]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    MAKING FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003--\n                               Continued\n\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today to, quite frankly, \ncompliment and add to the comments of my friend from West Virginia, \nSenator Byrd--although I will not be as eloquent--who spoke today on \nIraq and Korea and national security policy.\n\n[[Page S1124]]\n\n  Before I do, there was an intervening comment exchange that was made \non the floor earlier relating to the Michigan University cases.\n  I rise at this moment not to speak on whether or not the merits of \nthe Michigan cases or the merits of the Michigan admissions policies \nare constitutional or unconstitutional. My instinct, in what little I \nknow about it, is that it seems to be constitutional because there is a \ntwo-pronged equal protection test that has to be met; and that is, does \nthe University's consideration of race as one of many factors in making \nadmissions decisions constitute a compelling Government interest, and \nif it does, is it narrowly tailored. It appears, from what I have read \nin the press, that it is.\n  But I want to respond in the next 2 minutes to something my friend \nfrom Pennsylvania, my neighbor, Senator Santorum, said. He talked about \nthis point system. I just want to remind everyone how the University of \nMichigan's policy works, which is like many other universities.\n  Under the University's undergraduate admissions process, every \napplicant can get up to 150 points in seeking admission. My assumption \nis, what the university does, it reviews all of the applications from \napplicants. No one gets 150 points, necessarily, but there are methods \nby which you can get up to 150 points.\n  Madam President, 110 of the 150 points are strictly related to \nacademic criteria. They relate to GPA, the school you went to, the high \nschool you went to, the curricula you took, your SAT scores, et cetera. \nForty points are up for grabs, and they relate to nonacademic factors.\n\n  It is possible for a minority to get 20 points because of his \nminority status. People are pointing to that as saying that is unfair. \nWell, forget the constitutional detailed arguments for just a moment, \nbecause we will have plenty of time to make those on the floor. I want \neveryone to remind themselves what the rest of the University of \nMichigan policy allows.\n  If you are the son or daughter of alumni, you get 4 points. If you \ncome from an underrepresented county within the State of Michigan, you \ncan get up to 16 points. If you are a Michigan resident, you get 10 \npoints. If you are from an underrepresented State, you get 2 points.\n  Let me translate this. And I do not mean this as a criticism of \nanybody else's State. The most competitive, the most difficult place to \ngain admission, the most difficult geographic States to gain admission \nto the most elite colleges are Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and \nNew York. It is harder to get into competitive colleges if you're a \nresident of those States.\n  If you are from Mississippi or Alabama or Alaska and have the same \nscores as students from these northeast states--like my son or daughter \nfrom Delaware, and my nephew from Pennsylvania--and everything else is \nequal, the child from Mississippi or Alabama or Alaska will get into \nthe school before the child from Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, or \nMaryland. That's because--rightly or wrongly--the academic standards in \nthese latter States are considered to be higher, and the competition is \nmore intense.\n  So that is a literal fact of life. You say: OK, well, why in God's \nname would some child who does not have quite the same marks, or has \nthe same marks, from the Midwest or Alaska or the Deep South have an \nadvantage over a child from a New England State or a mid-Atlantic \nState? The reason is not to benefit the child. It is to benefit all the \nother students in the university. Because we have made a judgment, \nhistorically, in this Nation that it is better for my child to go to \nschool with someone from Alaska, Mississippi, South Carolina, North \nCarolina--all across the Nation--than it is to go to school with \neverybody being from Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware. It has \nbeen a judgment educators have made. And the more elite the university, \nthe more diversity, geographically, they seek.\n  It is the same way, I might add, that Rhodes Scholarships are, in \nfact, awarded. It is a heck of a lot harder to get a Rhodes Scholarship \nas a resident from New York State than it is from South Dakota. That is \na fact--a fact. It is the competition pool. Why? More money per pupil \ntends to be spent in those richer States than in the States that are \nnot as wealthy.\n  So what have we done? In everything we do about education, we seek, \nas a goal, not to reward the student, the diverse student who is coming \nin, but the goal is to reward the student body that is there to expose \nthem to diversity.\n  It is good that my middle-Atlantic State daughter is in a school with \npeople who talk to you like this--you know what I mean--like y'all do \nin the South. It is a good thing. She should be exposed to that. It is \ngood your southern son or daughter knows and has someone in class that \ntalks like they are from Brooklyn. It is a good thing. Some may \ndisagree, but that has been a national consensus.\n  Like geography, race is one of those factors colleges do and should \nconsider. The only generic point I want to make to people, as a Senator \nwho opposes quotas--that is not hyperbole; I oppose quotas; and I have \na 30-year voting record about that--but what is good for the goose is \ngood for the gander.\n  All of you who tell me this is a level playing field, give me a \nbreak. If your daddy happened to go to that school, it is not wrong \nthat you get a preference. But at least admit you are getting a \npreference. Stop this game, this silly little game.\n  If, in fact, you come from a State that is poor, stop pretending to \nme that it is a level playing field for a kid from Mississippi to get \nto Harvard versus a kid from Westchester County, NY to get to Harvard.\n  Give me a break. Let's stop being phony around here. I am not \nsuggesting anybody is phony. I am just trying to inform those of you \nwho have not had a chance to think of this how things actually work, \nhow they actually work.\n  And, by the way, even on the academic side, you get somewhere between \nzero and 10 points based on the school you went to.\n  The school I went to is a Catholic prep school, with mostly middle \nclass kids. My daughter, who is now a senior in college, graduated from \nthat same school several years ago. If my memory serves me correctly, I \nbelieve that out of 114 kids in her graduating class, 69 passed five or \nmore advanced placement tests, meaning that they tested out of their \nentire first semesters at the universities they attended--69 out of 114 \npassed five or more AP tests.\n  According to what was then put out by the SAT outfit out of New \nJersey, these kids represented the highest number in the region to test \nout of their first semester classes, and one of the highest in the \ncountry--this little old Catholic school I went to. Guess what. It \ncosts 14 grand a year to go to that school. Now, my daughter, I am \nconfident, were she applying to Michigan, could have gotten up to 18 \npoints--up to 10 for the quality of the school and up to an additional \n8 for the quality of her curriculum. And not because of anything she \nhad, but because her old man was able to borrow the money with her \nmother to pay for her to go to that school and expose her to that. She \nmay have gotten B's and my sons who went there or I who went there may \nhave gotten B's, while a kid from a little one-room schoolhouse--some \nStates still have one-room schoolhouses, not many--from a small school \nin, say, North Dakota, where you have 20 kids in a senior class, that \nkid got a B, same grade point. My daughter may have gotten up to 18 \npoints; the kid from North Dakota, with the same grade point average, \nmay get no added points.\n  How does it really work? A Black kid in west Philadelphia, he might \nhave gotten B's from a school we all acknowledge isn't that great a \nschool. My daughter gets an 18-point bump on the academic side because \nshe went to a school that costs--guess what, when I went there, it cost \n$900 a year, now it is 15, 14 grand. How many middle-class Black kids \nout there are able to pay 14 grand, or Hispanic, Latino kids? So I just \nthink we should be honest about this.\n  There is a legitimate constitutional argument to make and a test that \nMichigan is going to have to prove, and they should have to prove. \nThere is a two-prong test here. When you are in a suspect category--\nrace is a suspect category--there are two tests: One, is there a \ncompelling Government interest in using race as one of many factors to \nachieve a diverse class, and, two, is that use narrowly tailored. I \nthink\n\n[[Page S1125]]\n\nMichigan can prove that. I haven't done all the work. I teach \nconstitutional law; I think I know a little about it. I can't say to \nthe Chamber, I am guaranteeing I know the Michigan test is \nconstitutional. They should have to prove it. No problem. I think they \nwill. But let's not kid each other. OK? Level playing fields? I will \nconclude this part and get on to what I was going to speak about and \njust look at it.\n  Of the total 150 points an applicant to the University of Michigan \ncan get, 40 points are for non-academic factors. You can get 20 points \nif you're an underrepresented minority, but also if you're a \nscholarship athlete, or if you're a kid who is socio-economically \ndisadvantaged; you can get 10 points if you're a Michigan resident, 16 \npoints if you live in 2 particular counties in Michigan; 4 points if \nyour parents are alumni; 3 points for your required personal essay; 5 \npoints for personal achievement; 5 points for leadership and service \nand, guess what--I say to my friend who went to a great, great \nuniversity, the Presiding Officer, Duke University, one of the great \nuniversities in America; this will not surprise her, I suspect--the \nprovost has 20 points of discretion. How about that one? The provost \nhas 20 points of discretion.\n  Do you think the provost is more likely to receive a phone call from \nthe chairman of the board of General Motors, or do you think the \nprovost is likely to take a phone call from Rashid's mother in Detroit? \nMy colleagues, as the kids used to say, let's get real. Let's \nacknowledge the truth of this. There is no absolutely totally blind \ntest out there.\n  I am not criticizing. Universities have a reason for giving alumni \npreference. How do you think Harvard was built? There is a little red \nbook on how Harvard's endowment was built. You build loyalty to a \nuniversity. People then do things for the university. That is a good \nthing, not a bad thing. It is a good thing. There is geographic \ndiversity. It is a good thing that there is discretion built in.\n\n  But if you are going to take this purest view that race can never be \nconsidered, that minority status can't be considered and you want to be \nfair, be fair. Cash in your senatorial credentials when you start \nwriting recommendations. OK? Don't write a recommendation.\n  You want to be really fair? Be like every other person out there, do \nyou know what I mean? Maybe it is because I come from a place called \nClaymont. I come from an Irish Catholic family. I am the first one in \nmy family to go to college--no Horatio Alger story.\n  I once got in an argument during the Thomas hearings which I don't \nlike to recall very often. Someone was saying to me that there was no \npreference given to the Justice getting in the Yale University Law \nSchool. And I looked at this particular guy, who wasn't happy with me \nover another issue about logging roads through Federal lands. He was \nreally mad at me about that. I looked at him and I said: Where did you \ngo to school?\n  He said: I went to Yale.\n  I said: You are the guy who took my spot at Yale.\n  He said: What do you mean?\n  I said: We are the same age. You took my spot at Yale. I know you are \nthe one.\n  He said: What are you talking about?\n  This guy happened to be from Alaska. I come from Delaware. If I'm not \nmistaken, you got points at Yale for being from Alaska. And probably \nhis marks were better than mine, but I joked with him. He didn't know.\n  I said: I bet my marks were better than yours. I said: I'll make you \nanother bet. I bet your daddy went to Yale.\n  He said: Yes, what difference does that make?\n  It makes a difference. Assume my marks had been the same as his. I am \nfrom Claymont, Delaware. My father is making 17,000 bucks a year, and I \napplied to Yale. He is from a geographically underrepresented area and \nhis daddy went to Yale.\n  I mean this sincerely, I understand the anger of working-class and \nmiddle-class White people like me, my background. I can remember when \nmy dad, who was an automobile salesman, I remember my dad being so \nangry when he was trying to borrow the money to get a student loan to \nsend me to the local university and my sister almost at the same time. \nHe was $800 over the limit. It was like 18,000 bucks he made that year, \nover the limit to be able to borrow.\n  The guy who worked on the lot came in really happy one day, and my \ndad was good friends with him. But the guy was the laborer who cleaned \nthe cars. And he said: My son is getting in. I got the loan.\n  And my dad thought it was so unfair that this guy made one-third less \nthan he did and he was able to get the loan, but my dad couldn't afford \nto send us all without the loan.\n  So I am not in any way belittling the legitimate concern and anxiety \nof middle class and lower middle class White folks who feel they are \npushed out of the way. That is why I think we should give them all a \n$12,000 tax deduction to get to school which I have been pushing for 8 \nyears now.\n  But it amazes me how some of our friends in this Chamber and in the \nbody politic political elite really will bleed over the 1 or 2 or \nwhatever percent of the White children who really do get bumped out of \nthe way. Where is their bleeding for the 10, 20, or 30 percent of the \nBlack kids or Latino kids who get pushed out of the way a thousand \nways? Is anybody suggesting to me the injustice done to middle White \nclass or any White student is anywhere nearly equivalent to the \ninjustices done or the lack of opportunity available to minorities?\n\n  There is such an imbalance about this. That doesn't mean we should \njustify a wrong when it is only done to 1 percent of the people because \nthere is a greater wrong done to another group of people. We ought to \nbe able to figure out how to deal with this.\n  I will end with this: I respectfully suggest we should be making it a \nlot easier for kids to get to college, period, across the board. One of \nthe things we should do is what my friend from Connecticut has devoted \nhis career to, and he knows more about it than I do by a long shot, and \nthat is making elementary and secondary education truly equal. He had \nan amendment that said, on this big bill we passed on education, by the \nway, if you are going to test people equally, make sure you spend equal \namounts of money on them.\n  If you are a kid in west Philadelphia and you are a kid in Marion, \nwhich is one of the wealthiest areas just 4 miles away, I don't \nremember exactly what the numbers are, but it is like two or three to \none resources spent on the kid in Marion to educate him than the kid in \nwest Philadelphia. We are going to give them the same test. It reminds \nme of the old separate but equal stuff. So there is a lot we can do to \nmake sure no child, White or Black, is bumped out of the way because \nthey are qualified, but otherwise they do not suffer from one of the \nlitany of things listed as being able to be taken into consideration in \nadmission.\n  I am not making the case on the merits. I don't know enough about the \nMichigan policy. I hope we have a honest discussion about this when we \ntalk about it because there are preferences built in across the board, \nabsolute preferences.\n  I know, as a middle-class White kid--lower middle class \neconomically--growing up, who did relatively well, I knew that the kid \nwho had a lot more money, whose parents had gone to college, had more \nof an advantage. I didn't begrudge them the advantage. It is just \nthere. It is just there. Let us at least admit to that and acknowledge \nthat. Let's stop this--and nobody has done this in the Chamber, but \nlet's not start demagoging this notion that all these White kids are \nbeing discriminated against and so-called reverse discrimination is \nkilling opportunities for White children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/17/senate-section/article/S1125-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1125-S1126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NORTH KOREA AND IRAQ\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, we can't afford to put either Iraq or \nNorth Korea on the back burner. Both need our immediate and sustained \nattention. But the crisis on the Korean peninsula, and it is a crisis--\nis our most urgent priority.\n  The situation in North Korea has gone from bad to worse. They've \nthrown out the international inspectors. They've turned off cameras \nthat tracked thousands of canisters of weapons grade plutonium. They've \nwithdrawn from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.\n\n[[Page S1126]]\n\n  The irony here is that the very rationale some in the administration \ncite for regime change in Iraq is an emerging reality in North Korea: A \nrogue regime and one of the world's worst proliferators is on the verge \nof becoming a plutonium factory. It will sell anything it develops to \nthe highest bidder.\n  We know it doesn't take much plutonium to make a nuclear threat real. \nYou only need something the size of the bottom of a water glass, about \nan eighth of an inch thick, two pieces. With a crude operation to ram \nit together at high speed, you have a 1 kiloton bomb in a homemade \nnuclear device.\n  My colleagues from New York will remember this: our national \nlaboratories produced what could be a homemade nuclear weapon. They \nmade it off the shelf with easily obtainable materials. Everything \nexcept the plutonium. I asked Senators Clinton and Schumer to bring \nthat homemade weapon up to S. 407 and they walked it right in.\n  The threat of proliferation exists in North Korea as we speak, right \nnow, not tomorrow or next week or next month or next year, but right \nnow.\n  And by the way, if President Clinton had not completed the Agreed \nFramework, North Korea would already have material for dozens of \nnuclear weapons.\n  If North Korea continues down this path, we also risk an arms race in \nAsia. Think about it. North Korea, South Korea, Japan. And if that \nhappens, China will build up its nuclear weapons arsenal, India will \nget nervous and do the same, and Pakistan will follow suit. Everything \nwe've been working to present for decades--a nuclear arms race in Asia \nand beyond--will become a reality. And that could have a terrible \nimpact on economic stability, too.\n  The regime in Pyongyang is first and foremost to blame for this \ncrisis. But frankly, two years of policy incoherence on our part has \nnot helped matters. We have see-sawed back and forth between engagement \nand name-calling.\n  And the last two weeks of taking options off the table--especially \ntalking--has made matters worse. It tied our own hands and added \ntension to our already strained relationship with a key ally, South \nKorea. We need a clear--and clear eyed--strategy for dealing with this \ndanger.\n  I'm pleased the administration now seems to be on the right track. As \nseveral of us have argued for weeks, direct talks are the best way out \nof this impasse.\n  Some claim that talking is appeasement. Well, we know that not \ntalking could result in North Korea having the material to build up to \na half dozen nuclear weapons in six months--and dozens more in the \nmonths and years to follow.\n  We know that taking out North Korea's plutonium program must be a \ncourse of very last resort. Pyongyang has more than 10,000 heavily \nprotected artillery pieces just miles from Seoul--it could devastate \nthe city, its inhabitants and many of our troops before we could \nrespond.\n  We know that for additional sanctions to bite, we would need the \nparticipation of South Korea and China, neither of whom so far, wants \nto pursue that path.\n  And we know that talking is not appeasement. It is the most effective \nway to tell North Korea what it must do if it wants more normal \nrelations with us. In fact, in dealing with an isolated regime and a \nclosed-off leader, talking clearly and directly is critical if we want \nto avoid miscommunication and miscalculation.\n  We cannot and should not buy the same carpet twice. We won't if we \ninsist on getting more from North Korea than we got last time. This \nshould include giving up the plutonium and spent fuel it already has \nproduced and forsaking the production of plutonium and uranium in the \nfuture--all of this verified by international inspectors and \nmonitoring.\n  In turn, we should hold out the prospect of a more normal \nrelationship, including energy assistance, food aid and a ``no \nhostility pledge.''\n\n\n                                  iraq\n\n  As we contend with Korea, we also must deal with Iraq. The \nadministration was mistaken to suggest North Korea could be put on the \nback burner. But so are those who suggest Iraq is not a major problem. \nIt is, and we must continue to deal with it on its own merits, but on \nour own timetable.\n  It's no secret that the State Department, the Defense Department, and \nthe Joint Chiefs of are at odds on the best course of action in Iraq.\n  We have Hans Blix and the IAEA saying that the inspectors need more \ntime to accomplish their mission--that they will have to stay in Iraq \nmuch longer to get the job done.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld is saying, if we get ourselves locked in for four \nmore months we will lose our weather window and be forced to wait until \nthe fall.\n  Secretary Powell is saying, look, we must make it a priority to \nmaintain the support of the French and the Germans and everyone else, \nnot to mention the American people. The President was right to make \nIraq the world's problem, not just our own. Let's keep it that way.\n  In my view, the President has shown restraint on Iraq. He has gone to \nthe United Nations. He has allowed inspectors to begin. Now he must \nallow them to take their course. I would say to the President, keep it \ngoing. In the eyes of the world, you're doing it right.\n  Inspectors are not a permanent solution and neither is our massive \ntroop presence. But so long as the inspectors are doing their work in \nIraq, backed up by the threat of our forces, it is highly unlikely Iraq \ncould pursue a nuclear program undetected or would run the risk of \nselling chemical or biological weapons to terrorists. And we will \nsustain international support. Meanwhile, the pressure will build on \nSaddam. Unlike in North Korea, times is on our side, not his.\n  Of course, this massive deployment is costly and hard on our men and \nwomen in uniform. But going to war would be far more costly in terms of \ntroops and treasure. It must remain a last resort.\n  If we do go to war, we better be absolutely certain that our friends \nand allies are all in the game at the outset.\n  Not because we cannot prevail against Saddam Hussein without them. We \ncan--though it certainly makes sense to spread the risk and share the \ncost. But because without the support of other nations, we will be left \nwith a political, financial, and, potentially, a regionally \ndestabilizing burden after we take down Saddam. We will have to deal \nwith the ``day after'' Saddam--or more accurately the decade after--on \nour own.\n  In the weeks ahead, if we move to war, I hope the President will tell \nthe American people what he has not yet told them: How much will the \nwar cost? How will the balance his guns and butter rhetoric with the \nbottom-line budget realities we face? How many troops will have to stay \nin Iraq after Saddam and for how long? How much will it cost to rebuild \nIraq? Who will help us foot the bill? The American people deserve \nanswers to these and other key questions?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I wish to focus the body for a few \nminutes on January 20, 2003, when we will pause to remember Dr. Martin \nLuther King, Jr., a man who changed the course of history and America's \nconscience.\n  Dr. King is really one of those few individuals throughout history \nwho has so nobly exemplified the principles of sacrificial love and \ndevotion. He changed a country, and he gave his life in the process.\n  I want to read a short excerpt from a speech he gave the night before \nhe was assassinated. On April 3, 1968, 1 day before he was killed, Dr. \nKing said the following in a speech:\n\n       I don't know what will happen now. We've got some difficult \n     days ahead, but it doesn't matter with me now. I've been to \n     the mountaintop and I don't mind. Like anybody, I would like \n     to live a long life; longevity has its place, but I am not \n     concerned about that now. I just want to do God's will. And \n     he's allowed me to go up to the mountain, and I have looked \n     over and I have seen the promised land. I may not get there \n     with you, but I want you to know tonight that we as a people \n     will get to the promised land.\n\n  He said that April 3, 1968, the day before he was killed. I want to \nparticularly focus on that last sentence:\n\n       . . . but I want you to know tonight that we as a people \n     will get to the promised land.\n\n\n[[Page S1127]]\n\n\n  In order for our Nation to reach the promised land Dr. King \nreferenced, we must see a racial understanding, a racial \nreconciliation. We are still working at it and we still have a ways to \ngo. We need to do it through education, through cooperation, through \ncommunication, and we need to do it every way we can.\n  For several years now, several of us have been working together--I \nhave particularly worked with Congressman John Lewis on the House side \nto create a national museum of African-American history and culture on \nThe Mall here in Washington--in our front yard. I am proud to say that \nI have had the support of many Members of this Chamber on this issue, \nincluding Senators Sessions, Specter, Dodd, and Clinton.\n  I am confident that when the Presidential commission, which we \ncreated, submits their report on the creation of this much needed piece \nof American history, this body will vote to create this museum--a \nmuseum that not only means a great deal to African Americans, but to \nthis whole Nation as well.\n  I don't pretend that the creation of a museum will be a cure-all for \nracial reconciliation. It is, however, an important and, I think, a \nvery productive step toward healing our Nation's racial wounds. I hope \nit can be a museum of reconciliation at the end of the day, and that we \nwill be expanding on Dr. King's philosophy of understanding the plight \nof one another through education.\n  As we celebrate the life and legacy of one of our greatest national \nleaders, we need to return to those basic values which Dr. King \npromoted. His values are work, family, charity for our fellow man, and, \nmost importantly, the recognition of a higher moral authority, which \nempowered his life so much.\n  I had the opportunity last year to meet in Atlanta with Dr. King's \nwife, Coretta Scott King. She brought up again that point of view that \nempowered him, which was the power of faith that was evident in all \nthat he did. Only through those qualities he expressed and lived by \nwill we become a nation truly worthy of Dr. King's legacy.\n\n  According to Dr. King, I will quote again:\n\n       The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in \n     moments of comfort and convenience, but at times of challenge \n     and controversy. A true neighbor will risk his position, his \n     prestige, and even his life for the welfare of others. Indeed \n     Dr. King exemplified those qualities in his life, and I \n     invite all of my colleagues to join me in continuing this \n     legacy.\n\n  We will be introducing--probably within a month--the bill on the \nnational African American museum. I hope my colleagues will join us in \nsupporting this. I think it is going to be an important statement. We \nhave tried now for some 73 years to get this sort of museum--I have not \npersonally, but a number of groups have. It is time that this happens \nin order to tell the difficulties, trials, tribulations, and triumphs \nof the African-American people. It is my hope that through this \nunderstanding we will start to improve and create bonds and a racial \nreconciliation in our land.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise to talk about a matter that is of \nurgent concern to the people I represent in the State of North Dakota, \nwhere we have been hit by a series of natural disasters, both drought \nand flood.\n  In northeastern North Dakota, we have had nearly a decade of overly \nwet conditions and, as a result, very severe crop damage, a dramatic \nloss in production. Ironically, in the other corner of the State, the \nsouthwestern corner, we have had the most severe drought since the \n1930s. This combination has been a devastating blow to producers in my \nState, as it has been to producers in Montana, where they have suffered \nfrom terrible drought. Right down the core of the country, State after \nState has experienced overly dry conditions. On the other hand, States \nto our east have experienced overly wet conditions, with dramatic crop \nlosses, and substantial damage to the economy as a result.\n  In the last farm bill, we passed in the Senate on a bipartisan basis \na disaster relief package. When we went to conference with the House of \nRepresentatives, we were told there were two things that could not be \nnegotiated. One was opening up Cuba to trade. The second was disaster \nassistance. We were told that both had to go to the Speaker of the \nHouse. When the Speaker of the House was contacted, he said that the \nanswer on both of those questions--opening up Cuba for trade and \ndisaster assistance--was a firm no.\n  The administration, in open session in the conference committee, \nindicated they would not support disaster assistance.\n  Madam President, we now come to this juncture, and we have another \nopportunity to respond to the extraordinary natural disasters that have \nbeen felt in various parts of the country. And the question is: What do \nwe do? Some have suggested in this legislation an across-the-board cut \nof 1.6 percent in all domestic programs, and then to take some of that \nmoney and give a bonus payment to all farmers, whether they have been \nhit by natural disaster or not.\n  As much as I would like to see a bonus payment to all farmers, I \nreally do not think it can be justified before we provide a disaster \nprogram for those who have been hit by natural disasters.\n  The hard reality is that this is something we have always done, \nwhether it was floods in other parts of the country--Missouri--or \nhurricanes in Florida or earthquakes in California. Every year I have \nbeen here, 16 years, we have responded to natural disasters. Last year, \nfor the first time ever, we failed. There was no program to respond to \nnatural disasters.\n  I do not think we are going to look very good to the American people \nor very responsive to those who have suffered from natural disasters if \nour answer is to cut programs across the board and give a bonus to all \nfarmers whether they suffered from natural disaster or not. I just do \nnot think that can be defended. I believe such an approach is going to \ncreate very hard feelings, and I do not think it is fair.\n  The drought we are experiencing in southwestern North Dakota has now \ncrept across the State. We just received the latest information from \nthe U.S. Drought Monitor. It shows that the drought is now covering \nvirtually all of our State and, of course, it shows the terrible and \nprolonged drought to our west in Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, and down \ninto Arizona. This is a drought that is expanding, that is growing, and \nthat is devastating everything in its wake. That has to be responded \nto, and always before, we have had a program of natural disaster \nassistance.\n  Some have said: Just take it out of the farm bill. There are no \nprovisions for disaster assistance in the farm bill. The administration \nopposed it. It is not there.\n  Some say it is not fiscally responsible to have a program of natural \ndisaster assistance. We have never taken that position in the whole 16 \nyears I have been here. We have helped every part of the country that \nsuffered from natural disaster. Every year, we have helped those who \nhave been hurt. I do not think we should do any less this year.\n  The fact is, I wrote the Congressional Budget Office and asked them: \nWhat are the savings in the farm bill because of these disasters? They \nwrote back to me and said: Senator, the savings, because of these \nnatural disasters, are approaching $6 billion this year. Why? If you \nhave natural disasters, you have less production; less production, \nhigher prices; higher prices, lower farm program payments.\n  The distinguished occupant of the chair is married to a gentleman \nwith whom I served for many years. Senator Dole, the former Republican \nleader, represented Kansas in the Senate. He and I worked together many \ntimes on disaster assistance in the Agriculture Committee and on the \nfloor of the Senate. Whether it was a problem in Kansas or a problem in \nNorth Dakota or a\n\n[[Page S1128]]\n\nproblem outside of our States, we sought to be responsive to those who \nsuffered from natural disaster, and I believe we should do that again.\n\n  The proposal in this appropriations bill was not done in consultation \nwith the Agriculture Committee members, and it borders on bizarre. I do \nnot know how else to say it. To cut every other domestic program by 1.6 \npercent and then give a bonus payment to every farmer, whether they \nhave suffered losses or not, whether they have had natural disaster or \nnot, I do not think can be justified.\n  We just passed a farm bill. I fought very hard for it. It is a good \nfarm bill. It is not perfect, but it is a good farm bill, substantially \nstronger than the previous farm bill. For us to cut every other program \n1.6 percent and give a bonus payment to every farmer in the country \nwhether they suffered from a disaster or not, I do not think can be \njustified, I do not think can be supported.\n  Sign me up to give help to those who have suffered a natural \ndisaster. Whether it is in the State of Kentucky, the State of North \nCarolina, the State of New Mexico, the States of North or South Dakota, \nMontana, or Colorado, we ought to have a disaster package, disaster \nassistance for those suffering from disaster. We should not cut \neverybody else and give bonus payments to those who have had no \ndisaster.\n  How can that be justified? What are we going to do, cut law \nenforcement to give bonus payments to those who had no disaster? I do \nnot believe that will be sustained. I do not believe that will be \ncarried through the process. I do not believe the President of the \nUnited States would sign such legislation. Most of all, it is not \nright.\n  Let's take the resources that are available, the substantial savings \nthat are in the farm bill because of these disasters. Because we had \nnatural disasters, there is less production; as a result of that, there \nwere higher prices; as a result of that, there were lower farm program \npayments to the tune of $6 billion, maybe more. The CBO is about to \nrelease new estimates. They may show even greater savings. I think a \nportion of those savings ought to be allocated to help those who \nsuffered from natural disasters, and goodness knows those losses were \nwidespread in 2002.\n  I conclude by asking my colleagues to think carefully about the \nprecedent we are setting because always before, when others suffered \nnatural disaster, we responded. We ought to do no less now.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, it is appropriate that, on the eve of \nthe Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ngreat Marylander and civil rights leader in his own right, former \nBaltimore Mayor Clarence ``Du'' Burns.\n  From humble beginnings in East Baltimore, Du Burns began a lifetime \nof public service and great accomplishments, eventually becoming the \nfirst African-American mayor of Baltimore. Born on September 13, 1918, \nin East Baltimore, Du attended Frederick Douglas High School and the \nLarry London School of Music, where he developed a love of jazz that \nwould stay with him through his lifetime. At the age of 21, he married \nEdith Phillips, and soon thereafter joined the United States Army Air \nCorps. Du served in the Air Corps for 3 years before returning to \nBaltimore and embarking on a long career of service to the city.\n  For 20 years, Du Burns worked at Paul Laurence Dunbar High School as \na recreational and youth hygiene counselor. In 1971, he first entered \nthe political arena, serving as 2nd district councilman from 1971 until \n1982, and later became both Vice President and the first African-\nAmerican President of the city council. Then, on January 26, 1987, Du \nwas sworn in to complete the term of Governor William Donald Schaefer, \nbecoming the 45th mayor of Baltimore and the first African-American \nmayor in the history of the city.\n  This simple list of Du's career positions does not come close to \nexpressing all he accomplished and all he meant to Baltimore. Du Burns \ngot his nickname because he was always ``doing'' things for others. He \nmade his life's work the improvement of our city, particularly those \nareas that others had written off as beyond help. Among his many \naccomplishments were the creation of the new Dunbar High School \nComplex; the East Baltimore Medical Plan, the first community-based HMO \nin the Nation; and Ashland Mews, a 372 town home community for first \ntime homeowners. Du was one of the founding members and later a long-\ntime chairman of the board of the East Baltimore Corporation, a \nnonprofit organization that provides substance abuse services, job \ntraining and placement, and numerous other services to people that \ndesperately needed assistance in order to revitalize the community. Du \nlikewise was a founder and chairman of the Eastside Democratic \nOrganization. But most central in his life was his family and his \nchurch. Du was an active member of the St. Francis Xavier Roman \nCatholic Church for 45 years, and devoted to his wife Edith, daughter \nCheryl, granddaughter, and extended family.\n  Like Dr. King, Du Burns serves as an example that one person can move \nmountains and change the world for the better with selfless service to \nthe community. I was privileged to attend the funeral mass for Du \nyesterday, which was a touching celebration of his life and legacy. I \nthink the homily given by Father Edward Miller at that service was a \nwonderful tribute to the spirit that guided his life, and which we \nshould all strive to emulate. In honor of Du Burns, I ask unanimous \nconsent that a copy of that homily now be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Eulogy for Clarence ``Du'' Burns\n\n                       (By Father Edward Miller)\n\n       Extraordinary people are ordinary people, who allow Gods's \n     Amazing Grace to touch them and transform, them.\n       Extraordinary people are ordinary people, who, if you \n     hinted that they were extraordinary, would deny it, with all \n     Christian Honesty and Humility.\n       Extraordinary people are ordinary people, who, are graceful \n     in life's victories, and gracious in life's defeats, because \n     they know the God who makes the sun to shine on the just and \n     unjust, the rain to fall on the good and not so good.\n       Extraordinary people are ordinary people, who, when they \n     are `the first' to do something, simply say that somebody had \n     to be first, but then look out for those who come after them, \n     knowing that ``if I can help somebody . . .''\n       This morning we come in faith to commend the soul of our \n     brother in the Lord, and an extraordinary man, Clarence Du \n     Burns, to Almighty God.\n       I'll bet even God calls him Du.\n       When I went to the hospital to give him the Last Rites of \n     our Catholic Church, his much loved grandchild Lisa, trying \n     to wake him up, kept calling in his ear, ``Du - Du - Du - \n     wake up!''\n       Now, I come from the old school, and cannot ever imagine \n     calling either of my grandfathers John.\n       But I am sure that Du would have had it no other way!\n       He was proud of that name! And he will probably be the only \n     Baltimorean to ever carry it. He got it the old fashioned \n     way: he earned it.\n       When you speak it, and we had better tell his story to our \n     children and children's children, speak his name with \n     reverence, and with respect.\n       Du Burns embodied what was good about politics, what was \n     good about life, what was good about Baltimore, the city he \n     loved.\n       He loved his country, which he served for 4 years in the \n     army.\n       He loved his Catholic Faith, and as a convert to \n     Catholicism 45 years ago, was a member of St. Francis Xavier \n     Catholic Church, itself a first, the first African American \n     Catholic Parish in the US.\n       It was the only church he was a member of as an adult, \n     those 45 years, although he was known to sneak over to St. \n     Bernardine's from time to time with Cheryl and Lisa, and soon \n     stopped standing up when visitors stood to be recognized.\n       He served at St. Francis Xavier as an usher, but not in an \n     official, usher board capacity; he stepped in when needed, \n     when the ushers were short-handed.\n       That was Du.\n       The Sun editorial on Tuesday said ``when he ascended in \n     1987 to become the first Black mayor of Baltimore, Mr. Burns \n     knew a thing or two about how to make things work. He knew \n     how to run an organization, he knew how to look after \n     people.''\n       Cardinal Keeler, that sounds like the definition of an \n     effective pastor! And he might have made a great Catholic \n     priest and pastor, except that God called him to another \n     vocation, to say ``I do'' to Miss Edith 63 years ago, and to \n     travel through life together for these past 63 years.\n       Du loved his family, his wife, daughter and granddaughter, \n     as the family pictures that literally cover every square inch \n     of the living room walls attest.\n       Much was always made of Du's humble beginnings, of the \n     locker room at Dunbar. And I say, ``Tell it, tell it, tell it \n     some more; tell it to our children, who flippantly dismiss \n     flipping burgers, because it is beneath them.''\n\n[[Page S1129]]\n\n       Our youth need to know that if you have nothing, then \n     nothing is below you. You can't be the CEO, if you have \n     Zero!!! We need to tell them that in life, you do, and you \n     keep doing; and if God gives you a lemon, you make the best \n     lemonade anyone ever drank. That was Du's way!\n       Tell them that if you do what is right, God will make a \n     way, somehow! That was Du's faith!\n       His being present and available back then at Dunbar, led to \n     so many other developments.\n       Du became a youth counselor--to shape and guide young \n     lives; a teacher--who shared his street smarts, and mentored \n     aspiring politicians in East Baltimore; a developer--as the \n     Dunbar Complex rose up; this uneducated man!; an architect--\n     of the East Baltimore Community Development; a builder--as \n     new housing rose up for first time home owners; a \n     negotiator--as his skills built city council coalitions; this \n     uneducated man!; a doctor--as the East Baltimore Medical Plan \n     came to be; a wise man--who knew that you don't hang your \n     dirty laundry out for all to see; but you clean it up in the \n     back room, and hang it out clean, so no one would be \n     embarrassed; a mathematician--who knew that ``10'' was the \n     magic number; 10 votes, you win! This uneducated man!\n       But most of all, Du Burns was a servant of God!\n       The First Letter of John tells us that we cannot say we \n     love the God we cannot see, if we do not love the sisters and \n     brothers we do see.\n       Du knew that; he saw situations, he recognized needs, and \n     he served. The phrase ``too busy'' was not in his vocabulary.\n       People were housed, fed, educated, given a chance, at his \n     initiative. That is not irrelevant; that is life-giving, that \n     is service; and to a believer, that is living the Gospel of \n     Jesus Christ.\n       Baltimore is better, because Du Burns, an ordinary man, \n     took what God gave him, used it for others' good, and became \n     extraordinary, and forever a piece of Baltimore history.\n       Too many people spend their lives climbing the ladder of \n     success, and when they reach the top, they find out it has \n     been leaning against the wrong building all the time.\n       Not so for Du.\n       Most important: Du knew what God would do.\n       He knew that it mattered not if your name appeared in Who's \n     Who at the library; it only mattered if your name was written \n     in the Book of Life.\n       Sunday afternoon, Our Father God sent an escort named \n     Jesus, to take Du home.\n       As lovingly as Lisa had called his name the Sunday before, \n     Jesus now called his name.\n       The man who rode to many city appointments in a city limo, \n     now had his best ride ever, as that heavenly chariot swung \n     down to take him to that home on the other side, to that land \n     where he will never grow old.\n       And he heard the Lord say, Du, you did! You understood \n     that, whatever you did to the least of your s/b, you did to \n     me! Now, rest in the green pasture, sit beside the cool \n     water, take your place at the banquet table.\n       On Du's tombstone will soon be inscribed his name, dates of \n     birth and death, and a dash in between them.\n       What he did in that dash through life made all the \n     difference.\n       The psalmist says that 70 is the sum of our years, or 80 if \n     we are strong.\n       So we place a strong man, tenderly, lovingly, into God's \n     unchanging hands.\n       We are better, Baltimore is better, because Du passed \n     through.\n       Thank You, Lord, for Du. Give him, we pray you, the reward \n     that his good labors deserve.\n       Eternal Rest grant unto him, O Lord . . .\n  Mr. BREAUX. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to a great \nhumanitarian and a great American, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. This \nweek, as our Nation honors Dr. King on what would have been his 74th \nbirthday, we have an opportunity to reflect on his courage, his legacy, \nand his dream for a better and more equal America.\n  To honor his legacy and to more fully realize Dr. King's dream, we in \npublic service must support an agenda that reflects what is most \nimportant in the lives of all Americans, policies that emphasize \neconomic opportunity, improved education, an enhanced healthcare \nsystem, election reform and protection of basic civil rights.\n  First, as we commemorate the legacy of Dr. King and his dream for our \nNation I would like to take an opportunity to recognize the brave \ncontribution of the African-American community in my own state of \nLouisiana, men and women who have been true leaders and pioneers in our \nshared journey for equality, justice and human dignity for all \nAmericans.\n  Our country's first bus boycott, before Rosa Parks' courageous stand \nin Montgomery, occurred in Baton Rouge. Dr. King's national civil \nrights organization, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, was \ninaugurated and chartered in New Orleans. And the bravery exhibited by \nstudents at Southern University was responsible for the landmark \nSupreme Court case that desegregated the entire interstate commerce \nfacilities.\n  Dr. King's dream for equality and opportunity is reflected in recent \nwork here on the floor of this body.\n  Last year, Congress and President Bush worked together to improve \neducation for all students in our public schools with increases in \nFederal incentives for the lowest performing schools. To that end, I \nintend to pursue increased funding for the TRIO and GEAR UP programs, \nand for Historically Black Colleges and Universities, HBCUs.\n  Congress has passed comprehensive election reform legislation to \nbegin to correct the problems and prevent the abuses of the 2000 \nelection that led to the disenfranchisement of African-Americans and \nother minorities.\n  Our country struggles through an economic slowdown with high levels \nof unemployment, particularly in the African-American community. \nCongress has acted and passed an extension of unemployment benefits.\n  In 1996, we changed the way welfare works to help families escape the \ncycle of poverty and achieve independence. This year we must \nreauthorize those landmark reforms, but do so with more funding for \nchildcare, healthcare and transportation. Children should not be the \nvictims of welfare reform, and no mother should be forced to choose \nbetween her job and the care of her child.\n  There is much more to do. Today there are more than 40 million \nAmericans without health insurance. As health care costs rise, we need \na new approach to health care in this country, an approach that aspires \nto universal access for every man, woman, and child.\n  It is also past time to engage in a sustained and serious dialogue on \nracial profiling with an eye toward more public education and \nantiprofiling legislation.\n  Our country has come a long way in working to end the plague of \ndiscrimination and prejudice. Are things better? Yes, but they can be \nbetter still. We can do better, and we must.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, all across America preparations are being \nmade to commemorate the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. \nOn Monday, January 20, we will memorialize a man who sought to protect \nthe dignity of a people and awaken the conscience of a Nation.\n  Dr. King's death is 35 years behind us now. To some extent, deeply \nfelt passions and the frustration, anguish, and bitterness with which \nthe Nation was consumed during the tragic year of 1968 have cooled. But \nwhat remains with us and what is indelibly woven into the fabric and \nhistory of our Nation is the vision which Dr. King lived for and the \ndream for which he died. Dr. King embraced all Americans in his quest \nto make a living reality of equality of opportunity and economic and \nsocial justice for all humankind, those fundamental principles in our \nConstitution.\n  This great warrior, whose battlefield was the hearts and minds of \nthose who did not feel that justice and dignity were meant for all \npeople, whose shield and armor was a strong determination and an \nunassailable character and whose ammunition was moral conviction and \nself-sacrifice, continues to deserve the fullest honor of this Nation.\n  Dr. King gave a number of famous speeches during his time, most \nnotably in Montgomery, Birmingham, Selma, Chicago, Detroit, and several \nother cities. He came to Detroit on June 23, 1963, the day after his \nfirst meeting with President Kennedy. Introduced as ``America's beloved \nfreedom fighter,'' he called the ``Freedom Walk'' that day in Detroit \n``the largest and greatest demonstration for freedom ever held in the \nUnited States.'' Dr. King went on to say, `` . . . I can assure you \nthat what has been done here today will serve as a source of \ninspiration for freedom-loving people of this nation.''\n  Dr. King spoke about Birmingham and the vision that had been \nbroadcast to the entire world just two months earlier, when dogs and \nfire hoses were turned against peaceful marchers. He said, and I quote, \n``Birmingham tells us something in glaring terms--it says that the \nNegro is no longer willing to accept racial segregation in any of its \ndimensions.'' It is said that the Freedom Walk in Detroit was in many \nrespects a rehearsal for the upcoming March on Washington and Dr. \nKing's I Have a Dream speech, two months\n\n[[Page S1130]]\n\nlater on August 28, in our Nation's Capital.\n  Dr. King gave the people of this Nation an ethical and moral way to \nengage in activities designed to perfect social change without \nbloodshed and violence; and when violence did erupt it was that which \nis potential in any protest which aims to uproot deeply entrenched \nwrongs. Dr. King preached, ``Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome \nevil with good.''\n  He believed in a united America. He believed that the walls of \nseparation brought on by legal and de facto segregation and \ndiscrimination based on race and color, could be eradicated. His quest \nwas to make a living reality our fundamental principles, that ``all men \nare created equal,'' and with a right to ``life, liberty, and the \npursuit of happiness.''\n  Few have dedicated their life so tirelessly in the struggle for \nequality as Dr. King. From the bus boycott in Montgomery to the \nsanitation workers in Memphis, his unyielding commitment to improve the \nlot of all Americans was demonstrated--he achieved significant goals by \npeaceful and nonviolent actions. To Dr. King, those means were \nbeneficial to those in the struggle as the ends they were seeking.\n  With reference to the 11-month long successful Montgomery bus \nboycott, he said:\n\n       Nonviolence had tremendous psychological importance to the \n     Negro . . . This method was grasped by the Negro masses \n     because it embodied the dignity of struggle, of moral \n     conviction and self-sacrifice. The Negro was able to face his \n     adversary, to concede to him a physical advantage and to \n     defeat him because the superior force of the oppressor had \n     become powerless . . . I am convinced that the courage and \n     discipline with which Negro thousands had accepted non-\n     violence healed the internal wounds of Negro millions who did \n     not themselves march in the street or sit in the jails of the \n     South. One need not participate directly in order to be \n     involved . . . to have pride in those who were the principals \n     . . . to restore to them some of the pride and honor which \n     had been stripped from them over the centuries. We have come \n     a long way toward achieving justice and equality for all.\n\n  When the Supreme Court order to end segregation on buses was \ndelivered to Montgomery, Dr. King proudly told an overflow crowd at a \nlocal church:\n\n       We came to see that, in the long run, it is more honorable \n     to walk in dignity than ride in humiliation. So in a quiet \n     dignified manner, we decided to substitute tired feet for \n     tired souls, and walk the streets of Montgomery until the \n     sagging walls of injustice have been crushed.\n\n  We have come a good distance in fulfilling Dr. King's dream, but \nthere is still a ways to go. Let us rededicate ourselves today, in his \nname, to continuing the struggle for human rights for all, for which he \nlived and died.\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, I rise today to celebrate the life and \nremarkable work of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. In remembering Dr. King, \nI think we should all hold close to our hearts these words, spoken by \nDr. King in May 1944:\n\n       So as we gird ourselves to defend democracy from foreign \n     attack, let us see to it that increasingly at home we give \n     fair play and free opportunity for all people.\n\n  Even as we continue to fight the war on terrorism abroad, we are \nreminded of the injustice that still exists here, and we must be \nequally diligent to root out violence and discrimination at home.\n  The racial profiling and hate crimes that have occurred in the wake \nof September 11 are a blight on our Nation; but, we know that hate \ncrimes are not new. June will mark the 5th anniversary of the murder of \nJames Byrd, Jr. in Jasper, TX. James Byrd was dragged to his death for \nno other reason than hatred of the color of his skin. This is shameful, \nand our government must do more to protect all its citizens regardless \nof skin color, religion, gender, national origin, or sexual \norientation.\n  As all of my colleagues know, I have been working to pass hate crimes \nlegislation that will eliminate the bureaucratic jurisdictional hurdles \nthat hinder our efforts to prosecute hate crimes, and give federal \nprosecutors new resources for cases involving race. I know that this \nwill be the year to finally pass this legislation in the U.S. Senate. \nIt is high time that we act to end the specter of hate across our \nNation.\n  So as we pause to remember Dr. King next week, let us continue to \nlook for opportunities to try to create change. We can all work a \nlittle bit harder to create the kind of world he dreamed about, a world \nin which things are the way they ``ought'' to be rather than the way \nthey are.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, on the occasion of the day that \nhonors Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., I offer a couple of thoughts. I \nwill share with the Senate a couple of stories.\n  I think of what Dr. King and his band of brothers and sisters meant \nto this Nation and their extraordinary success under extremely \ndifficult circumstances and under a great deal of duress. One of his \nyoung lieutenants is a member of this Congress, Congressman John Lewis \nof Atlanta. He was one of the youngest of Dr. King's lieutenants, \nhaving been a very young preacher from Alabama who had joined Dr. King, \na young preacher who, by the way, has regaled so many in this Congress \nwith the stories of how he learned to preach in a rural area of \nAlabama, on a dirt farm, where John Lewis as a child would go out to \nthe henhouse, and there, with an audience of hens perched on their \nperch in the henhouse, John Lewis would start to practice his oratory \nthat ultimately brought him to be such a great preacher, to be such a \ngreat lieutenant of Dr. King's, or now, as we know, a great public \nservant, having been a Member of the House of Representatives for a \nnumber of years.\n\n  But the story I wanted to share about John Lewis, I asked him one \nday, there was something very special about what you and Dr. King and \nthe rest of Dr. King's group would do because you were always together \nand there was not a lot of discord. How was it, in the face of all of \nthat physical threat and at times physical brutality, you were able to \nbe so successful and so single-minded of purpose that you ultimately \nachieved your goal?\n  He said: Bill, we always met together as a covenant group in prayer \nand we always prayed together that divine providence would watch over \nus, and that gave us the strength.\n  That was an insight for me into that extraordinary part of American \nhistory where they were so very successful. So, on this eve of Dr. \nMartin Luther King's holiday, I not only give the reverence and the \nrespect to Dr. King, but to those who were with him, like our friend, \nour colleague here in the Congress, Congressman John Lewis.\n  But there is another story I wanted to tell you about. It is \nillustrative of some of the obstacles that have had to be overcome, \nparticularly by minorities and people of color, for whom Dr. King \nfought so successfully. I want to tell you the story about Charlie \nBolden from Columbia, SC.\n  One day I was down in my State and a very distinguished retired \ngentleman approached me. He said, You don't know me, but we know \nsomeone in common and that's Charlie Bolden. He knew that the \nrelationship I had with Charlie Bolden was that Charlie was my pilot on \nthe 24th flight of the space shuttle. Both of us were rookies. That is \nthe same Charlie Bolden who went on to command two more flights, \nultimately retired from the astronaut office, went back in the active \nduty Marines, and has just recently retired with a second star--General \nCharlie Bolden.\n  But the story this gentleman wanted to tell me was the extraordinary \nsuccess story of Charlie Bolden from Columbia, SC, whose father was a \nfootball coach, whose mother was a librarian who had always taught him \nthe value of an education and the value of hard work. Yet when this \noutstanding high school student applied to the Naval Academy, his \nrepresentative from the South Carolina congressional delegation would \nnot nominate him because of the color of his skin. So this gentleman I \nmet in Florida wanted to tell me the story.\n  He was an Assistant Secretary of Defense under the administration of \nPresident Johnson, and one of his specific duties, in addition to his \nDepartment of Defense duties, was to go\n\n[[Page S1131]]\n\naround the country and find promising minority students and try to get \nthem married up with a sponsor who would nominate them to the service \nacademies. This gentleman found Charlie Bolden, who could not get a \nnomination from his congressional representative in his home State. But \nSenator Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota nominated Charlie.\n  Charlie went to Annapolis. He was promptly elected president of the \nfreshman class and continued as class president, interestingly, \nalternating as class president in that Annapolis class with another \nvery distinguished American, the just retired Adm. Blaire, the \nCommander in Chief of the Pacific for the United States. Charlie, at \nthe end of graduation, chose the Marines. He chose aviation, he became \na marine test pilot, and then he applied for the astronaut office. Fate \nbrought the two of us together on the flight that had to be scrubbed \nfour times on the pad, delayed over the better part of a month. On the \nfifth try, almost a month later, we were launched into an almost \nflawless 6-day mission, with Charlie having to correct a helium leak \nimmediately after launch, only to return to Earth from a very \nsuccessful mission and, 10 days later, Challenger launches and blows up \n10 miles high in the Florida sky.\n\n  An extraordinary success story about a fellow, an African American, \nwho wanted to achieve, who obviously had the right stuff, who could not \nget in because of the color of his skin in a nomination process, who \nwas given a break and who soared in his personal achievement and his \ncontributions to our society. This is another example of the principles \nfor which Dr. King fought.\n  I want to tell one more story. This is a story that has nothing to do \nwith American history, but it is one of my favorite political heroes in \nhistory. A British parliamentarian by the name of William Wilburforce \ncame to the Parliament in the 1790s and served there for almost 4 \ndecades. He came to the Parliament at age 21. He came at the same time \nas his good friend, William Pitt the younger, who, 3 years later, at \nage 24, was elected Prime Minister and, of course, William Wilburforce, \none of Pitt's best friends, could have been a part of the government. \nBut he had an experience and he decided to devote his life to the \nelimination of the established economic order of the day in England at \nthat time, the English slave trade.\n  Just to give you an idea of the enormous economic power of the slave \ntrade at that time, in the 1790s and early 1800s, it would be as if you \nwould take half of the American Fortune 500 companies, combining all of \nthat economic power, and that was the power that invaded the whole \ncountry of England at that time. That was how much money was being made \nby the shipping companies, by the captains, by the seamen, by the \ninsurance companies. They would go under the flag of truce, down off \nthe African coast--sometimes with the complicity of some of the tribal \nchieftains and sometimes not--taking natives as slaves against their \nwill and forcing them into the holds of ships, separating them from \nfamilies and shipping them to the new world where they would be sold.\n\n  Wilburforce, at age 24, and a Parliamentarian, said this is wrong; it \nis against God's law, and he devoted himself to the abolition of the \nEnglish slave trade. Time after time, again he was beaten in vote after \nvote, but he persevered. He overcame, and 20 years later his bill \npassed the Parliament. As a matter of law, the English slave trade was \nabolished. Some 20 years later--literally 3 days before William \nWilburforce died, news was brought to him on his deathbed that the \nParliament had abolished slavery, a full 2 or 3 decades before slavery \nwas abolished in the United States.\n  He also had as one of his great crusades not only the English slave \ntrade, but what he called ``The Reformation of Manners''--what we term \ntoday a moral and spiritual revitalization of the country. He did that \nfor England in that day and was exceptionally successful, particularly \nafter he wrote a book, which would be at the top of the New York Times \nbest seller list today, called ``A Practical View''--written by William \nWilburforce.\n  On this eve of Dr. King's birthday I wanted to reflect on these \ngiants--John Lewis, a contemporary among us, a lieutenant of Dr. King; \nCharlie Bolden, a contemporary today, a just retired Marine two-star \ngeneral, former astronaut; and William Wilburforce, one of the great \nleaders who single-handedly as a single member of Parliament--not in \nthe government--changed the course of history of the world by his \npersistence in establishing a law to abolish the English slave trade.\n  What do those three people have in common, John Lewis, Charlie \nBolden, and William Wilburforce? What they had in common was clearly \nthey were courageous, clearly they were persistent, and clearly they \nwere talented. But they also were ``overcomers''--to overcome the \nestablished order of the day, to make things different, and to make \nthings more right.\n  This is my testimony to Dr. King.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Florida for a \nmoving and insightful tribute to William Wilburforce, someone I never \nheard of before I came to the Senate. Now many of our colleagues have \ntalked about him in the same vein as the Senator from Florida has.\n  Picking up from the theme he has established, I would like to talk \nbriefly about the legacy of Martin Luther King. I was in Washington \nwhen the great march took place that led to Dr. Martin Luther King's \nmoving address ``I Have a Dream'' occurred.\n  One of the interesting things about that address from which I take \nsome comfort is Dr. King left his established transcript in the speech. \nHe started out sticking to the transcript, and as the speech built he \nbecame overcome with the spirit of what he was doing, and \nextemporaneously launched into the soaring phrases that he outlined of \n``I Have a Dream,'' and he described to America what he saw.\n  One of the interesting ironies of today's debate about civil rights \nis the dream Martin Luther King, Jr. saw in the eyes of many is being \nturned on its head. He saw a country where color would make no \ndifference, where it would make no difference in employment, where it \nwould make no difference in academic admission, where people would be \njudged on the basis of anything but their skin color. He had a dream \nthat that time would come.\n  I will not go into detail about the current fight that is going on \nwith respect to the University of Michigan, but I do wonder aloud how \nyou can square what has been going on at the University of Michigan \nwith Dr. King's dream. If at the time he had given that speech the \nUniversity of Michigan had a rating system for all of its applicants \nand said if you are white we will give you an automatic 20 points on \nour rating system, but we will deny those points to anyone who is \nHispanic, Asian, or African in heritage, I think Dr. King would have \nhad a few things to say about the inequities of that. I think clearly \nhe would have condemned that, and he should have condemned that.\n  Now some of those who claim to be his spiritual heirs are applauding \nthat when it is applied in reverse. I will leave that matter to the \ncourts. I will let that play itself out however it happens.\n  But I want to make this one further observation.\n  What does that tell us about Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.? That tells \nus he had parents who were married to each other, who were stable in \ntheir family, who loved him, and who raised him in a family \ncircumstance.\n  The African-American woman who has achieved perhaps the highest \ndegree of success in contemporary society is Condoleeza Rice. What do \nwe know about Condoleeza Rice and her rise in this struggle? We know \nthat she was born in Birmingham, AL where Dr. King wrote the letters \nfrom a Birmingham jail. We know at the time Birmingham, AL was regarded \nas the most heavily segregated city in the United States. We know that \nis where the riots were. That is where Dr. King was arrested. That is \nwhere he wrote his letters from that jail. That is where Condoleeza \nRice grew up.\n  We know this about Condoleeza Rice. She had parents who were married \nto each other, who loved each other, and who provided her with a home \nin which she learned.\n  One of the things she learned, as outlined in her biography, was \nbecause she\n\n[[Page S1132]]\n\nwas black and female she would have to be twice as good and work twice \nas hard in order to make it in the white world. Instead of protesting \nthat, instead of taking to the streets and complaining about that \ninequity, Condoleeza Rice determined she would indeed be twice as good \nand work twice as hard as any of her contemporaries.\n  The story is told that when she was at school at the college level, \none of her professors began to lay out the case that blacks are \ninherently inferior to whites. Condoleeza Rice as a young student spoke \nup and said, We are the ones who play Beethoven and speak French. What \nabout you? She is an accomplished concert pianist. She went on to a \nPh.D. and she became the youngest and first female provost at Stanford \nUniversity with an outstanding career as she worked twice as hard to be \ntwice as good as anybody else.\n  Some would argue that the most successful black African-American of \nour time is Secretary Colin Powell. I have read his biography. I find, \namong other things, that what he talks about, in his experience dealing \nwith segregation and discrimination in America and growing up following \nthe contributions of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr, is his family. He had \nparents who were married to each other and who provided him with a \nloving and nurturing home situation. He describes that in his \nbiography.\n\n  I suggest this because I think there is a clear thread here. Martin \nLuther King, Jr., came from a stable family. Condoleezza Rice came from \na stable family. Colin Powell came from a stable family. And in the \nsame period that Martin Luther King, Jr., was making his contribution, \na young staffer in the Johnson administration named Daniel Patrick \nMoynihan wrote prophetically of the breakup of Black families in \nAmerica and talked about what would happen to the African-American \ncommunity if the family cohesion that had been there before was somehow \nnot preserved.\n  The predictions and implications of former Senator Moynihan's work \nhave come true, tragically. Today, over two-thirds of the children born \nto African-American mothers are born outside of a formal marriage, \noutside of a stable family, outside of that one constant that provided \nthe launching pad for the careers of those who have been successful \namong us.\n  Of course, the lack of a family, the lack of loving parents who are \nmarried to each other and provide a nurturing circumstance--the \ndevastation of that lack knows no racial boundaries. White students, \nAsian students, Hispanic students--whoever it might be--who come out of \na circumstance where they do not have a stable family relationship are \nstatistically at far greater risk educationally, economically, \nsocially--every other way--than those who come from a family \nbackground.\n  So as we celebrate rightly Dr. Martin Luther King and his \ncontribution to this country, we should also recognize the importance \nof sustaining traditional family values in this country for everyone, \nregardless of race. And I would think that adding to Dr. Martin Luther \nKing's dream, we should have a dream of a time when no child is reared \nin a circumstance where there is not a loving support system.\n  Now, it need not always be blood relatives. Clarence Thomas, who sits \non the Supreme Court, has written movingly of his family, but his \nfamily was a family of Catholic nuns who gathered around him and \nprovided surrogate parenthood and gave him the kind of nurturing \nopportunity as a young man that he needed if he was going to succeed.\n  We should understand that there is no substitute in Government \nprograms for that kind of nurturing background. And we should look \naround us at the role models who have overcome discrimination and \nsegregation and achieved greatness and recognize that the common thread \nthroughout most of their lives is some kind of family background, \nfamily stability; nurturing, supporting activities when they were in \ntheir formative years.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/17/senate-section/article/S1132-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1132-S1134]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    MAKING FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003--\n                               Continued\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, to my colleagues who have known me and \nwho have heard me speak on spending issues before, what I am about to \nsay may be very shocking, and it shocks me as well. I am going to vote \nfor this appropriations bill. It contains only a 3-percent increase in \ntotal spending--can you believe that; that is mandatory and \nnondiscretionary domestic spending, a 3-percent increase--and a 2.4-\npercent increase in discretionary spending.\n  All of us should congratulate the President for sticking to his guns \nand keeping his promise that he was going to restrain spending while he \nwas President.\n  We also should thank Appropriations Chairman Ted Stevens and his \ncolleagues on the committee who have done a good job in putting this \npackage together. It is time for us to move on.\n  I would first like to comment on why we are here. Why are we here \ntoday? We would not be here today if we had passed a budget last year \nand had not wasted so much time debating bills on the floor of the \nSenate that should have been taken care of properly in committee.\n  Last year was the first time the Senate did not pass a budget \nresolution since the Budget Act of 1974. Think of that. For 29 years we \npassed a budget, but last year we were not able to muster up the votes \nto get a budget passed. In addition, we have spent so much time \ndebating bills on the floor of the Senate that should have been handled \nproperly in the committees where those bills originated. In so many \ninstances where the leader was unhappy with the results of the \ncommittee work, he yanked the bills out of committee, took it into his \noffice, rewrote the bill, put it on the floor, and we debated it. \nFor example, the energy bill, where we spent 8 weeks debating it, when \nit could have been taken care of in the Energy Committee. The energy \nbill, the farm bill, the economic stimulus bill, we spent so much time \nlast year dealing with things that should have been done in committee.\n\n  I am hoping the new leader gives more emphasis to the importance of \ncommittees in the Senate. I cannot understand why the previous majority \nparty's committee chairmen were not up in arms about so many bills that \nshould have been handled in their committees, but were pulled. We \nwasted a lot of time last year, and the chickens have now come home to \nroost. We have operated on a continuing resolution for 4 months--\nOctober, November, December, and January.\n  The executive branch is already one-third through the fiscal year, \nand the President wants us to finish our work. The American people want \nus to finish our work. There are so many Federal agencies today that \nare providing services not knowing what their budget is going to be for \nthis year. Starting this week, executive branch agencies must absorb a \n3.1-percent pay raise within fiscal year 2002 funding levels. I know \nwhat that is like. I know, as a former governor and mayor, the pressure \nthat puts on agencies. Many agencies will be unable to effectively \nallocate funds, particularly competitive grant funds, prior to the end \nof the fiscal year without a final appropriation in the next 20 to 30 \ndays.\n  In other words, consider the many agencies that have competitive \ngrant programs. These agencies will not be able to get their requests \nfor grant applications out this year, nor the grant applications back \nin unless we get things done in the next few days. Also thousands of \npeople, like my nephew, are out of work because companies they work for \nthat have government contracts don't know if the projects that are \nbeing funded by the Federal Government will continue. Government \nprograms have been on hold for the past 4 months and won't move forward \nuntil we pass an appropriations bill.\n  One of the things hurting our economy today is uncertainty. We have \ncontributed to it because we haven't been doing our work.\n  My constituents ask me: Do you guys in Washington get it? Do you get \nit? Do\n\n[[Page S1133]]\n\nyou understand what is going on? We are at war. The President of the \nUnited States has more on his plate than perhaps any President in my \nmemory. Some say FDR; some say Abraham Lincoln. The economy is \nsputtering. Our constituents believe we are behaving like Nero, \nfiddling around while Rome is burning. They continue to ask, don't you \nget it?\n  We have to understand that we cannot tolerate business as usual. In \nfact, business as usual looks pretty good compared to what we have been \ndoing the last year or so, and the way we have been behaving.\n  If corporate executives in the private sector took this much time to \nimplement their budgets, they would never bring any projects to market \nor create any new jobs and our economy would collapse.\n  Let's get appropriations done now. None of us are happy with \neverything in it, and everyone would like to add something, a pet \nproject, a pet constituent request. All of us have them. Hopefully, \nsome will be taken care of and smoothed out in conference. But if not, \nthey will have to be handled in the 2004 budget.\n  Remember we are in this pickle because we did not do our work last \nyear. Let's get it over so we can begin to do our work this year. Let's \nget on with the budget, so that we can have an aggressive effort to do \nthe 2004 appropriations bills and the other urgent business of the \nAmerican people.\n  God only knows what the budget environment will be if we go to war \nwith Iraq. As all of us in this body understand, even if we do not go \nto war, there are likely to be supplemental expenditures for whatever \nthe final settlement with Iraq will be.\n  Let's look at this proposal before us. This bill represents a \ncompromise between true fiscal discipline and Congress' desire to \nspend. It is made up of 11 bills. Passage of this bill will bring non-\ndefense discretionary spending up to $385 billion, an increase of 2.4-\npercent over the fiscal year 2002 level. It provides everything the \nPresident asked for except the $10 billion defense contingency \nfund. Although this low number is something to rejoice about, we had \nbetter understand that one of the reasons it is low is that we have had \na continuing resolution for the past 4 months and we have been spending \nmoney at FY 2002 levels.\n\n  Included in the package is a 1.6-percent across-the-board cut in all \ndomestic spending, in order to accommodate some high-priority items. \nLet's not forget about that. Some are talking about amending this bill. \nThe bill already contains an across-the-board reduction so we could \nprovide $3.1 billion for drought aid for farmers in counties that have \nbeen declared disasters. In my particular case, we have 88 counties in \nOhio that have been declared disasters. Mr. President, the bill \nincludes $1.5 billion for election reform; which is not as much as we \npromised the states when we passed the election reform legislation, but \nit is a substantial amount of money that will help the states. And the \nbill includes $1.6 billion for a Medicare physician's fee fix. All of \nus have heard from our physicians in terms of the Medicare situation \nthey are confronted with, when every year the amount of reimbursement \nis going down and down.\n  Inflation this year is only about 2.4 percent, nevertheless, all but \ntwo appropriations bills in this package are getting increases above \nthat rate.\n  The Labor-HHS appropriation has grown an average of 12.4 percent \nevery year since I have been here and will grow another 5.4 percent in \nthis bill. So this bill does not represent draconian restrictions on \nFederal spending.\n  In fact, the proposed $750 billion budget the President wants can \nfund critical priorities within the limits of fiscal discipline. That \n$750 billion represents an increase of over 11 percent in discretionary \nspending in just the last 2 fiscal years. I don't know anybody who has \nhad those kinds of increases. If you look at our spending during the \nlast 5 years, you see we have increased spending in most of the 13 \nannual appropriations bills by about 7.1 percent each year. That is \nabout a 43-percent increase in spending since I came to the Senate. \nDuring the same period of time we have had inflationary growth of only \nabout 11.4 percent.\n  The projected deficit for fiscal year 2002 was $314 billion, which \nincluded using Social Security, and the projected deficit for 2003 is \nalready $315 billion. Someone said at a meeting I attended yesterday \nthat it could go up to about $370 billion because we are going to have \nto borrow more money than what we originally expected.\n  We just increased the debt ceiling last June and will probably need \nto increase it again before the end of this year. Therefore, we need to \nendorse this fiscally responsible approach presented to us by the \nAppropriations Committee today. All these amendments proposed in the \nlast couple days would keep adding money and adding money to the \ndeficit. That is what it is about. I cannot understand it.\n  I hear arguments on the other side expressing concern about the \ndeficit, and these same people are on the floor trying to amend this \nappropriations bill. That would be fiscally irresponsible and would add \nto the deficit. The Appropriations Committee proposal is the lowest \nincrease in spending I have seen since I have been in the Senate.\n  As I said, I have to take my hat off to the President for holding the \nline on spending, and I take my hat off to my friend, Appropriations \nCommittee Chairman Ted Stevens. He and I have had some strong words \nover the last several years. But as Humphrey Bogart said in \n``Casablanca'': ``This could be the start of a beautiful friendship.''\n  I want the Appropriations chairman to know I look forward to working \nwith him and his colleagues on the committee on the 2004 budget and \nhope by the end of this year we can point to another set of \nappropriation bills with the same type of responsible and restrained \ngrowth.\n  Over the last 2 days, some people have come to the floor and said we \nneed more money for various good programs. As I mentioned before, these \nprograms are on hold until we pass an appropriations bill. In other \nwords, nothing is happening in some of these programs until we pass an \nappropriations bill.\n  I agree that there are many things we all want money for, but I want \nto point out to my colleagues what we have done during the past few \nyears in terms of the money we have put in the pipeline--I will repeat \nit so everybody gets it.\n  Since I have been in the Senate, we have increased discretionary \nspending by 10 percent in 1999, 15 percent in 2001, and 9 percent in \n2002. We have allocated so much additional money to Federal agencies \nthat many of them have had difficulty spending all of it. For example, \nthe Department of Housing and Urban Development has consistently \nrecaptured $1.5 billion to $2 billion in unallocated section 8 housing \nvouchers.\n  Mr. President, what we are doing here is fiscally responsible. Let's \nget it done. Let's get on with it. Let's finish the work of the 107th \nCongress so we can get on with the work of the 108th, starting with the \n2004 budget. And we need to move aggressively with the appropriations \nbills, so that we can get on with an energy bill, and do something \nabout some of the other pressing issues facing the American people.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for the \nMedicare provisions contained in H.J. Res. 2. These provisions would \nprevent unwise reductions in physician payments from taking effect by \nfreezing Medicare reimbursement rates for doctors at the 2002 level. \nThey would also provide much-needed, increased funding for rural \nhospitals.\n  Enacting these important provisions has been at the top of my agenda, \nand I am pleased that the committee was able to include them in the \nomnibus appropriations bill for fiscal year 2003. After extensive \nconversations with constituents throughout Utah, it became obvious to \nme that Congress must act to support Medicare providers and patients by \nensuring that payments are made more fair.\n  In 2002, physicians' Medicare reimbursements were reduced by \napproximately 5 percent. And, on March 1, 2003, Medicare reimbursement \nrates for physicians are scheduled to be reduced by another 4.4 \npercent. The provisions in H.J. Res. 2 that I strongly support will \nprotect physicians across the country by preventing the 4.4 percent cut \nin physician Medicare payment from going into effect in March.\n  It is apparent to me that Medicare constraints have made it more and \nmore difficult for hard-working physicians to provide the level of \npatient\n\n[[Page S1134]]\n\ncare that they and their patients expect. Physicians in Utah with whom \nI have consulted over the past year have showed me the lasting, \nnegative impact that the 2003 reductions would have on patient care. In \naddition, I have been dismayed to learn from several physicians that \nthese unwarranted reductions would cause them to think twice about \nremaining in the Medicare Program.\n  In fact, as representatives of the Utah Medical Association have \npointed out to me, Medicare's flawed reimbursement system has made it \nincreasingly difficult for Utah physicians to accept new Medicare \npatients, putting many seniors who seek care in a quandary. This is not \nfair to the physicians, and it is not fair to the patients.\n  While the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, CMS, reports that \nMedicare physician participation rate was 89.3 percent in January 2002, \nfigures from Utah portray a dramatically different picture. In a recent \nsurvey conducted by the Utah Medical Association, the Medicare \nparticipation rate among physicians was significantly lower. The UMA \nfound that only 77 percent of Utah's primary care physicians \nparticipated in the Medicare Program. I am hopeful that once Utah \nphysicians see that we in Congress are listening and serious about \nsupporting them, other doctors will consider participating in the \nMedicare Program once again.\n  I am also pleased that this legislation contains a provision which \nwill provide additional funding for rural hospitals, something that is \ndesperately needed in my home state of Utah. More specifically, the \nhospital provision contained in H.J. Res. 2 would raise the inpatient \nbase rate upon which payments are calculated for hospitals in rural and \nsmall urban areas to the same rate as that in large urban areas for 6 \nmonths. This provision will provide both patients and hospitals in my \nstate with necessary and welcomed relief.\n  Many of us who worked last year to enact needed changes such as this \nhave been dismayed that, despite our best efforts, Congress could not \nfind a collective way to rectify these problems that are doing so much \nto hurt patient care throughout Utah. It is high time we take this \naction.\n  I urge my colleagues to support these two important provisions \nbecause both will provide Medicare patients with access to quality and \naffordable health care across the country. Let's do the right thing and \npass this legislation as quickly as possible, this issue is much too \nimportant to both Medicare beneficiaries and providers. Medicare \nproviders, and most importantly, the beneficiaries they serve, are \ndepending on us to get the job done.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to have submitted an \namendment dealing with the Total Information Awareness Program at the \nDOD. Many of my colleagues may know about this program designed to test \ntechnologies that collect information from public and private databases \nand try to find trends that could signal threats against the United \nStates. Like many people, I have been concerned that this program could \nbe used to invade the privacy of Americans by snooping around in our \nbank accounts, personal internet computers, phone records, and the \nlike. In November of last year, I asked the DOD Inspector General to \nlook into the purposes of TIA and to make sure that there are \nappropriate controls in place to ensure that it is used only for \nforeign intelligence purposes to protect us against terrorism and \nforeign threats, but not on Americans or for domestic crime fighting. I \nam told that the IG investigation is proceeding, and that the IG has \nordered a formal audit of TIA.\n  This amendment limits the use of the TIA funds appropriated by \nCongress to foreign intelligence purposes. DOD will be required to tell \nCongress what it is doing regarding TIA, and keep us in the loop on \ndevelopments. It also provides that TIA can't be used on U.S. citizens \nonce it is up and running.\n  But the amendment allows development of TIA to continue for foreign \nterrorism purposes. So it is a great compromise in that it allows the \ndevelopment of TIA to help track international terrorism, but protects \nagainst abuses that could violate the privacy of our own people. I \nencourage my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, as an appropriator, I come to the \nfloor this afternoon to express my opposition to this omnibus \nappropriations bill.\n  The $385 billion omnibus appropriations bill cuts almost $10 billion \nfrom what the Senate Appropriation Committee approved last year.\n  On top of these Draconian cuts, the bill before us includes a 2.9 \npercent across the board cut, to nonmilitary programs, and will affect \ncritical programs such as homeland security, education, and job \ntraining.\n  This bill is a major mistake and represents a short-sided approach to \nsolving our Nation's problems.\n  What is happening is the administration's effort to starve domestic \nprograms in order to save dollars for a $674 billion tax cut. If this \neffort is successful, we will see interest rates rise, the deficit \nballoon, and a 10-year cumulative deficit of $2 to $3 trillion.\n  Americans don't know it yet, but soon will learn that this bill makes \na house of cards out of homeland security, which loses $1 billion which \nwere already requested, authorized, and appropriated.\n  How many Americans know that this bill will likely cut 1,175 FBI \nagents, 490 food safety engineers, and 1,600 customs inspectors who are \nvital if we are to protect our homeland from contraband and those that \nwould do us harm.\n  How many Americans know that the Head Start cut of $107 million could \nprevent 2700 youngsters from a Head Start experience, or leave 224,000 \nneedy individuals without the meals provided by WIC, or 230,000 \nveterans without medical services.\n  To make matters worse, this bill is being offered at a time when our \nNation continues to face significant challenges in protecting homeland \nsecurity, increasing school achievement, and strengthening our \nworkforce.\n  Essentially what this bill does is cut the money from a number of \ncritical projects so this body can pass a tax cut of $674 billion, \nwhich will lead to a $2 trillion deficit over the next 10 years.\n  Every day this body is faced with tough choices. But in my decade in \nthe Senate, I believe that this bill represents one of the worst pieces \nof legislation to pass this Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/17/senate-section/article/S1134-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1134-S1137]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MURDER OF AMERICANS IN INDONESIA\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, let us commend the chairman of the Foreign \nOperations Subcommittee for the strong report language on Indonesia. I \nparticularly appreciate the reference to the Americans murdered in \nPapua in August 2002, and the demands that justice be served for these \ncrimes. I share this sentiment completely and believe that inaction by \nIndonesia on these murders will result in a negative reaction by both \nthe congress and the Administration.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I appreciate my friend's comments, and believe he is \nright that the absence of a credible investigation into these murders \nwill have repercussions. While we all recognize that Indonesia \ncontinues on a difficult path of political and economic reform--at the \nsame time being a frontline state on the war on terrorism--the \nGovernment of Indonesia cannot and should not underestimate the \nseriousness of the crimes committed in Papua and the need to bring \njustice to the victims and their families.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I understand that the Federal Bureau of Investigations \nmay be in Indonesia in the very near future to assist in investigating \nthis crime. Does the chairman share my support for the FBI's \ninvolvement in this case?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Absolutely. The FBI should pursue all leads, and \ndetermine whether the reports of the Indonesian military's involvement \nin the ambush are accurate and credible.\n  For the benefit of my colleagues, let me take a moment to describe \nthe Indonesia provisions in the fiscal year 2003 bill. We earmark funds \nfor Indonesia, including $10 million for the fragile peace agreement in \nAceh and $5 million for reconstruction efforts in Bali. The bill does \nnot contain restrictions on the International Military Education and \nTraining program for that country but maintains the conditions on \nassistance under the Foreign Military Financing program. The fiscal \nyear 2003 request for IMET is $400,000,\n\n[[Page S1135]]\n\nwhich is slightly less than that requested for Sri Lanka.\n  Mr. ALLARD. The Foreign Operations bill strikes an appropriate \nbalance between our national security interests in that vast \narchipelago and the realities of a developing Indonesia. I want to be \non record that I will continue to closely follow the investigation into \nthe murder of Americans in Papua last year and I encourage the Chairman \nand all my colleagues to pay attention to that case.\n  I also recommend that the administration report to Congress on a \nregular and ongoing basis into the progress the Government of Indonesia \nis making into resolving these murders.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. My friend from Colorado's advice is excellent, and I \nhope that Secretary Powell will take note to the request for regular \nbriefings into the murder of American citizens in Indonesia.\n\n\n                             scaap funding\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise with a number of my colleagues \nand the chairman of the Commerce, Justice, State Subcommittee, the \nSenator from South Carolina, to discuss funding for the State Criminal \nAlien Assistance Program, popularly know as SCAAP. As my colleagues \nknow, States and localities across the Nation are facing extraordinary \ncosts associated with incarcerating criminal illegal aliens.\n  Since the September 11th terrorists attacks, State and local \ngovernments have borne unprecedented costs that the Nation's critical \ninfrastructure and public are protected. As a result, State and local \ngovernments are facing tremendous budget deficits. Moreover, the \nbudgets of local law enforcement agencies are stretched to the limit. \nCalifornia, for one, is estimated to face a shortfall of at least $26 \nbillion over the next 18 months.\n  In the face of these new challenges, the burden placed on States by \nthe Federal Government's long-standing inability to control illegal \nimmigration continues to grow. States like California continue to \nshoulder extraordinary criminal alien incarceration costs. One out of \nevery seven prison beds in California is occupied by an illegal \ncriminal alien.\n  SCAAP funding helps all States that are experiencing increasing costs \nfrom incarcerating undocumented felons--both low-impact and high-impact \nStates. Last year, more than 400 local jurisdictions, including all 50 \nStates, received SCAAP funding. With States facing budget deficits \nreimbursement for the costs they have incurred will be even more \nimportant. Congress must continue to support communities that must \nshoulder the burden of what is, in essence, a Federal responsibility. \nGiven the rising costs associated with criminal alien incarceration, I \nhad hoped that the Senate would see fit to increase the funding for \nthis important program to $650 million, or at minimum, at last year's \nlevel of $565 million.\n  I understand that the House-passed Commerce, Justice, State \nappropriations bill provides $500 million for the SCAAP program. Given \nthat fact, I would like to inquire of my friend from New Hampshire if \nthere is something that can be done to increase funding for this bill \nfor SCAAP to at least the funding level approved by the House.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wish to associate myself with the remarks \nof my good friend, the Senator from California, and also look forward \nto working with the chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee to \nresolve the funding disparity in the State Criminal Alien Assistance \nProgram (SCAAP).\n  Before I begin my comments about this important program and the level \nof funding in the Senate Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations bill, I \nwant to state my full support for what I have been told will be a $500 \nmillion funding level for SCAAP in the House fiscal year 2003 bill.\n  Through the Crime Control Act of 1994, the Congress created SCAAP to \nreimburse States and localities for the costs they incur incarcerating \ncriminal illegal aliens. Such costs, it has been made clear, are the \nresponsibility of the Federal Government. Previously, SCAAP was \nauthorized at $650 million, although total expenditures of the States \nand localities exceeds $1.6 billion per year. Last year, the Congress \nreauthorized the program for the next 2 fiscal years at an open-ended \nlevel.\n  Though the financial burden to process and incarcerate criminal \nillegal aliens overwhelms the budgets of many States and localities, \nSCAAP has never even been allocated to its full authorization. Over the \npast 5 years, SCAAP has usually been funded at levels between $500 \nmillion and $600 million, which has provided States and localities \nreimbursement of about 30 cents for each dollar spent on incarceration.\n  The Congress would be doing the right thing if it allocated $1.6 \nbillion. In fiscal year 2002, the State of Arizona and its localities \nincurred costs of well over $305 million to incarcerate criminal \nillegal aliens, and received $24 million in Federal reimbursement--when \nSCAAP was funded at $565 million overall.\n  To reduce the total 2003 SCAAP funding from its $565 million to zero \nis unacceptable. Should the funding be eliminated, all 50 States, D.C. \nand the increasing number of localities that incur costs, which now \nreceive an unacceptable 30 cents for each dollar spent, will receive \nnothing, if Congress were to eliminate funding altogether.\n  Mr. President, I very much hope that Senators Gregg, Hollings, \nFeinstein, Schumer, and I can work to resolve these issues before this \nbill is signed into law.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues from \nCalifornia and Arizona to ask for support for the State Criminal Alien \nAssistance Program (SCAAP) and to ask that it be funded, at the very \nleast, at last year's level of $565 million in fiscal year 2003 in the \nCommerce, Justice, State Appropriations Report. Before I continue, I \nwant to thank my colleagues for their hard work and dedication to the \nupkeep of this program.\n  SCAAP reimburses States and counties for the costs associated with \nthe incarceration of undocumented criminal aliens. Unfortunately, \nFederal efforts are often not adequate to combat illegal immigration. \nBy some estimates, the total annual cost to States and local \ngovernments exceeds $1.6 billion. The broad principle on which the \nSCAAP Program is based is simple: the control of illegal immigration is \na Federal responsibility. When the Federal Government falls short in \nits efforts to control illegal immigration, it must bear the \nresponsibility for the financial and human consequences of this \nfailure. Thus, the ``State Criminal Alien Assistance \nProgram Reauthorization Act'' would properly vest the Federal \nGovernment the fiscal burden of incarcerating illegal immigrants who \ncommit crimes in our communities.\n\n  Southwestern States are not the only ones shouldering the \nextraordinary financial burdens of this type of incarceration. Northern \nborder and interior States are increasingly bearing these costs, too. \nSCAAP funding has been on the rise even in historically low immigration \nStates and counties. It is important to note that SCAAP receives \nwidespread bipartisan and bicameral support. I encourage my colleagues \non the Commerce, Justice, and State Subcommittee to support this very \nimportant program to help alleviate the impact of these unfunded \nFederal mandates on State, and in particular, county governments.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I thank my friends from California, \nArizona, and New York for their efforts in relieving the burden of \nillegal immigration on our State and local governments. I know that \nthey have been tireless in their efforts to secure both an end to \nillegal immigration and to ensure that the Federal Government assume a \nshare of the financial responsibility for its inability to control \nillegal immigration.\n  I know, as well, Mr. President, that my colleagues from California \nand Arizona were among the principal authors of the SCAAP Program when \nit was created by the 1994 crime bill, and that they both worked very \nhard to help secure the $565 million which was appropriated last year. \nThey have also worked to ensure that the program remains authorized \nover the next 2 fiscal years.\n  Knowing of the great need for adequate funding for SCAAP, I assure \nthe Senators that I will make it a high priority during the conference \nbetween the House and Senate.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I concur with my colleague from New Hampshire. I \nunderstand the importance of this funding for the States affected by \nthe high\n\n[[Page S1136]]\n\nrates of criminal alien incarceration and I am hopeful we can provide \nan adequate funding level for SCAAP during conference.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator for his encouraging words. As I \nam sure he knows, the SCAAP reimbursements provided in prior years did \nnot nearly cover the costs States and localities incurred do \nincarcerate illegal aliens in their jurisdictions.\n  The cost for States and localities amounted to more than $11 billion. \nThus, last year's funding level of $565 million covered a mere 5.1 \npercent, of the actual costs.\n  Failing to fund the program altogether would be devastating to our \nStates. The State of Wisconsin, for example, would lose more than $3.5 \nmillion in funding; Massachusetts would lose over $13 million; \nPennsylvania would lose over $2.6 million; Virginia would lose more \nthan $6.4 million; North Carolina would lose $5.2 million; Michigan \nwould lose $2.9 million; Minnesota would lose $1.8 million. Thus, even \nStates that have not traditionally had to confront the growth in \nillegal immigration are now bearing the costs of this Federal \nresponsibility.\n  When the Federal Government fails in its responsibility to control \nour Nation's borders, local taxpayers should not have to foot the bill \nfor incarcerating undocumented criminal aliens in State and local \njails. I will work closely with the Senators from New Hampshire and \nSouth Carolina and my colleagues in both bodies ensure that this bill \nadequately funds SCAAP.\n\n\n                  PROSTHETIC AND SENSORY AIDS DEVICES\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I have come to the floor today to \ncompliment the Chairman of the VA-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee \nSenator Bond and the Ranking Member Senator Mikulski on an excellent \njob of balancing all the very important programs in the VA-HUD \nAppropriations bill, included as part of the omnibus bill now pending \nbefore the body. I know the spending limitations imposed on the \nSubcommittee do not permit the chairman and other members of the \nSubcommittee to address each and every issue as fully as they would \nlike to but nonetheless the chairman has achieved a balanced and good \nresult.\n  Earlier this year, I contacted the subcommittee to express the view \nthat the Veterans Health Administration be as proactive as possible to \nhelp ensure that disabled veterans have the most advanced prosthetic \nand sensory aids devices made available to them, as would be medically \nappropriate. In this regard, I was pleased to see that the committee \napproved the administration's fiscal year 2003 budget request for \n$739.1 million for prosthetic and sensory aids devices providing an \nincrease of $60.3 million over the last year.\n  One of the exciting new prosthetic and sensory aids devices known as \nthe iBOT was invented in my home State of New Hampshire. It is a \nmobility device that climbs stairs, traverses all terrain and balances \nthe seated user at standing eye-level. It would be my view that some \nportion, at least one percent, of the approximately 25,000 veterans \nwith service connected spinal cord injuries should have access to this \nadvanced mobility device. In fact, at the request of Congress, the VHA \nconducted a study of this mobility device last year that concluded with \nthe finding that ``the subjects were unanimous in their recommendations \nthat the Veterans Health Administration should provide iBOTs to \nveterans''--and that--``the iBOT could improve integration and work \nperformance.'' Additionally, as Secretary Principi has established a \npriority of ``restoring the capability of disabled veterans to the \nextent possible'' it is my expectation that such devices will be \nactively considered and provided to disabled veterans as medically \nappropriate.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I want to add my praise for the job done by \nSenators Bond and Mikulski and associate myself with the comments just \nmade by Senator Gregg. I am also familiar with the mobility device \nwhich Senator Gregg mentioned. I also believe that some of the veterans \nwith service connected spinal cord injuries could benefit from, and \nshould be assisted by, making these devices available to them. \nTherefore, it is also my expectation that the Department will \naggressively pursue, within available funds and current policy, making \nthis mobility device and other state of the art assistive technologies \navailable to disabled veterans as medically appropriate.\n\n\n                      RUM COVER-OVER TAX PROVISION\n\n  Mr. Grassley. It has recently been brought to my attention that there \nhas been a controversy over a Puerto Rican excise tax on beer. \nUnfortunately, the Omnibus Appropriations bill is an inappropriate \nforum to address this issue. But we realize the importance of ongoing \nnegotiation.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I cosponsored your amendment because I \nagree that inclusion of a tax provision in this bill is inappropriate. \nIn 1983, under the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act, the excise \ntax collections on imported rum are transferred or rebated to the \ntreasuries of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. The tax code provides \na rebate of $13.25 of the $13.50 excise tax to Puerto Rico and the \nVirgin Islands for the excise tax collected on rum imported into the \nUnited States (without regard to the country of origin). The amount of \nthe rebate is scheduled to decrease to the 1983 level of $10.50 after \nDecember 31st, unless Congress extends the current $13.25 rebate.\n  Perhaps the expiration of the increased amount transferred provides \ntime for resolution of the dispute?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I commit to working together with those concerned to \naddress this issue through the Finance Committee, which is the \nappropriate jurisdiction for resolution of this matter.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I thank the Senator for his time and efforts to work on \nthis issue with us. This issue is a horribly excessive tax that needs \nto be discussed immediately, which was my motivation towards working \nwith Senator Stevens in addressing this issue in the appropriations \nbill. I agree with Senators Grassley and Baucus that resolving this \nissue prior to the end of this year is very important. As such. I \naccept the amendment offered by Senators Grassley and Baucus which \nstrikes this provision from the Omnibus Appropriations bill, Title I, \nSection 128.\n  We want to encourage all parties involved to immediately come to the \ntable to begin working together to solve this issue. As I have \npreviously stated, this excise tax on beer hurts producers, farmers, \nand working people, and has to be resolved.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I look forward to working with the Senator and his \nstaff on this issue.\n\n\n                            CIVIL EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. One area in the Foreign Operations portion of this \nomnibus bill where I have had particular interest is the section \nentitled Democracy Programs. We have worked closely in our approach to \nthis section where we have addressed the funding needs for democracy \nprograms, including in predominantly Muslim countries.\n  The bill we are considering today will increase funding in Section \n524(b) of the Foreign Operations portion from $15,000,000 to \n$20,000,000 and correspondingly adds ``civic education'' as a program \nand activity under this section that the subcommittee wishes to fund.\n  Does the Ranking Member agree with me that this increase of \n$5,000,000 is intended to ensure that democracy programs, including \ncivic education programs, receive additional funding?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I agree with my friend from Kentucky, the chairman of the \nForeign Operations Subcommittee. The additional $5,000,000 in section \n524(b) will ensure that these programs are expanded, including through \nthe establishment of civic education programs in countries with a \nsignificant Muslim population, and where such programs and activities \nwould be important to United States efforts to respond to, deter, or \nprevent acts of international terrorism.\n  Is it the understanding of my friend from Kentucky that funds made \navailable under Section 524(b) for civic education are intended to be \nawarded as a grant or grants to--among other eligible applicants--\neducational organizations with experience working in other countries, \nincluding organizations in the fields of democracy education, civic \neducation, community service, global education and learning through \ninteractive Internet-based technologies and experience in the field of \ncivic and international elementary and secondary education?\n\n[[Page S1137]]\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The Senator from Vermont is correct, and I thank him \nfor this useful exchange.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all first-\ndegree amendments to H.J.

Mr. President, Peter Arapis, Jr. was born in Nevada at the \nLas Vegas Hospital Clinic on 8th Street. His father, Peter Arapis, Sr., \nwas born in Greece and was heavily involved in the Las Vegas Greek \ncommunity throughout his life. Peter Arapis, Sr. was the Head Chef at \nthe Nevada Test Site for many years beginning in the early 1950s. Peter \nArapis, Sr. was active in the election of Michael O'Callaghan as the \nGovernor of Nevada in 1970. He always helped me whenever I ran for \npublic office.\n  It was probably due to his father's involvement in politics that \nPeter Arapis, Jr. was quickly drawn in as well. As a student at Rancho \nHigh School, Peter volunteered to walk the neighborhoods, hanging \ncampaign information on doors. All Peter's hard work paid off because \nO'Callaghan was elected as Governor, and I was elected as Lieutenant \nGovernor. Little did I know that Peter would one day become an \ninvaluable member of my senior staff and a trusted friend.\n  After graduating from Rancho High School in Las Vegas, NV, Peter \nworked as a car valet for a few years before attending college at UNLV. \nIn 1985, he received a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science. This same \nyear, Peter was the recipient of the L.B.J. Scholarship which afforded \nhim the opportunity to come and work in my office in the House of \nRepresentatives as a congressional fellow. This is when Peter got his \nfirst taste of politics on Capitol Hill.\n  Thereafter, Peter returned to Las Vegas and worked as part of my \ncampaign staff the first time I ran for the U.S. Senate. In 1986, I was \nfortunate to be elected to serve my first term in the Senate, and from \nthat date until now, Peter has been an indispensable part of my team.\n  One of Peter's first lessons in Nevada politics came shortly after my \nfirst Senatorial campaign. He was hiking in Nevada, east of Ely in \nWhite Pine County, and planning to camp up on top of Mt. Moriah. Mt. \nMoriah had a wilderness area at the top whose preservation had been an \nissue during the campaign. While hiking, Peter was confronted by \nranchers who were trying to keep people off the mountain. They made it \nquite clear to him that no one was welcome on the mountain. Unbeknown \nto Peter, the ranchers were the very same ranchers that had been \nextremely cooperative with respect to the wilderness issue during the \ncampaign. Reason being, the ranchers were mountain lion hunting guides, \nand they had surrounded the entire mountain. The only way to get to the \nroads to gain access to the wilderness area up on top was to cross over \ntheir private property. By surrounding the mountain they had in essence \nturned the wilderness area into their own private property to help \ntheir guide service flourish. Peter later made the connection.\n  After working on the 1986 election, Peter earned a master's degree in \nPolitical Science from UNLV in 1987 where he also served as a teaching \nassistant.\n  Over the years, Peter has held nearly every position in my office. He \nworked for 4 years, 1987 to 1991, in my Las Vegas office as a state \nrepresentative. In 1992, he decided that he wanted to return to \nWashington, DC, and he came to work as a Legislative Assistant \nresponsible for Appropriations for Energy and Water, Interior and \nRelated Agencies, Commerce-Justice-State, and Military Construction. \nShortly thereafter, he served as a Deputy Legislative Director.\n  Peter returned to Nevada to work as a deputy campaign manager in my \n1998 Senate race. He was a vital part of my team in a very close re-\nelection. Realizing that he had caught the ``Potomac Fever,'' and \nhaving met Lynn Breaux at her restaurant, the famous Tunni Cliffs \nTavern, Peter once again returned to Washington, DC.\n  From 1999 to today, Peter has diligently worked for me as my floor \nmanager and senior policy adviser, aiding me daily in my capacity as \nDemocratic whip. I am thankful to have had such a loyal and dedicated \nemployee, but more importantly, I am thankful that I can call him my \nfriend.\n  I say to Peter: Good luck, I will miss you, but always remember you \nare a Nevadan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/17/senate-section/article/S1137-3", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1137]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. In the last Congress Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred October 6, \n2001 in Topeka, KS. A 21 year-old man from Bangladesh was attacked in a \nconvenience store. Police say that the victim entered the store when \nthree men began asking him questions about his national origin and \nreligion. One of the men used a racial slur and then started punching \nthe victim. The victim was treated at a local hospital for injuries \nsustained during the attack.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/17/senate-section/article/S1137-4", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1137-S1138]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 A REPORT CARD ON STATE GUN SAFETY LAWS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this week the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun \nViolence, in partnership with the Million Mom March and State gun \nsafety groups, released its 6th Annual Report Card on State Gun Laws \nProtecting Children. According to the report, the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention data showed a welcome decrease in the number of \nchildren killed by guns. However, children continue to be at great risk \nfrom gun violence.\n  The Brady Campaign State Report Cards evaluate each State on several \ncriteria: Does the State have juvenile possession laws or juvenile sale \nand transfer laws? Does the State have child access prevention laws? \nDoes the State have gun safety lock and safer design standards? Does \nthe State allow cities to regulate guns? Does the State provide \nsecondary private sales background checks? Does the State have carrying \nconcealed weapons laws? In addition to these criteria, States can also \nreceive extra credit and/or demerits for a variety of gun safety \nmeasures such as permits for handguns.\n  This year, according to the Brady Campaign, 11 States were awarded \nSensible Safety Stars. These States resisted efforts to weaken gun \nsafety laws and/or enacted gun safety laws that protect children from \nguns. I am disappointed to report that my home State of Michigan was \nnot among them.\n  According to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms and the \nBrady Campaign, seven states, all of whom received poor grades, were \nmajor sources of crime guns. Further, the ATF found that gun \ntraffickers seek out States that allow criminals to purchase firearms \nwithout background checks at gun shows.\n  The Congress has the ability to pass legislation that will further \nreduce\n\n[[Page S1138]]\n\nchild firearm deaths and automatically improve the grade of many \nStates. I urge my colleagues to take up and pass commonsense gun safety \nlegislation that will close the gun show loophole and improve child gun \naccess prevention laws so that we might prevent kids from gaining \naccess to guns, and improve the quality and safety of our communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/17/senate-section/article/S1138-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1138-S1139]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        PROMOTING DIVERSITY IN INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing letter to the President, regarding his Administration's \ndecision to file a brief opposing the University of Michigan's use of \naffirmative action, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                   U.S. Senate\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 17, 2003.\n     Hon. George W. Bush,\n     President of the United States,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: On Wednesday, as your Administration \n     prepared to file its Supreme Court brief opposing the \n     University of Michigan's use of affirmative action to achieve \n     diversity in its student body, you reiterated your commitment \n     to increasing the number of minorities on college campuses. I \n     applaud this commitment, but do not believe that replacing \n     traditional affirmative action with ``race neutral'' percent \n     plans will fully accomplish our shared goal of promoting \n     diversity throughout our institutions of higher education. I \n     am especially concerned that such plans necessarily depend on \n     racial segregation in high schools and, further, that a Court \n     decision banning traditional affirmative action could trigger \n     a domino effect undermining our nation's anti-discrimination \n     laws.\n       The Michigan cases are among the most important ever to \n     confront the Court since Brown v. Board of Education. Over \n     the past several decades, the story of American higher \n     education has been a story of gradually expanding opportunity \n     for historically excluded or marginalized groups. Anti-\n     discrimination laws and financial aid policies have opened \n     the doors of higher education for millions of minority \n     students. But as you said on Wednesday, ``We should not be \n     satisfied with the current numbers of minorities on Americans \n     college campuses. Much progress has been made; much more is \n     needed.''\n       At the very top schools in this country, including \n     Michigan, significant racial diversity is largely \n     attributable to affirmative action. By traditional \n     affirmative action, I do not mean quotas, and neither does \n     the University of Michigan. I mean the use of race as one of \n     many factors--along with geography, socioeconomic status, and \n     other life-shaping attributes or experiences--to achieve an \n     educationally diverse student body. Michigan's affirmative \n     action policies work this way, and for 25 years such policies \n     have been constitutional, just as they are today.\n       If our best colleges, law schools, and medical schools were \n     to end traditional affirmative action today, without adopting \n     any alternative, minority enrollments would drop by two-\n     thirds or more. So a critical question, as you suggested, is \n     whether there are alternatives to traditional affirmative \n     action that might do as good a job--or better--at keeping the \n     doors of selective institutions open to qualified minority \n     students.\n       You applauded the innovation of states that have adopted \n     ``percent plans'' guaranteeing college admission to top high \n     school graduates. I agree with you that after five years, the \n     Texas ``10 percent plan,'' where all students who graduate in \n     the top 10 percent of their high school class are guaranteed \n     admission to a state university of their choosing, has shown \n     some impressive results. After an initial drop in 1997, \n     minority enrollment at UT-Austin, one of the state's flagship \n     schools, has rebounded almost to the levels achieved under \n     traditional affirmative action.\n       In addition, UT-Austin is now drawing students from a \n     larger number of high schools and from a wider geographic \n     area, a change that benefits white as well as minority \n     students. The entering class of 2000 included students from \n     135 schools that had not been represented there before 1996. \n     Those schools included predominantly minority, inner-city \n     schools as well as predominantly white, rural schools. And, \n     despite worries that 10-percenters from poor high schools \n     might not be prepared for the academic rigor of UT-Austin, \n     the most recent evidence is that 10-percenters of all races \n     are performing as well as other students who scored 200 or \n     300 points better on the SAT. Retention is generally higher \n     among 10-percenters than among other students.\n       Notably, these results have occurred despite the fact that \n     average SAT scores--the often cited measure of merit among \n     opponents of traditional affirmative action--have decreased, \n     not increased, among 10-percenters and among black and \n     Hispanic students at UT-Austin. Like traditional affirmative \n     action, the 10 percent plan admits qualified students with \n     lower test scores over students with higher scores, \n     recognizing that test scores are not the ``be all and end \n     all'' of an applicant's merit, potential, or character.\n       The early evidence is very encouraging, and I am cautiously \n     optimistic that for some schools, racial diversity can be \n     achieved through alternatives like this one. Even so, I think \n     it would be a mistake to shut the door on traditional \n     affirmative action and treat percent plans as a panacea for \n     increasing minority enrollments. While they hold promise, \n     they also come with pitfalls.\n       As I am sure you are aware, Texas's other flagship \n     institution, Texas A Station, continues to struggle \n     with raising black and Hispanic enrollments, even under the \n     10 percent plan. California's 4 percent plan and Florida's 20 \n     percent plan, though similar in concept, differ from the \n     Texas plan in one crucial respect: They do not guarantee top \n     graduates admission to a state university of their choosing. \n     As a result, minority enrollment in California has increased \n     at less selective schools like UC-Irvine and UC-Riverside, \n     but not at the most selective schools. Between 1997 and 2001, \n     the number of black freshmen dropped from 252 to 138 at UC-\n     Berkeley and from 204 to 125 at UCLA. Florida's 20 percent \n     plan, after its first year, has kept minority enrollment in \n     the state system steady. But the flagship school, the \n     University of Florida, saw a 40 percent drop in black \n     enrollment and a 7.5 percent drop in Hispanic enrollment.\n       My primary concern, however, is that the very success of \n     percent plans in enrolling substantial numbers of minority \n     students is entirely dependent on racial segregation at the \n     high school level.\n       For the past 30 years, the Supreme Court has turned its \n     back on remedying inequality in elementary and secondary \n     schools based on race or income, even going so far as to say \n     that ``at least where wealth is involved, the Equal \n     Protection Clause does not require absolute equality or \n     precisely equal advantages.'' As a result, 50 years after \n     Brown, racial segregation is increasing in our public \n     schools. Seventy percent of black students now attend \n     predominantly minority schools, up from 63 percent in 1980. \n     Forty-six percent of Hispanic students in Texas, 42 percent \n     in California, and 59 percent in New York go to schools that \n     are 90 to 100 percent minority. And racially segregated \n     schools, except predominantly white schools, are almost \n     always schools with high poverty. The average black or \n     Hispanic student goes to school with more than twice as many \n     poor classmates as the average white student.\n       Any policy of college access that is in tension with \n     efforts to integrate public schools cannot be the best \n     option. Instead of motivating improvement in poor and \n     segregated high schools, percent plans give minority parents \n     an incentive to keep their children in those schools, instead \n     of transferring them to integrated and more academically \n     competitive schools. And no parent should have to make a \n     trade-off between college access and high school quality.\n       In fact, the Texas 10 percent plan exposes the depth of \n     inequality that can exist in a single state. Texas has 1,500 \n     high schools. In the year 2000, nearly half the 7,600 \n     freshman at UT-Austin came from 74 high schools, around 50 \n     students per school. The other half came from 718 high \n     schools, roughly 5 students per school. Approximately 700 \n     high schools sent no student to UT-Austin in 2000.\n       Just as traditional affirmative action should never \n     distract us from the task of strengthening our elementary and \n     secondary schools, neither should percent plans. If we are \n     serious about expanding minority access to higher education, \n     then we should not only take a closer look at traditional \n     affirmative action and its alternatives; we should also fully \n     fund Title I and increase the maximum Pell Grant. The 10 \n     percent plan will never reach students in the poorest schools \n     unless we commit the resources to turn those schools around \n     and make college more affordable. These are commitments we \n     should already be making to help the 90 percent of students \n     not covered by the 10 percent plan.\n       Moreover, although percent plans have been somewhat \n     successful in sustaining minority enrollments at the \n     undergraduate level, none of them has proven effective at \n     graduate or professional schools. In 1995, for example, \n     before traditional affirmative action was eliminated at the \n     University of Texas Law School, 7.4 percent of first-year \n     students were black and 12.5 percent were Mexican-American. \n     But today, only 4 percent are black and 8 percent are \n     Mexican-American. Similarly, at UC-Berkeley's law school, \n     Boalt Hall, there were 14 blacks and 17 Hispanics in the 2001 \n     entering class, down from 20 blacks and 28 Hispanics in 1996. \n     At UCLA Law School, the 10 blacks and 26 Hispanics in the \n     2001 entering class were substantially fewer than the 19 \n     blacks and 45 Hispanics in 1996.\n       Between 1997 and 2001, the number of blacks fell from 10 to \n     6 at UCLA Medical School and from 12 to 7 at UC-San Francisco \n     Medical School. In the MBA program at UC-Berkeley, there were \n     3 blacks and 5 Hispanics in the 2001 entering class, down \n     from 11 blacks and 15 Hispanics in 1996. And at UCLA, there \n     were 9 blacks and 13 Hispanics in the 2001 first-year MBA \n     class, compared to 13 blacks and 18 Hispanics in 1996.\n       The fact is, at the graduate level, there are few options \n     for sustaining minority enrollments besides traditional \n     affirmative action. Percent plans will not achieve graduate \n     student diversity unless the undergraduate institutions they \n     draw from are segregated.\n\n[[Page S1139]]\n\n     And preferences for socioeconomic disadvantage will not help \n     very much. Although minorities are more likely than whites to \n     come from low-income backgrounds, the vast majority of low-\n     income people are still white.\n       Finally, there is little if any evidence that percent plans \n     provide an effective substitute for traditional affirmative \n     action at our leading private institutions. Under Title VI of \n     the Civil Rights Act, virtually every private institution in \n     the country is subject to the same legal standards regarding \n     traditional affirmative action as public institutions. Any \n     Supreme Court decision finding traditional affirmative action \n     unconstitutional at public universities would likely end \n     affirmative action at private universities as well--with very \n     troubling results.\n       It is one thing for Florida to guarantee top 20 percenters \n     admission to one of the state's 11 public universities, or \n     for the University of California to guarantee top 4 \n     percenters admission to one of 10 campuses. But what about \n     schools like Harvard or Stanford or Columbia? Given how small \n     and selective these schools are, even a plan guaranteeing \n     admission to the top half of one percent of high school \n     graduates would not work, nor would it necessarily make good \n     sense.\n       While some may think it odd to worry about racial diversity \n     at private schools, since our public university systems serve \n     far more students, these schools have long been regarded by \n     the American public--indeed, the world--as the very best of \n     what higher education can offer. And those schools generate a \n     disproportionate number of our nation's leaders in \n     government, business, and academia. As Justice Lewis Powell \n     said 25 years ago in the Bakke case, which featured Harvard's \n     affirmative action policy as the gold standard for selective \n     admissions: ``It is not too much to say that the Nation's \n     future depends upon leaders trained through wide exposure to \n     the ideas and mores of students as diverse as this Nation of \n     many peoples.''\n       The bottom line, then, is that although percent plans and \n     other approaches may hold promise for some institutions, they \n     are not effective substitutes for traditional affirmative \n     action at all institutions. There is no ``one-size-fits-all'' \n     alternative to traditional affirmative action that works at \n     every school, in every system, in every state. I agree with \n     you, Mr. President, that we need to take a closer look at \n     ways to achieve diversity besides traditional affirmative \n     action. But I do not agree that we should foreclose \n     traditional affirmative action as an option for pursuing \n     diversity where the alternatives do not work.\n       Finally, let me mention two additional concerns. First, no \n     one doubts that the percent plans in Texas, Florida, and \n     California were designed to achieve exactly what traditional \n     affirmative action was designed to achieve, namely, increased \n     opportunity for qualified minority students. And the \n     barometer of success has been whether these plans are keeping \n     minority enrollments at levels achieved under traditional \n     affirmative action. Where percent plans have been judged \n     successful-at UT-Austin, for example-they have lowered, not \n     raised, average SAT scores among former beneficiaries of \n     traditional affirmative action. The fact is that percent \n     plans, in their motivation, design, and effect, look a lot \n     like traditional affirmative action. If the Court agrees with \n     your Administration that traditional affirmative action is \n     unconstitutional, aren't percent plans simply the next shoe \n     to drop? If we accept the constitutionality, and sometimes \n     the wisdom, of percent plans, then logic and law dictate that \n     we also accept the constitutionality and wisdom of \n     affirmative action\n       This is especially true for public universities like \n     Michigan that strive to serve a student body representative \n     of the taxpayers who support the system. As you said \n     yesterday, ``America is a diverse country, racially, \n     economically, and ethnically. And our institutions of higher \n     education should reflect our diversity.'' I see nothing wrong \n     with a public university doing directly what Texas, \n     California, and Florida have been forced to do indirectly, \n     indeed what we have applauded them for doing.\n       Second, I am very concerned about the unintended \n     consequences of making a constitutional distinction between \n     percent plans and traditional affirmative action. If \n     admissions policies must be scrubbed clean of race, then \n     shouldn't they also be scrubbed clean of gender? Women have \n     made great strides in higher education, but they continue to \n     lag behind men in areas like engineering and computer \n     science. In fact, women are awarded 25 percent of doctoral \n     degrees in math and the physical sciences, and only 15 \n     percent of doctorates in engineering. Percent plans cannot \n     solve these problems of gender inequality, just as they \n     cannot solve every problem of racial inequality. But percent \n     plans teach us what supporters of traditional affirmative \n     action have long known: that there are considerations \n     important to the distribution of educational opportunity in \n     America other than a standardized test score.\n       Traditional affirmative action, whether based on race or \n     gender, stands or falls on similar logic. And if traditional \n     affirmative action falls, I worry it is only a small step to \n     rolling back our most basic antidiscrimination laws, like \n     Title VII and Title IX. Given unconscious stereotypes and \n     structural inequalities that persist in our society, there is \n     a very fine line between taking deliberate steps to ensure \n     access to higher education for minorities and women, and \n     protecting them from unlawful discrimination.\n       Mr. President, I urge you to carefully consider the \n     implications of eliminating traditional affirmative action in \n     the absence of alternatives that effectively promote, and do \n     not work against, diversity and integration in all of our \n     public high schools, colleges, and graduate programs. And I \n     urge you to consider the consequences your Administration's \n     position may have for the vigorous enforcement of our \n     nation's anti-discrimination laws.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Hillary Rodham Clinton.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/17/senate-section/article/S1139-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1139-S1140]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        21st CENTURY NANOTECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the 21st Century \nNanotechnology Research & Development Act. I want to thank my colleague \nfrom Oregon, Senator Wyden, for his leadership on this important issue. \nI have enjoyed working with Senator Wyden on nanotechnology for the \npast several years. I would also like to thank the other cosponsors on \nthis legislation, the Senior Senator from Virginia--Mr. Warner, \nSenators Lieberman, Mikulski, Hollings, Landrieu, Clinton, Levin, and \nBayh.\n  Today, our scientists and visionaries are quickly learning that there \nis a whole New Frontier of promise and human endeavor literally right \nunder our eyes, at the nanoscale, when magnified for us to see.\n  The potential for nanotechnologies and the exciting work taking place \nin the nanoscience field are by all accounts revolutionary. \nNanotechnology is still very much in its infancy, but as the technology \nmatures it will undoubtedly have a tremendous impact on our daily \nlives.\n  Nanoscience is quickly transforming almost every aspect of our modern \nworld and is already significantly improving our quality of life. From \ncomputer and electronic devices, to health care and pharmaceuticals, to \nagriculture, energy and our national defense, nanoscience will be the \nfoundation of many of the revolutionary advances and discoveries in the \ndecades to come and will soon occupy a major portion of the technology \neconomy.\n  Through nanoscience, researchers and scientists are already beginning \nto develop technologies that years ago were thought to be impossible. \nMemory and processing chips the size of a sugar cube have the ability \nto store all the information in our Nation's National Archives and the \nLibrary of Congress combined. Nanoscientists are also exploring ways \nnanomaterials can travel through the human body to detect and cure \ndiseases, such as target cell therapy where limited amounts of \nchemotherapy drugs can, cell by cell, attack individual cancer cells \nand leave healthy cells intact.\n  As production and innovation of nanotechnologies becomes easier, \nfaster, more efficient and less costly, every market sector in the \neconomy will begin to feel its impact. The NanoBusiness Alliance \nestimates that the global market for nanotechnology related products \nand services will reach more than $225 billion by 2005. The National \nScience Foundation conservatively predicts a $1 trillion global market \nin a little over a decade.\n  While nanotechnology is typically defined by size--that is 1 \nnanometer equaling 1 billionth of a meter--the science of \nnanotechnology is really the ability to pick and place or manipulate \natoms 1/100,000 the width of a human hair, and eventually generate \nmaterials with properties that are fundamentally new and superior to \nthe bulk form of the same materials.\n  It is the promise and potential that impels the Congress to act and \nintroduce legislation that assures this Nation remains at the forefront \nof the nanoscience revolution. The United States has been the leader of \nvirtually every important and transformative technology since the \nIndustrial Revolution, and this legislation ensures we will continue to \nlead the world in this new frontier.\n  The 21st Century Nanotechnology Research & Development Act authorizes \nappropriations for the coordination of an interagency and \ninterdisciplinary program to support long-term nanoscale research in \nthe fields of nanoscience, nanotechnology and nanoengineering as part \nof the National Nanotechnology Research Program. The legislation \nauthorizes $676 million for fiscal year 2004--a 15 percent increase \nfrom the President's budget request for fiscal year 2003--in\n\n[[Page S1140]]\n\nall nine civilian Federal agencies currently conducing nanotechnology \nresearch.\n  The goal of the legislation is to provide an organized, structured \nand collaborative approach to nanotechnology research that will ensure \nAmerica's leadership and economic competitiveness internationally. This \nlegislation provides grants to support nanoscience research centers \nthat will bring together experts from various disciplines, agencies, \nindustries and universities.\n  I have wanted the Commonwealth of Virginia to recognize \nnanotechnology as a key element in the future of high technology and \neconomic development and commend the establishment of the Initiative \nfor Nanotechnology in Virginia to serve as a facilitator in the \nnanoscience community. This legislation takes the work being done at \nthe State level and encourages increased collaboration with State-led \ninitiatives like the one in Virginia as well as universities and \nindustry led projects.\n  As our scientist and researchers adventure boldly into this New \nFrontier of nanoscience and chart new waters in lands not yet \ndiscovered, this legislation will serve as a guide and hopefully a \ncatalyst to the nanotechnology community. The work being done in the \nnanoscience field is invigorating; it's exciting, and it's important \nfor our future health, the economy and millions of jobs.\n  I hope my colleagues will work with Senator Wyden and me to pass this \nimportant legislation in a nanosecond, but recognizing the deliberative \nprocess of the Senate, passage in a nanoyear will suffice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/17/senate-section/article/S1140-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1140]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          BETTY HAGEL BREEDING\n\n Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, on Monday, a colleague \nof ours lost his mother and, as always, when tragedy hits one member of \nour Senate family, we all feel like we have lost a member of our \nextended family.\n  Not every American is recognized for the way they lived their lives. \nMost Americans pass through time making contact with those around them, \nleading good and decent lives, praying to God for forgiveness and \nsalvation, and leaving behind a modest legacy.\n  Betty Hagel Breeding was just like each one of us. She strived to \nlive her life well; she endured life's unexpected twists and survived \nits tragedies for 79 years. She passed away this week, a true Nebraskan \nand a beloved matriarch, grandmother and mother of our colleague and \nfriend Senator Chuck Hagel.\n  Life doesn't prepare you for much, especially the loss of your \nparents. It's especially difficult to lose someone who has played such \nan instrumental role in shaping your life, like most parents do.\n  According to her sons, Betty Hagel Breeding was ``the glue'' in the \nHagel family, even more so after the death of her husband in 1962 and \nlater her youngest son, Jim. From that point on, she alone faced the \nrealities of life, the uncertainty of the future, and the wonder of \nfate as she guided her boys as they became young men.\n  When you lose someone like that, there is a bottomless hole in your \nlife. When you reflect on the influence of your parents it crystallizes \nthe role they played in the development of who you are and what you \nbelieve.\n  Our parents are the people who teach us how to be, how to treat \nothers and how to live our lives. Betty Hagel Breeding passed away on \nMonday, but the lessons she taught her children and her children's \nchildren will live on through her sons. Her legacy lives today in \nNebraska in those who have survived her and the lives of the Nebraskans \ntouched by each one of them.\n  Senator Hagel is in Nebraska today with his friends and family. They \nare reliving the memories they share of Betty Hagel Breeding and \ncelebrating her life and how she led it. I know many Nebraskans and \nmany in the Senate community join me in sending heartfelt condolences \nto the Hagel family.\n  In times like these, when Nebraskans reach out to support fellow \nNebraskans, it reminds me of why our State motto is ``the good life;'' \nbecause neighbor to neighbor, town to town, city to city, Nebraska is \nhome to great men and women, like Betty Hagel Breeding.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/17/senate-section/article/S1140-2", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1140-S1141]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      GRAND VALLEY UNIVERSITY WINS NATIONAL FOOTBALL CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I want to bring to the attention of \nmy colleagues the recent accomplishments achieved by Grand Valley State \nUniversity's, GVSU, football team who on December 14, 2002, became the \n2002 National Collegiate Athletic Association, NCAA, Division II \nFootball Champions. This championship was the first in Grand Valley's \nhistory, and completes a perfect season in which the GVSU Lakers went \n14-0 maintaining their position atop the Division II football rankings \nfor the entire season. Even more impressive is the fact that the Lakers \nare 33-1 in their last 34 games with their only loss coming in the 2001 \ntitle game.\n  Preceding their National Championship, the GVSU Lakers won the Great \nLakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference, GLIAC, Football Championship \nwith a perfect record in league play. The Laker's depth was evidenced \nby their placing 18 players on the All-GLIAC team. Quarterback Curt \nAnes was named the GLIAC Player of the Year for the second straight \nseason, and received the Harlon Hill Trophy as NCAA Division II's most \noutstanding player. In addition, head coach Brian Kelly was recently \nnamed the American Football Coaches Association Division II Coach of \nthe Year. Coach Kelly has led the GVSU Lakers to a 104-34-2 record \nduring his 12 years as head coach, and includes five GLIAC titles and \nfive NCAA Division II playoff appearances.\n  The championship game, which I was lucky enough to see on television, \nwas a true nail-biter. The game matched the top ranked Grand Valley \nState Lakers against the second ranked Valdosta State University \nBlazers. After marching through the playoffs with relative ease, the \nLakers found a formidable opponent in Valdosta State, and the game was \nappropriately close to the very end. GVSU sealed the game when All-\nAmerican quarterback Curt Anes tossed a 10-yard pass to fellow All-\nAmerican wide receiver and his primary target David Kircus with 1 \nminute and 4 seconds remaining securing a 31-24 victory.\n  Over the last 2 years, the GVSU Lakers have demonstrated great \nstrength, skill, unity, and perseverance. Their ability to regroup \nafter last season's loss and maintain their top ranking all season \nbears witness to the focus and common purpose shared by the entire \nteam. I commend them for their hard work and dedication. I know that my \ncolleagues will join me in congratulating the GVSU Lakers on winning \nthe 2002 NCAA Division II Football Championship.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a list of the players and coaches be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n       Players:\n       Curt Anes, Kentwood, MI\n       Ryan

A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to establish an inventory, \nregistry, and information system of United States greenhouse emissions \nto inform the public and private sector concerning, and encourage \nvoluntary reductions in, greenhouse gas emissions; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that \nrepresents an important step towards the goal of addressing the threats \nposed by global climate change. I am pleased to be joined on this bill \nby Senator Jeffords and Senator Lieberman. They were cosponsors of this \nlegislation in the 107th Congress, they are recognized environmental \nleaders in the Senate, and are long-standing, outspoken advocates for \ntaking action to mitigate climate change. I appreciate their help in \nintroducing this legislation today.\n  Climate change is a complex issue. Scientifically. Economically. \nPolitically. But complexity is no excuse for inattention or inaction. \nBecause the health and viability of the global ecosystems upon which we \nall depend are at stake. And the time to act is now.\n  In 2001, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its \nThird Assessment Report. That report shows that climate change science \nis increasingly clear and alarming. We know that human activities, \nprimarily fossil fuel combustion, have raised the atmospheric \nconcentration of carbon dioxide to the highest levels in the last \n420,000 years. We know that the planet is warming, and that the balance \nof the scientific evidence suggests that most of the recent warming can \nbe attributed to increased atmospheric greenhouse gas levels. We know \nthat without concerted action by the U.S. and other countries, \ngreenhouse gases will continue to increase.\n  These findings were echoed by a National Academy Sciences report \npublished later in 2001, which concluded that: ``Greenhouse gases are \naccumulating in Earth's atmosphere as a result of human activities, \ncausing surface air temperatures and subsurface ocean temperatures to \nrise. Temperatures are, in fact, rising. The changes observed over the \nlast several decades are likely mostly due to human activities, but we \ncannot rule out that some significant part of these changes is also a \nreflection of natural variability. . . . ``Despite the uncertainties, \nthere is general agreement that the observed warming is real and \nparticularly strong within the past 20 years.''\n  Climate science and climate modeling have improved. These models \npredict warming under all scenarios that have been considered. Even the \nsmallest warming predicted by current models, 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit \nover the next century, would represent the greatest rate of increase in \nglobal mean surface temperature in the last 10,000 years.\n  If these trends continue, the results may be devastating. People in \nmy State of New Jersey treasure their Jersey Shore. With the exception \nof the 50 mile northern border with New York, New Jersey is surrounded \nby water. The State's Atlantic coastline stretches 127 miles. Fourteen \nof 21 counties have estuarine or marine shorelines. Rising sea level is \nalready having adverse impacts, by exacerbating coastal erosion, and \ncausing inundation, flooding, and saline intrusions into ground water. \nThe NJ coastal area also supports one of New Jersey's largest \nindustries, tourism.\n  Sea level is rising more rapidly along the US coast than worldwide. \nStudies by EPA and others have estimated that along the Gulf and \nAtlantic coasts, a one-foot rise in the sea level is likely by 2050 and \ncould occur as soon as 2025. In the next century, a two-foot rise is \nmost likely but a four-foot rise is possible. The implications for New \nJersey and many other coastal States are potentially very significant. \nI am concerned about this impact. And I am concerned about other \nclimate change impacts across New Jersey, the country and the globe.\n\n  The time for inaction and delay is over. We need to take steps today \nto start dealing with this issue. This bill is a modest step. But I \nthink it's an important one, and it's one that I believe we should be \nable to act on during the 108th Congress.\n  The main provisions of the bill establish a system that would require \ncompanies to estimate and report their emissions of greenhouse gases, \nand a place where companies can register greenhouse gas emissions \nreductions. In addition, the bill would require an annual report on \nU.S. greenhouse gas emissions. I'd like to go through each of these \ncomponents in more detail.\n  First, the bill requires EPA to work with the Secretaries of Energy, \nCommerce and Agriculture, as well as the private sector and non-\ngovernmental organizations to establish a greenhouse gas emission \ninformation system. For the purposes of the bill, greenhouse gases are \ncarbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, \nperfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride. EPA is directed to establish \nthreshold quantities for each of these gases. The threshold quantities \nwill trigger the requirement for a company to report to the system, and \nare included to enable EPA to exclude most small businesses from the \nreporting requirements.\n  Companies that emit more than a threshold quantity of each gas will \nbe required to report their emissions on an annual basis to EPA. The \nrequirements will be phased in, beginning with direct, stationary \nsource emissions in 2004. The following year, in 2005, companies \nsubject to the reporting requirements will need to submit to EPA \nestimates of other types of greenhouse gas\n\n[[Page S1146]]\n\nemissions, such as process emissions, fugitive emissions, mobile source \nemissions, forest product-sensor emissions, and indirect emissions from \nheat and steam. By reporting to the system, companies will be able to \nestablish emissions baselines.\n  Perhaps more important than the reporting system is the greenhouse \ngas registry established by the bill. The bill requires EPA a \ngreenhouse gas registry, which will enable companies to register \ngreenhouse gas reductions. Many companies are voluntarily implementing \nprojects to reduce emissions or sequester carbon. The registry would \nestablish a place for companies to be able to put these projects on \npublic record in a consistent and reliable way.\n  Taken together, these provisions of the bill will accomplish several \nimportant goals. First, they will create a reliable inventory of the \nsources of greenhouse gas emissions within our economy. But more \nimportantly, these provisions will provide a powerful incentive for \ncompanies to continue to make voluntary greenhouse gas reductions. The \nreason is that the greenhouse registry will be a place where companies \ncan register their greenhouse gas reductions in a consistent and \nuniform way. This will enable companies to publicly verify the actions \nthey are taking to reduce their emissions. It also provides a place \nwhere farmers, ranchers and foresters can register their carbon \nsequestration projects. They can then trade these registered reductions \nwith any companies that might wish to purchase them. This had the \npotential to create a new carbon market that our farmers can benefit \nfrom.\n  Prior efforts to provide ``future credits'' in a registry bill have \nrun up against a Constitutional problem in that we cannot bind future \nCongresses in legislation. So the bill does not provide such credits, \nper se. But it does establish a robust and credible reporting system \nand registry. And if companies register their reductions in a strong \nregistry, they will have as much assurance as we can provide them that \ntheir reductions will be taken into account if a mandatory greenhouse \ngas emission reduction program is enacted.\n  I believe that such a mandatory emissions reduction program will be \nnecessary, and I already support such a program, for example, Senator \nJeffords' Clean Power Act. I don't believe that a reporting and \nregistry system such as I am proposing is a substitute for such a \nmandatory emissions reductions program. But a reporting and registry \nsystem is a necessary component of any such program, and is a step that \nCongress may be able to agree on now, despite differences of opinion \nabout whether mandatory emissions reductions are necessary at this \ntime. A greenhouse gas reporting system and registry is a step we ought \nto take now, because it would provide a structure that encourages \ncompanies to make voluntary reductions now. That's the main purpose of \nthe bill.\n  In addition, the bill requires EPA to annually publish a U.S. \ngreenhouse gas emissions inventory. This will be a national account of \ngreenhouse gas emissions for our nation, and will incorporate the \ninformation submitted to the greenhouse gas information system and \nregistry. EPA has issued a similar report for several years now, and \nthis provision is intended to explicitly authorize and specify the \nscope of that report going forward.\n  I want to add that I think that many of the emissions measurement \nchallenges have been worked out or are being worked out now. Many \nadvances have been made in recent years, often in a cooperative way, \nwith industry, environmental groups and governments at the table \nworking towards measurement protocols, such as the GHG Protocol \nInitiative. It's my intent that in developing the systems and protocols \ndeveloped under this bill that EPA take advantage of the best practices \nthat have been and continue to be developed in this fashion.\n  I first introduced this bill in December 2001. Since that time, I \nthink it's fair to say that the Bush Administration has done literally \nnothing of consequence to address the climate change threat. But I \nthink that there are many in industry who disagree with the Bush \npolicy. Last September 16, the Pew Center ran an ad in the Washington \nPost that was signed by 40 major companies, including energy producers \nsuch as American Electric Power, BP, Cinergy, Entergy, and Sunoco. In \nthat ad, these companies stated their support for policies to \n``disclose major sources of greenhouse gas emissions and recognize \nearly action.'' In addition, ExxonMobil stated in their 2002 report, \n``Corporate Citizenship in a Changing World,'' that they are ``working \nwith governments and industry associations to promote development of \nprocedures for mandatory reporting by all businesses, so that in the \nfuture we can report emissions for activities we operate and also those \nin which we share ownership with others.'' So there is a willingness on \nthe part of many major U.S. corporations to move to emissions \nreporting. Congress needs to follow the leads of these companies.\n  I also want to note that I worked on a bipartisan greenhouse gas \nregistry and reporting bill with Senator Brownback last year. That bill \npassed the Senate by voice vote as a Brownback-Corzine amendment to the \nSenate energy bill. While it did not require reporting immediately, it \nensured robust participation in the reporting and registry system in \nthe near future through a trigger mechanism. And while I preferred a \nmandatory system, and still do, I am primarily concerned with getting \nresults. And the Brownback-Corzine approach had the support of the full \nSenate. So while I still prefer a mandatory system, as this bill would \ncreate, I remain willing and open to work with Senator Brownback on an \nalternative again in this Congress.\n  In closing, it's clear that it's up to Congress to lead on climate \nchange. I urge my colleagues to work with me this Congress to create a \ncredible greenhouse gas reporting and registry system that will \nencourage voluntary reductions. I ask unanimous consent that the text \nof the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 194\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Greenhouse Gas \n     Emissions Inventory and Registry Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) human activities have caused rapid increases in \n     atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and other \n     greenhouse gases in the last century;\n       (2) according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \n     Change and the National Research Council--\n       (A) the Earth has warmed in the last century; and\n       (B) the majority of the observed warming is attributable to \n     human activities;\n       (3) despite the fact that many uncertainties in climate \n     science remain, the potential impacts from human-induced \n     climate change pose a substantial risk that should be managed \n     in a responsible manner; and\n       (4) to begin to manage climate change risks, public and \n     private entities will need a comprehensive, accurate \n     inventory, registry, and information system of the sources \n     and quantities of United States greenhouse gas emissions.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to establish a \n     mandatory greenhouse gas inventory, registry, and information \n     system that--\n       (1) is complete, consistent, transparent, and accurate;\n       (2) will create accurate data that can be used by public \n     and private entities to design efficient and effective \n     greenhouse gas emission reduction strategies;\n       (3) will encourage greenhouse gas emission reductions; and\n       (4) can be used to establish a baseline in the event of any \n     future greenhouse gas emission reduction requirements \n     affecting major emitters in the United States.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act to bring \nunderground storage tanks into compliance with subtitle I of that Act, \nto promote cleanup of leaking underground storage tanks, to provide \nsufficient resources for such compliance and cleanup, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Underground \nStorage Tank Compliance Act of 2003. While this bill is being \nintroduced today, it already has a long history. The Superfund \nSubcommittee conducted two hearings on the bill last year. We have \nreceived solid testimony and input from interested parties throughout \nthis process, and I believe that this measure goes a long way toward \nsolving the problems we face with leaking underground storage tanks. In \naddition, the language in this bill was approved unanimously by the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee in the 107th Congress.\n  The chief reason for pursuing this legislation today is to improve \ncompliance with the December 22, 1998 deadline for tank owners and \noperators to upgrade, replace, or close tanks that didn't meet minimum \nFederal requirements. To assess the situation, I asked the U.S. General \nAccounting Office in April, 2000 to examine compliance of tanks with \nFederal requirements. GAO concluded in May, 2001 that approximately \n76,000 tanks have never been upgraded to meet minimum Federal \nstandards. In addition, GAO found that more than 200,000 tanks are not \nbeing operated and maintained properly due, in part, to infrequent tank \ninspections and limited funding.\n\n[[Page S1149]]\n\n  Leaking tanks can have severe impacts on local communities. For \nexample, the village of Pascoag, Rhode Island learned the hard way that \nthe problems GAO outlined are real and have serious consequences. \nTwelve hundred households were without water with which to drink, \nbathe, or cook for over four months because MTBE contaminated fuel from \na local gasoline station was leaking into the town's drinking water \nsupply.\n  I believe the Underground Storage Tank Compliance Act of 2003 will \nassist communities that are grappling with these problems and will \nprevent such problems from recurring. The high cost of clean-up once a \ntank has leaked, demands the emphasis on prevention included in this \nlegislation. The bill requires the inspection of all underground \nstorage tanks every two years and for the first time focuses on the \ntraining of tank operators. It simply does not make sense to install \nmodern, protective equipment if the people who operate them do not have \nthe proper training. The bill also provides the Federal Government and \nStates with the tools necessary to ensure that all parties are meeting \nFederal standards. In addition, the legislation emphasizes compliance \nof tanks owned by Federal, State, and local governments, and provides \n$125 million per year for cleanup of sites contaminated by MTBE.\n  This bill enjoys broad support, including the support of the \nregulated community and the environmental community. We have worked \nextensively with the Administration to address issues raised by the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency. I believe that this legislation goes a \nlong way toward solving many of the problems relating to leaking tanks, \nand I thank all of my colleagues for working with me on this.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 195\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a digital and wireless network technology \nprogram, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, today I rise with my colleagues--Senators \nMcCain, Stevens, Hollings and Miller to introduce the Digital & \nWireless Network Technology Program Act of 2003.\n  Access to the Internet is no longer a luxury, but a necessity. \nBecause of the rapid advancement and growing dependence on technology, \nbeing digitally connected becomes more essential to economic and \neducational advancement. 60 percent of all jobs require information \ntechnology skills and jobs in information technology pay significantly \nhigher salaries than jobs in non-information technology fields. People \nwho lack access to information technology tools are at an increasing \ndisadvantage. Consequently, it is important that all institutions of \nhigher education provide their students with access to the most current \ninformation technology and digital equipment.\n  As Governor of Virginia, I implemented a technology plan that created \na blueprint of technology resources throughout the Virginia Community \nCollege System, VCCS. All 38 community college campuses are wired and \neach community college has a dedicated Commonwealth Classroom for \ncompressed video distance education classes. Arrangements with Old \nDominion University, Christopher Newport University, Virginia Tech and \nother institutions are offering senior level courses through distance \neducation that actually take place on the community college campus.\n  Minority Serving Institutions, however, still lack basic information \nand digital technology infrastructure. A study completed by the \nDepartment of Commerce and the National Association for Equal \nOpportunity in Higher Education showed that most Historically Black \nColleges and Universities do not have high-speed Internet access, and \nonly 3 percent of these colleges and universities indicated that \nfinancial aid was available to help their students close the computer \nownership gap, the digital divide.\n  The Digital & Wireless Network Technology Program Act of 2003 seeks \nto address the technology gap that exists at many Minority Serving \nInstitutions, MSIs. Our legislation establishes a new grant program \nwithin the National Science Foundation, NSF, that provides up to $250 \nmillion to help Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic \nServing Institutions, and Tribal Colleges bridge the digital divide.\n  The legislation allows eligible institutions the opportunity through \ngrants, contracts or cooperative agreements to acquire equipment, \ninstrumentation, networking capability,\n\n[[Page S1152]]\n\nhardware and software, digital network technology and wireless \ntechnology/infrastructure, such as wireless fidelity or WiFi, to \ndevelop and provide educational services. Additionally, the grants \ncould be used for such activities as equipment upgrades, technology \ntraining and hardware/software acquisition. A Minority Serving \nInstitution also could use the funds to offer its students universal \naccess to campus networks, dramatically increase their connectivity \nrates, or make necessary infrastructure improvements.\n  Virginia has five Historically Black Colleges and Universities: \nHampton University, Norfolk State University, St. Paul's College, \nVirginia Union University and Virginia State University.\n  The best jobs in the future will go to those who are the best \nprepared. However, I am increasingly concerned that when it comes to \nhigh technology jobs which pay higher wages this country runs the risk \nof economically limiting many college students in our society. It is \nimportant for ALL Americans that we close this opportunity gap. Since \nmy election to the Senate, my goal has always been to continue the work \nthat I began as Governor, to look for ways to improve education, create \njobs and seek out new opportunities to benefit Virginia and its \ncitizens. By improving technology-education programs, we can accomplish \nall three for students throughout our nation.\n  I want to thank my colleagues for joining me today cosponsoring this \nlegislation and look forward to working with fellow Senators to push \nthis important measure across the goal-line so that many more college \nstudents are provided access to better technology and education, and \nmost importantly, even greater opportunities in life.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  Mr. McCAIN. During this era of economic slowdown and global threat, \nit is imperative that our Nation's institutions of higher education are \nprepared to produce a technologically advanced workforce. Rita Colwell, \nDirector of the National Science Foundation, NSF, stated in a recent \nletter to new Members of Congress that ``. . . American science and \ntechnology is failing to tap a vast pool of talent among our women and \nethnic minorities.''\n  As the demographics of the Nation become more and more diverse, \nminority institutions of higher education take on an even greater \nimportance. It is estimated that in 10 years, minorities will comprise \n40 percent of the college-age Americans, the pool from which the \nNation's future engineers and scientists will emerge. Therefore, to tap \nthis underutilized pool of future engineers and scientists, it is \nessential to provide assistance to these minority institutions. The \nhundreds of minority-serving institutions, MSI, which include \nHistorically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), Hispanic-serving \ninstitutions, and tribal colleges and universities, should be provided \nwith the resources to ensure that we are indeed utilizing their large \nstudent populations.\n  I am pleased to join Senator Allen and the other sponsors in \nintroducing the Digital and Wireless Network Technology Act of 2003. \nThis legislation would create an office at the NSF to draw upon its \nresources to strengthen the ability of MSIs to provide instructions in \ndigital and wireless network technologies.\n  The legislation is not the result of any special interest groups or \nhighly financial lobbying efforts. It is based upon data provided by 80 \nof the 118 HBCUs in a study, entitled ``HBCU Technology Assessment \nStudy,'' funded by the U.S. Department of Commerce and conducted by a \nnational black college association and minority business. The study \nassessed the computing resources, networking, and connectivity of HBCUs \nand other institutions that provide educational services to \npredominately African-American populations.\n  The study concluded that ``during this era of continuous innovation \nand change, continual upgrading of networking and connectivity systems \nis critical if HBCUs are to continue to cross the digital divide and \nnot fall victim to it. Failure to do this may result in what is a \nmanageable digital divide today, evolving into an unmanageable digital \ngulf tomorrow.'' I believe there is reason to conclude that the \nfindings from the study also would apply to Hispanic-serving \ninstitutions, and tribal colleges and universities.\n  This bill would build upon the work of Senator Cleland and many \nothers during the last Congress. In testimony before the Commerce \nCommittee last year, the president of the United Negro College Fund, \nCongressman William Gray, stated that we can ill afford to promote \ncollege graduates who enter the workforce without mastering the basic \ncomputer skills and understanding how information technology applies to \ntheir work or profession.\n  I feel it is imperative that we do all we can to improve the quality \nof education for students at our minority serving institutions.

A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n1965 to establish a program to help States expand the education system \nto include at least 1 year of early education preceding the year a \nchild enters kindergarten; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the Early \nEducation Act. This bill will enable millions of children to be \nprepared when they begin their academic careers.\n  In 1989, the Nation's governors established a goal that all children \nwould have access to high quality prekindergarten programs by the year \n2000. It is now the year 2003, and this goal is far from being met.\n  Of the nearly 8 million 3- and 4-year-olds that could be in early \neducation, fewer than half are enrolled in an early education program.\n  The result is that too many children come to school ill-prepared to \nlearn. They lack language skills, social skills, and motivation. Almost \nall experts now agree that an early education experience is one of the \nmost effective strategies for improving later school performance.\n  Researchers have discovered that children have a learning capacity \nthat can and should be developed at a much earlier age than was \npreviously thought. The National Research Council reported that \nprekindergarten educational opportunities are necessary if children are \ngoing to develop the language and literacy skills needed to read.\n  Furthermore, studies have shown that children who participate in \nprekindergarten programs are less likely to be held back a grade, show \ngreater learning retention and initiative, have better social skills, \nare more enthusiastic about school, and are more likely to have good \nattendance records.\n  For every dollar invested in early education, about 7 dollars are \nsaved in later costs.\n  My bill, the Early Education Act, would create a demonstration \nproject in at least 10 States that want to provide one year of \nprekindergarten early education in the public schools. There is a 50 \npercent matching requirement, and the $300 million authorized under \nthis bill would be used by States to supplement--not supplant--other \nFederal, State or local funds.\n  Our children need a solid foundation that builds on current education \nsystem by providing them with early learning skills. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/17/senate-section/article/S1153-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1153-S1154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 2--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE CONGRESS \n   THAT THE UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE SHOULD ISSUE COMMEMORATIVE \nPOSTAGE STAMPS HONORING AMERICANS WHO DISTINGUISHED THEMSELVES BY THEIR \n                      SERVICE IN THE ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mr. CORZINE (for himself and Mr. Warner) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs:\n\n                             S. Con. Res. 2\n\n       Whereas the United States Postal Service honored four \n     distinguished American soldiers when it issued its \n     Distinguished Soldiers commemorative postage stamps on May 3, \n     2000;\n       Whereas such stamps not only paid tribute to the patriotism \n     and uncommon valor of those brave soldiers, but also served \n     as a lasting tribute to the men and women of the Army who \n     have dedicated their lives to the defense of our country; and\n       Whereas it is only fitting that similar recognition be \n     given with respect to the other branches of the armed forces: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That--\n       (1) commemorative postage stamps should be issued by the \n     United States Postal Service honoring Americans who \n     distinguished themselves by their service in the Navy, Air \n     Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, respectively; and\n       (2) the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee should recommend \n     to the Postmaster General that such stamps be issued.\n                                  ____\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I join my colleague from New Jersey, \nSenator Corzine, in support of a series of commemorative postage stamps \nto\n\n[[Page S1154]]\n\nhonor the distinguished members of our armed services.\n  As a veteran of World War II and Korea, I know firsthand the \nhardships of war. It certainly does provide a deeper appreciation for \nlife and the struggles faced by the men and women who serve in our \nuniformed services. I also appreciate just how critical it is for our \nmilitary personnel to be appropriately trained, well-equipped, and \nfairly compensated, both in times of peace and hostilities, for \nprotecting the freedoms we enjoy as Americans.\n  In May of 2000, a series of four stamps were issued by the United \nStates Postal Service to acknowledge several distinguished leaders of \nthe United States Army. This Resolution maintains that this honor \nshould be extended to recognize the accomplishments of notable service \nmembers of the United States Navy, United States Marine Corps, United \nStates Air Force and the United States Coast Guard.\n  I take great pride in representing military personnel and the \nveterans of our great nation and I am pleased to support this admirable \ninitiative.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution \ncalling on the United States Postal Service to issue commemorative \npostage stamps honoring distinguished servicemen and servicewomen from \nthe Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Coast Guard.\n  On May 3, 2000 the United States Postal Service formally recognized \nfour distinguished Army soldiers with ``Distinguished Soldiers'' \ncommemorative postage stamps. These stamps serve as an important \ntribute to the patriotism and uncommon valor of four individual \nsoldiers who risked life and limb in defense of liberty. Clearly, as \nour military is being mobilized for possible military action, these \nstamps serve as a timely recognition of the sacrifice made by our Army \npersonnel to defend the democratic values that we hold dear.\n  To date, however, there has been an unfortunate, but easily \nremediable oversight: the Postal Service has issued a set of four \nstamps recognizing the accomplishments of individual U.S. Army \nsoldiers, but has not followed through with similar stamp series \ncommemorating the profound contributions of individual members of the \narmed forces from the Marines, the Navy, the Air Force, and the Coast \nGuard.\n  Recognizing all the branches of our Armed Forces is long overdue. Men \nand women from all the military services deserve recognition for the \nrisks they have taken and the sacrifices they have made for the freedom \nwe all enjoy. As Mr. Einar Dyhrkopp, then Chairman of the Postal \nService Board of Governors stated in May 2000, at the dedication \nceremony for the block of four stamps commemorating the valor of \nindividual ``Distinguished Soldiers,'' ``By doing their duty, they \nbrought honor to us all and helped preserve this country that we love. \nNow it's time for the nation to do its duty and honor these \ndistinguished soldiers.''\n  It is a mistake to pay tribute to one service without similar \ntributes to the other services. The Postal Service should issue similar \nfour-stamp sets recognizing the military accomplishments of individual \nmembers of the Air Force, the Marines, the Navy and the Coast Guard \nsoon to redress this lamentable omission.\n  I am sure that each member of Congress can think of at least one \nmilitary hero who deserves this special recognition. For instance, I \nhave long felt that a stamp commemorating the courageous service of \nGunnery Sergeant John Basilone would be a fitting memorial to a great \nMarine.\n  Raised in Raritan, NJ, Basilone, enlisted in the U.S. Army soon after \nhis 18th birthday. Shortly thereafter, he was deployed to the \nPhilippines where he earned a nickname that would stick with him for \nthe rest of his career: ``Manila John.''\n  Following his tour of duty in 1937, Basilone returned to Raritan. But \nhe wouldn't stay there long. In July 1940, with much of Europe at war \nand the United States on the brink, ``Manila John'' left New Jersey, \nenlisting in the military once again, this time joining the United \nStates Marine Corps.\n  On October 24, 1942, Basilone earned his Congressional Medal of \nHonor. He was sent to a position on the Tenaru River at Guadalcanal and \nplaced in command of two sections of heavy machine guns. Sergeant \nBasilone and his men were charged with defending Henderson Airfield, an \nimportant American foothold on the island. Although the Marine \ncontingent was vastly outnumbered and without needed support, Basilone \nand his men successfully repelled a Japanese assault.\n  Other survivors reported that their success can be attributed to one \nman: ``Manila John.'' He crossed enemy lines to replenish a dangerously \nlow stockpile of ammunition, repaired artillery pieces, and steadied \nhis troops in the midst of torrential rain. He went several days and \nnights without food or sleep, and the U.S. military was able to carry \nthe day. His exploits became Marine lore, and served as a patriotic \ninspiration to others facing daunting challenges in the midst of war.\n  For his courage under fire and profound patriotism, Basilone was the \nfirst enlisted Marine to be awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor in \nWorld War II. When he returned to the United States, he was heralded as \na hero and quickly sent on tour around the country to help finance the \nwar through the sale of war bonds. The Marine corps offered to \ncommission Basilone as an officer and station him far away from the \nfrontlines.\n  But Basilone was not interested in riding out the war in Washington, \nDC. He was quoted as saying. ``I ain't no officer, and I ain't no \nmuseum piece. I belong back with my outfit.'' In December 1944, he got \nhis wish and returned to the frontlines.\n  General Douglas MacArthur called him ``a one-man army,'' and on \nFebruary 19, 1945 at Iwo Jima, Basilone once against lived up to that \nreputation. Basilone destroyed an enemy stronghold, a blockhouse on \nthat small Japanese island and commanded his young troops to move the \nheavy guns off the beach. Unfortunately, less than two hours into the \nassault on that fateful day in February, Basilone and four of his \nfellow marines were killed when an enemy mortar shell exploded nearby.\n  When Gunnery Sergeant John Basilone died, he was only 27, but he had \nalready earned the Congressional Medal of Honor, the Navy Cross, the \nPurple Heart, and the appreciation of his Nation. Basilone is a true \nAmerican patriot whose legacy should be preserved.\n  Basilone is just one of the many heroes who deserve to be \nmemorialized on a U.S. postage stamp. That is why the Military \nCoalition, a group that includes associations representing every aspect \nof our Armed Forces community, from the Reserve Officers Association to \nthe Veterans of Foreign Wars, has endorsed the initiative to see \ncommemorative stamps issued honoring exceptional service men and women \nfrom all branches of the military.\n  The Postal Service fittingly honored courageous men and women who \nfought in the Army by issuing stamps commemorating the tremendous \nsacrifice and unusual courage demonstrated by individual distinguished \nsoldiers. Now it is time for Marines like Sergeant Basilone, and men \nand women from the Air Force, the Coast Guard, and the Navy to be \nhonored in a similar fashion.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this resolution as an \nimportant message to all our military servicemen and women that we \nappreciate and admire their efforts to defend our great country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/17/senate-section/article/S1154-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1154-S1155]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED & PROPOSED\n\n       SA 35.

For purposes of this paragraph, the term \n     ``total annual revenue'' means the revenue earned in a \n     single year from such stocks. The Secretary shall accept \n     each qualified bid in rank order of bid score from the \n     lowest to the highest until acceptance of the next \n     qualified bid with the next lowest bid score would cause \n     the reduction cost to exceed the reduction loan's maximum \n     amount. Acceptance of a bid by the Secretary shall create \n     a binding reduction contract between the United States and \n     the person whose bid is accepted, the performance of which \n     shall be subject only to the conclusion of a successful \n     referendum, except that a person whose bid is accepted by \n     the Secretary under this section shall relinquish all \n     permits in the reduction fishery and may Dungeness crab \n     and Pink shrimp permits issued by Washington, Oregon, or \n     California; except that the Secretary shall revoke the \n     Pacific groundfish permit, as well as all Federal fishery \n     licenses, fishery permits, area, and species endorsements, \n     and any other fishery privileges issued to a vessel or \n     vessels (or to persons on the basis of their operation or \n     ownership of that vessel or vessels) removed under the \n     program.\n       (g) The Secretary shall establish separate reduction loan \n     sub-amounts and repayment fees for fish sellers in the \n     reduction fishery and for fish sellers in each of the fee-\n     share fisheries by dividing the total ex-vessel dollar value \n     during the bid scoring period of all reduction vessel \n     landings from the reduction fishery and from each of the fee-\n     share fisheries by the total such value of all such landings \n     for all such fisheries; and multiplying the reduction loan \n     amount by each of the quotients resulting from each of the \n     divisions above. Each of the resulting products shall be the \n     reduction loan sub-amount for the reduction fishery and for \n     each of the fee-share fisheries to which each of such \n     products pertains; except that, each fish seller in the \n     reduction fishery and in each of the fee-share fisheries \n     shall pay the fees required by the reduction loan sub-amounts \n     allocated to it under this paragraph; except that, the \n     Secretary may enter into agreements with Washington, Oregon, \n     and California to collect any fees established under this \n     paragraph.\n       (h) Notwithstanding 46 U.S.C. App. 1279(b)(4), the \n     reduction loan's term shall not be less than 30 years.\n       (1) It is the sense of the Congress that the States of \n     Washington, Oregon, and California should revoke all \n     relinquishment permits in each of the fee-share fisheries \n     immediately after reduction payment, and otherwise to \n     implement appropriate State fisheries management and \n     conservation provisions in each of the fee-share fisheries \n     that establishes a program that meets the requirements of 16 \n     U.S.C. 141861a(b)(1)(B) as if it were applicable to fee-share \n     fisheries.\n       (j) The term ``fee-share fishery'' means a fishery, other \n     than the reduction fishery, whose members are eligible to \n     vote in a referendum for an industry fee system under \n     paragraph (c). The term ``reduction fishery'' means that \n     portion of a fishery holding limited entry fishing permits \n     endorsed for the operation of trawl gear and issued under the \n     Federal Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 47.

Mr. President, I thank the leader for his kindness in \nletting me speak for up to 15 minutes before the Senate goes out for \nthe long weekend before we come back in on Tuesday. I take this time to \ndraw attention to the provision in the pending bill regarding disaster \naid to our farmers.\n  We have been fighting here for almost 3 years to get disaster relief \nfor farmers all over America. We had it basically in our budget a \ncouple years ago. We had it in the farm bill, but it was taken out. We \nhad assurances from the administration that it would come later. It \nnever did. We have farmers who were promised disaster aid over 2 years \nago, and they still have not received it.\n  A number of us on both sides of the aisle have been trying for some \ntime now to fill in that hole and get aid to the farmers who have \nreally suffered a lot from disasters. In the Presiding Officer's home \nState, livestock producers and grain farmers have had disasters in the \nlast couple of years for which they have not been adequately \ncompensated. That is true in the Midwest--some in my State, and much of \nit further west, and a lot along the eastern seaboard. But we have had \nsome serious crop disasters.\n  Now the bill before us has some money in there for, as they say, \ndisaster assistance. But upon reading the fine print, it turns out that \nit is not really disaster assistance, it is just putting money in a \nbushel basket and throwing it out to farmers. It just doesn't make any \nsense. In the Des Moines Register this morning, Philip Brasher had an \narticle about it. Here is the headline: Bountiful Crop Could Still Draw \nDisaster Aid. My quote is this:\n\n       ``This is just nonsense,'' said Iowa Senator Tom Harkin.\n\n  Basically, the article shows that a grain farmer in Iowa--we had \nreally great crops in Iowa--the soybean and corn crops this year. In \none part of Iowa, we had a drought. In many parts of the State, we had \nbumper crops and we had significantly higher prices. Under the \nprovision in the bill before us, those farmers will get disaster \nassistance. What sense does that make?\n  Please, someone explain to me why we are taking an across-the-board \ncut--we are cutting education, veterans, medical research, and all this \nother stuff; and we are going to take some of this money and give it to \nfarmers who have had no losses. In fact, some farmers made a lot of \nmoney because they had good crops. God bless them. I wish every farmer \ncould have a good crop and have high prices to go with it. But this \ndoesn't make sense in\n\n[[Page S1167]]\n\nthis bill. Basically, it is using the old Freedom to Farm payments.\n  Mr. Brasher points out in the article:\n\n       A farmer who received $40,000 last year would get a special \n     payment of as much as $16,700.\n\n  That could be a farmer who had a great crop and made money. They \ndon't have to have a disaster. All you have to do is be eligible for \ncrop payments, and then you can get part of this payment.\n\n       ``This is not a disaster relief package,'' said Republican \n     Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas, which has been hard hit by a \n     long drought.\n       Harkin said, ``Let's face it, there are a lot of farmers in \n     my State and there are a lot of farmers in other States who \n     made pretty good money this past year. Why should they get \n     some more money from the government?''\n       Senator Charles Grassley agreed that the aid should be \n     directed to farmers with crop losses.\n       ``The farmers who didn't get hurt weren't asking for more \n     money from the Federal Treasury,'' he said.\n\n  He is right. Why is there money in this bill for farmers who didn't \nhave a disaster and are not asking for it?\n  I understand Senator Daschle will be offering an amendment to correct \nthis anomaly in the bill. The provision being offered by Senator \nDaschle, whether it is next week, or whenever it is going to be \noffered, is already known to the Senate. In September of last year, we \nessentially passed the same measure by a vote of 79 to 16. So it is \nnothing new.\n  The provisions in the appropriations bill before us totally miss the \nmark. It is not directed toward those who actually lost crops due to \nnatural disaster; the funding is offset by reducing funding for other \nimportant Federal programs, and it is inadequate.\n  We know from our experience, we know from having investigated it, \nfrom hearings we have had both in the House and the Senate, that we \nneed somewhere in the neighborhood of $6 billion to address the needs \nof those who suffered a drought.\n  As Senator Conrad said earlier today--and I was watching his speech--\nthe Department already, because of the new farm bill and because the \nnew farm bill directs payments in a more targeted fashion, we have \nalready saved $5 billion to $6 billion, maybe a little bit more than \nthat. So the savings have come in from the new farm bill.\n  We think those savings, rather than going back to the General \nTreasury, ought to be used to help those farmers who had a loss, who \nhad a drought, who did not have anything because of a natural disaster.\n  If an argument is made that $6 billion has to be offset by cuts \nsomewhere else, it is already offset because we have already saved the \nmoney that was previously budgeted for agricultural commodity programs. \nThat money was budgeted, and yet we saved it. That money ought to go \nout to help farmers hit by this drought and hit by disaster.\n  To repeat for emphasis sake, this appropriations bill would simply \nprovide a supplemental direct payment for all producers of all covered \ncommodities and peanuts. It means that all producers of these crops who \nwere eligible to receive a direct payment for 2002 will receive the \nsupplemental payment regardless of whether they had an actual disaster \nloss in 2001, 2002, or any other time.\n  I repeat, why should Congress be taking money away from education, \nmedical research, veterans, law enforcement--all these other domestic \nprograms--for the purpose of making payments to farmers who did not \neven have a disaster and sometimes making a payment to a farmer who had \na record yield and good prices this last year? It makes no sense to me.\n  I have to believe that farmers all over America, when they find this \nout--and they will be reading about it in their local papers; they will \nread about it in their farm journals; they will hear about it on their \nfarm radio shows--they are going to laugh. They are going to say: What \nare those people in Washington thinking about?\n  Mr. President, if you are a farmer and you have had a record yield, \nyou have had a good crop, and all of a sudden the Government comes \nalong and wants to give you several thousand more dollars, well, hey, \nopen the mailbox and take it out, but still they are going to think we \nare goofy around here for doing something like that.\n  Talk to farmers. Most say if farmers are hit by a disaster, whether \nit is a flood, a hurricane, a drought, insects--whatever it might be--\nor it could be in the livestock sector where they lost feed grains for \nthe livestock, yes, they deserve to have disaster payments, but not \nthose who are doing well.\n  Lastly, I notice the bill adopts the Livestock Compensation Program \nthat was put together last summer. That program had a lot of problems. \nThe help it provides is inadequate for those who qualify. The Livestock \nCompensation Program provided less than half of the funding that would \nbe provided to livestock producers under section 3 of the Daschle \namendment that will be offered.\n  I was told last fall that the payment offered to cattle producers who \nlacked forage would cover only about 2 weeks of feed cost for the \nherds, and that was not enough.\n  I note another curious feature about this bill in the drought \nsection. The provisions of the Livestock Compensation Program are \nextended to catfish farming, but not to pork producers. That is very \ncurious. We extend the Livestock Compensation Program to catfish \nfarmers, but not to hog farmers. I am waiting to hear the explanation \nfor that one.\n\n  I am saying livestock producers of all categories experienced \nsignificant increases in their feed costs due to higher grain and \noilseed prices, not just catfish, but pork producers, cattle, sheep, \nand goats.\n  I have no problem--I want to say it right here and now--I have no \nproblem in providing disaster assistance to catfish farmers if, in \nfact, they have suffered a disaster, but we cannot single out catfish \nfarmers and say not pork producers, because pork producers have to pay \nhigher grain prices also. Both use feed grains.\n  This so-called drought relief package that is in the bill before us \nis, No. 1, inadequate. It is about $3 billion. We need about $6 \nbillion.\n  No. 2, it is totally misdirected because it takes the $3 billion and \ngives it to everybody. It just throws the money out there. This is \nFreedom to Farm revisited. We do not care whether you had a drought or \nnot, but you are going to get money. It is misdirected.\n  And, No. 3, it should not be coming out of across-the-board cuts in \nveterans compensation, education, medical research at NIH, the Byrne \ngrant program, and programs like those, because let the record show \nthat we have already saved in agriculture more than enough money to pay \nfor disaster assistance to farmers who need it nationwide. We have \nsaved that much money. No one can deny it. So we do not need an offset. \nWe have the offset. We have saved the money with the new farm bill.\n  I hope when this issue comes up next week, or whenever it comes up, \nthat Senators will, again, call their farmers. Do not talk to staff. \nThey can talk to their staff, but get on the phone and call the farm \norganization back in their States. Call the Farm Bureau, the Farmers \nUnion, call your cattlemen's association, pork producers, catfish \nproducers, whatever, and ask them if they believe this is the right way \nto proceed.\n  I will give you a dollar to a dime they will not find one in ten to \nsay yes, and the one who says yes made a lot of money and wants more. \nCall your farmers. They will tell you what to do: Target it; get it to \nthe farmers who had a disaster, and make sure they are compensated \nadequately and not just throw it out there for everybody.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a \nletter from numerous farm organizations.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                  January 6, 2002.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Member of Congress: The undersigned organizations \n     write to urge your support for emergency disaster assistance \n     for crop and livestock procedures who have suffered losses \n     during the 2001 and 2002 agriculture production years due to \n     natural disasters. Such disaster assistance would be \n     consistent with responses by the U.S. government to natural \n     disasters in the past, including hurricanes, floods, and \n     droughts.\n       The Food Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 provides \n     increased economic resources, certainty, and stability across \n     a wide range of agricultural, rural, and nutrition programs \n     administered by USDA. For\n\n[[Page S1168]]\n\n     commodities, we believe it was the intent of Congress that \n     the new farm bill reduce or eliminate the need for future ad \n     hoc market loss-related assistance and, instead, provide a \n     similar level of assistance in a more efficient and cost \n     effective manner than the legislation it replaced. In fact, \n     projected outlays for commodity programs under the new law \n     are projected to be significantly less than the annual \n     average federal expenditures incurred since 1998. However, \n     the new farm bill is incapable of predicting and adequately \n     dealing with natural disasters.\n       Furthermore, due in part to increased prices resulting from \n     the impact of natural disasters, the most recent projected \n     outlays for 2002 are less than originally projected at the \n     signing of the farm bill. Despite these savings and the \n     precedence of assistance for those who suffer from natural \n     disasters, Congress has failed to pass emergency disaster \n     assistance.\n       For U.S. farmers and ranchers, the current production \n     disaster is multi-faceted. In many areas, drought has \n     decimated row crops and forage and has reduced water supplies \n     available for livestock. In other regions, farmers are \n     experiencing crop destruction and reduced yields and quality \n     due to flooding and an increased incidence of crop pests and \n     diseases. Especially hard hit are the specialty crops such as \n     apples, cherries and grapes in the Great Lakes region, the \n     eastern states and the Pacific Northwest that suffered frost, \n     freeze and drought damage this season and adverse weather in \n     2001 that caused a failure of the blossom set required to \n     produce fruit.\n       The negative economic impact of natural disasters to \n     American agriculture and rural communities continues to grow.\n       Almost 90 percent of U.S. counties have received a USDA \n     disaster designation in 2002.\n       Over 40 percent have received designations in both 2001 and \n     2002.\n       Washington State alone suffered $100 million in apple crop \n     losses in 2002 due to early freeze.\n       Adverse weather conditions cut the expected cotton crop by \n     over 1 million bales. Drought conditions harmed the growing \n     season, and a series of storms hit during harvest, inflicting \n     continued quality and quantity losses. In the Southeast and \n     Mid-South, only 55% of the crop achieved a color grade of \n     Strict Low Middling or better. This compares to a five-year \n     average of 81%.\n       The producers on the Blackfeet Reservation, Montana, lost \n     over 3000 head of cattle in a freak June 3rd snowstorm. The \n     storm did fill stock ponds and provided some additional \n     spring green-up moisture but did not provide enough to \n     alleviate the effects of four years of drought.\n       The wheat acreage harvested at 45 million acres is the \n     lowest it has been since 1971.\n       Financial assistance is needed now if the economic ruin of \n     farms, ranches and rural businesses caused by these natural \n     disasters is to be averted.\n       Within the range of its existing options, we believe USDA \n     has taken positive actions to address the weather and \n     disease-related disasters experienced by crop and livestock \n     producers during the 2001 and 2002 production years. \n     Unfortunately, the Department's authority and resources \n     available to mitigate the losses sustained by farmers, \n     ranchers and rural businesses are inadequate given the full \n     scope of the weather and disease problems confronting \n     American agriculture.\n       While crop insurance, disaster loans, emergency haying and \n     grazing of Conservation Reserve Program acreage, and the \n     Livestock Compensation Program (LCP) are helpful, the relief \n     they provide cannot effectively respond to the unprecedented \n     and expansive devastation being experienced across a large \n     part of America. We urge your active engagement and support \n     immediately upon convening the 108th Congress of the \n     emergency disaster assistance legislation passed by the \n     Senate last session.\n       We urge Congress to approve this legislation and work with \n     the administration to ensure that this emergency program is \n     in place, which provides a responsible level of assistance to \n     those suffering substantial losses as a result of natural \n     disasters. This adequate response is needed immediately to \n     reduce the devastating economic impacts being experienced by \n     farmers, ranchers and their communities throughout much of \n     rural America because of natural disasters beyond their \n     control.\n       Thank you for your attention to this issue.
