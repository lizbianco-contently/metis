Mr. President, this morning we will resume consideration \nof the Defense authorization bill. Under the order, Senator Bond will \noffer an amendment relating to energy employees, and I understand there \nmay be a modification to the amendment. Therefore, the amendment may be \naccepted without a recorded vote.\n  The chairman and ranking member also discussed the possibility last \nnight of considering several missile defense amendments this morning, \nand I defer to the chairman as to what debate times will be necessary \non these amendments after discussion with the ranking member. I do \nanticipate rollcall votes will be required in relation to these \namendments.\n  We will have a very busy session today as we continue to make \nprogress on the Defense authorization bill. I am pleased with the \nprogress that is being made, though last night I did file cloture on \nthe bill as a necessary tool, in my mind, to facilitate and help bring \nthe bill to closure.\n  We will continue to discuss the issue of how best to bring the bill \nto closure. I am in constant discussion with the Democratic leadership \nand with the ranking member and the chairman as to how we can best \nfinish this important bill. We will be updating the Senate over the \ncourse of the day as to our progress.\n  Once again, I remind our colleagues that we will continue to schedule \nvotes on judges throughout each day's session. We will set votes on \nthose judicial nominations as we set votes on the defense amendments \nover the course of the day. I do want to thank Chairman Warner and \nSenator Levin for their tremendous work on the bill thus far, and I \nlook forward to another very full and very complete day.\n  I will defer for a minute as far as the schedule goes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/17/senate-section/article/S6911-7", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6911]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

If I could ask, through the Chair, to the distinguished \nmajority leader, it is obvious we have a number of amendments to \ndispose of. As we talked publicly last night with the two managers, we \nhave four missile defense amendments over here. There will be at least \ntwo second degrees, maybe more, that will be offered on those \namendments. As we have said, as soon as we see them, I am sure we can \nset out a reasonable period of time to debate them and vote on them, \nand we should get rid of these with--I do not mean that in a negative \nsense but move on past these in a fairly short period of time.\n  We also have indicated that Senator Biden wishes to offer the \namendment that has been no secret around here to take some of the \nhigher bracket tax cuts and use those moneys for what is going on in \nIraq.\n\n[[Page S6912]]\n\n  Anyway, all of this stuff is fairly known now, what we have to do. I \nbelieve we can move through these at a fairly decent rate.\n  Senator Levin mentioned last night that people have been waiting for \nseveral days to offer amendments, and we have to make sure they have \nthat opportunity. The main reason for rising now is to say I hope \nthat--I should not say I hope; I guess it should be in the form of a \nquestion--on Monday that we are going to have some votes on some \nsubstantive defense-related amendments, and I do not know what time the \ndistinguished majority leader wants to do that. If it is going to be at \nthe regular time, 5:30, we should know that. If it is going to be \nearlier, we should alert our folks to that now. Because of certain \nthings that also are quite known around here, we will not have votes \ntomorrow, unless the majority leader decides to have a cloture vote. \nOther than that, there will not be any other votes, I am very confident \nof that.\n\n  Does the majority leader have an idea whether he is going to move \nthings up on Monday?\n  Mr. FRIST. It is absolutely critical that we make today a productive \nday, and I think we have a good plan for today. Tomorrow needs to be a \nproductive day. The scheduled cloture vote for tomorrow would likely be \nthe only vote tomorrow, and again I think we need to discuss that over \nthe course of the day and then see what the plan would be for Friday \nand Monday. We will be voting Monday absolutely. We will probably do it \nlater in the day. Again, we will defer to the managers about that.\n  We need to make Monday a very full and productive day if we are going \nto finish this bill.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to make sure everyone understands \nthat tomorrow will be a tremendously good day to offer amendments. \nThere would be time to debate whatever they want to lay down, and even \nthough there would not be votes scheduled on them tomorrow that would \nsure be a good way to get things done. Some Members have already \nexpressed to me that they would be willing to lay down their amendments \ntomorrow. So tomorrow, in addition to Monday, should be a productive \nday on this legislation.\n  Mr. FRIST. I agree, tomorrow would be a great day to lay down \namendments if they are absolutely necessary and important amendments, \nbut for amendments we do not need to consider or that can be considered \nlater, we do not need to lay down too many amendments tomorrow because \nI want to be able to finish this bill. But tomorrow is going to be a \nproductive day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/17/senate-section/article/S6912-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6912-S6913]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MEDICAL LITIGATION REFORM\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I know we are going to go straight to the \nbill, but first I want to make a few comments on another very important \nissue, and now during leader time is the most appropriate time for me \nto comment. It is an issue that is very close to my heart and an issue \nthat has tremendous impact on people in every State.\n  I will speak to one State, that is Massachusetts, on the issue of \nmedical liability.\n  It was just this week that the American Medical Association added \nanother State--Massachusetts--to its growing list of States that can be \nclassified as being in medical crisis because of out-of-control medical \nlitigation system.\n  For several months, as we brought a series of bills to the floor to \ntry to bring this issue to debate and to focus the attention of this \nbody on it, we have been using the number of 19 States. Now it is 20 \nStates in this great country of ours that are in medical crisis because \nof this single issue.\n  According to the AMA, access to quality health care is increasingly \nendangered. What this means is decreased access to doctors. If you need \na doctor, if you are in an automobile accident or if you are a mom or \nfuture mom and you need an obstetrician, access to care is increasingly \nendangered due to a broken medical litigation system. It is a problem \nin all States and in at least 20 it is a crisis. It is spreading across \nthe country and that is why I take this opportunity to at least mention \nit and shine a light on it once again. It is a problem, it is a growing \nproblem, and we have a responsibility to address it.\n  Three weeks ago, I had a wonderful opportunity to present what is \ncalled the Shattuck lecture before the Massachusetts Medical Society. I \nhad done my training in Massachusetts and I have tremendous respect for \nthat organization. They report that the litigation crisis has become so \nsevere in Massachusetts that numerous high-risk specialists, such as \nobstetricians, neurosurgeons or trauma surgeons, have reduced their \nscope of practice. This applies to 29 percent of general surgeons,--a \ngeneral surgeon is the one who might come to the emergency room to sew \nup your child if they have a laceration--36 percent of obstetricians, \n41 percent of orthopedic surgeons, and greater than 50 percent of all \nneurosurgeons. If you are in an accident and you are going to a \nhospital, you want a neurosurgeon there to evaluate and appropriately \ntreat.\n  Those are the percentages of those who have said they are reducing \ntheir scope of practice. In other words, if you are a neurosurgeon, you \nmight do elective cases but you might not put your name on the list to \nshow up in the middle of the night to treat somebody. Why? Because your \ninsurance would go from $100,000 to $300,000, just so you could have \nthe opportunity to come in late at night to treat somebody. That is \nabout as simple as I can say it. The problem is quality of care is \nbeing affected.\n  The facts in Massachusetts reflect a growing trend. I gestured going \nup. It should be going down, because it is almost like a downward \nspiral that is occurring over the last several weeks and months and \nyears. We have heard it again and again on the floor with anecdotes \nreinforcing what the medical societies are telling us, what hospitals \nare telling us, and what physicians are telling us, and that is that \ndoctors are leaving and narrowing the scope of their practice. They are \nleaving the opportunity to deliver babies, maybe just to do the medical \naspects of gynecologic care, or no longer taking calls in trauma \ncenters, or they are moving to less litigious States.\n  I was in Pennsylvania a few months ago. I believe 1,400 doctors in \nthe last 2 years have left the Philadelphia area and they cite the high \nmedical liability rates they are paying as the No. 1 reason they are \nforced to leave. Many doctors are retiring from practice altogether.\n  Neurosurgeons and obstetricians are being hurt the most. If you talk \nto people in the emergency room or if you have friends, nurses, or \ntechnicians there, just ask them because emergency rooms are having an \nincreasingly difficult time getting the high-risk specialists, and \nthose are the people you want if an injury occurs. If driving home \ntonight you are in an accident, you want somebody there or someone who \ncan get there very quickly. That is what is at risk.\n\n  I keep mentioning the doctors. It is not just the doctors; it is the \npatients who are ultimately hurt. The doctors probably will be OK. They \nwill move and incomes can sort of adjust. It is ultimately the patients \nwho are being hurt when health care is being threatened.\n  The good news is we know how to address the crisis. It is not just a \nproblem that is getting worse that cannot be fixed. We actually know \nhow to address the crisis. Commonsense comprehensive medical litigation \nreform, which has taken place in some States, has been proven to be \noverwhelmingly successful. It strengthens our system by addressing the \nabuses in the system. We want a strong tort system. We want to make \nsure medical malpractice is aggressively addressed. What we don't want \nare frivolous, unnecessary lawsuits that drive up the cost of health \ninsurance for the physician, but ultimately the cost of health care \nthroughout the system, and destroy the quality of the great health care \nthat we do have in this country.\n  Being a physician, obviously this is close to my heart because I see \nit and I happen to be around physicians a lot and I happen to be around \npatients a lot. I am not going to give up on this issue. We are going \nto keep bringing it back again and again until we make headway on this \nincreasing problem.\n  I don't know how many more States it will take. Massachusetts was \nadded this week. I don't know how many more States we are going to have \nto add to this medical crisis before we act.\n\n[[Page S6913]]\n\nHow many women are going to have to put up with their obstetricians \nleaving halfway through the pregnancy, either moving or dropping \nobstetrics, and having to find another obstetrician, or in rural areas \nnot being able to find an obstetrician at all?\n  So I do call on my colleagues to stand with America's patients, the \nAmerican people, and resist the powerful special interests--we know \nthey are out there today--that want no change whatsoever.\n  I am determined to press forward. We will try once again at some \npoint in the future to address this on the floor of the Senate. This is \nnot a partisan issue. It goes way beyond that. People say we have these \npartisan votes, but it is not a partisan issue. This should not be and \ncannot be a partisan issue. So let's make Massachusetts the last State \nadded to this list. Let's reduce that list. The only way we can do that \nis by acting on the floor of the Senate. Let's act now to stop the \ncrisis from spreading and let's work together to put America's patients \nfirst.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/17/senate-section/article/S6913-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6913]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I wonder if the Senator will yield for a minute? The \nSenator from Missouri, perhaps the Senator from Iowa, could they advise \nthe Senate with regard to your desire to make a change to the \namendment? Has that been completed yet?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I would advise the distinguished chairman of \nthe committee that we have made a modification on this to change the \noffset to an across-the-board reduction in the DOE appropriations. \nDiscussions are continuing with you. We would like to have the same \ntreatment for these workers as the other workers who were described in \nthe Bunning amendment.\n  This is a work in progress. We do have an across-the-board offset in \nauthorization for all DOE programs in this bill, but, obviously, we are \ngoing to have to continue to work with you and work in conference to \nmake sure this is an effective, agreeable offset.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine. I would say we will continue to work. At the \nmoment, from the managers' perspective, at least this manager would \nhave to take a close look at this.\n  I hope in a short time we could establish a time agreement so we \ncould move on with other matters.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished Senator from \nIowa.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized to offer his amendment under the previous order.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from Missouri yield for a question?\n  Mr. BOND. I am happy to yield to the distinguished minority whip.\n  Mr. REID. I am wondering if the two proponents of this legislation, \nthe Senator from Iowa and the Senator from Missouri, would give us a \ngeneral idea of how long they will speak on this?\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I believe we can have the discussions on the \nsubstance of amendment No. 3384 as we work with the managers on both \nsides and perhaps the Finance Committee to make sure we have the \nappropriate offset.\n  The amendment I wish to address, and I know Senator Harkin and \nSenator Talent will address it, is the Energy Workers Special Exposure \nCohort Designation Act of 2004, which I will be offering on behalf of \nmyself, Senator Harkin, and Senator Talent.\n  It will designate former nuclear production facilities in Missouri \nand Iowa as special exposure cohorts under the Energy Employees \nOccupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000. This was a very \ncompassionate act designed to provide lump sum payments of $150,000 to \npeople who had worked in the nuclear weapons production program from \n1942 to 1967--way before we understood the dangers of radiation--and \nwho suffered very high levels of radiation and have now been diagnosed, \nsuffered, and many have died from multiple cases of cancer.\n  This problem was brought to my attention by Denise Brock, whose \nfather had died while waiting for the bureaucracy to work through the \nsteps set up under the program to qualify for that particular $150,000 \ncompensation.\n  There are a very convoluted set of steps that have to be followed \nunless you are in a special cohort. There were four States that were \ndesignated as having needs that automatically qualified these workers.\n  We have found upon research that the exposure to the workers in \nMissouri was in many instances the highest exposure in any place. My \ncolleague and I have met with those workers. Eight workers came into my \noffice with Ms. Brock last spring, in May. Since then, three of them \nhave died. They had multiple cancers. A brave fellow that I met when I \nmet with the group in St. Charles County several months ago, Jim \nMitalski, wheelchair-bound because cancer was in his right foot, had at \nleast three other cancers. I am sad to say he slipped into a coma \nyesterday. His doctors suggest this may be his final coma. He has not \nbeen compensated.\n  The Mallinkrodt workers, who worked at the St. Louis downtown site \nfrom 1942 to 1958 and moved out to the Weldon Springs facility in St. \nCharles County, which operated until 1967, were exposed to levels of \nradionuclides and radioactive materials that were much greater than the \ncurrent maximum allowable Federal standards. Many workers were exposed \nto 200 times the recommended levels of maximum exposure.\n  The chief safety officer for the Atomic Energy Commission during the \nMallinkrodt St. Louis operations described that as one of the two worst \nplants with respect to worker exposures. Workers were excreting in \nexcess of a milligram of uranium per day, which caused kidney damage.\n  A recent epidemiological survey found excess levels of nephritis \nkidney cancer from inhalation of uranium dust.\n  The Department of Energy has admitted that those Mallinkrodt workers \nwere subjected to risks and had their health endangered as a result of \nworking with these highly radioactive materials.\n  The Department of Energy reported that workers at the Weldon Springs \nfeed materials plant handled plutonium and recycled uranium which were \nhighly radioactive. NIOSH admits that the operation at the St. Louis \ndowntown site consisted of intense periods of processing extremely high \nlevels of radionuclides. The institute has virtually no personnel \nmonitoring data for Mallinkrodt workers which would be necessary for \nthem to reconstruct the dosages to make them qualify under the act. \nUnder these circumstances, I believe simple justice and equity demands \nthat we provide assistance for these severely ill workers and for their \nsurviving families.\n\n[[Page S6914]]\n\n  This amendment would add the Mallinkrodt facilities, along with the \nIowa Army Ammunition Plant, to the four existing special exposure \ncohort sites. These are sites where a group of employees with specific \ncancers who worked at specific nuclear facilities or participated under \ncertain nuclear weapons tests and met other requirements are eligible \nfor expedited compensation. This special exposure cohort designation \nwould make the workers at these Missouri and Iowa sites eligible for \nthe expedited compensation as opposed to requiring them to participate \nin the long, complex, and cumbersome bureaucratic process known as \n``dose reconstruction.'' They are faced with a situation where the \nbureaucrats are asking them to go back and help them reconstruct the \ndosages over 50 years ago--or more. They have no records. They are very \nsick people. They are dying of multiple cancers, the kinds of cancers \nand other problems caused by exposure to radioactivity. It is not \nfeasible for them to go back and reconstruct. Without the records, we \nknow that these people are seriously ill and are afflicted with all \nkinds of cancers. We, therefore, ask our colleagues if they will accept \nthe amendment as we work to modify the offset.\n  The total cost over 10 years for the people who worked in the \nMissouri and Iowa sites is expected to be $180 million. That is over 10 \nyears. Given the fact that these people are suffering from very serious \ncancers, I hope my colleagues will join Senator Harkin, Senator Talent, \nand me in saying these people badly need the assistance this \ndesignation will provide them.\n  I will withhold submitting the amendment until we have further \ndiscussions with the managers to ascertain their desires and the \nappropriate offset. But offset or no, let me reemphasize to my \ncolleagues that $180 million for people who are suffering mightily from \nmultiple cancers is the least we can do to take care of the brave \natomic workers who helped us develop the weapons that ended World War \nII and who are now paying every day with the suffering from the \nexposure to that radioactivity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. TALENT. Madam President, I rise today in support of the Bond-\nHarkin amendment. I am going to be brief because I think my colleague \nfrom Missouri has covered the ground. I imagine the Senator from Iowa \nwill wish to speak further.\n  I want to begin by recognizing the work they have both put into this \namendment. My friend from Missouri has been a tiger in support of \ncompensation for these employees. He was moved--as I was moved and as \nthe Senator from Iowa was moved--by the unique claim these individuals \nhave on justice. This is not some kind of giveaway, but it is just \ncompensation that is owed to them for the sacrifices they made on \nbehalf of this country. That is really what this amounts to.\n  I was pleased to cosponsor this amendment. I am grateful to the \nSenator from Virginia and the Senator from Michigan for their attempts \nto work this out. I hope we can do that. I know they want to. I know \nthey recognize the justice of the claims.\n  We certainly understand the importance of doing this the right way. I \njust hope we can do this. At the end of the day, if we have to put it \nin without all of the t's crossed and the i's dotted and work on it in \nconference, I hope we can do that because we will have other \nopportunities further down the road in the Defense bill to tie up any \nloose ends which may exist. Certainly the Senators from Missouri and \nIowa have worked in good faith, as I have, in trying to make this \nacceptable to the managers of the bill.\n  In Missouri, an estimated 3,500 people worked at sites which handled \nand processed highly radioactive material. These workers were exposed--\nand in most instances unknowingly--to dangerous levels of radiation. It \nis not necessarily important to blame people for that. Those were in \nmany cases the early years of nuclear work and people just didn't know, \nand it was necessary to do this work. That is why, without trying to \npoint fingers, Congress created the Energy Employees Occupational \nIllness Compensation Program Act--EEOICPA--of 2000, which was designed \nto provide these employees with the compensation they deserve.\n  Unfortunately, the process, as any of us know who sit on the Armed \nServices Committee or on the Energy Committee--both of which I sit on--\nis complex, it is disjointed, and in many cases outright mishandled. As \na result, in Missouri, hundreds of claims have been filed by surviving \nindividuals who have received not only no compensation but no progress \nin the processing of their claims. In many cases those individuals \nfaced 200 times the dosage of radiation that would be considered \nacceptable today. We know that happened because we know the nature of \nthe processes in which they were working, and we can see the illnesses \nthey now have.\n  That doesn't mean they can go back and reconstruct from worksheets \nthat no longer exist--and which they wouldn't have access to anyway--\nexactly what happened on a given day 50 or 60 years ago, which is the \nreason Senator Bond explained so lucidly we need a special exposure \ncohort, or an SEC, to expedite compensation for these employees. The \namendment would simply allow these employees to be included in an SEC. \nThey already exist for employees in other States.\n  An SEC is a group of employees with specific cancers who worked at \nspecific nuclear facilities or who meet other requirements under the \nact. The designation would provide former employees at the site with \nexpedited compensation for going through the lengthy and oftentimes \nimpossible process of dose reconstruction.\n  I could go on. I know the bill handlers want to get the bill \nfinished. The program so far has one of the most abysmal records of \nperformance which I have witnessed in my now 10 years in the Congress \non one side of the Capitol or the other. As the Department of Energy \nand the Department of Labor create bureaucratic paperwork burdens for \nsick former employees, this amendment, which would remove the barrier \nof dose reconstruction for those cases, is a small step forward toward \ngiving them the justice which they so clearly deserve.\n  I believe workers in Missouri and Iowa ought to qualify for inclusion \nin the SEC.\n  It is a pleasure for me to cosponsor this amendment. I hope we can \nwork out the issues that remain surrounding it and get it included in \nthe bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, my colleague, Senator Bond from \nMissouri, and I are on the floor today to basically work with the \ncommittee to do the right thing. We are here to simply add former \natomic workers, nuclear workers, who worked in our ammunition plants in \nMissouri and Iowa, to a group of workers who are already eligible for \nspecial compensation.\n  This category is already in effect for workers from Kentucky, Ohio, \nAlaska, and Tennessee. But since the original legislation was passed in \n2000, we have learned a great deal more about the facilities in Iowa \nand Missouri which makes it necessary to include these workers as well.\n  I spoke at length on this issue yesterday on the floor. I will not go \nover those again. I want to make a couple of brief points today.\n  In Iowa, between 1947 and 1975, almost 4,000 people were employed \nhandling nuclear weapons. So great was the secrecy that 5 and a half \nyears later we still don't know exactly to what the workers were \nexposed.\n  At the time the bill passed in 2000, Congress recognized that there \nwere likely to be more situations where it was simply not feasible to \nreconstruct workers' doses because the records don't exist, or they are \ninadequate, because it might take so long to reconstruct a dose for a \ngroup of workers that they would all be dead before we would have an \nanswer to determine their eligibility. That is precisely the situation \nwe find ourselves in in Iowa, and the workers also find themselves in \nin Missouri.\n  Speaking just about the Iowa facility, the Army ammunition facility \nin\n\n[[Page S6915]]\n\nBurlington was in operation from 1947 to 1975. The people who worked \nthere and who are still alive today are elderly. Many are sick and many \nhave cancers. They are ill and they are dying. Yet almost 4 years into \nthis program, only 38 Iowans have received compensation. That is \nbecause after 3 years of hard work by researchers at the University of \nIowa, and at the same time by the National Institute of Occupational \nSafety and Health, we have learned that Iowa has the worst records \ndocumenting worker exposure to radioactivity of any facility in the \ncountry. Without good documents, you simply cannot do good dose \nreconstruction.\n  When Congress passed this law, they explicitly said workers could be \nadded to a cohort when the records didn't exist to make it feasible to \ndo dose reconstruction. Now, NIOSH has concluded that there are no \nrecords anywhere that document the level of internal radiation \nexposures to which workers at the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant were \nexposed. None, no records.\n  With regard to external doses, up until 1968, the highest percent of \nthe DOE employees who were monitored was 7 percent, or 23 workers out \nof a workforce of 800.\n  It is time to admit that both in Iowa and Missouri we have two sites \nwhere it simply is not possible to perform dose reconstruction. The \nGovernment simply doesn't know what went on at these facilities and to \nwhat the workers were exposed. That makes it impossible to do timely \ndose reconstruction.\n\n  Some may say the law provides for people to be added to a cohort \nadministratively. Well, 10 days ago, after 3\\1/2\\ years of waiting, the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services issued a rule setting out the \nprocedure. This only occurred as a result of congressional pressure. \nThe process set out under the rule is likely to take several more years \nbecause there are no statutory deadlines that must be met.\n  So the workers who worked there, who had high exposure to radioactive \nmaterials, who are sick and many have had multiple cancers, quite \nfrankly, cannot wait any longer.\n  We took an important step in fixing about half of this program \nyesterday with the Bunning amendment. Now it is time to finish the job \nand give the workers in Iowa and Missouri the same ability to be \ncompensated as those workers in Kentucky, Ohio, Alaska, and Tennessee.\n  Again, my colleague from Missouri has an amendment now that is being \nworked out. We hope it is going to be accepted once all of the T's are \ncrossed and I's are dotted. Basically, it is an equity argument to make \nsure these workers will be treated fairly and in the same manner as \nworkers who were exposed in other places.\n  I have met with these workers, as Senator Bond has, and it just tears \nyour heart out. These were patriotic individuals. I have talked to some \nof them who told me they were told what they did was top secret and \nthey could not discuss it with anybody, not even their doctors. So \nyears later, because they were patriotic, hard-working Americans, they \nnever told anyone about the kind of work they did. In fact, I had to \nwork with some of my colleagues a few years ago to get the Department \nof Defense to get them a written document that said it is OK for them \nnow to talk about what they did. So, as a result of that, we are now \ngetting a clearer picture of the kind of work these individuals did. \nThey handled highly radioactive materials. Many times, they did not \neven wear dose badges. They had no idea what they were handling. When \nyou listen to workers talk about how, when they worked, certain things \nwould happen to them, such as the hairs on their arms and legs would \nstand up when they were getting near this material, they had no idea \nwhat it was.\n  Sadly, many of them have already died. Sadly, many of them died at an \nearly age and they left young children. Some of their kids who are \nalive today tell me about how their father died and how they had all \nthese illnesses and sores and cancers. Many died when they were in \ntheir forties or early fifties. They had no idea it was because of the \nradiation exposure they had when they worked in those plants.\n  I think it is time for us to do this, acknowledge their patriotic \nservice, the work they did, the dangers they were exposed to and were \nnever really told about. What Senator Bond and I are seeking to do is \nsimply make this equitable. There is no reason why his workers in \nMissouri, or mine in Iowa, should be treated any differently than those \nin the four States I mentioned. I believe those in the four States \nshould be compensated, too, and they have been. We thought ours were \ngoing to be compensated, but in the intervening 4 years, we found out \nthat no records exist. So they cannot do the dose reconstruction. They \nhave tried to get around it, but they cannot. So we are left on the \nfloor of the Senate to make this equity argument in the hope the Senate \nwill concur and allow us to move ahead in a way that, hopefully, before \nthe year is out, we will be able to include these workers in this \nspecial cohort that will allow them to be compensated out of a fund \nthat was established 4 years ago to compensate these workers. The fund \nstill has, as I am told, plenty of money in it. So we are not actually \nspending any new money. We are simply adding some people to the fund to \nbe compensated.\n  I am hopeful we can get this all worked out and that we can accept \nthis amendment and move ahead to adequately compensate and acknowledge \nthe work these people did, at least in Iowa and Missouri. I thank my \ncolleague, Senator Bond, for his leadership on this issue. I thank \nSenator Talent for his comments earlier.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I will be back when we have \nthe amendment fully ready.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3427, As Modified\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 3427 and ask \nunanimous consent to have the amendment, which is at the desk, \nmodified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Reserving the right to object, and I do not intend to \nobject, I think the managers are doing our very best to move along this \nmorning. We have had a number of unexpected switches by a number of \nSenators who start amendments and stop them for various reasons. We are \nprepared now to go ahead with the amendment of the Senator from \nWashington. But I say to our colleagues, when they have informed the \nmanagers they are prepared to go ahead, and then abruptly have to stop, \nit makes it increasingly difficult for us to work on this bill.\n  I thank the Democratic whip. He has been most helpful. We have lost a \nlot of time this morning due to unexpected decisions.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, if the Senator will yield, we on this side \ncertainly understand the travails of the managers of this bill. Several \ndays ago, we had written on our sheet ``voice vote.'' We thought the \namendment of the Senator from Washington had been accepted. There were \nmiscommuni- cations and, of course, that happens. It is certainly no \nfault of the Senator from Washington. She was ready several days ago, \nand we told her not to push it because we thought it would be accepted.\n  Mr. WARNER. We will proceed with the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3427, as modified.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To facilitate the availability of child care for the children \n   of members of the Armed Forces on active duty in connection with \n         Operation Enduring Freedom or Operation Iraqi Freedom)\n\n       At the end of subtitle E of title VI, add the following:\n\n[[Page S6916]]\n\n     SEC. 653. CHILD CARE FOR CHILDREN OF MEMBERS OF ARMED FORCES \n                   ON ACTIVE DUTY FOR OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM \n                   OR OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM.\n\n       (a) Child Care for Children Without Access to Military \n     Child Care.--(1) In any case where the children of a covered \n     member of the Armed Forces are geographically dispersed and \n     do not have practical access to a military child development \n     center, the Secretary of Defense may, to the extent funds are \n     available for such purpose, provide such funds as are \n     necessary permit the member's family to secure access for \n     such children to State licensed child care and development \n     programs and activities in the private sector that are \n     similar in scope and quality to the child care and \n     development programs and activities the Secretary would \n     otherwise provide access to under subchapter II of chapter 88 \n     of title 10, United States Code, and other applicable \n     provisions of law.\n       (2) Funds may be provided under paragraph (1) in accordance \n     with the provisions of section 1798 of title 10, United \n     States Code, or by such other mechanism as the Secretary \n     considers appropriate.\n       (3) The Secretary shall prescribe in regulations priorities \n     for the allocation of funds for the provision of access to \n     child care under paragraph (1) in circumstances where funds \n     are inadequate to provide all children described in that \n     paragraph with access to child care as described in that \n     paragraph.\n       (b) Preservation of Services and Programs.--The Secretary \n     shall provide for the attendance and participation of \n     children in military child development centers and child care \n     and development programs and activities under subsection (a) \n     in a manner that preserves the scope and quality of child \n     care and development programs and activities otherwise \n     provided by the Secretary.\n       (c) Funding.--Amounts otherwise available to the Department \n     of Defense and the military departments under this Act may be \n     available for purposes of providing access to child care \n     under subsection (a).\n       (d) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) The term ``covered members of the Armed Forces'' means \n     members of the Armed Forces on active duty, including members \n     of the Reserves who are called or ordered to active duty \n     under a provision of law referred to in section 101(a)(13)(B) \n     of title 10, United States Code, for Operation Enduring \n     Freedom or Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n       (2) The term ``military child development center'' has the \n     meaning given such term in section 1800(1) of title 10, \n     United States Code.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, as my colleagues know, I have been \nworking for several months on proposals to help ease the burden on \nGuard and Reserve families who have a loved one serving our country. \nToday, I am offering an amendment to help families get childcare so a \nparent can go back to work while their spouse is deployed overseas.\n  This amendment applies to activated only, and it is discretionary. I \nwant to make sure that is clear. I think there was a misunderstanding \nwith regard to that issue. It is for activated soldiers, and it is \ndiscretionary. This will help relieve the childcare squeeze that is \nhurting so many families who are silently sacrificing for all of us.\n  Hopefully, with the success of this amendment, the Senate will then \nhave adopted several proposals to help our Guard and Reserve families \nget health care through TRICARE, pay for their equipment, help them \nstay on their payrolls through employer tax credits, and, today, with a \ncritical piece on childcare.\n  Each one of these steps is part of the much larger effort to help \nease the burden on families who are trying so hard to make ends meet \nwhile their spouse serves our country overseas.\n  Six months ago, on January 9, I sat down with members of the Guard's \n81st Armored Brigade and their families at Camp Murray in Fort Lewis, \nWA, and at that meeting Guard and Reserve members told me about the \ntremendous challenges their spouse and their children would face once \nthey were deployed.\n  I could see how worried and concerned they were that they would not \nhave time to get their families on sound footing with a job, with \nchildcare, and with health care before they deployed to Iraq. I \nlistened closely to all of their concerns, and I spent several weeks \ncrafting a bill to address a number of those issues.\n  On February 12, I introduced S. 2068, the Guard and Reserve Enhanced \nBenefit Act. That is a comprehensive bill that will minimize the \nchallenges at home when these brave men and women leave their jobs, \nleave their schools, and leave their families to protect our homeland \nand fight terrorism.\n  Since that meeting back in January, many of the Guard and Reserve \nmembers with whom I met have now been deployed to Iraq. Currently, more \nthan 5,400 brave Washington National Guard and Reserve soldiers have \nbeen activated, including 3,200 members of the 81st Armored Brigade who \nare serving in Iraq today. They are part of the more than 168,000 Guard \nand Reserve troops who have been called to active duty from States \naround the country.\n  Our Washington Guard and Reserve troops are among the more than \n22,000 total troops from Washington State who are supporting Operation \nIraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom.\n  As I have talked with family members since the deployment, I have \nlearned a lot about the tremendous challenges they are facing. Today, I \nwant to report back to them on the steps we have taken in the Senate to \nhelp ease their burden.\n  I am proud that in the past month, the Senate has delivered on three \nof those challenges I outlined in my bill back in February. The first \none we delivered on was health care. My bill proposed providing access \nto TRICARE for all members of the Guard and Reserve, and their \nfamilies, regardless of their employment or insurance status. That is \nan issue that Senators Daschle, Reid, Graham, and others have been \nworking very hard on over the years. I was a cosponsor of that TRICARE \namendment. I voted for it on June 2, and I am very pleased that it \npassed the full Senate.\n  Now we need the House of Representatives to agree that our citizen \nsoldiers and their families deserve health care.\n  Secondly, we made progress on another challenge: the strains facing \nthose who employ Guard and Reserve members. My bill offered tax credits \nto employers to encourage their support of activated Guard and Reserve. \nIt is something that Senator Kerry and Senator Landrieu have worked on. \nI was the original cosponsor of an amendment to provide a tax credit to \nemployers who continue to pay active Reserve and Guard employees, and \nthat passed the Senate with my support on May 11.\n  Third, we have provided help for soldiers and families who had to \nprovide equipment because the military did not provide it to them in a \ntimely fashion. Back on October 17, on the Senate floor, I told the \nstory of SPL Ian Willet, who was deployed to Iraq on his 21st birthday \nlast September. His father David wrote to me and told me that Ian and \nhis family will have to buy equipment that the military should have \nprovided.\n\n  This week in the Senate we did the right thing for soldiers such as \nSPL Ian Willet and his family. On Monday, I voted for an amendment \ndirecting the Secretary of Defense to provide reimbursement to soldiers \nwho face this hardship. I was proud to be a cosponsor of the Dodd \namendment that passed this body by an overwhelming margin.\n  Today, the Senate has the opportunity to pass the Murray childcare \namendment, and that will be another important and critical step forward \nfor families who are sacrificing for all of us.\n  I have raised these issues time and again on the Senate floor because \nI believe if the American people are told about the silent sacrifices \nthat so many families are making, they will demand that we do more.\n  President Bush is visiting Fort Lewis in my State tomorrow, and I \nhope during his visit he shines a bright light on the sacrifices that \nfamilies are making while their loved ones serve our country overseas. \nI think it is critical that he hears directly from these families, as I \nhave, about the burdens our Guard and Reserve are facing today. It is \nimportant that he support the steps we have taken in the Senate to help \nthose families with health care, payroll, equipment, and, today, \nchildcare. I hope the President will make it clear to those in the \nHouse of Representatives that the support we provided in the Senate \ncannot be removed from the Defense bill in the dark of night.\n  One critical support we need to take care of is this amendment on \nchildcare that I am offering today. I offer this amendment in honor of \nall the Guard and Reserve troops who are sacrificing for us overseas, \nand I offer this amendment in honor of their spouses and their children \nwho are sacrificing so much for us at home.\n  Let me explain why childcare is such a challenge for many of our \nmilitary families. Often when a member of the Guard or Reserve is \ndeployed overseas,\n\n[[Page S6917]]\n\nthe remaining spouse has to go to work to support the family and to \nmake up for the income their spouse has given up because of their \nmilitary service. Unfortunately today, as we all know, high-quality \nchildcare is very expensive and often out of reach of a single parent.\n  In addition, many Guard and Reserve families do not live anywhere \nnear a military installation, so they cannot use the services that are \navailable.\n  I will tell my colleagues about a Washington wife and a mother whose \nlife was turned upside down when her husband was called to active duty. \nDanielle and Jack Lucas have three children. They worked opposite \nshifts to avoid the cost of daycare. In February, Jack was told to \nreport to the 81st Armored Brigade at Fort Lewis. Danielle scrambled to \nfigure out how to keep her job and care for her children, including a \nnewborn. Unfortunately, as so many of us find, the cost of daycare was \nprohibitive and she was forced to quit her job, after 10 years of work, \nwhen her husband was deployed.\n  Jack's monthly military pay was $1,000 less than his civilian job. So \nwhen it became impossible to make ends meet, Danielle moved to another \npart of my State where rent was less expensive. She has now gone back \nto work, but the cost of daycare is still not affordable. She juggles \ntoday with help from her family and her friends to watch her three \nchildren, and she often has as many as three different people watching \nher children in one 8-hour period.\n\n  While SPL Jack Lucas is taking the same risks as all Active-Duty \nsoldiers in Iraq, his family has faced emotional and financial turmoil \nthat will be alleviated with the Murray amendment. We cannot continue \nto ignore the needs of our Guard and Reserve families.\n  Unfortunately, Danielle's situation is not an isolated case. When MAJ \nJake Callahan was called back to duty, his wife Kathleen and two small \nchildren were suddenly faced with a childcare dilemma. Kathleen's job \nrequires her to travel and attend work events on weekends and evenings, \nbut her son has special needs, and the cost of childcare is financially \nout of the question. Kathleen struggles with the stress of abandoning \nher career now or continuing to rely heavily on her family for \nchildcare.\n  Kathleen is not alone. Lisa Palmer made the difficult decision to \nquit her job as a registered nurse when her husband was deployed to \nIraq with the 81st Armored Brigade. After her husband was deployed, her \ntwo sons began experiencing severe emotional problems due to their \nfather's departure. Lisa believed it was important for one parent to be \nat home to help her sons through these challenges. Her son's \ndepression, his nightmares, his overwhelming sadness require constant \nassurance and support by her. Lisa has now started to work part time at \nthe hospital to help lessen the tremendous financial strain of their \ngreatly reduced family income. However, like Danielle and Kathleen, \nLisa is only able to do so by leaning heavily on her family and friends \nto provide childcare.\n  All three of these women tell me they honestly do not know how they \nare going to make it through until their husbands return home. The \ncurrent support system for our deployed and activated Guard and Reserve \nfamilies is broken. We need a fix to keep our families strong while \ntheir spouses serve our Nation. Unless we soften the tremendous burdens \nthey face, we may have trouble retaining the soldiers we have and \nrecruiting the new soldiers we need.\n  This amendment is about easing the burden on those who serve us \ntoday, recognizing that we ask more of them so we need to provide them \nwith more support, ensuring that we can recruit and retain our Guard \nand Reserve members for our future security.\n  I have heard some of my colleagues argue that some of these Guard and \nReserve proposals are too expensive. We may hear that claim again \ntoday. But I think we need to look at the costs of abandoning these \nfamilies who are serving. We need to look at how much pain it causes \nthem. I have talked with these families. They are trying to serve our \ncountry honorably, but they cannot do it when they are so worried about \nhow they are going to keep their children safe and secure while they \nwork to keep their families financially capable. We need to look at how \nthis issue threatens our ability to recruit and retain the voluntary \nmilitary we need to protect us.\n  We are spending $5 billion a month on the war in Iraq, and virtually \nall of this spending goes right to the deficit that our grandchildren \nare going to inherit. Supporting our Guard and Reserve families is not \ncheap but we need to do it if we still want to have a Guard and Reserve \nsystem after all of these long, extended deployments. These families \nare part of our war effort. They are part of the war on terrorism. They \nare part of the war in Iraq. They are part of our homeland security \nefforts.\n  All of our military families are sacrificing today. Our Guard and \nReserve troops are doing the right thing. They are meeting their \nobligations. They are protecting our people and they are serving our \ncountry with honor.\n  We have to acknowledge that our unprecedented deployment of Guard and \nReserve Forces is creating tremendous new hardships that we have not \nhad to deal with before. The amendment before the Senate now gives us \nthe opportunity to do the right thing for these families and for the \nloved ones who are serving. We are asking so much of our Guard and \nReserve members and their families. We have an obligation to make it \neasier for their spouses and their children during these long \ndeployments.\n  The Murray childcare amendment and the other steps we have taken tell \nour Guard and Reserve soldiers that they can serve our country \noverseas, even on long deployments, and know their families will be \nfinancially secure and they will be able to get childcare and health \ncare.\n  So my message to our Guard and Reserve families is: We gave you \naccess to health care through TRICARE. We made sure you were reimbursed \nif you had to buy protective equipment. We made sure employers can \ncontinue to keep your loved ones on the payroll by providing employer \ntax credits. Today, this body will assure you that you have an ease of \nmind when it comes to your children that you left behind, that they \nhave the childcare that is so critical to the well-being of your \nfamily.\n  We made progress. We have much more to do. We need to keep the \npressure on to make sure when we get to conference behind closed doors \nthese measures are not lost.\n  There are several other elements of my original comprehensive bill \nthat have not been addressed yet, but today I think it is extremely \nimportant that we adopt this amendment.\n  The DOD is supportive of this amendment. It is for our activated \nsoldiers. I urge the Senate to adopt this amendment today. I hope we \ncan do it efficiently and quickly because I think we will send a strong \nmessage to those who are serving us so honorably overseas today.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I commend our colleague. This is a subject \nthat certainly will be approached in a very bipartisan way.\n  I am wondering, do we have any procedural requirement on that family \nwho needs childcare, to express some sort of need for it before it is \nautomatically granted? Would the Secretary adopt regulations? I just \nask the distinguished Presiding Officer if I may enter into a colloquy \nwith our distinguished colleague on that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, this would allow the DOD Secretary of \nDefense to promulgate the process for the families to go through. It \nwould be discretionary for him.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is very helpful.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield for a question on that point?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, of course.\n  Mr. LEVIN. In the form of a question to the Senator from Washington, \nwhose amendment fills in such a gap and really meets such an incredibly \nimportant need for childcare, but is it not true that in section \n(a)(3), the bottom of page 2, you do provide specifically:\n\n       The Secretary shall prescribe in regulations priorities for \n     the allocation of funds for provision of access to child \n     care. . . .\n\n  So the amendment itself does provide for those regulations to be \nadopted by the Secretary of Defense?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator is absolutely correct. I think it is also \nimportant to point out there is no direct\n\n[[Page S6918]]\n\nspending. It simply authorizes the Secretary of Defense to help \ngeographically dispersed Active-Duty military families.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank our colleague. I asked the question so as to make \nit a part of the record of the proceedings today. So often when \nCongress acts on an amendment such as this, which is so important to so \nmany families, they suddenly hear from Washington, ``You got \nchildcare.'' But I think we better put in a caution: Yes, childcare \nhopefully will be made available, but there has to be some showing of a \nrequirement. Because it is my understanding the Department of Defense \nnow has a number of childcare centers here in the Greater Washington \narea. Frankly, the adequacy is questionable. Some families do not have \naccess to them. But those families, I point out, might not be able to \nmeet the criteria in the opening section 1:\n\n       In any case where the children of a covered member of the \n     Armed Forces are geographically dispersed. . . .\n\n  Those families theoretically are not geographically dispersed, but \nthey are caught in between the class that you are establishing and \nthose who are near a major military installation here in Washington, \nyet there are inadequate childcare facilities.\n  Those are the types of things that are going to have to be worked out \nshould this become law.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, there is no doubt the childcare is an \nissue that is very difficult for many families, and to provide all this \nsupport for every family is something that will be extremely difficult. \nWe all acknowledge that. But there is a specific group of families \nserving us overseas today in Iraq and Afghanistan who are absolutely \nexcluded from any help whatsoever. My amendment assures that they are \nnot excluded.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine. We definitely want to care for those. Those \nfamilies who are not serving overseas yet have been pulled up abruptly \nfrom Reserve or Guard status, yet where the husband or the wife--\nwhichever the case the uniform may be worn--is not deployed overseas, \nthey may have a critical problem, too.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The amendment before us is in support of all activated \npersonnel.\n  Mr. WARNER. You make reference to those families overseas repeatedly. \nI just want to make sure about some of those at home.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine. On the basis of that, we are prepared to accept the \namendment on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me first commend the Senator from \nWashington. She has been tenacious, absolutely determined to provide \nchildcare for military personnel. She has devised this amendment to \ntake care of the ones who are currently employed in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, because their families surely are the ones who, first and \nforemost, we have to try to take care of, where they have no other \nalternative on base because they are geographically dispersed.\n  This amendment provides funds for childcare for members of the Armed \nForces who do not have access to military childcare programs because \nthey are geographically dispersed and there is no military childcare \nprogram available to them. These will mainly be Guard and Reserve \npeople but not exclusively. There may be families of Active-Duty people \nwho are normally on active duty, who because their loved one is now in \nIraq or Afghanistan, for instance, take the family back home and who \nalso will have access to childcare because of this amendment.\n  It is discretionary spending. I note the Department of Defense \nsupports this amendment. It seems to me the fact that the Senator from \nWashington was able to work with the Department of Defense to actually \nobtain their support for her amendment is a notable success for which \nshe is entitled to the commendation of this body and the thanks of this \nNation.\n  I hope this amendment will be adopted by the Senate. I do not know if \na rollcall is necessary. If it is, I hope we strongly support this \namendment, and I commend Senator Murray for her tenacity and for the \nsensitivity which she shows in so many issues, but in this case on the \nchildcare needs of this country.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have indicated that colleagues on this \nside of the aisle are very anxious to work to make this childcare \navailable subject to the availability of funds, as the amendment \nstates. We are prepared to move on, make it totally bipartisan, and \nvoice-vote this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, without objection the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3427) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we are prepared to proceed with the \namendment on important aspects of missile defense by our colleague from \nCalifornia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3368\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3368.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3368.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To allow deployment of the ground-based midcourse defense \nelement of the national ballistic missile defense system only after the \n   mission-related capabilities of the system have been confirmed by \n                    operationally realistic testing)\n\n       On page 33, after line 25, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 224. LIMITATION ON DEPLOYMENT OF GROUND-BASED MIDCOURSE \n                   DEFENSE ELEMENT OF THE NATIONAL BALLISTIC \n                   MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM.\n\n       The ground-based midcourse defense element of the national \n     ballistic missile defense system may not be deployed for \n     initial defensive operations before the Secretary of Defense \n     certifies to Congress that the capabilities of the system to \n     perform its national ballistic missile defense missions have \n     been confirmed by operationally realistic testing of the \n     system.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we are going to face a series of \namendments on the missile defense system, and I believe I have an \namendment which I am surprised we even have to have a long debate about \nbecause it is so straightforward. It says let us not spend the money to \ndeploy the system until it has been tested and until it has been \ncertified as passing those tests by the one office that has the \ncapability of doing it, which is the Office of Director of Operational \nTest and Evaluation.\n  We want to ensure that the ballistic missile defense system the \nPresident plans to deploy later this year has passed these tests.\n  In 1983, Congress created the Office of the Director of Operational \nTest and Evaluation--DOT It is now headed by Mr. Thomas Christie.\n  The Office of DOT was created under the ``fly before you buy'' law. \n``Fly before you buy'' makes a lot of sense for our taxpayers. Frankly, \nwhen it comes to defending our country, my goodness, how much more \nimportant can it be before we tell our people they are protected that \nwe actually know they are protected and that the tests which have been \ndone have been signed off on by the very office that has been created \nfor that purpose?\n  The office oversees the operational testing programs of all major \nmilitary systems. Operational testing is intended to be as realistic as \npossible. This includes testing at night, testing in bad weather, using \nsoldiers rather than contractors who have a special interest in the \noutcome of the test, and using expected enemy countermeasures.\n  Let me repeat that. In order to have operational tests that you can \ntrust, the testing has to be done under realistic circumstances. We \ndon't know if our enemy is going to attack us on a beautiful, clear day \nwith the wind blowing at a certain rate. The fact is, we need to test \nunder the harshest conditions so that we know what we are deploying \nworks. It must be a realistic test. Most importantly, the tests must be \nconducted by the Office of DOT\n\n[[Page S6919]]\n\nthe program that is developing the weapons system.\n  I am sure you are going to hear people stand up and fight against \nthis amendment.\n  I have to tell you that if you really look at the facts, they do not \nhave them on this side. If I were to ask one of my constituents, who \nknew nothing about this at all, who they would rather have testing our \nmilitary systems to make sure they work, the contractor, who has an \neconomic interest in it; the program director, who has an economic \ninterest in getting the program funded; or basically an independent \noffice that was set up by Congress, the Office of Director of \nOperational Test and Evaluation, I think the answer would be clear. \nPeople would want an objective test.\n  My amendment requires that the Secretary of Defense confirm that the \nground-based, midcourse missile defense system has passed these \noperational tests prior to deployment for initial defensive operations. \nIt is very simple--fly before you buy, test before you deploy, common \nsense, following the wishes of Congress that knew this was a problem \nwhen we set up that office.\n  Here is why it is important. This amendment is important because the \ncurrent plan of the Missile Defense Agency does not include any \noperational testing at any time in the foreseeable future.\n  Let me say that again. The current plan of the Missile Defense Agency \ndoes not include any operational testing at any time in the foreseeable \nfuture. And this statement I just made has been confirmed by the Office \nof Director of Operational Test and Evaluation.\n\n  Imagine: We are about to spend $10 billion on this program. It is the \nbiggest program in the defense budget, as I understand it, and we are \ngoing to deploy without operational testing.\n  On December 17, 2002, President Bush announced that the United States \nwill declare a midcourse ballistic missile defense system ready for \ndefense operations at the end of the year. That is interesting. He \ndeclared and announced that we would be ready to deploy before the \nsystem was tested. He should say: Assuming it passes the tests by the \nappropriate evaluation agency, which is DOT But he didn't say that. \nThe Pentagon's current plan is to deploy the first interceptor missile \nin late July, and before the system becomes operational by the end of \nSeptember when five interceptors are in place at Fort Greeley, AK. The \nMissile Defense Agency hopes to have a total of 10 interceptor missiles \nin place by the end of January 5 at both Fort Greeley and Vandenberg \nAir Force Base in California.\n  They are moving ahead without any operational testing done by the \noffice that was created to do this.\n  This plan that I described to you, known as Block 2004, will \neventually result in the deployment of 20 missile interceptors by the \nend of next year.\n  There is a serious problem here. We have no way of knowing that these \ninterceptor missiles will actually be able to protect us from an \nincoming ballistic missile attack. The system President Bush is \ndeploying has been tested eight times--not by the Director of the \nOffice of Operational Test and Evaluation, it has been tested by the \nDOD. The contractor was involved in those tests, and the program \ndirector was involved in those tests of the Missile Defense Agency, but \nnot the office that has been created to be the objective tester. The \ntests were conducted, again, by the Pentagon's Missile Defense Agency \nin cooperation with the contractor--not the DOT\n  These tests were highly scripted. They occurred in an unrealistic \ntest environment, and only five of the eight were successful.\n  Here is the GAO report.\n  The date is April of 2004. This is a relatively new report. In this \nreport, the GAO criticizes the administration's plan, saying:\n\n       as a result of testing shortfalls and the limited time \n     available to test the BMDS [Ballistic Missile Defense System] \n     being fielded, system effectiveness will be largely unproven \n     when the initial capability goes on alert at the end of \n     September 2004.\n\n  That is when the initial five missiles will be deployed.\n  This report from the General Accounting Office, which is the \ninvestigative arm of the Congress, goes on to say:\n\n       the Missile Defense Agency predicts with confidence that \n     the September 2004 defensive capability will provide \n     protection of the United States against limited attacks from \n     Northeast Asia. However, testing in 2003 did little to \n     demonstrate the predicted effectiveness of the system's \n     capability to defeat ballistic missiles as an integrated \n     system.\n\n  And from the GAO, who we pay a lot of money to, to advise us, they go \non to say:\n\n       None of the components of the defensive capability have yet \n     to be flight tested in their fielded configuration (i.e., \n     using production-representative hardware).\n\n  My friends, the GAO has essentially exposed the fact that the \nPresident plans a ``Wizard of Oz'' defense. We have seen the Wizard of \nOz. That Wizard of Oz was scary, but when you pull back the curtain, it \nwas just some little guy.\n  I want to see a successful missile defense system. I want to see it \nwork. Ever since I have been in Congress, I have been voting \ncontinually for research, research, so we have one system in place that \nworks. It would be the greatest to have. We may eventually have it. I \nhope to God we do. I am from California. I want a missile defense \nsystem. I am worried. I am just as worried, however, that if we tell \nour people they are defended and we do not have objective testing \nbehind it, it will be a very hard blow to people and a waste of money \nthat, God knows, we need in other areas of the military and in other \nways to defend our people from the suitcase bomb or an attack on a \nnuclear power plant, which we know the terrorists are looking at.\n  The President's decision, in my view, before the testing is done, is \na waste of our resources. The total amount requested for missile \ndefense in 2005 is $10.2 billion, more than any other defense system in \none year ever.\n  To put this $10.2 billion in perspective, let me read the budgets of \nsome of the programs in agencies critical to protecting us from the \nthreat of terrorism. I have a chart listing what we spend in other \nareas that are key in our fight against terrorism.\n  The entire missile defense system is $10.2 billion. That includes \neverything, research and everything else. I am talking about the \ndeployment costs, which are about $3.7 billion of the $10 billion. This \nchart shows the $10.2 billion, which is the entire missile defense \ncost. The money we are talking about spending is $3.7 billion to deploy \nthese 20 missiles.\n  Look what we have spent on the other areas to protect our people. The \ncustoms and border protection is $6.2 billion. My colleague, Senator \nMcCain, right now is holding a hearing--unfortunately I could not do it \nbecause I had to be here--on our problems at the border, protecting \nour borders from terrorism. The fact is, we need to spend more in high-\ntech equipment to better protect our people from terrorists crossing \nthe border. The total is $6.2 billion, compared to $10.2 billion on \nmissile defense; Transportation security, $5.3 billion; Coast Guard, \n$7.4 billion; FEMA, $4.8 billion; Office of Domestic Preparedness, $3.5 \nbillion. This is what we are talking about spending on this \ndeployment--$3.7 billion of the $10 billion--before it is operationally \ntested by the office that is supposed to do that.\n\n  We know the customs and border protection is the front line in \nprotecting the American public against terrorism. Transportation \nSecurity Administration--we all know what happened on 9/11; they are \nresponsible for keeping our airlines safe but also our railroads and \nour ports secure--$5.3 billion, and we are going to spend $3.7 billion \non an untested deployment? Coast Guard, $7.4 billion. Imagine that is \nwhat we spend on the Coast Guard, and they are right in the line of \nfire. I visit my Coast Guard ports all the time. They are the lead \nFederal agency in maritime safety. They are so important. We spend $7.4 \nbillion. And we are spending $10.2 billion on the entire missile \ndefense and ready to toss out $3.7 billion of that in this initial \ndeployment.\n  All of FEMA, the lead agency for preparing us to respond to all \ndomestic disasters, including acts of terrorism, $4.8 billion. We are \nabout to spend $3.7 billion on an untested system, and we are spending \n$4.8 billion on FEMA.\n  Office of Domestic Preparedness, $3.5 billion, which is less than we \nwill spend on an untested system. They are the\n\n[[Page S6920]]\n\nlead agency responsible for preparing the Nation against terrorism by \nassisting States and local governments in preparing for terrorists \nacts.\n  The Presiding Officer must hear the same things I hear at home from \nthe police officers, from nurses, from the first responders, the \nfirefighters. They are hurting. They need our help. Would it not be \nbetter at the moment now not to waste $3.7 billion on this initial \ndeployment, if we have that extra funding, but to put it into the fight \non terrorism?\n  My amendment does not cut any money from this program. My amendment \ndoes not cut one dollar from the program. However, it says, do not \nspend the money until the system is operationally tested. We will have \nother attempts because other people will be taking out some funding. I \ndo not touch the funding. All I say is, test it before you deploy it. \nIf the Office of Operational Test and Evaluation comes back with a good \nreport, then I say please deploy but not until that time.\n  We are at war with al-Qaida and with terrorism. The only four nations \nthat have ever successfully tested a nuclear capable intercontinental \nmissile are Russia, France, Britain, and China. We are not at war with \nthem.\n  We will talk about Korea and Iran. There are fears, and I share the \nfears, that this technology could get into the hands of the wrong \ncountries or somehow a terrorist could get his or her hands on one of \nthese missiles. That is why I want to protect our country against the \npotential of this kind of a strike. However, I do not want a make-\nbelieve system. I do not want a Wizard of Oz system.\n  I want a system I can look my people in the eye and say: We spent \n$3.7 billion deploying the first aspects of this system, and we know it \nworks. I think my people deserve to know that.\n  When I was in the House, I was on the Armed Services Committee, and I \nworked very hard on procurement reforms. I enjoyed so much being on the \nArmed Services Committee in the House. I was there for years. We had \nsome wonderful debates. What we found is: ``Fly before you buy'' is \nessential. And that is all we are saying. We want to know the system \nworks. We want to be able to tell the people the system works. And, \nclearly, we should look at the threat we face.\n  Now, the reason I am for this program, the reason I have voted for \nthis program many times for research, is because I want to have a \nsystem that works. Why? North Korea. I am very fearful of North Korea. \nAlthough I believe we can try our best and do more to negotiate with \nthem, there is no question I am worried about a potential missile \nsystem in North Korea.\n  But here is the issue. We have a capability that is not talked about \nthat much here, but the Pentagon's former Director of DOT, Philip \nCoyle, has said: We would never wait until North Korea has launched a \nmissile attack. ``We'd blow it up on the ground.'' We have the \ncapability to know when these missiles are being moved into place. Let \nme repeat what Philip Coyle said, the Pentagon's former Director of \nDOT:\n\n       We would never wait until the thing was launched. We'd blow \n     it up on the ground.\n\n  Now, I subscribe to that theory. I want to blow it up on the ground. \nI think Philip Coyle is right. With our capabilities, we could see any \nmovement, and we would know. But wouldn't it be great to intercept a \nmissile once it is in the air? Absolutely. If we could not destroy it \nbefore it was launched, definitely. But let's operationally test the \nsystem first, with the people who are hired to do this for the \ntaxpayers.\n  Now, let's hear what the Union of Concerned Scientists is saying. \nThey are an independent nongovernmental organization. They released an \nanalysis of the President's plan to deploy a missile defense system. \nLet me read you two of their findings:\n\n       The Block 2004 missile defense will have no demonstrated \n     capability to defend against a real attack since all flight \n     intercept tests have been conducted under highly scripted \n     conditions with the defense given advance information about \n     the attack details.\n\n  Now, do we think our enemies are going to place a call to us and say \nhere is what we are going to do; here is what time we are going to do \nit; here is the weather we are going to do it in; here is the day? No. \nThe fact is, we have not realistically tested this system.\n  This is what the Union of Concerned Scientists says:\n\n       Unsophisticated countermeasures that could readily be \n     implemented by countries such as North Korea remain an \n     unsolved problem for mid-course defenses against long-range \n     missiles.\n\n  So they are calling our countermeasures that we are using \nunsophisticated. It is a problem. This means that any country able to \nlaunch an ICBM is also capable of using countermeasures to fool our \ninterceptors.\n  The Union of Concerned Scientists report ends with their \nrecommendation that the Pentagon's Missile Defense Agency should:\n\n       [H]alt its deployment of the Block 20O4 Ground-based Mid-\n     course Defense system and Congress should require MDA to \n     conduct operationally realistic testing of the system before \n     it is deployed.\n\n  I thank the Union of Concerned Scientists because it was their very \nclear writing that led me to this amendment. In addition, common sense \nled me to this amendment. In addition, many former generals who have \nspoken out on this led me to this amendment. I agree with the \nscientists. That is why my amendment says that before we declare the \nsystem operational, we should know that it has been tested in a \nrealistic manner.\n  I want to show you the list of 49 generals who have written on this \nissue. I say to the Presiding Officer, I think you would find this very \ninteresting. This is a list of 49 generals and admirals who call for \nmissile defense postponement because they do not believe the testing is \nadequate.\n  In a recent statement these 49 generals and admirals have written to \nPresident Bush asking that the deployment of a ground-based midcourse \nmissile defense system be postponed. Their letter points out that the \nPentagon has waived the operational testing requirements that are \nessential to determining whether this highly complex system of systems \nis effective and suitable.\n  The last paragraph of their letter sums up the concerns of these \ngenerals and admirals:\n\n       As you have said, Mr. President, our highest priority is to \n     prevent terrorists from acquiring and deploying weapons of \n     mass destruction. We agree. We therefore recommend, as the \n     militarily responsible course of action--\n\n  The militarily responsible course of action--\n\n     that you postpone operational deployment of the expensive and \n     untested GMD system and transfer the associated funding to \n     accelerated programs to secure the multitude of facilities \n     containing nuclear weapons and materials and to protect our \n     ports and borders against terrorists who may attempt to \n     smuggle weapons of mass destruction into the United States.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthis letter signed by 49 retired generals and admirals.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   March 26, 2004.\n     President George W. Bush,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: In December 2002, you ordered the \n     deployment of a ground-based strategic mid-course ballistic \n     missile defense (GMD) capability, now scheduled to become \n     operational before the end of September 2004. You explained \n     that its purpose is to defend our nation against rogue states \n     that may attack us with a single or a limited number of \n     ballistic missiles armed with weapons of mass destruction.\n       To meet this deployment deadline, the Pentagon has waived \n     the operational testing requirements that are essential to \n     determining whether or not this highly complex system of \n     systems is effective and suitable. The Defense Department's \n     Director of Operational Test and Evaluation stated on March \n     11, 2004, that operational testing is not in the plan ``for \n     the foreseeable future.'' Moreover, the General Accounting \n     Office pointed out in a recent report that only two of 10 \n     critical technologies of the GMD system components have been \n     verified as workable by adequate developmental testing.\n       Another important consideration is balancing the high costs \n     of missile defense with funding allocated to other national \n     security programs. Since President Reagan's strategic defense \n     initiative speech in March 1983, a conservative estimate of \n     about $130 billion, not adjusted upward for inflation, has \n     been spent on missile defense, much of it on GMD. Your Fiscal \n     Year 2005 budget for missile defense is $10.2 billion, with \n     $3.7 billion allocated to GMD. Some $53 billion is programmed \n     for missile defense over the next five years, with much more \n     to follow. Deploying a highly complex weapons system\n\n[[Page S6921]]\n\n     prior to testing it adequately can increase costs \n     significantly.\n       U.S. technology, already deployed, can pinpoint the source \n     of a ballistic missile launch. It is, therefore, highly \n     unlikely that any state would dare to attack the U.S. or \n     allow a terrorist to do so from its territory with a missile \n     armed with a weapon of mass destruction, thereby risking \n     annihilation from a devastating U.S. retaliatory strike.\n       As you have said, Mr. President, our highest priority is to \n     prevent terrorists from acquiring and employing weapons of \n     mass destruction. We agree. We therefore recommend, as the \n     militarily responsible course of action, that you postpone \n     operational deployment of the expensive and untested GMD \n     system and transfer the associated funding to accelerated \n     programs to secure the multitude of facilities containing \n     nuclear weapons and materials and to protect our ports and \n     borders against terrorists who may attempt to smuggle weapons \n     of mass destruction into the United States.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the admirals and generals are essentially \nasking to take that money, that $3.7 billion, out of the $10 billion, \nand divert it to other programs. I am not doing that. I am simply \nfencing the money and saying: You can spend it when the tests pass. So \nthey are really asking more than I am doing.\n  The people who wrote this letter are some of our most distinguished \nmilitary men and women. I am going to read the names of these generals \nand admirals:\n  ADM William J. Crowe, United States Navy, Retired; GEN Alfred G. \nHansen, United States Air Force, Retired; GEN Joseph Hoar, U.S. Marine \nCorps, Retired; LTG Henry E.

I have spoken to the two managers. Senator Levin wants to \nspeak in support of your amendment for 5 minutes. They want 25 minutes \nto respond to your statement.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Sure.\n  Mr. REID. We would like to set a vote for around 12:30.\n  Mrs. BOXER. OK.\n  Mr. REID. Which is 40 minutes from now.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, and no second degrees prior to the vote.\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am happy to take another 7, 8 minutes and then finish.\n  Mr. WARNER. That runs us into about 35 minutes on your time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will finish in 5 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Yes. Senator Boxer will speak for 5 minutes. He will speak \nfor 5 minutes. That will give you 40 minutes and will be about evenly \nbalanced.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that on the pending Boxer amendment, there be \n10 minutes left on the proponents' side, 5 minutes for Senator Boxer, \nand 5 minutes for Senator Levin, and the remaining time be under the \ncontrol of Senator Warner, and that there be a vote at 12:30 with no \nsecond-degree amendments prior to the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. Reserving the right to object, could we state no later \nthan 12:30? We may be yielding back time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator so modify his request.\n  Mr. REID. Yes, and that Senator Boxer could have 1 minute prior to \nthe vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. We will take on this side equal time with 1 minute prior \nto the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. May I ask the Senator, I do get a vote on this?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, at 12:30.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The reason I am reading these names is because these are \nnames we know. These are our heroes: Major General Appleby, Major \nGeneral Boatner, Major General Bradshaw, Major General Brady, Major \nGeneral Burns, Rear Admiral Center, Major General Crawford, Major \nGeneral Edmonds, Rear Admiral Elliot, Major General Faith, Rear Admiral \nGormley, Major General Griffitts, Rear Admiral Grojean, Major General \nHaddock, Major General Holbein, Major General Hyman, Major General \nJackson, Major General Lawson, Major General Luchsinger, Major General \nLeCleir, Major General Willoughby, Brigadier General Cannon, Brigadier \nGeneral Costa, Brigadier General Cowan, Brigadier General Foote, \nBrigadier General Forney, Brigadier General Grubbs, Brigadier General \nHastings, Brigadier General Johns, Brigadier General Roush.\n  This is not easy for these people to come out here now and do this. \nThey believe, as I do, and as I hope colleagues on both sides of the \naisle feel--and I don't know what will happen with this--that with all \nof the threats we face today, we have to take care of everything. But \nfor goodness' sake, before we make a $3.7 billion deployment decision, \nlet us test the system with the agency that was set up to do it, not \nwith the program that is kind of fighting for its life always because \nthat is what happens around here, whether it is in the military or any \nservice. You can't rest with that and with the contractors that have \nthe economic stake. This separate objective office is the one.\n  I stand with the scientists who say we need the realistic test. I \nstand with the 49 former generals and admirals who say the militarily \nresponsible course is not to spend this money until these tests pass. \nThe Pentagon's current Director of the DOT, Thomas Christie, says we \ncan't be sure the system will work against a real North Korean missile. \nSo why wouldn't we fly before we buy? Why wouldn't we be sure that we \nare spending the money for the taxpayers in a wise way?\n  I want this as much as anybody else. I want this very much to work. \nBut I don't want to spend the money until we know we have tested the \nsystem realistically, and that is common sense.\n  Again, I named the names of these admirals. They want to go even \nfurther. They want to postpone this. I am saying let's not take away \nthe money. Keep the money in place. Let's just make sure the \nappropriate agency does the testing. That appropriate agency is the \nDirector of Operational Test and Evaluation. It is very simple. I hope \nmy colleagues will support this. We are being told by the people who \nknow that it is not ready yet for deployment.\n  I thank my colleagues for their patience. I yield the floor. I look \nforward to a good vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may require. \nI would like to enter into a brief colloquy with our colleague from \nCalifornia. If we can keep the answers short, I want to frame, for \nthose Members following this debate, my perception of what your \namendment does. I start by pointing out that last year, this body, this \nCongress, in a conference report, approved 20 ground-based \ninterceptors--they have been authorized--16 of which will be based at \nFort Greely, AK, and four of which will be placed at Vandenberg, CA. \nThey are being fielded as part of a missile defense test bed. This test \nbed is required for operational realistic testing and provides some \nmeasure of operational capability which serves as a basis for the IDO.\n  Is that basically a correct statement of what we did last year?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am sorry. My staff was pointing out something. You are \nasking me if what?\n  Mr. WARNER. What we did last year, this body authorized moving ahead \non 20 test bed sites, 16 in Alaska and the balance in your State. Am I \ncorrect?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Is not the purpose of your amendment to stop that \nprocess?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Absolutely not.\n  Mr. WARNER. Then how do you proceed to do any testing if you stop the \ntest bed?\n  Mrs. BOXER. We want operational testing. We want the tests to be done \nby the appropriate office. That is the purpose of the amendment. That \nis exactly what the generals are saying. That is what the admirals are \nsaying.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Sure.\n  Mr. WARNER. I interpret it quite differently. The amendment would \nprohibit deployment of the ground-based midcourse missile defense \nsystem until\n\n[[Page S6922]]\n\nthe Secretary certifies to Congress that the capabilities of the system \nto perform its national missile defense missions have been demonstrated \nin operationally realistic testing.\n  We authorized precisely what was to be done last year. We are \nproceeding on that basis right now. And as I look at this amendment, it \nwould be in effect to reverse what we did last year and start off in an \nentirely different direction. The test bed capabilities will include \nspace, ground, sea-based sensors, missile defense interceptors, battle \nmanagement facilities, software, command and control, and \ncommunications facilities. To provide additional realism, military \noperators participate in the tests, and the warfighter is developing a \nconcept of operations.\n  So, basically, what we are doing, if we were to adopt this amendment, \nis to put a halt on this system.\n  As I said, I rise in strong opposition to the Boxer amendment. This \namendment would prohibit deployment of the ground-based midcourse \nmissile defense system until the Secretary certifies to Congress that \nthe capabilities of the system to perform its national missile defense \nmissions have been demonstrated in operationally realistic testing.\n  This amendment, however, is flawed.\n  Let me start by noting that the Missile Defense Agency, with the \nstrong support of the Pentagon's Director of Operational Test and \nEvaluation, is fielding an extensive missile defense test bed. This \ntest bed is key to operationally realistic testing.\n  The test bed capabilities will include space, ground, and sea-based \nsensors; missile defense interceptors; battle management facilities and \nsoftware; and command, control, and communications facilities and \nsoftware. To provide additional realism, military operators participate \nin the tests, and the warfighter is developing a concept of operations.\n  The test bed facilities, the participation of military operators, and \na good concept of operations provide MDA the ability to test \nrealistically but also provide the initial defensive capability of the \nBMD System. This initial capability is based on the operational \ncapabilities inherent in the test bed. We are, in fact, on track to \nfield an initial, limited defensive capability later this year. That is \nwhat a number of Senators have described as a missile defense \ndeployment.\n  Indeed, the Commander of U.S. Strategic Command strongly supports the \nearly operational exploitation of test bed capabilities. He is the \nindividual charged with assessing the military utility of the BMD \nsystem. He testified forcefully to our committee that the BMD system \nprovides a useful military capability, contributes to deterrence, and \nprovides a useful option to military commanders and national command \nauthorities, even in the early phases of testing. He testified that he \nintends to ``take full and early operational advantage of the system's \nanti-missile capabilities under development.'' He also wrote in a \nrecent letter, ``U.S. STRATCOM supports the continued appropriate \ndevelopment of missile defense capabilities . . . under the \nevolutionary approach of concurrent test and operation.''\n  The amendment does not recognize the connection between the test bed \nand the fielding of operational capability. If you prohibit this \n``deployment,'' you prohibit operationally realistic testing--and \nprevent the very basis for the certification that the amendment \nrequires.\n\n  The BMD system is already being rigorously tested. I would argue that \nit is one of the most thoroughly tested systems--at this point in its \ndevelopment--that we have. It has gone through thousands of hours of \nground testing. The ground-based midcourse missile defense element that \nwe are discussing has achieved successful intercepts in five of eight \ntests and proven the basic soundness of the hit-to-kill technology. The \noperational test community is deeply involved in the test program, each \ntest includes operational test goals in addition to developmental test \ngoals.\n  Each test already includes a measure of operational realism. That \ntesting will continue and will become progressively more realistic and \nchallenging as the system matures. Testing successes will provide \ngreater confidence that the system is performing as we expect it will.\n  I would further note that the fielding of BMD systems is threat \ndriven. Serious ballistic missile threats exist today and will increase \nin the future. Congress addressed this issue years ago in the National \nMissile Defense Act of 1999, which states that it is the policy of the \nUnited States to deploy a national missile defense as soon as \ntechnologically possible. The Senate passed that act by a vote of 97-3. \nWe need to proceed expeditiously with fielding.\n  This is entirely consistent with past practice. Our nation has often \nfielded military systems without completion of operational testing in \nresponse to an urgent military need. These systems include the Joint \nSTARS system in the first Persian Gulf War, and the Global Hawk and \nPredator UAVs in the war on terror. Deployment of these systems--which \nhad not completed testing--greatly increased the security of our \nnation. The same will be true when we have fielded the missile defense \nsystem.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  I ask the chairman of the subcommittee to address the Senate and \nallocate the time on this side.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for yielding to me. \nSenator Kyl was on the Senate floor. I thought I would go ahead and \ngive him an opportunity to make some comments. I would like to make \nsome comments following his remarks.\n  Mr. WARNER. Does the Senator from Colorado agree with me as to what \nthis amendment does?\n  Mr. ALLARD. I do. If you take down the test bed, you in effect are \ngoing to stop the progress of the missile defense program. The real \nissue is, if you take down any part of it, it is so intertwined and \ninterconnected, you slow down and stop the whole system. Your comments \nare very pertinent. They are very much in order. I have tremendous \nconcern that this in effect is going to undo what the Congress has \nworked so hard to do.\n  If you remember, initially the legislation directed that we move \nforward on missile defense as soon as technologically feasible. We are \nready to move ahead, and we need to.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, with regard to the amendment before us, the \nchairman of the committee and of the subcommittee have made precisely \nthe right point. Congress has passed a law to get us to this point \ntoday, to begin the kind of operational testing that everybody agrees \nwe need to do, that even critics of the missile defense program want us \nto do. Yet now they say let's stop building the missiles that would be \nused for the operational testing.\n  The essence of this is captured in one of the first comments of the \nSenator from California.\n  She talked about the concept of ``fly before you buy,'' which \nordinarily is the way we buy military equipment but not always. She \nnoted that is one of the reasons why the Office of Test and Evaluation \nwas created, and she noted there had been problems as a result of the \nfact that not all of the operational testing had been done on this \nprogram.\n  Let me quote from the person who heads that office, the Director for \nOperational Test and Evaluation, Thomas Christie, on this precise issue \nin his recent testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee:\n\n     . . . I think the issue we're talking about here is the \n     building of missiles that will be put into silos that are \n     part of the test bed, and we have to have this test bed in \n     order to do some of the testing that will become more \n     realistic engagements, geometrics, for example, than we've \n     been able to do before. And some of these attributes of this \n     test bed are in response to criticism that came from my \n     office and my predecessor in previous administrations. . . .\n\n  Mr. President, that is the precise point. The criticism has been that \nnot all of the testing has been under the kind of realistic conditions \nthat would be the real battlefield we need to be able to test against. \nIt has been done by contractors, and, of course, that is the way you \nhave to start out to test the components and make sure they work. \nEventually, you have to build the missiles, put them into the ground, \nand test them in real conditions. What better way to do that than to \nput them in the actual silos in which they will have to be located in \nAlaska?\n\n[[Page S6923]]\n\n  By the way, when Thomas Christie speaks of this, he talks about the \nplaces for the best chance of intercepting missiles, where we think \nthey might come in. Where is that? Alaska. Weather conditions in Alaska \nare not necessarily the best. We have to test these missiles under \nconditions where there would be several feet of snow or ice on top of \nthe missile silo, the lid that has to be blown off for the ground-based \nmissile interceptor to be shot off. That is why we have to have \nmissiles precisely in the place where they can be tested under these \noperational conditions. That is precisely why we have to, A, authorize \nand, B, fund this group of 10 missiles which will be part of the test \nbed.\n  Now, the fact that they may also have the capability in an extreme \nemergency of actually shooting down a hostile missile should not be a \nbad thing. If, God forbid, a hostile country should challenge us and \neither mistakenly launch a missile at us or intentionally do so against \nus, wouldn't it be nice to have the missile in the silo to shoot it \ndown with? I fear some opponents--certainly not anybody on the Senate \nfloor--would say you cannot do that because we have not certified yet \nthat it is an operational system.\n  In the 1991 gulf war, for example, when we had an air defense system \ncalled Patriot and Saddam Hussein began sending Scud missiles at our \ntroops in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, we actually sent that air defense \nsystem to Saudi Arabia, doing some fixes to it on the way over, and we \nput it on the ground. As the Scuds were launched, we fired Patriot \nmissiles at them. We didn't hit them all, but I think we hit something \nlike about a third of the Scud missiles.\n  That system wasn't designed to shoot down missiles. It had never been \noperationally tested and hadn't been certified for deployment, but in \nan emergency we needed it. We have done that with other systems, such \nas JSTARS and some of our unmanned aerial vehicles. There are some \nother programs we can talk about that we didn't ``fly before we buy'' \nwith those systems. We had them in a developmental process, and all of \na sudden we needed them and we used them. Thank God, they were there to \nbe used.\n\n  So even if we had to use one of these missiles in an emergency, God \nforbid, would anybody object to us doing that? Would we have to say, \nwait a minute, we don't have the certification called for in the Boxer \namendment yet? Sorry, we cannot defend ourselves.\n  I think not. It is an unrealistic requirement. More importantly, it \nis a requirement that even the head of the group that we have set up, \nthe Director of the Operational Test and Evaluation Office, has said is \nunnecessary.\n  We need to move forward in building these missiles so we can put them \nin the silos and conduct the operational tests that we all agree need \nto be conducted.\n  I note that our colleague from California said she has always voted \nfor research. I accept her word on that. But part of the problem for \nmissile defense is that a lot of us vote for research, but when it \ncomes to bending the metal, actually building the system and putting it \ninto the ground, that is when people say we need to slow up, we have \nnot done enough testing, we are not sure it will work against \neverything. So we have spent an awful lot of money on missile defense \nand, frankly, a lot of research, but we have not been able to put \nsomething into the ground.\n  President Bush said, when he came into office, we are going to put \nsomething into the ground that will work. We may have to let it evolve \nas it moves forward, and we will make changes as we learn more and \nmore. But that is all right. At least we have an initial capability \nthat might work, God forbid, should somebody accidentally launch \nsomething against us, or even do so intentionally. I look at our \nweapons systems, such as the F-16s that are tested at Luke Air Force \nBase in Arizona. I am not sure which version of the F-16 we are flying \nnow, but it is not the A, B, C, or D. We build systems and we keep \nimproving them. We evolve in our technology and keep putting that new \ntechnology into the systems.\n  That is precisely what we have decided to do with missile defense, \nrather than trying to come up with the perfect system that will defeat \nany kind of offensive system against us. We understand we need to start \nwith something that will be rudimentary and at least will deal with a \nthreat coming from a country like--let's say North Korea, and it may \nnot work against one of the old Soviet systems, for example. But as we \nget better, we will include those new technologies into these systems, \nimprove them; so as our adversaries develop systems, we will be one \nstep ahead of them.\n  Finally, part of the purpose of this is deterrence. It is not just to \nbe able to defeat a missile that might be thrown against us. The \nmessage we want to send to North Korea, Iran, and other countries is \nthe same one we sent to Soviet Union, which it heard loudly and \nclearly. It was the message President Reagan sent: We have the economy \nto outspend you, out-research you, out-build you, and we are going to \nbuild a missile defense that will defeat you. Why go to the trouble, \nsince you cannot afford to do it, of trying to build an offensive \nsystem that we can defeat? That is the message we want to send to these \npotential enemies. We can deploy a system and we will always be able to \nhave a system that will defeat what you throw against us. Why take the \ntime and trouble to develop that kind of system? It has a deterrent \neffect as well.\n\n  We need to move forward with this system and defeat the Boxer \namendment. Both Chairman Warner and the Senator from Colorado, Senator \nAllard, are precisely correct in their opposition to this amendment.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Senator for his statement. I recognize in a \npublic way his great work on this particular issue, and his comments \nare very enlightening.\n  I will yield myself 6 minutes.\n  I rise in strong opposition to the Boxer amendment. Today, we face a \nclear threat from long-range missiles in North Korea. Iran has made no \nsecret of its intent to develop long-range missiles. We may have to \ndeal with that threat in the not-too-distant future. That is the truth.\n  Consequently, I have great concern about this amendment, which seems \nrelatively straightforward but it is potentially devastating to the \neffort to defend our Nation from long-range missile threats. I say \n``seems straightforward'' because I can actually read this amendment \nthree different ways. None of these readings seem useful to the defense \nof this country.\n  If I focus on mission, I would note that Admiral James Ellis, \nCommander of Strategic Command, has testified to our committee that the \nground-based midcourse element of the ballistic missile defense system \nenhances deterrence and provides him a militarily useful capability. On \nthat basis, perhaps the Secretary could provide the certification \nrequired by the amendment, even at this stage of the testing. I don't \nbelieve that is what the Senator from California has in mind.\n  If I focus on operations, I might read this amendment to say we can \ndeploy all we want, but we cannot use what we deployed operationally. \nTaken literally, that would mean if North Korea or some other nation \nwould launch a missile at us, we would be forbidden by law from trying \nto defend ourselves. I don't believe that is what the Senator has in \nmind either. Of course, to be able to try to intercept such a missile, \nthe ground-based midcourse element would have to be on alert and \noperationally ready. This is precisely why Admiral Ellis strongly \nsupports taking advantage of the operational capabilities of the \nmissile defense test bed.\n  That brings us to the third reading focusing on deployment. If I read \nthe amendment correctly, it would impose a prohibition on any \ndeployment of defenses against long-range ballistic missiles. Any \nadditional deployment would be prohibited until the Secretary of \nDefense certifies that operationally realistic testing has demonstrated \nthat the ground-based midcourse defense element can perform its \nmission.\n  If that is the Senator's intent, as I read this, if this amendment \nwere to become law at the beginning of the new fiscal year, no further \nfielding of ground-based midcourse interceptors, radars, battle \nmanagement facilities, command and control facilities, or \ncommunications assets would be permitted. These are the components of \nthe BMD test bed on which the initial defense capability of the GMD \nelement are based.\n\n[[Page S6924]]\n\n  This has the potential to cause extraordinary harm to the GMD effort \nby disrupting ongoing efforts to acquire assets for the BMD test bed, \nincluding all of the assets I just mentioned. Recovering from this \ndisruption, depending on how long fielding of capabilities were to be \nsuspended, could take years and cost hundreds of millions of dollars. \nBut beyond that, as a consequence of this disruption, and the \nconsequent harm to the BMD test bed, it is not clear to me at all how \nthe Missile Defense Agency could achieve the operationally realistic \ntesting that all of us support.\n  Furthermore, I believe this amendment fails to grasp the essentials \nof how the Department of Defense and the Missile Defense Agency are \nattempting to field missile defenses as effectively and expeditiously \nas possible.\n  The ballistic missile defense program is a spiral development effort. \nThat means, in essence, develop missile defenses and field those \ndefenses if the warfighter believes the capability has military utility \nwithout necessarily waiting for the 100-percent solution. Further \ndevelopment then allows those defenses to be improved in subsequent \nspirals.\n  This amendment does not seem to take account of this spiral \ndevelopment, that the ground midcourse defense system element will be \nable to perform at a certain level early in its fielding and will \nimprove in its capabilities over time or that continued testing will \ndemonstrate new capabilities as they are developed. Testing, which \nalready incorporates operational goals and some measure of operational \nrealism, gets more realistic and more rigorous with time.\n  This method of development, testing, and fielding does not seem to me \nto be compatible with the one-time certification by the Secretary. We \nall support operationally realistic testing, but banning deployment \nuntil a certification appears to me to be self-defeating.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this amendment.\n  I would like to bring to the attention of my colleagues a quote by \nChristie, who is the Director of the Operational Test and Evaluation \nProgram:\n\n       I continue to strongly support the construction and \n     integration of the BMDS test bed. This test bed will provide \n     the elements that make up the initial defense operations or. \n     . . .\n\nthe architecture of the missile defense system.\n  Who is this director? He is the chief tester. This is what the chief \ntester himself is saying about how important it is that we move forward \nwith spiral development where we can operationally show in a test bed \nthe dual capability.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). The Senator has \nused 6 minutes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I yield the floor and yield--how much time \ndoes the Senator from Alabama wish?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Five minutes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Allard for his great \nleadership on the issue of national missile defense, space technology, \nand all the related issues. We are fortunate to have him as chairman of \nthe Strategic Forces Subcommittee. He understands the issue. He has \nbeen dealing with it for many years. He studied it and brought his \nscientific background to the issue. I agree with him, and I also very \nmuch agree with the comments of our distinguished Senator Jon Kyl from \nArizona, who also has studied this issue for many years.\n  We voted back when President Clinton was President, and he signed the \nbill to deploy a national missile defense system as soon as \ntechnologically feasible. It was an amendment, I recall, by Senator \nThad Cochran and Senator Joe Lieberman. It passed by a very large vote, \nand we made a commitment to do that. There was a lot of debate about it \nthen.\n  I think some people still are somewhat motivated by their criticism \nof President Reagan's Star Wars maybe; that this would not work; it \ncould not work. They just did not like it. But we voted on it after a \nnational commission had reported unanimously that we needed to have \nthis defense. Overwhelmingly the Senators voted for it. Since then, \nthere has been a steadfast effort to slow, delay, and undermine the \nactual deployment of this system.\n  We are now on the move to deploy this system in September in Alaska, \nto put, I believe, five missiles in the ground, and this will give us \nthe ability to conduct realistic testing, the kind of testing that can \nactually deal with the realistic conditions around the world, our radar \nsystems, our interceptor systems, the nature of the launch facilities \nin Alaska, which is the perfect place, people have convinced us, to \ndeploy a system and cover all the United States. It will protect us \nnow. It has military capability to protect this country when deployed.\n  It also could, in addition to perhaps a threat from a nation such as \nNorth Korea that actually rattled its missiles a number of times and \nare working steadfastly to improve their missile system, help us deal \nwith an accidental launch from a country that has a missile defense \nprogram. It would give us the ability to have protection today for the \nentire United States. That is what we committed to do.\n  We voted to begin this deployment in September, and General Kadish \nand his entire team, General Holly and others, have worked so hard to \nprove the feasibility of this system. A bullet can meet a bullet. We \nhave done it. We know it will work. Now we need to set up an \noperational system, a very realistic system, deploy these missiles, and \ncontinue to test them. We will learn to make them even better to deal \nwith some of the problems we have not anticipated today from this \ndeployment and the testing that can occur there.\n  We are doing this as part of the spiral development, the idea that \nwhen you are developing a new system such as this, it is not possible \nto anticipate everything that may occur, every challenge that may be \nout there, and as we learn, we continue to improve the system.\n  We in Congress in the past have made mistakes sometimes about \nmandating a new weapon system, a new production, and then demand it \nmeet 10 characteristics, when we may find, as we go along in the \ndevelopment of it, if we drop off 1 of those characteristics and keep 9 \nof them, we have even more capability and a better system. We are \ngiving them some freedom to deploy and test as they go.\n  I believe we are well on the way under Senator Allard's leadership \nand Senator Warner, the chairman of our committee, to deal with any \nscientific difficulties that have come up in the past.\n  I thank the Chair for recognizing me to speak on this issue. I join \nwith Chairman Warner and Chairman Allard in urging defeat of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the pending amendment would prevent \ndeployment of the missile defense system before that missile defense \nsystem is shown to be workable by operationally realistic testing. That \nis what we are supposed to do around here. This is nothing new. What is \nnew is the deployment of a system before it has been realistically \ntested and operationally tested with no plans to ever test the system.\n  There are a couple of examples where we have deployed systems, but we \nhave never deployed a system without a plan to at least operationally \ntest at some point. There are no such plans here. It violates the \nspirit and, in one case, the letter of the law relative to testing and \nrelative to ``fly before you buy.''\n  These laws are intended to prevent the purchase and deployment to the \nfield of billions of dollars in military equipment prior to it being \nadequately tested. What we have heard on the floor is a giant \nrationalization for deploying a system which may or may not work. We \nhave been told this morning that we have to deploy in Alaska because \nthat is where the operational testing is going to take place. How can \nthere be operational testing unless these missiles are put in the \nground?\n  The problem is, that is not accurate. There is not going to be flight \ntesting of these missiles from Alaska. That is not just me saying that; \nthis is what the Department of Defense has told us. I will quote from \nthe DOT fiscal year 2003 annual report:\n\n       Due to safety considerations, no tests are currently \n     planned to launch interceptors from the operational missile \n     fields.\n\n\n[[Page S6925]]\n\n\n  I am going to repeat it:\n\n       Due to safety considerations, no tests are currently \n     planned to launch interceptors from the operational missile \n     fields.\n\n  So these missiles are not going to be put in Alaska in order to have \nsome place from which to operationally test a missile. It is not going \nto happen.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a question on that point?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. So when Senator Warner says essentially we need to go \nahead because we are going to test this once they are deployed, what I \nhear my colleague saying the Pentagon told him, and they put it in \nwriting, is because of safety concerns there will be no operational \ntesting at those sites; is that correct?\n  Mr. LEVIN. At these sites, they are not going to be fired. So you \nwant to deploy before you test. Do not deploy because you think that is \nwhere you are going to be testing from. We are not. That is according \nto the Department of Defense.\n  Now another reason we are given is that will work against the real \nNorth Korean missile threat. That is what we are told. Yet on March 11, \nthe Pentagon's own chief tester, Tom Christie, testified in front of \nthe Armed Services Committee and Senator Jack Reed asked him whether it \nwas true that at this time we cannot be sure the actual missile defense \nsystem would work against a real North Korean missile threat, to which \nMr. Christie replied, ``I would say that's true.''\n  Now, there are good arguments to test a missile defense system which \nwill work. It seems to me to say that a missile defense system which \nmay or may not work, which we have not tested operationally or \nrealistically, is a deterrent against some potential threat, is totally \ninaccurate as well. It is wishful thinking. Something is not deterred \nwith a system which may not work. There is testing to get a system \nwhich does work and then deterrence may be possible, because if there \nis going to be a missile attack against us, we always have to remember \nthat the people who would shoot at us, No. 1, would destroy themselves, \nnot us. They may or may not destroy us depending on how accurate the \nmissile is, but they would destroy themselves because the retaliation \nwould be swift, clear, certain, and massive. That is the deterrent that \nworks and has always worked in the area of missiles.\n  Nonetheless, if one wants a defense against such an attack, if they \ndo not think they can deter an attack by the certainty of massive \nretaliation, if they think some country is going to shoot a missile at \nus even though it will lead to their own destruction, then the value of \nthat system would be ``if it works.'' But no operational testing here.\n   Senator Boxer's amendment would prevent deployment of the \nadministration's national missile defense before the capabilities of \nthe system have been confirmed by operationally realistic testing. This \namendment does exactly the right thing. The administration currently \nplans to deploy a national missile defense before the capabilities of \nthe system have been confirmed by operationally realistic testing. This \nviolates the entire spirit, if not the letter, of the ``fly-before-you-\nbuy'' laws, because these laws are intended to prevent the purchase and \ndeployment to the field of billions of dollars of military equipment \nprior to it being adequately tested to show that it would work in \nactual combat.\n   Sometime in September of this year, the Bush administration will \ndeclare a national missile defense system deployed and operational, \nprobably with much fanfare. However, the system has never been \nrealistically tested, against targets that actually look like an enemy \nmissile. Instead, the targets have had beacons on them, telling the \nnational missile defense where they are, instead of using the national \nmissile defense radars to do that. An enemy missile will not have a \nbeacon on it. Yet, the DoD has never yet tested this system without the \ntarget having one. Nor has the system been tested against targets that \nlook like a threat missile might look, with the simple countermeasures \nthat any ICBM-capable country would almost certainly have.\n   The Pentagon's chief test official, who is required by law to \nindependently oversee and approve all operational testing of major \nweapon systems, has not been given any authority over the missile \ndefense test plans. This chief test official is the only true \nindependent judge of the Pentagon's weapon system. The law established \nhis position to ensure that political or other pressures did not result \nin a weapon system being deployed before it was ready. But the Bush \nadministration has consistently tried to marginalize the role of the \nPentagon's test official in missile defense.\n   The result is that the testing for the national missile defense \nsystem has remained unrealistically simple. The tests have been \ndesigned to ensure test success, and ``rack up the score,'' not to \nensure the system actually works in wartime. Despite the artificial \nsimplicity of the tests, the last major test of the system was a \nfailure. That was back in December of 2002, and the DoD has not \nconducted another such test in the 18 months since then. This long \ndelay has been due to a number of developmental problems with the \nsystem's interceptors. The Pentagon still has not fixed the \ndevelopmental problems with the system, which is why the next test, \noriginally scheduled for March, has been delayed by 4 months. Yet \ndespite these continuing problems, test failures, and the substantial \ndelays, the administration still plans to deploy the system in \nSeptember, as it has for more than a year. This is putting perceived \npolitical advantages of a Presidential election-year before technical \nreality, and fiscal responsibility.\n   Senator Boxer's amendment would require realistic operational tests, \nunder the control of the Pentagon's chief tester, prior to deployment \nof a national missile defense. I support Senator Boxer's amendment, \nwhich would put common sense ahead of missile defense politics, and \nwould reinforce the intent of existing ``fly-before-you-buy'' laws \nwhich protect men and women in uniform, the taxpayer, and our national \nsecurity. I urge others to support this amendment as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 3 minutes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. My colleague said all we have to have is mutually assured \ndeterrence. That is a policy out of the cold war: Blow me up and I am \ngoing to blow you up. We are past that in this day and age. We are \ndealing with leaders in other countries who do not care, and that is \nwhere our threat is coming from, it is coming from countries such as \nIran and North Korea. We need to figure out a new system, and we need \nto get it in place as quickly as we possibly can to make sure we can \ncontinue to provide the security to this country that the American \npeople expect. The missile defense system is the answer.\n  We are talking about a test bed that is overlapping with an \noperational capability, and anything we do to delay the operational \ncapability, we delay testing. When testing is delayed, the cost of the \nprogram is run up and the program is delayed out. Then pretty soon \nthere are cost overruns and then the opposition says, well, we cannot \nmove forward because of all of these delays and cost overruns.\n  The fact is, we are on schedule. We expect to get these missiles in \nthe ground this fall, and we are going to begin to have a system in \nplace where we can defend this country from an unexpected missile \nattack that may occur out of North Korea or Iran.\n  Mr. Christie, who I had quoted earlier, in simple terms, was our \nchief tester, and he states that the test bed is necessary for \nevolution improvement to the ballistic missile defense system, and that \nthe challenge is to do testing in a manner that will improve the system \nwhile supporting an operational system.\n  Stating something Mr. Christie said from his recent testimony to the \nfull committee, he says that fielding the test bed provides an \nopportunity to gather operational data on system performance, safety, \nsurvivability, availability, and maintainability. We should expect \nthese data to drive system enhancements. The challenge will be in \nachieving a defensive posture that is flexible enough to accommodate \nthe necessary changes to hardware, software, and processes that will be \nnecessary to maintain a highly available\n\n[[Page S6926]]\n\nballistic missile defense system, while supporting a comprehensive \ntesting program that is designed to mature, improve, and demonstrate \nmission capabilities through continued development.\n  Mr. Christie believes the Missile Defense Agency test program is a \nstrong one, and that it is working. Unnecessary delays are unnecessary. \nWe simply cannot tolerate those. This issue is too important to the \nsecurity of this country. So I am asking that my colleagues join me in \nopposing the Boxer amendment. This is a devastating amendment. It is \ncreating all sorts of problems as far as the defense of this country is \nconcerned, and it is going to severely hinder what we are trying to do \nwith ballistic missile defense.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, is there any time for me to rebut some of \nwhat was said?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has 1 minute 20 \nseconds remaining; the Senator from Colorado has 8 minutes 20 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I will take this time to rebut some of \nwhat has been said.\n  The amendment I am offering with Senator Levin does not cut one slim \ndime from the National Missile Defense Program. All it says is, let us \nmake sure the system works before we expend $3.7 billion to deploy it. \nHow people can say that is devastating is beyond belief.\n  If one wants to talk about devastating, devastating is investing \nmoney in something that will not work when it is needed. Devastating is \nsomething where the people of this country are told they are protected \nwhen they are not because the agency that was set up to test this is \nnot in charge of the operational testing.\n  The opponents to this amendment also say something else over and over \nagain: It is important we deploy these. Then we will test.\n  The fact is, the Pentagon themselves--and I ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed in the Record this Pentagon report in which they say:\n\n       Due to safety considerations, no tests are currently \n     planned to launch interceptors from the operational missile \n     fields.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation]\n\n                         FY 2003 Annual Report\n\n\n dod programs, army programs, navy and marine corps programs, and air \n                             force programs\n\n     Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD)\n       The Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) element is an \n     integrated collection of components that perform dedicated \n     functions during an ICBM engagement. As planned, the GMD \n     element includes the following components:\n       GMD Fire Control and Communications.

For IDO, all fire control \n     will be conducted within the GMD element.\n       Long-range sensors, including the Upgraded Early Warning \n     Radar, the COBRADANE radar, and the Ground-Based Radar \n     Prototype.

The plan for the 2004 Test \n     Bed plan places six Ground Based Interceptors at Fort Greely, \n     Alaska, and four at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California. In \n     2005, plans are to place ten more at Fort Greely.\n       GMD soon plans to interface with other BMDS elements and \n     existing operational systems through external system \n     interfaces. Through FY06, these plans include GMD interfacing \n     with the Aegis SPY-1B radars and satellite-based sensors and \n     communications.\n       To date, the GMD program has demonstrated the technical \n     feasibility of hit-to-kill negation of simple target \n     complexes in a limited set of engagement conditions. The GMD \n     test program in FY03 was hindered by a lack of production \n     representative test articles and from test infrastructure \n     limitations. Delays in production and testing of the two \n     objective booster designs have put tremendous pressure on the \n     test schedule immediately prior to fielding. The most \n     significant test and infrastructure limitations and \n     mitigation plans are described in the table below.\n\n           MAJOR GMD TEST LIMITATIONS AND MDA MITIGATION PLANS\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n         Limitation                 Comments         MDA mitigation plan\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLack of a deployable boost    The Orbital booster   MDA is proceeding\n vehicle.                      has been tested in    with deployment\n                               developmental         plans emphasizing\n                               flight tests          the Orbital\n                               without attempted     booster.

The target suite \n     consisted of a mock warhead and a number of decoys launched \n     from the Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, towards the \n     Reagan Test Site. IFT-9 (largely a replay of IFT-8) was \n     designed to increase confidence in the GMD capability to \n     execute hit-to-kill intercepts. Overall, the test execution \n     was nominal although the EKV experienced the track gate \n     anomaly previously observed in IFT-7 and IFT-8. The software \n     changes incorporated in IFT-9 to mitigate this problem were \n     not successful. Further changes were made prior to IFT-10.\n       In December 2002, GMD attempted a night intercept in IFT-\n     10. In this test, the EKV failed to separate from the \n     surrogate boost vehicle and therefore the ability to \n     intercept the target could not be tested. The failure to \n     separate was attributed to a quality control failure combined \n     with shock and vibration loads on the EKV. As a result, \n     corrective measures taken to fix the track gate anomaly found \n     in previous tests could not be used.\n       GMD suspended intercept flight testing after the EKV failed \n     to separate from the surrogate booster in IFT-10. IFT-11 and \n     IFT-12 that employed the problematic surrogate booster were \n     eliminated from the schedule. This decision was reasonable \n     given the increased risk of surrogate boost vehicle failure, \n     the resources that would have to be diverted from tactical \n     booster development to fix the problems, and the limited \n     amount of additional information to be gained in IFT-11 and \n     IFT-12 over that available from previous flight tests. It \n     does, however, leave very limited time for demonstration of \n     boost vehicle performance, integration of the boost vehicle \n     to the new, upgraded EKV, and demonstration of integrated \n     boost vehicle/interceptor performance. IFT-13A and IFT-13B \n     remain in the schedule as non-intercept flight tests to \n     confirm booster integration and performance. IFT-13C was \n     added to the schedule and represents a significant exercise \n     of the Test Bed infrastructure. It will be the first system-\n     level flight test to use the Kodiak, Alaska, facility to \n     launch a target missile. While it is not a planned intercept \n     attempt, it will fully exercise the system and may result in \n     an intercept. IFT-13C also addresses a long-standing concern \n     over target presentation that has not yet been tested. IFT-14 \n     and IFT-15 are the next official intercept attempts and are \n     scheduled for May 2004 and July 2004, respectively.\n       The Orbital Sciences Corporation booster was successfully \n     tested with a mock EKV on August 16, 2003. Shock and \n     vibration environments were measured and compared to previous \n     test levels. Preliminary analyses suggest that the new \n     booster produces lower than expected vibrations at the EKV. \n     Performance of the real EKV mated with the Orbital booster \n     will be demonstrated in IFT-14 prior to IDO. Similar \n     demonstration flights for the Lockheed Martin booster design \n     are slipping due to technical difficulties and several \n     explosions at the missile propellant mixing facility. Silos \n     and related construction projects at Fort Greely, Alaska; \n     Kodiak, Alaska; and Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, \n     are proceeding on schedule. Due to safety considerations, no \n     tests are currently planned to launch interceptors from the \n     operational missile fields.\n       To date, EKV discrimination and homing have been \n     demonstrated against simple target complexes in a limited set \n     of engagement conditions. Demonstrations of EKV performance \n     are needed at higher closing velocities and against targets \n     with signatures, countermeasures, and flight dynamics more \n     closely matching the projected threat. In addition, system \n     discrimination performance against target suites for which \n     there is imperfect a\n\n[[Page S6927]]\n\n     prior knowledge remains uncertain. GMD is developing a SBX \n     radar mounted on a semi-submersible platform. The SBX radar, \n     scheduled for incorporation into the GMD element in December \n     2005, is designed to be a more capable and flexible midcourse \n     sensor for supporting GMD engagements. This radar will \n     improve the operational realism of the flight test program by \n     providing a moveable mid-course sensor.\n       A flight demonstration of the BMDS capability using Aegis \n     SPY-1B data (particularly for defense of Hawaii) is planned \n     for IFT-15 in FY04. A flight demonstration of COBRADANE is \n     currently not planned, and its capability will need to be \n     demonstrated by other means until an air-launched target is \n     developed. IFT-14 and IFT-15, scheduled for FY04, are \n     intended to provide demonstrations of integrated boost \n     vehicle/EKV performance. Even with successful intercepts in \n     both of these attempts, the small number of tests would limit \n     confidence in the integrated interceptor performance.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Here we have a situation where you have an amendment that \ndoes not cut any money from this, that just says fly before you buy. I \nhope my colleagues will approve it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know we are under a time agreement. I ask \nunanimous consent for a couple of minutes to report on what is \nhappening with the bill so far. I was asked this morning to give a \nreport on this. I would like to do that.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Would you repeat your request?\n  Mr. REID. I would like a couple of minutes to give the Senate a \nreport on what we have done on the bill so far, the number of \namendments and such.\n  Mr. ALLARD. On the Defense authorization bill? We have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have been on this bill 12 days counting \ntoday, but 4 of those days are our famous--or infamous, however you \nlook at it--Mondays and Fridays. So actually we spent 8 days on this \nbill. When we dispose of this amendment, the Boxer amendment, we will \nhave disposed of 79 amendments. During this period of time, counting \nthe Boxer amendment, we will have had 12 rollcall votes.\n  For a Defense authorization bill, we have not spent an inordinate \namount of time on it. We have not spent very much time at all. There \nhave been very few quorum calls. The quorum calls we had this week have \nbeen most productive. We have been able to work out the problem dealing \nwith the South Carolina situation, as the Presiding Officer knows. We \nwere able to work out various other problems with the quorum calls we \nhad. Even having had quorum calls, they were very short. So I think we \nhave accomplished quite a bit in a very short period of time on this \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I would like to call on the Senator from \nMississippi and yield him 3 minutes to comment on the Boxer amendment. \nI want to recognize, in a public way, that he is the one who carried \nthe initial amendments on the missile defense system that said we move \nforward when technologically feasible and he has been a real leader in \nthe defense of this country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the distinguished Senator from Colorado for \nyielding to me. I also thank him for his leadership on this issue in \nthe Armed Services Committee. He has been a key proponent and a very \npersuasive supporter of the National Missile Defense Program and \nmissile defense generally.\n  This amendment would undermine the ability of our Department of \nDefense to go forward in the deployment and protection of our country \nthrough the use of ballistic missile technology and capabilities. These \ncapabilities have been developed in response to legislation that was \napproved by the Congress and signed by the Chief Executive to develop a \nmissile defense capability that could defend the United States against \nmissile attack.\n  We have made great progress since those initial authorizations were \napproved by the Congress. We are now in a position of actually \ndeploying a system that is workable. The testimony of General Kadish \nbefore our Appropriations Committee and before the Armed Services \nCommittee has clearly indicated the successful progress of this program \nto date. We should continue to support it and we should defeat this \nBoxer amendment.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I would like to know what time remains on \nthe Boxer amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 6 minutes 50 seconds.\n  Mr. ALLARD. On our side. How about the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired, other than the 2 minutes \npreceding the vote.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I would like to yield myself 2 minutes. I \nwould like to make a couple of summary comments.\n  First, technologically we are ready to move ahead. The various \ncomponents of this missile defense system have been shown to be \nfunctional and scientifically can happen. What needs to be established \nis all the communications systems that run from California to Alaska to \nColorado, to some of our space satellites, to some of our ships at sea, \nto the Hawaiian Islands, to the Kwajalein Islands, over thousands and \nthousands of miles, that they can communicate with one another.\n  There is only one way to do that. You have to put together a large \ntest bed. This test bed happens to also be the same thing we would use \nto operationally defend ourselves. To not continue on a dual pathway \ndoes not make any sense at all. That is why it is so very important \nthat we defeat this Boxer amendment.\n  Mr. Christie, who is the tester, is the one who has been following \nthis. It has been stated time and time again that he is satisfied with \nthe progress, the way we are moving forward. He is the expert. He says: \nYou are doing a good job. Keep it up. I am satisfied. I am responsible \nand accountable for how this program has gone ahead. He has been before \nthe committee and made that statement.\n  It is very important that we defeat this Boxer amendment. I ask my \ncolleagues to join me.\n  I think the chairman has a concern or two he wants to raise. I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to advise Senators, Senator Levin \nand I have conferred. We have the next amendment following this vote to \nbe provided by the Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. Reed, No. 3354. I \nreserve the right to put on a second-degree amendment. As soon as we \nprovide the second-degree amendment to the other side, it is my \nexpectation, during the course of the deliberations, we will be able to \nwork out a time agreement.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Hopefully, we can work out a time agreement after we see \nthe second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct. There is no restriction. Offer the \namendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. And the second-degree amendment is not available at this \npoint?\n  Mr. WARNER. It momentarily will be available. I think we can yield \nback all time. I didn't know whether the Senator wanted another minute \nto speak to the amendment. Did she ask for it?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized for \n1 minute.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator.\n  I think we have had a good debate. I am just saying to colleagues, \nthese are the names of retired admirals and generals you all admire. \nThey are saying we have to delay this deployment because we have no \nidea that this system works.\n  To my colleagues who said let's deploy it and then test it, the \nPentagon in its own words has said they can't do it. It is not safe. \nHere it is. They say:\n\n       Due to safety considerations, no tests are currently \n     planned to launch interceptors from the operational missile \n     fields.\n\n  So the Pentagon has said very clearly--and good for them because it \nwould be too dangerous--they are not going to operationally test from \nthe missile fields. So what are we doing? We are investing $3.7 billion \nout of the $10 billion to move forward with a system that is untested.\n  For those people who say this is a devastating amendment, why do they \nsupport ``fly before you buy,'' which is the way we do things around \nhere? This is a way to get around realistic testing. That doesn't make \nus any safer; it makes us weaker. It makes us vulnerable.\n  So I hope you will stand with these 49 generals and admirals and \nSenator\n\n[[Page S6928]]\n\nLevin and me and vote for the Boxer-Levin amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. WARNER. I say to our colleagues, this issue was acted upon last \nyear. Money was authorized and appropriated. The program is underway. \nThe effect of this amendment is to cancel what the Congress did last \nyear.\n  I yield the remainder of our time. I think a vote is now in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent).

The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we have advised the Senate that the \nSenator from Rhode Island, Mr. Reed, will have an amendment.\n  Mr. President, if the Senator is ready to send his amendment to the \ndesk, then I would like to send up a second-degree amendment, and we \nwill proceed.\n  Mr. REED addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Virginia yield the \nfloor?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3354\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3354.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Reed] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3354.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To require baselines for and testing of block configurations \n                of the Ballistic Missile Defense System)\n\n       On page 33, after line 25, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 224. BASELINES AND OPERATIONAL TEST AND EVALUATION FOR \n                   BALLISTIC MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM.\n\n       (a) Operational Tests.--(1) The Director of the Missile \n     Defense Agency shall prepare for and conduct, on an \n     independent basis, operationally realistic tests of each \n     block configuration of the Ballistic Missile Defense System \n     being fielded.\n       (2) The tests shall be designed to permit the evaluation of \n     each block configuration of the Ballistic Missile Defense \n     System being fielded by the Director of Operational Test and \n     Evaluation.\n       (3) The Director of the Missile Defense Agency shall carry \n     out tests under paragraph (1) through an independent agent, \n     assigned by the Director for such purpose, who shall plan and \n     manage such tests.\n       (b) Approval of Plans for Tests.--The Secretary of Defense \n     shall assign the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation \n     the responsibility for approving each plan for tests \n     developed under subsection (a).\n       (c) Evaluation.--(1) The Director of Operational Test and \n     Evaluation shall evaluate the results of each test conducted \n     under subsection (a) as soon as practicable after the \n     completion of such test.\n       (2) The Director shall submit to the Secretary of Defense \n     and the congressional defense committees a report on the \n     evaluation of each test conducted under subsection (a) upon \n     completion of the evaluation of such test under paragraph \n     (1).\n       (d) Cost, Schedule, and Performance Baselines.--(1) The \n     Director of the Missile Defense Agency shall establish cost, \n     schedule, and performance baselines for each block \n     configuration of the Ballistic Missile Defense System being \n     fielded. The cost baseline for a block configuration shall \n     include full life cycle costs for the block configuration.\n       (2) The Director shall include the baselines established \n     under paragraph (1) in the first Selected Acquisition Report \n     for the Ballistic Missile Defense System that is submitted to \n     Congress under section 2432 of title 10, United States Code, \n     after the establishment of such baselines.\n       (3) The Director shall also include in the Selected \n     Acquisition Report submitted to Congress under paragraph (2) \n     the significant assumptions used in determining the \n     performance baseline under paragraph (1), including any \n     assumptions regarding threat missile countermeasures and \n     decoys.\n       (e) Variations Against Baselines.--In the event the cost, \n     schedule, or performance of any block configuration of the \n     Ballistic Missile Defense System varies significantly (as \n     determined by the Director of the Ballistic Missile Defense \n     Agency) from the applicable baseline established under \n     subsection (d), the Director shall include such variation, \n     and the reasons for such variation, in the Selected \n     Acquisition Report submitted to Congress under section 2432 \n     of title 10, United States Code.\n       (f) Modifications of Baselines.--In the event the Director \n     of the Missile Defense Agency elects to undertake any \n     modification of a baseline established under subsection (d), \n     the Director shall submit to the congressional defense \n     committees a report setting forth the reasons for such \n     modification.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3453 To Amendment No. 3354\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, at this time I send an amendment to the \ndesk in the second degree to the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the second-degree \namendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3453 to amendment No. 3354.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To require the Secretary of Defense to prescribe and apply \n criteria for operationally realistic testing of fieldable prototypes \n           developed under ballistic missile defense program)\n\n       In the matter proposed to be inserted, strike subsections \n     (a) and (b) and insert the following:\n       (a) Testing Criteria.--Not later than February 1, 2005, the \n     Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Director of \n     Operational Test and Evaluation, shall prescribe appropriate \n     criteria for operationally realistic testing of fieldable \n     prototypes developed under the ballistic missile defense \n     spiral development program. The Secretary shall submit a copy \n     of the prescribed criteria to the congressional defense \n     committees.\n       (b) Use of Criteria.--(1) The Secretary of Defense shall \n     ensure that, not later than October 1, 2005, a test of the \n     ballistic missile defense system is conducted consistent with \n     the criteria prescribed under subsection (a).\n       (2) The Secretary of Defense shall ensure that each block \n     configuration of the ballistic missile defense system is \n     tested consistent with the criteria prescribed under \n     subsection (a).\n       (c) Relationship to Other Law.--Nothing in this section \n     shall be construed to exempt any spiral development program \n     of the Department of Defense, after completion of the spiral \n     development, from the applicability of any provision of \n     chapter 144 of title 10, United States Code, or section 139, \n     181, 2366, 2399, or 2400 of such title in accordance with the \n     terms and conditions of such provision.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we would be happy, on this side, to work \nout a time agreement as soon as the Senator from Rhode Island is able \nto indicate to us the amount of time he desires. We will quickly \nrespond as to the amount of time we would desire.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I think if I could have an hour on my side.\n\n[[Page S6929]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I say to the Senator, an entire hour on your side?\n  Mr. REED. I would not attempt to simply fill the hour. I would yield \nback time if we have reached a point where we have sufficiently \ndiscussed it.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would request we have an hour on this \nside, with the expectation we will be able to yield time back.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia has the floor and \nmakes a unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am happy to yield to the Senator for \npurposes of a statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Michigan wish to be \nrecognized?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, the suggestion of an hour on this side relative to the \nReed amendment, would that include the proposed time for the second-\ndegree amendment to be offered by Senator Warner? Does the hour that \nyou have estimated you would need include time for debate on the Warner \nsecond degree?\n  The next question is this: If the Warner second-degree amendment \nprevails, which is a substitute, then the question is, Would the hour \nthat you are referring to, then--without seeing, knowing exactly what \nwould be in the second-degree amendment that would be offered--cover \nthe debate time for your second-degree amendment to the substitute?\n  Mr. REED. If I may respond, it would be appropriate if we took an \nhour debating both the Reed first degree and the Warner second degree. \nAt the conclusion of a vote on the Warner second-degree amendment, then \nthere would be no time agreement entered into. It would be my intention \nto offer----\n  Mr. LEVIN. If that substitute were adopted----\n  Mr. REID. Could I be recognized? Would anybody be insulted if I asked \nfor a quorum call?\n  Mr. WARNER. No.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we are moving along in a very cooperative \nspirit. We are going to ask for a time agreement on the Reed amendment \nand the Warner second-degree amendment as a package. They will be \nconsidered in the course of 2 hours, hopefully less. At the conclusion \nof the debate on these two amendments, we will then proceed to a record \nvote on the Warner amendment. In the event the Warner amendment \nprevails, then the Chair would recognize the Senator from Rhode Island \nfor the purpose of a perfecting amendment, which he has a right to do \nunder the rules, but in order to keep the sequence moving, I would like \nto advise the Senate that it would be done in that way. At this time, \nuntil we see the perfecting amendment, we cannot set a time agreement \non that. But it would be my hope that we can move along expeditiously, \nfirst by crunching the 2 hours to less, moving to a vote, and then the \nperfecting amendment and concluding, hopefully, a brief colloquy, \ndebate on that, and vote, if that becomes necessary. Have I correctly \nstated it?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, of course, there would be no amendments in \norder to either of the amendments, the one of Senator Reed or your \nsecond degree.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct. But there would be in order an amendment \nto the perfecting amendment.\n  Mr. REID. I understand that. I have no objection to that. We have no \nobjection to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. So the Chair gets it straight, if the Senator \nfrom Virginia could clarify, this is a request for a 2-hour time \nagreement on the second-degree amendment?\n  Mr. WARNER. Let me try that again. We have before the Senate at this \ntime the underlying Reed amendment. We have the Warner amendment in the \nsecond degree. We ask for an hour on each. At the conclusion of that \nperiod of time, which I hope will be less than 2 hours, the Senate \nwould proceed to a record vote on the Warner amendment. I am asking for \nthe yeas and nays incorporated in this. After that is taken, the Chair \nwould then recognize the Senator from Rhode Island for the purpose \npresumably of offering a perfecting amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, however, if the Warner amendment does not \npass, then we would vote on the underlying Reed amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Immediately.\n  Mr. WARNER. Immediately.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that following the \nvotes or vote, whatever the case may be, there will be probably a \nnumber of judges we might be called to vote on. My point is at around 3 \nor thereabouts, there could be a series of as many as four or five \nvotes.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is a leadership request, I so advise the Democratic \nwhip.\n  Mr. REID. It is not a unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. WARNER. It is just an advisory for Senators. But I understand \nthat my leader will be making that request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia asked for the yeas \nand nays on the second-degree amendment; is that correct?\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Are the yeas and nays ordered on the underlying amendment \nof the Senator from Rhode Island? If not, I so ask.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair informs the Senator, it is not in \norder to request the yeas and nays on the first-degree amendment at \nthis time without consent.\n  Does the Senator from Virginia yield the floor?\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time under the unanimous consent \nagreement?\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise to offer an amendment which would implement the \nrecommendations of the General Accounting Office for missile defense \ntesting and base alignment. Last month the GAO issued a report on \nmissile defense entitled ``Missile Defense Actions Are Needed To \nEnhance Testing And Accountability.'' In its report, the GAO makes some \ncommonsense recommendations to improve the testing of missile defense \nand to increase accountability of Congress for missile defense \nprogramming.\n  The principal recommendation is that at some point there is developed \nand executed a plan for operational testing. That is a very critical \npoint. As the GAO pointed out, they would recommend to the Missile \nDefense Agency that they prepare for and conduct, on an independent \nbasis, not within the purview of the Missile Defense Agency but on an \nindependent basis, operationally realistic tests of those missile \ndefenses. This is the way we develop and deploy major weapons systems \nin the United States. We do initial testing. We prove out the \ntechnologies. But before we field them, we go ahead and do a test on \ntheir operational capacities. That is the basic approach. It is a good \napproach, a sound approach. The GAO recommendations would make the \nmissile defense programs consistent in this regard with all other \nprograms.\n  The second aspect of the proposed amendment would be to require the \nMissile Defense Agency to require course baselines so that we know how \nmuch we are spending with respect to missile defense. We know what the \ncourse goals are. We know when they are exceeded or when they are \nconstrained by good planning and good management. These are two \nfundamental aspects of any sound military procurement program.\n  Missile defense is one of the most complicated programs we will ever \nattempt to field in the history of this country.\n  I believe it is appropriate at this juncture to take a look at this \nmissile defense system as it exists today. I think you will hopefully \nconcur with\n\n[[Page S6930]]\n\nme that we do need some realistic operational testing.\n  First, this is the basic architecture of the system. The system we \nare deploying in Alaska is designed principally, if not exclusively, to \ncounter one potential threat--the threat of a missile coming from North \nKorea. Now, the system is composed of several major elements. I will \nreview them.\n  First is the DSP early warning satellite. This is a defense system \nthat has been flying since the 1970s. It is well proven, but \nessentially all this system does is spot the lift-off of an enemy \nmissile, or potential adversary missile, coming out of North Korea or \nanyplace else. It was put up in the 1970s as part of the cold war to \nidentify a Russian missile or Chinese missile being ignited. That is a \nrather established technology. It provides just the cue that an enemy \nmissile has been launched.\n  The next part of the proposed system is the Aegis ships. They have \nradar, but it was designed not to track ICBMs. Rather, it is to track \ncruise missiles and close-in aircraft. They are being essentially \npushed into the role of trying to acquire the target after it lifts off \nand track it as far as it can. It really cannot track that far because \nof built-in limitations. Again, this version was not designed to track \nlong-range ICBMs. Their radar doesn't seem to be powerful enough to \nprotect and track accurately to places such as Hawaii. Also, these \nAegis ships have never guided an interceptor to its target in a single \nintercept test. They have done preliminary activities but have not \nguided an interceptor to a target in a test. The operational tracking \nsoftware of Aegis has never been tested in an integrated test. So you \nhave one element that is still not quite up to the speed we would like \nit to be in terms of the Aegis system.\n  The next part is the Cobra Dane radar system in Alaska. Cobra Dane is \nanother 1970s version. It has been updated, but it has no real \ndiscrimination capability in terms of determining what a missile \nwarhead would be or what a decoy would be. It is incapable of tracking \na North Korean missile bound for Hawaii. So, again, we have a problem \nin terms of providing coverage. It has never been used in an intercept \ntest, and there are no plans to do so because we do not have an ICBM \ntarget that can fly in Cobra Dane's field of view. Then we were going \nto have to replace Cobra Dane and x-band radar on Shemya Island. We \ndon't have the x-based, land-based system. We are working on a sea-\nbased x-band radar, not primarily for operational use but for test use, \nto be ready in fiscal year 2005.\n  The final one is the interceptor with the kill vehicle on top. Both \nthe interceptor and kill vehicle are brand-new, and neither have been \ntested together in an intercept test. The new version of the kill \nvehicle hasn't been flight tested at all. It is coming off of \nproduction. There are new systems within the kill vehicle. It is an \nimprovement, we hope, over the previous prototypes but has not yet been \nflight tested. Problems with the kill vehicle are seen as delaying the \nnext scheduled test. That is the IFT-13c. That test is being touted by \nthe Missile Defense Agency as a fly-by. So the next test--the one \nbefore this system is declared deployable and deployed--is not designed \nto knock the missile down but to simply fly by it. If it does knock it \ndown, I am sure the Missile Defense Agency will take great pleasure in \nit, with great claim. By declaring it just a fly-by, they will have \nwiggle room for saying the test succeeded and saying we didn't intend \nto knock it down either. Ask yourself, if we are deploying a missile \nsystem in a most recent test to fly by the missile, is that going to \nprotect the U.S.? I don't think that is the case.\n\n  My amendment would require that we do operational testing, which is \nsomething done on every major system. It is under the purview of Dr. \nTom Christie in the Office of Test and Evaluation at the Department of \nDefense. He is charged by Congress with independently evaluating these \nsystems on behalf of the Defense Department.\n  Some argue that we need to go ahead and deploy this system right \naway, that we have done it before, and that is fine. It turns out that \nwe have deployed systems before in emergencies, such as the Predator in \nKosovo in 1999. That system had already on the books operational \ntesting plans. Indeed, when this emergency deployment was completed, \nthat operational test was carried out the following year, 2000. This \nsystem is a rudimentary system with huge gaps in technology, which has \nnever been fully tested on an integrated basis. None of these parts \nhave been put together in one intercept test yet. This system has no \nplans for operational testing, which denies the obvious point of the \ncustom and practice and the law in many cases.\n  The JSTAR surveillance system is another one which individuals will \nsay was put into the fray before it was operationally tested. That is \nalso true. In 1991, JSTARs were deployed in Desert Storm. Following the \ndeployment, even though the Senate Armed Services Committee was so \nimpressed that they wanted to deploy it without testing, the Air Force \ninsisted upon operational testing. They found defects because of the \ntesting. They completed the operational testing in 1995, and this \ntesting revealed problems with respect to the inability to operate at \nthe right altitude and inadequate mission reliability. These were \ncorrected, so the JSTAR system is much more reliable today than it \nwould have been without operational testing.\n  Once again, this system is untested in a systematic way, and it is \nnot even scheduled for operational testing. The point of my amendment \nis not to delay or defer this deployment; it is simply to say at some \npoint in time--some point when the Missile Defense Agency feels they \nare ready for operational testing--we should at least have operational \ntesting. I believe that is absolutely critical.\n  There are examples now, too, of the tests that have been conducted. \nThese suggest that the tests are not up to the level of operational \ntesting. For example, for the tests conducted so far on this system, \nall of the targets have had beacons on them, telling the National \nMissile Defense Agency and the shooters, if you will, the exact \nlocation of the missiles coming in. I don't think anybody believes that \nan adversary would put a beacon on the missile to warn us. Those are \nthe types of rudimentary tests taking place today. They are important \ntests but not operational tests. Indeed, I asked the Director of the \nMDA in March when we would stop using beacons on our target vehicles. \nHe simply said he didn't know. That is not exactly the kind of \nrealistic testing the General Accounting Office called for.\n  I mentioned Cobra Dane, which is the radar that is a critical piece. \nIt will track this target for a long way, and it would hopefully be \nable to discriminate between decoys and the actual warheads. But we \nhave, as I mentioned before, no plans to test this radar because we \nlack an appropriate testing vehicle, ICBM.\n\n  The other point, which is very important--and it goes to the heart of \nrealistic testing--is that every intelligence analyst who looks at this \nproblem has suggested that if a nation is capable of putting a nuclear \ndevice on a long-range missile, and particularly if they are so \nmotivated to use it against us, they are likely to be just as capable \nof having sophisticated decoys or even rudimentary decoys on the \nmissile.\n  We have never conducted tests against very sophisticated or even \nrealistic decoys. As a result, we are prepared to deploy a system that \nhas not been adequately tested. But more importantly, there are no \nplans to adequately test it.\n  My amendment would simply ask the Department of Defense, through the \nnormal procedures, through the Office of Test and Evaluation, to \nprepare such plans and conduct those tests when appropriate.\n  These are just some of the examples I have given with respect to this \nparticular system. There is a whole laundry list of what should be done \nto ensure that this system, when deployed, is appropriately ready for \nthe challenge. This chart shows yes and no in terms of obvious \nparameters for a system that is about to be fielded. Most of the \nparameters have not been accomplished. In fact, the vast majority have \nnot been accomplished.\n  There is no full system operational test. There are no tests, to my \nmind, that have integrated every part of this system, from Cobra Dane, \nthe Aegis warships, to the interceptor with the new-kill vehicle with \nthe new booster\n\n[[Page S6931]]\n\nattached and flying out and engaging a target.\n  There is no full system operational test scheduled. We are not \ntalking about a situation where we have to wait a few months or a year \nand there is an operational test planned for. By the way, these \noperational tests are not something that can be done on 2 or 3 days' \nnotice. These takes months and months to prepare and plan and are \nextremely costly.\n  I do not really know, because it is hard to figure out the budget for \nMDA, whether they have put aside money for operational testing. It is \nhard to tell. We are not even scheduling these tests.\n  It has not been tested in bad weather. It has not been tested at \nnight. Experts in the field indicate that is a very important aspect of \nensuring the system will work.\n  Again, I do not think there is any American who does not want to see \na workable system in place, but we have to raise questions when we have \nnot done the testing to assure the American public that this system \nwill work and will work as it is designed to work.\n  Tested three-stage booster and intercept test: This new package of \nthe booster and kill vehicle has not been tested yet.\n  Tested without interceptor knowing in advance warheads infrared and \nradar signature, I mentioned that before. All of the data of the enemy \nwarhead is essentially given to the forces that are trying to engage \nit. That is not a realistic test.\n  It has not been tested against a tumbling warhead, when the warhead \ndetaches from the boost vehicle and spinning. That has not been tested.\n  Tested against realistic decoys and countermeasures: Realistic decoys \nwould be something that looked like a warhead; just one other body that \nlooks like a warhead. We have not done that. The decoys that have been \nused to date have been large spheres that look completely unlike the \nwarhead.\n\n  It has not been tested against complex decoys. These are much more \nsophisticated decoys. We certainly have not done that. We have not \nreached the realistic level, let alone the complex level.\n  It has not been tested against more than one warhead on a missile. \nAgain, if there is a nation out there that is capable of producing a \nnuclear warhead and putting it on a missile, they are probably \ncapable--it may take a little longer--of producing multiple warheads \nand putting them on a missile.\n  It has not been tested against more than one incoming missile. If \nNorth Korea is going to attack us, why would they do something that \nwould spell doom, first because of our overwhelming power to deter \nthem, but second, what makes us think they will fire just one missile \nat us? I would assume they would fire multiple missiles, and we have \nnot tested against that.\n  Again I mention this, we have not tested this without a GPS system, a \nbeacon on the adversary missile and warhead.\n  Tests have been conducted by the contractors and managers. That is \nthe first ``yes'' accomplished.\n  Tests overseen by Pentagon's independent test office: No, and that is \nthe core of our debate today, because looking at the chairman's \namendment to my amendment, what they are essentially saying is: Listen, \nwe do not want the independent tester to look at this; we want the \nSecretary of Defense to prescribe this. That is not the way to do this \nbecause it just invites all of the problems with individuals testing \nthemselves.\n  This is not as much a technical problem as a problem of human nature. \nYou tend to pass every test you give yourself, particularly if it is \nimportant you pass the test. That is why we set up, in the eighties, \nthis Office of Test and Evaluation with an individual who is appointed \nby the President, not the Secretary of Defense, to conduct these tests.\n  SBIRS high early warning satellites: This will be the follow-on to \nthe DSP satellites. SBIRS is not yet flying. The original plan was to \nhave SBIRS in this system instead of the old DSP system.\n  SSTS space tracking and surveillance system: This is another system \nnot in place.\n  Cobra Dane radar upgraded: Yes, it has been upgraded, but not the x-\nband radar contemplated for this system. It does not have the power of \nthe x-band. Even with this upgrade, it is still not capable of the \ndiscrimination that you need to separate decoys from the warheads.\n  The ground-based x-band radar I mentioned is not deployed. It has \nbeen essentially canceled.\n  Sea-based x-band radar is being developed. It is not yet deployed.\n  Question: Will it protect Hawaii? It is a question because of the \ncoverage of the Cobra Dane, because the fact the Aegis system is \nproviding an important part of the tracking system.\n  Fly before you buy: We are certainly violating that. We are buying \nthe system without flying. That is the fundamental problem we are \nfacing today. Yet we are going to declare the system operational. We \ncan argue about that, and we have. Senator Boxer had an amendment which \ntalked to that specifically.\n  My amendment is not about deploying the system. My amendment is about \nconducting operational tests at some juncture. I believe this \noperational testing scheme has hit a nerve because, as I saw the \nchairman's substitute to my amendment, he basically said yes, we will \ndo operational--in fact, he specifies a date. I believe it is October \nof 2005. That is pretty ambitious since we are not planning for any \ntests yet. It is also pretty ambitious since we do not have a suitable \nmissile target vehicle that could fly from the vicinity of North Korea \nand go through the space in which Cobra Dane operates.\n  As a result, in a very short time, we would have to build a target \nmissile, we would have to plan for the test, and we would have to \nintegrate all these other pieces. Yet that is what the amendment \noffered by my colleague from Virginia would say.\n  The problem with the amendment is that it takes out of the loop the \none person who is there to guarantee the independence, the rigor, and \nthe accuracy of this test, and that is the Director of the Office of \nTest and Evaluation at the Pentagon. That is something I think is \ncritical.\n  Again, given this list of items to be accomplished, it seems stunning \nto me that we are actually debating about whether we should just \nauthorize and require at some point--and at this point, after \ndeployment--operational testing, or at least to plan it. But that is \nthe substance of the debate, and just as importantly, not just the \noperational testing, but the fact it is going to be conducted by an \nindependent agency within the Pentagon, not by the people who are \ngraded by whether they pass or fail. Again, not high tech but human \nnature. I think more people are comfortable with having someone \nobjectively design the test and supervise the test than having the \npeople who have everything to lose and everything to gain do that.\n  There is one other aspect of my amendment I want to mention, which is \nimportant, and that is the notion of baselines. The GAO came back to us \nand said: No one seems to know how much the system is costing because \nthere are no baselines.\n  They pointed out, for example, that there was a $1 billion overrun of \nthe cost goal of missile defense to be fielded starting in September, \nbut the Department of Defense never explained to Congress this overrun. \nInstead, they simply changed the cost goal.\n  How can we evaluate this system? How can we make difficult choices \nbetween investing in missile defense and increasing the end strength of \nour Army, if MDA suddenly says, well, our objective was X, but we found \nit cost us a billion dollars more, so now it is X plus one billion? We \nhave to have a baseline. This is all designed to have appropriate \ncontrol and appropriate notification to the Congress about the status \nof this very complex system.\n  Additionally, this cost goal change was surprising because the GAO \nalso noted that originally the system in Alaska to be deployed in \nSeptember was to have 10 interceptors, and now it is 5. So not only did \nthey change the cost goal by increasing the amount of money they are \nspending, but they lowered the number of interceptors and also, I think \nby fair inference, the capability of the system. High cost, lower \ncapability, but yet it was not communicated to us.\n  My amendment would ask them to prepare the baseline, to communicate \nto us when those baselines are exceeded. If we do not have that, then \nwe will\n\n[[Page S6932]]\n\nnot have the ability to do our job, which is to supervise appropriately \nand oversee the activities of the Missile Defense Agency in the \ndevelopment of this very complicated system.\n  There has been a great debate about whether we should deploy this \nsystem. I found it interesting to note that President Reagan was \napproached years ago by some Congressmen and Congresswomen who wanted \nto deploy then the existing system. This was in August of 1986. \nAccording to the Frances Fitzgerald's book about President Reagan ``Way \nOut There in the Blue,'' here is what he told those Congressmen:\n\n       I know there are those who are getting a bit antsy [to \n     deploy a missile defense] but to deploy systems of limited \n     effectiveness now would divert limited funds and delay our \n     main research. It could well erode support for the program \n     before it's permitted to reach its potential.\n\n  Once again, we are not debating today the deployment in this \namendment. We have had that debate previously with Senator Boxer. We \nare not debating deployment. We are simply debating let us plan to do \nthe operational testing. Let us get that operational testing done at \nsome point because otherwise we are literally getting a system that is \nuntried. No one wants the first time this system is fully operationally \ntested to be in the deplorable and horrific situation of a missile \nheading toward us.\n  So I would hope that we could, in fact, adopt the Reed amendment, \nhave operational testing planned for it, have baselines established to \nbe able to monitor this system as we should and be able, I hope, to \nassure the American public that when we say it is in service, it will \nwork. There is a difference between telling them it works and proving \nit in operational and realistic testing. I hope we can do that.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time in response to my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields the floor and reserves the \nremainder of his time.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Reed amendment \nthat was before us prior to the amendment from Senator Warner, and I \nwant to talk about that briefly. Then I want to talk about the second-\ndegree amendment by Senator Warner.\n  With respect to the Reed amendment, from my standpoint and the \nstandpoint of the Missile Defense Agency and the Pentagon's office of \nTest and Evaluation and Formal Operation, tests at this juncture simply \nwould not be helpful.\n  According to a letter I received on May 17, 2004--and I think this is \nthe most current position--the letter from the Pentagon's Director of \nOperational Test and Evaluation, Mr. Tom Christie, in response to \nseveral questions I asked him, Mr. Christie writes--he is the chief \ntester we referred to, and he is responsible for overseeing much of the \ntesting that goes on at the Department of Defense and obviously has a \ndeep interest in what is happening as far as accountability in the \nmissile defense system.\n  Mr. Christie writes, and this is important:\n\n       The Ground-based Midcourse Defense element is currently at \n     a maturity level that requires continued developmental \n     testing with oversight and assistance from operational test \n     personnel.\n\n  I would add at this point that the Missile Defense Agency is \ncurrently stressing the system is involved in every developmental test \nto ensure that they are as realistic as possible.\n  Mr. Christie continues in his letter:\n\n       Conducting realistic operational testing in the near-term \n     for the GMD element would be premature and not beneficial to \n     the program.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that his letter of May 17, 2004, be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Office of the Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 17, 2004.\n     Hon. Wayne Allard,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Allard: Thank you for your May 11, 2004, \n     letter concerning my role in the Ballistic Missile Defense \n     System (BMDS).\n       The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is building a BMDS test \n     bed that is essential to support realistic testing, and is \n     absolutely essential for conducting adequate operational \n     testing in the future. The test bed is also key to developing \n     operational concepts, techniques, and procedures, while \n     allowing my office to exploit and characterize its inherent \n     defensive capability.\n       The Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) element is \n     currently at a maturity level that requires continued \n     developmental testing with oversight and assistance from \n     operational test personnel. Conducting realistic operational \n     testing in the near-term for the GMD element would be \n     premature and not beneficial to the program.\n       My office has unprecedented access to GMD, and I am \n     satisfied with the cooperation between the program office and \n     the test community. I will continue to advise the Secretary \n     of Defense and the Director, MDA, on the BMDS test program. I \n     will also provide my characterization of system capabilities, \n     and my assessment of test program adequacy annually, as \n     required by Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Thomas P. Christie,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, \nMr. Christie expressed his support for the approach the Missile Defense \nAgency is taking to incorporate operational realism in the \ndevelopmental test and is conducting, in his words, continuous \noperational assessments of the ballistic missile defense system.\n  We must consider that missile defense is a capabilities-based spiral \ndevelopment evolutionary acquisition program--this is a mouthful--and \nunder this approach the missile defense programs are designed to focus \non developing capabilities to meet a range of possible threats. These \nprograms are developed incrementally in blocks with the recognition \nthat full capability would not be reached in the first block.\n  Missile defense does not have a final architecture that is defined in \nthe first block but will continue to evolve over time. Therefore, \ntesting of the system should occur as we continue to develop it.\n  We should also consider rethinking how we do formal tests and \nevaluation. Formal operational testing carries with it certain \nrequirements. There can be no developmental goals because of that. \nContractors cannot be involved.\n  The Director of Operational Test and Evaluation must approve the \noperational test plans. Even the current Director of Operational Test \nand Evaluation recognizes the need to adopt a new acquisition paradigm \nfor tests and evaluation.\n  Here is what Mr. Christie said about that in his speech just 2 months \nago:\n\n       The concept of milestone driven operational test and \n     evaluation appears to be becoming a process of the past. \n     Either we change our way of doing business, adapt to the new \n     acquisition paradigms and the realities of the war on \n     terrorism, or we will find ourselves becoming irrelevant with \n     dire consequences for our operational forces. . . . Users \n     need up to the minute, continuous test and evaluation to keep \n     them informed of system capabilities and limitations. Even \n     after fielding, the acquisition community needs continuous \n     evaluation to feed spiral development and other evolutionary \n     acquisition concepts.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of Mr. Christie's speech be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Test and Evaluation in the ``New World of 2004''--Tuesday, March 2\n\n                   (By the Honorable Thomas Christie)\n\n       Let me express my thanks to Gen. Farrell and the leadership \n     of NDIA for, once again, affording me the opportunity to \n     discuss with you some of my views and concerns with T I \n     have had the opportunity to do this for the last two years, \n     and recall that, when I spoke in Savannah [March 2002], I \n     warned you that I might sound like a ``stick-in-the-mud'' or \n     some sort of Cassandra because I couldn't help but say that I \n     had seen and heard all this acquisition reform stuff before. \n     I'm not sure my remarks here this morning will paint a much \n     different picture than I presented in my talk in Savannah, \n     where I contended that the problems we face as operational \n     testers may have to take different forms than previously, but \n     remain formidable. Recall that the Cassandra I referred to \n     was a princess of Troy who could foresee the future--but the \n     penalty for her gift was that the Gods made it so that no one \n     would believe her. If you don't believe--I will understand.\n       The theme for this Conference is ``Operational Test and \n     Evaluation: Twenty Years and Counting: Doing OT Better \n     After Twenty Years of Practice.'' That title seems\n\n[[Page S6933]]\n\n     to imply two things: that we are doing OT better after \n     twenty years and that we have been doing OT only in the \n     last twenty years. Our conference chairman, Jim O'Bryon has \n     assembled many of the historic--I won't say ancient--\n     personalities in the field. I challenge each of them to \n     demonstrate that we are doing OT better after twenty years \n     of so-called practice. I would offer my observation--or at \n     least concern--that program offices and developers appear at \n     times to be learning faster how to avoid testing then we are \n     learning to do it better. This conference should consider \n     that.\n       I think Jim may have confused the ``Practice makes \n     Perfect'' adage with the professional use of the word \n     practice. Doctors have a practice; and I always worry about \n     that when I go to them. I don't want them to practice on ME. \n     For a variety of reasons, Program Managers don't want T to \n     be practiced on them either. I know Walt Hollis used to think \n     that they taught ``Test Avoidance 101'' to program managers \n     at the Defense Systems Management College.\n       This morning, I thought it would be appropriate for us to \n     spend some time thinking about the history of OT in \n     preparation for the insight to be offered by the elder \n     statesmen that you will hear from over the next few days: \n     first, the early reform efforts that set the stage for the \n     creation of DOT then, a little bit of history of the \n     office itself, and I am sure that we will get more of that \n     during the conference because all the living DOT will be \n     here; then, finally, we should discuss some of the challenges \n     that the fast changing acquisition process and \n     accompanying practices are posing.\n\n\n                          early reform efforts\n\n       While I know that the theme of this conference is about the \n     twentieth anniversary of the law on OT, for me, OT's \n     relevance to OSD goes back, not twenty years, but well over \n     thirty years. The 1970 Blue Ribbon Defense Panel, also known \n     as the Fitzhugh Commission, addressed a whole host of defense \n     management issues, to include ``Defense acquisition policies \n     and practices, particularly as they relate to costs, time and \n     quality.''\n       This Commission found the acquisition strategies in being \n     then to be ``highly inflexible . . . and also based on the \n     false premise that technological difficulties can be foreseen \n     prior to the detailed engineering effort on specific \n     hardware.''\n       With respect to OT, the Blue Ribbon Presidential \n     Commission made several cogent observations. Let me, once \n     again, recall for you four of them, because they relate to \n     early involvement by operational testers, joint test \n     capability, and T funding--all of which are coming around \n     again as important issues:\n       It has been customary to think of OT in terms of physical \n     testing. While operational testing is a very important \n     activity . . . it is emphasized that the goal is operational \n     evaluation and that physical testing is only one means of \n     attaining that goal. This is an important point, since it is \n     often argued that operational testing must await production \n     of an adequate number of operationally-configured systems; \n     and, by this time, it is too late to use the information \n     gathered to help decide whether to procure the new system or \n     even influence in any significance way the nature of the \n     system procured.\n       If OT, as a total process, is to be effective, it must \n     extend over the entire life cycle of a system, from initial \n     requirements to extending its life by adaptation to new uses. \n     It must use analytical studies, operations research, systems \n     analysis, component testing, testing of other systems, and \n     eventually testing of the system itself.\n       There is no effective method for conducting OT that cuts \n     across Service lines although, in most actual combat \n     environments, the U.S. must conduct combined operations.\n       Because funds earmarked for OT do not have separate \n     status in the budget, or in program elements, they are often \n     vulnerable to diversion to other purposes.\n\n\n                             dot history\n\n       Some ten or more years after the recommendations of the \n     Fitzhugh Commission, the Congress perceived a lack of \n     responsiveness on the part of the Office of the Secretary of \n     Defense with respect to the call for an independent entity \n     overseeing and reporting on OT Congress then legislated \n     the creation of the D,OT in 1983. As many of us recall, the \n     Congressional Military Reform Caucus of the 1980s played the \n     key role in this initiative. Among the players in that reform \n     caucus and that legislation were names you would still \n     recognize: Dave Pryor, Bill Roth, Nancy Kassenbaum, Denny \n     Smith, Dick Cheney, Newt Gingrich, . . . They pushed through \n     legislation that created the DOT over the adamant \n     objections of the Pentagon, particularly from the acquisition \n     office at that time. Over the past twenty years, these \n     reformers and their successors have protected the office and \n     the independence of OT from continued pressures to \n     eliminate or downgrade its function and to vitiate the \n     independence and influence of the OT community throughout \n     the Department.\n       To my three predecessors as DOT, we testers as well as \n     the men and women in our combat forces owe a great debt of \n     gratitude for their courageous efforts in protecting and \n     nourishing the independence and relevance of OT Over the \n     years, each in some way stood up when it counted and made \n     significant contributions to strengthened testing in the \n     Department.\n       It took over a year and a half after the landmark \n     legislation of 1983 to actually get the DOT office up and \n     running and to bring the first Director--Jack Krings--on-\n     board.\n       Jack did a masterful job of putting the office together and \n     on its feet. He took the initiative--against the grain in \n     most cases--to initiate many of the processes and activities \n     that we take for granted now: the notion of Early Operational \n     Assessments; responsive reports on systems to the decision-\n     makers in the building and on the Hill; the Central T \n     Investment Program; and DOT oversight of the Automated \n     Information Systems.\n       Cliff Duncan, who headed the office during the first \n     President Bush's administration, expanded on many of Jack's \n     initiatives, pushed earlier involvement by OTers and enhanced \n     the evaluation capabilities of the organization with \n     particular focus on Independent Evaluations by DOT\n       In the 1990s, when the budgets for testing and the \n     infrastructure were being slashed by the Services, there was \n     not a greater champion for testing than Phil Coyle. And I \n     believe his vision for ``testing as learning'' and ``making \n     it all count'' will continue to guide DOT as it adapts \n     to new acquisition strategies.\n       Over the years, we've developed a ritual here at the NDIA \n     Conference. That is, every year we give Phil Coyle a copy of \n     the Annual Report. We won't disappoint him this year. Here is \n     your very own copy. All the rest of you will be able to see \n     what is in it early tomorrow, when it appears on Phil's web \n     site.\n       One thing that Phil tried very hard to promote while he was \n     the DOT was the proper use of models and situations. It fit \n     in well with the Blue Ribbon Panel comment: that the goal is \n     operational evaluation and that physical testing is only one \n     means of attaining that goal. He had one of the most \n     favorable environments in which to promote modeling and \n     simulation that will be around for many administrations: the \n     use of modeling and simulation in T became one of the \n     ``Bill Perry's Themes.'' But, in the end, despite Phil's \n     dedicated efforts, I contend that modeling and simulation in \n     support of T has been a mixed bag, at best.\n\n\n my legacy: early involvement, no surprises and the warfighter as the \n                                customer\n\n       As I walked through this short history, you may have \n     wondered what my hopes and desires for the office are. Making \n     early involvement pay off, cutting down on surprises, better \n     serving the operator--these are among my hopes.\n       Of course, early involvement is not new to DOT Jack \n     Krings did the first early operational assessment, and Phil \n     Coyle worked hard to great effect to make it the normal way \n     of doing business. There is tremendous power that comes from \n     having operational testers involved early. Some of that power \n     is technical, and some of it comes from the added credibility \n     of having an independent tester looking at the system from \n     the outset.\n       Obviously, if operational testers, to include my office, \n     are involved in programs from the outset--reviewing \n     requirements or desired capabilities; developing and \n     assessing test plans, to include development testing; \n     participating in critical design reviews; monitoring closely \n     DT along with the deficiencies and corrections that arise \n     from it--all of these efforts help to preclude the big \n     surprises at the last stage of programs that operational \n     testers are blamed for.\n\n\n                     the warfighter is the customer\n\n       Another direction that I have emphasized is a refocus on \n     who our customer really is. The operational test community, \n     to include DOT, should consider the prime customer for \n     its efforts to be the user--the men and women in the \n     trenches, on-board the ships, flying our fighter/attack \n     aircraft, maintaining our complex systems, etc., etc. We \n     are in an era where we are rushing to field new equipment \n     to the warfighters in the Global War on Terrorism. We need \n     to be timely and we need to tell it like it is in \n     informing them of the capabilities and limitations of the \n     new system they are being asked to employ in the field.\n       In that context, I see a critical need to expand our \n     contacts with operational users across-the-board and to \n     cultivate them as principal recipients of our assessments. \n     Right or wrong, the concept of milestone-driven OT appears \n     to be becoming a process of the past. Either we change our \n     way of doing business, adapt to the new acquisition paradigms \n     and the realities of the war on terrorism, or we will find \n     ourselves becoming irrelevant with dire consequences for our \n     operational forces. When so many of our systems go to war \n     before IOT and before full rate production, users need up-\n     to-the-minute, continuous T to keep them informed of system \n     capabilities and limitations. Even after fielding, the \n     acquisition community needs continuous evaluation to feed \n     spiral development and other evolutionary acquisition \n     concepts.\n\n\n                      mission focus/joint testing\n\n       Also important, I would like to continue the evolving \n     improvements to the OT process we have seen over the years: \n     early involvement--testable operational requirements; backing \n     away from the ``pass/fail'' mentality; truly testing for \n     learning; mission-oriented focus; more emphasis on \n     evaluation. These are all very ``old-time,'' but\n\n[[Page S6934]]\n\n     just as true now as in 1970. Developing and fielding joint \n     force capabilities requires adequate, realistic test and \n     evaluation in a joint operational context. To do this, the \n     Department will need to provide new testing capabilities and \n     institutionalize the evaluation of joint system effectiveness \n     as part of new capabilities-based processes. DOT has been \n     directed to develop a roadmap no later than May 2004 that \n     addresses the changes necessary to ensure that test and \n     evaluation is conducted in a joint environment to enhance \n     fielding of needed joint capabilities. We are working with \n     the Service and Defense Agency test communities to satisfy \n     this direction.\n\n\n                      acquisition system comments\n\n       You all know that the acquisition process changes much \n     faster than we actually acquire anything. DoD would be much \n     better off if we could produce systems as fast as we produce \n     new Acquisition Regulations. So a major acquisition program \n     during its development passes through, not just milestones \n     that used to be called 1,2,3 and are now called A, B, C, but \n     perhaps even several whole acquisition processes. Programs, \n     such as the V-22 Osprey and the F-22 Raptor, have seen an \n     acquisition system that has been called Need-Based, then one \n     called Simulation-Based, then one called (in the Air Force) \n     Reality-Based, and now one called Capability-Based. These \n     changes are not at the root of the problems encountered by \n     these programs, but they certainly haven't helped. The \n     situation may be getting worse rather than better: I believe \n     I am the first DOT to sign two versions of the 5000.2 and \n     I've been in the job less than three years.\n\n\n               testing to support new acquisition styles\n\n       Among the major new initiatives, as I just mentioned, is \n     Capabilities-Based Acquisition. The idea here, as I see it, \n     is a continuous process of design, development and testing of \n     a new concept or system until we demonstrate and validate a \n     level of capability deemed worth considering for procurement \n     and deployment. At that point, the decision-maker--hopefully, \n     based on the informed advice of the potential user as well as \n     the acquisition and testing communities--decides that the \n     system has indeed demonstrated a needed warfighting \n     capability and approves advancing it, perhaps into full-scale \n     engineering development, or even directly into production and \n     deployment to our operational forces. One of the features of \n     this approach is that, up to this point, there are no hard \n     and fast requirements, threat-based or otherwise, against \n     which to measure the operational effectiveness or suitability \n     of the system. I said two years ago, ``How all this will work \n     in detail is still a little murky.'' We are still feeling our \n     way. The Ballistic Missile Defense System is a major test \n     bed, in fact, for the operational test community in working \n     with this new acquisition paradigm. In this approach to \n     acquisition, we testers won't be making judgments as to a \n     system's effectiveness or suitability against some ORD-based \n     bench-marks, but rather presenting our best judgment as to \n     the capability demonstrated to-date in whatever \n     environments--open-air testing, hardware-in-the-loop, or \n     human-in-the-loop--the system has been subjected to. \n     Interesting enough, we have some helpful guidance in a \n     statement in the new 5000.1 DoD Directive: The Defense \n     Acquisition System. The Directive has only three policies \n     identified, the second of which I quote: ``The primary \n     objective of Defense acquisition is to acquire quality \n     products that satisfy user needs with measurable improvements \n     to mission capability and operational support, in a timely \n     manner, and at a fair and reasonable price.''\n\n\n             methodology: mission focus/comparison testing\n\n       This directs me, as I see it, to define some marks on the \n     wall with respect to capabilities that must be improved upon. \n     It also keeps a strong mission-oriented focus. The \n     ``measurable improvement'' phase in the new 5000.1 also \n     highlights the need for comparative evaluations to show \n     improvement. When formal requirements are missing, the \n     current mission capability provides a natural point from \n     which to measure any improvement. This may seem like a simple \n     idea. And we have used it in a number of cases to assist the \n     evaluation. For example, in one Army system, the requirements \n     had specified a timeline for movement after shooting. Well, \n     that requirement was not met in testing, but did that mean \n     the system was ineffective? When we compared the actual time \n     to that of the current system, we found that the new system \n     provided significantly better survivability, even though it \n     did not meet the ``Requirement.'' We used the comparison as \n     part of the justification for calling the system effective.\n       Now the comparison test idea is often criticized--\n     understandably so in many instances--as being expensive. We \n     need to move to collect data on the capabilities of current \n     systems and forces from ongoing exercises in order to avoid \n     burdening new programs with the time and resources needed to \n     test and collect such data to establish a baseline. But that \n     will require establishing meaningful, accredited databases \n     for operational capabilities of existing forces/equipment/\n     TTPs. As Walt well knows, the information from tests--the \n     databases--quickly become unusable. Archiving the databases \n     should be part of a more robust T infrastructure.\n\n\n       testing to support acquisition: t infrastructure/people\n\n       While Spiral Development and Block Upgrades might be \n     somewhat different animals, their treatment by the T \n     community is somewhat similar. As an aside, we have quite a \n     bit of experience with such approaches, particularly in \n     testing software-intensive systems to include the myriad of \n     automated information systems. Here, we plan our T \n     strategies to assess incremental improvements in capabilities \n     as opposed to using the full-up, or ultimate, system \n     requirements spelled out in an operational requirements \n     document as a benchmark. At the least, our assessments should \n     consider whether each spiral or block provides a measurable \n     improvement in military capability over its predecessor. What \n     may be called spiral or block developments, may just be \n     the block upgrades of the past. The T community has \n     dealt with those for quite some time now. We should step \n     back now and translate our lessons learned in this context \n     into more concrete policies or strategies for the future.\n       Undoubtedly, the biggest financial commitment by a program \n     in this context will be to field the first spiral or Block I. \n     Therefore, at a minimum, Block I should clearly demonstrate \n     that it does not represent a decrease in military capability \n     over legacy systems. In addition, If new functionality is \n     added in a spiral or block, we will probably need to carry \n     out some level of regression testing. There will also have to \n     be some assessment of the growth potential of this spiral or \n     block.\n       The new functionality--if it is to be worth the disruption \n     to the force by requiring retraining, additional training or \n     new operational concepts--ought to represent a significant \n     improvement that should be easy to confirm. We should accept \n     it as our responsibility to confirm, not only that \n     improvement, but that the system continues to be effective \n     and suitable for combat after fielding. In spiral \n     developments, we will need a formal feedback mechanism--\n     spiral reporting, so to speak--to ensure that problems or \n     deficiencies identified in T for each spiral are addressed \n     and corrected by the developer. The information needs during \n     spiral development seem to include at least: (1) what is the \n     added capability of the new spiral, (2) what direction should \n     the next spiral take to address the residual deficiencies of \n     the incomplete system and (3) is the new spiral's increase in \n     capability worth the disruption of introducing it into the \n     force--the reconfiguration, the revised training or the \n     changed tactics, techniques and procedures the new spiral \n     might imply.\n       These considerations lead me to a need for some form of \n     continuous testing, evaluation and reporting even after the \n     system is deployed. Presumably, with increased use of \n     spirals, there will be many more potential engineering change \n     proposals. Hopefully, priorities accorded these proposals \n     will be based on evaluation of data that shows what needs to \n     be fixed depending on the most value to the war fighter.\n       We need to look to the future beyond the items addressed \n     above--the increasing complexity of systems and tactics to be \n     tested, the need for better trained people in the T \n     business, the massive amounts of data becoming available and \n     the concomitant requirement for more sophisticated evaluation \n     techniques/approaches.\n\n\n            t infrastructure/tools/modeling and simulation\n\n       Let me address in some fashion the modeling and simulation \n     disappointment which I inferred earlier. A success story in \n     this context is the AIM-9X. But you have to understand the \n     very special circumstances of that success. First and \n     foremost, the contractor was willing to go down the path. The \n     model was developed by the contractor and was open to the \n     government. The DT program was used to develop and validate \n     the model. The model was a design tool. The OT program also \n     validated the model. The close collaboration of government \n     and contractor was necessary where there are too many cases \n     to cover in a live test program. In the Aim-9X, there were \n     over 500 scenarios that were in the Operational Requirements \n     Document.\n       However, the experience with M, overall, has been a major \n     disappointment of promises undelivered. Why? First, there \n     have been unreasonable expectations. Surely, some design \n     problems can be modeled, but these tend to be small changes \n     in well-understood designs. Defense systems do not tend to be \n     of this ilk. When the system technology is cutting edge, its \n     real limits are probably not well understood. You cannot \n     replace testing with modeling in that case. As Jack Krings \n     used to say, model to interpolate, not extrapolate.\n       Second is the money problem. Many program managers would \n     like to finance the development of models with money from \n     testing--trade off testing for modeling. That timing is off--\n     modeling, to be successful, has to start early; using OT \n     money is too late. The trade is not what ought to be the \n     goal. Defense systems encounter a lot of problems in \n     development--a fact that the OT community is painfully aware \n     of because so many of those problems appear in IOT To \n     overcome these, in the best case, takes additional time and \n     money. The role of modeling should be as something extra that \n     can be done to help the success of the program--not some \n     trade off with testing.\n\n\n              t infrastructure/resources/t cycle time\n\n       Unfortunately, I am concerned that our T infrastructure \n     is not in the best of\n\n[[Page S6935]]\n\n     shape needed to meet the challenges of the future. Past \n     failures of the acquisition process, with all the program \n     slips, have tended to ease the burden faced by the test \n     ranges. Lord knows what would happen if all the programs that \n     claimed to be ready for testing in 2004 actually showed up \n     for testing. If the latest acquisition initiatives deliver \n     what they hope for, then a greater fraction of programs \n     should be ready for testing on or near their schedules. In \n     this respect, I fear the T community might not be prepared \n     for success in acquisition reform. A capable test \n     infrastructure to include appropriate targets, \n     instrumentation, etc., will have to be available at our test \n     ranges and facilities.\n       So, what's the bottom line? First and foremost, we have a \n     lot to be proud of over the past several years in our \n     demonstrated flexibility and responsiveness to an ever-\n     changing acquisition landscape. Our record of early \n     involvement and the fruits of that involvement are also \n     praiseworthy. We have not choice but to continue and even \n     expand our involvement earlier and continuously throughout \n     the life cycle of systems. But, I am concerned with the \n     increasing demands on our resources necessary to make those \n     involvements continue to pay off.\n       We need to do more in cultivating and serving the users, \n     the operational forces, as prime customers for our products. \n     The Joint Test and Evaluation Capability should play a big \n     role here. Warfighters need to know the capabilities and \n     limitations of the new systems they are deploying, based on \n     our best estimates of what the testing to-date has \n     demonstrated.\n       The Joint Test and Evaluation Capability will probably \n     borrow a lot from the Joint Training Capability. One key that \n     I believe will connect them is the careful enumeration of the \n     military tasks that is catalogued in the Universal Joint Task \n     List. The tasks, standards, and conditions there can be a \n     basis for comparison of current and new capabilities. It \n     ought to be an important item in the new ``Requirements \n     Generation'' process we will hear about later that is called \n     JCIDS--the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development \n     System.\n       While acquisition reform has aimed at making substantial \n     reductions in cycle-time, by at least a half in most cases, \n     we in the testing community should be looking at ways of \n     cutting testing turn-around times in half.\n       I reject the claims of the many critics of the testing \n     process that overall OT costs and schedules are excessive--\n     in fact, they're a very small part of system costs (recent \n     Rand study); the costs of skipping tests, of avoiding \n     adequate tests, of skimping on either DT or OT can be huge \n     (as well as cause loss of lives). We started the RAH-66 \n     Comanche, V-22 Osprey and F-22 Raptor programs in the early \n     1980s. After roughly $7 billion and twenty years of effort, \n     the Comanche is being terminated while still several years \n     from its IOT and a production decision. The V-22 program \n     has spent over $16 billion and taken more than twenty years, \n     during which it unfortunately skimped on DT and paid the \n     price in a failed OPEVAL in 2000. It is now embarked on an \n     event-driven test program that will culminate in a second \n     OPEVAL in early 2005. After $36 billion and nearly twenty \n     years in development, the F-22 is about to enter its IOT \n     heading for a production decision this coming fall. Now, I \n     challenge you to show me where operational testing has held \n     these programs up or has cost us an arm and a leg as some of \n     our critics would claim.\n       In closing, I continue to believe the T community--in \n     both industry and government, both technical and operational \n     testers--has served the department very well over the years. \n     The success of our operational forces in the last several \n     conflicts reflects that dedication to deploying systems \n     proven effective, suitable and survivable on our ranges and \n     in our facilities. But, the increasing complexity of systems \n     and tactics should be tested, the need for better trained \n     people in the T busienss, the massive amounts of data \n     becoming available and the concomitant requirement for more \n     sophisticated evaluation techniques/approaches, all call for \n     new and innovative strategies and capabilities for T I \n     hope this conference does not degenerate into a reminiscence \n     session. We face challenges in the future as we have in the \n     past in ensuring that our soldiers, sailors and airmen are \n     equipped with the best equipment our nation can provide.\n  Mr. ALLARD. This quote that I just shared describes exactly what he \nis doing with testing and the Missile Defense Program. Heavy \ninvolvement in the developmental test program, with the intent to \nachieve operational test goals during development, continued test \nevaluation assessments to keep the warfighter informed of system \ncapabilities and limitations, and continuous evaluation after fielding \nto feed spiral development. That is the role the Director of the OT \ndescribes for himself, and that is the role he is playing in missile \ndefense testing.\n  Everyone on both sides of the aisle, and I would add everyone in the \nPentagon, supports operational realistic testing of the ballistic \nmissile defense system, and that is why we are building a missile \ndefense test bed today. That is why the Director of OT has over 100 \noperational test agents influencing and providing input for the GMD. \nThat is why military operators are being used in the tests. Perhaps \nmore importantly, that is why operational test goals are incorporated \ninto each developmental test.\n  Now, make no mistake, the threat drives this program. We are building \nmissile defenses to meet that threat. The test bed is needed to perform \noperationally realistic tests of the ballistic missile defense system \nand testing will proceed, becoming progressively more realistic, and \nwill improve the system. Yet it is these same test bed capabilities \nthat would afford us an early operational capability.\n  We cannot forget that we have no defense against long-range missiles. \nThe Armed Services Committee has seen intelligence information which \nillustrates, more than ever, that the ballistic missile threat is real \nand growing. We are vulnerable and it is time to change that \nvulnerability. We need a missile defense capability in the field as \nsoon as possible. For that reason, I will oppose the Reed amendment as \nit was introduced, and I urge my colleagues to oppose those efforts \nthat would tie up our system in a way that adds delays and adds to our \ninability to defend ourselves from emerging threats in other parts of \nthe world.\n  With the Warner second-degree amendment, my view of this amendment of \nSenator Reed changes; that is, if we adopt the Warner amendment. This \nis why I think we need to support Senator Warner's amendment. The \nintent is to assure that the Department of Defense conducts operational \nrealistic testing of the BMD system and to support Senator Warner's \nsecond-degree amendment because I believe we will achieve our common \ngoal of operational, realistic testing while avoiding some of the \npotential pitfalls.\n  Everyone on both sides supports operational realistic testing, as I \nmentioned earlier, on the ballistic missile system. I certainly support \nthe Senator's intent to make sure the BMD system is tested. The \nquestion is how best to test effectively while improving system \ncapabilities and fielding capabilities as quickly as we can.\n  Formal operation and testing carries with it certain requirements \nwhere there can be no developmental goals. Contractors cannot be \ninvolved and the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation approves \nof the operational test plan.\n  I think the Warner amendment improves on what was proposed by the \nSenator from Rhode Island. This is operational testing.\n  Again, as I said earlier, we are looking at a two-way path here. \nWhile we are doing testing, we want to get something in place that is \noperational. The more we tie this down in a step-by-step process, which \nhappens with the Reed amendment, with accountability on every little \nfinite step in development, the more you delay the process and the more \nyou add to the cost of the program. That is why I am supporting the \nWarner amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I ask for an additional 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. He is yielded an \nadditional minute.\n  Mr. ALLARD. What happens with the step-by-step process in the Reed \namendment which leads to delays and additional costs, the Warner \namendment refines that down so it is more streamlined and becomes \npalatable to us who would like to see rapid deployment of some kind of \nmissile defense system for this country.\n  It is not going to be perfect. That is why we have spiral \ndevelopment. We are going to develop it and improve upon it with time. \nThis is a process we have used before. It works and it is something \nthat is going to assure us that we will have security rapidly deployed \nfor this country where we have emerging threats in Iran and North \nKorea.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. He yields \nthe floor. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island has 35 minutes \n38 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, if you could interrupt in 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 10 minutes.\n\n[[Page S6936]]\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I was very interested in hearing about the \nletter from Mr. Christie. I have not seen it. I am getting a copy of \nit.\n  But as I heard my colleague from Colorado, Mr. Christie seems to be \nsaying that this system is not ready for operational testing yet, that \nit was premature to operationally test it. But it is ready for \ndeployment in September? I think the notion of deployment is this thing \nis ready to operate; certainly it is at least ready to begin the \nthreshold operation for testing. So I can't think of anything else that \nmore strongly emphasizes the need for operational testing.\n  We have all heard the terminology, evolutionary spiral development, \nnew techniques, et cetera, but the basic question here is: Does it \nwork? No evolutionary spiral jargon avoids that question. Related to \nthe question, does it work, is: What can it do? What do we expect this \nsystem to do? And then, of course, you validate that by testing under \nrealistic conditions.\n  None of this is taking place. None of this is planned. I believe my \ncolleagues when they say they want to see this operational testing. But \nthere is no plan to operationally test now.\n\n  I find interesting the notion that Mr. Christie says it is premature \nto test, yet in the amendment to my amendment offered by Senator Warner \nthere is a specific deadline of October 1, 2005, that a test will be \ncompleted.\n  My amendment doesn't do that because I do recognize the fact that \nthese are very difficult technological issues, that there is great \nconcern about getting the system up and running. There are multiple \npieces from space-based radar to ships at sea to land-based radar to \nbooster rockets and kill vehicles. Yet interestingly enough, the Warner \namendment would lock in a date of October 1, 2005, to test the \nballistic missile system. Yet Mr. Christie is talking about it is too \npremature, et cetera.\n  I think the approach I have taken is simply saying at some time in \nthe future we need operational testing. Please lay out a plan--a plan, \nof course, can be modified--and before these new steps in the process \nare put into effect, let's have the operational testing. I think it \nmakes a great deal more sense.\n  Also, there is a question about limiting developmental testing and \noperational testing by saying, when you do operational testing, you \ncan't do developmental testing. Actually both can be conducted in \nvirtually the same test. I think one of the major differences between \ndevelopmental testing and operational testing is that developmental \ntesting is designed by the proponent agency and the contractors and \nthey are supervised by the proponent agencies and contractors. \nOperational testing is designed by Dr. Christie's office, the Office of \nOperational Test and Evaluation, and supervised and conducted by those \nindividuals from that particular office. It is quite appropriate. It is \ndone frequently.\n  The Patriot was an example of a system that had both operational and \ndevelopmental testing taking place. Indeed, the Patriot is another good \nexample of the need for operational testing.\n  The upgrade PAC-3 missile defense system had a very good record when \nit was in its developmental phase. It was just doing extremely well. \nThen they started the operational combat, realistic test phase, and the \nPatriot PAC-3 failed each of these operational tests. It had four \nconsecutive operational test failures. What did that suggest to you \nabout this system? This system might pass all these tests, as some have \nargued watered down as they are, but it could pass all of them. Well, \nthe PAC-3 system passed all the development tests and then had four \nconsecutive failures in a row in an operational test.\n  If we have four consecutive failures in a real operational test of \nthis system, I think the American people will be quite shocked, given \nthe fact we are not planning any operational test, yet we are deploying \nthe system.\n  Luckily, with the PAC-3, there was time to fix the problem.\n  These operational tests were not only conducted, but the problems \nwere fixed. In Operation Iraqi Freedom, the system was deployed. It \nworked very well when it engaged missiles. But again, there are still \nsome difficulties. At least one friendly aircraft was engaged and \ndestroyed by a PAC-3 system. Two were destroyed, suggesting that all \nthe problems with the system in terms of target identification, in \nterms of proper response and enemy versus friendly targets in the air \nhave not been fully resolved. It is a complex system. This system is \nmuch more complex and complicated. But the PAC-3 is a very good example \nof what we should be doing here--that is, operational testing, learning \nfrom those tests, fix the system, and keep doing it continuously.\n  Again, I think it is an interesting notion about this spiral \ndevelopment and everything else. There has to be consistent, constant \ntesting because that is how you learn so you can make the changes. Yet, \nagain, we don't have an operational test planned for this particular \nsystem. I believe we have to have something like that. Again, the \nnational missile system is very complex. We have to have this system.\n  Part of the Warner amendment to my amendment takes out the Director \nof Operational Test and Evaluation and lets the Secretary of Defense \nprescribe the criteria. Let me suggest that in the last several years, \nDr. Christie has been advising and consulting. But nothing has happened \nin terms of operational testing. Each year, he reports to his superiors \nand to the public at large. In each one of those reports, he calls for \nmore realistic testing. Apparently he is consulting and is not \nparticularly effective. But that is exactly what the Warner amendment \nto my amendment would do--simply make him a consultant.\n  The reality is, as a consultant, his voice would be no more prominent \nthan it is today. We don't have an operational testing plan. We have \nnot conducted operational testing yet, and yet we are deploying the \nsystem. It seems to me that the Warner amendment waters down further \nthe operational testing. He calls it operational testing, but then it \ntakes out the operational testing, giving it to the Secretary of \nDefense.\n  We have seen that this Secretary of Defense is committed to getting \nthis program into the ground by September of this year regardless. That \ndoesn't give me and I don't think it should give the public the \nconfidence that a rigorous realistic testing scheme will be developed. \nBut then the amendment goes on to say within a year we are going to \nhave that, we are going to mandate the test. It seems to be slightly \nschizophrenic. We don't want the normal procedures, we don't want the \nDirector of Test and Evaluation to be doing it, we want the Secretary \nof Defense to do it, but he is going to do it by October 1 of 2005.\n  Again, I don't think the amendment really responds to the problem and \nthe issue. The issue and the problem is developing, as we have done for \nevery other system. PAC-3 is an excellent example of operational \ntesting and planning, and then ensuring that the operational tests take \nplace--not just calling for operational tests but having the \nindependent operational testing agency within the Pentagon designing \nand conducting the test. That is what my amendment does. It doesn't \ncall for any specific deadline. If the conclusion of Mr. Christie were \nto be that it couldn't be feasible for 18 months or 2 years, at least \nwe have gotten an operational test plan, and we will conduct the test. \nThat, to me, would be a vast improvement over the current situation.\n  I hope my colleagues will not favorably respond to Senator Warner's \namendment and give me a chance to have this amendment agreed to.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I support the Warner amendment to the Reed \namendment because it adds flexibility with accountability. The second-\ndegree amendment will allow the Missile Defense Program to field \ncapabilities expeditiously and to improve those capabilities rapidly \nand avoids the disadvantages I see in Senator Reed's approach, which \nrequires realistic testing broken off into blocks.\n  Specifically, Senator Warner's second-degree amendment will require \nthe Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Director of OT, to \nset forth formal criteria to define operationally realistic testing for \nthe ballistic missile defense system as a spiral development program. \nIt will require operationally realistic testing consistent\n\n[[Page S6937]]\n\nwith those criteria during the fiscal year 2005, and it will require \noperationally realistic testing of each block or spiral of the \nballistic missile defense system.\n  The Warner second-degree amendment provides the flexibility needed to \nincorporate both operational test goals and developmental test goals in \nmissile defense tests--flexibility that is denied in the Reed \namendment. Thus, it avoids the substantial replanning, delay, and \nadditional costs that would result if the Reed amendment is adopted.\n  But the second-degree amendment also helps ensure that the testing of \nthe missile defense system is realistic and will result in a well-\ntested system that will be capable of defending our Nation. It requires \na formal and appropriate role for the Director of OT, and it requires \nthis realistic testing to be conducted during fiscal year 2005--almost \ncertainly sooner than the formal OT required in Senator Reed's \namendment, perhaps even sooner.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Warner second-degree amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am just a bit taken aback by the claim of \nflexibility. The Warner amendment actually sets out a date certain when \nthe tests will be conducted. Particularly, since it is a year away, \nparticularly Mr. Christie is talking about it is premature because it \nis in the developmental stage. I thought his letter was quite specific. \nThe ground-based midcourse defense element is currently at a material \nlevel which requires continued developmental testing with oversight and \nassistance from operational testing personnel conducting realistic \ntesting in the near term. I guess the question is, What is ``in the \nnear term''? I suggest it would be a year or more. It would be \npremature and not beneficial to the program.\n  Let me reiterate that this is an extraordinary letter. It says \nbasically this system is not mature enough to test, but we are going to \ndeploy it. I think that is very unusual, particularly given the history \nof having other systems where, even though they had not completed their \noperational testing--like the Predator and JSTARS--the plan for \noperational testing had already been sketched out--not by the Secretary \nof Defense but by the Office of the Director of Operational Test and \nEvaluation.\n  I think the flexibility is in my central amendment. It talks about \nbefore you deploy a block or a spiral--the new terminology might be \n``spiral,'' but what they are going to do essentially is what we do so \noften: build the system to a certain capability; then, through tests or \nexperience or through actual field trials, develop new software, new \ntechnology, and new complements that can make it better. At a certain \npoint, rather than just simply tweaking here and there, you go back in \nand you develop a new block. That is roughly to me what the spiral \ndevelopment is, minus the catchphrase. Before you do that, we should \nhave operational testing.\n  I think this is a very critical aspect. My amendment does not intend \nto stifle flexibility. It has no correlation with deployment. That is \nan issue that is going to be determined--and has been determined. We \nhad votes on that, but somewhere along the line we need to do \noperational testing.\n  I must say I would be much more impressed with the degree of \ncommitment to this operational testing if at least we had a plan for \noperational tests, a plan prepared by Mr. Christie. We do not have \nthat. At least that would signal that we are serious about operational \ntesting. In fact, that should have been done. It says this system is so \nimmature that we cannot even get to the point of developing a plan to \ntest.\n\n  Once again, the amendment is not only reasonable but it is \ncompelling. This is what we do when we develop systems. Again, I \nsuggest it is something we should do.\n  There is another aspect of my amendment which is very important and \nthat is the baseline. Again, we have to know how much is being spent, \nwhat are the cost goals, what are the capability goals with respect to \nthe system.\n  The GAO discovered--we did not discover this because of the way the \nbooks are kept--a $1 billion cost overrun. Rather than reporting it, \nmaking it obvious or tracking it, they simply changed the cost goals. \nIn conjunction with that, we find that rather than having 10 \ninterceptors, as they originally talked about in terms of cost goals, \nthey now have 5 interceptors. The situation is that the costs have gone \nup by $1 billion and capability has gone down by half. Now we have a \nsituation where we were unaware of it until the GAO discovered this.\n  Call it spiral development, call it evolutionary development, that \nshould not be. One would hope this sophisticated development process, \nthis new form of development, would mean that costs are more \ntransparent, more accurate, and the capability is more obvious. That \ndoes not seem to be the case.\n  Along with the notion of developing operational testing is developing \nthe baseline. None of that is in the Warner substitute to my amendment. \nI cannot see any discussion of establishing baselines, of making sure \nthe costs are appropriate, of alerting Congress to overruns, rather \nthan just changing goals.\n  I hope my amendment would be adopted and could be adopted.\n  I yield the floor, and ask at the conclusion we might think about \nwhether it is appropriate to continue debating or to yield back time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, on this side, most Members have said \nwhatever they want to say.\n  I, again, state we have a number of amendments we dealt with last \nyear and this year which, in effect, add delays because of an excess \nreevaluation of the program. What we are striving for is a commonsense \napproach to accountability in the missile defense program without so \nmuch evaluation that we delay it. Each delay adds more and more costs \nto the program. Then those people who oppose the missile defense \nprogram will use that as a reason to defeat the program.\n  The fact is, right now we are in the process of putting those \nmissiles in the ground. This fall we expect them to be operational. In \norder to have the proper developmental process in place, we have to \nhave a test bed. While we are putting the test bed in place, it \nrequires such a wide area we might as well make it operationally \nfunctional at the same time. That is what we are trying to do.\n  The Warner amendment provides the flexibility but still the \naccountability that we need. I am happy with what he has laid out in \nthat amendment.\n  Dr. Thomas Christie has indicated time and time again that he is \nsatisfied with his current role and the role his office plays in \nballistic missile defense testing. He has testified. He states in his \nrecent letter to me--and maybe I need to read the substance of this \nletter just to give my colleague an opportunity to hear clearly what \nhis position is--the following:\n\n       The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is building a BMDS test \n     bed that is essential to support realistic testing, and is \n     absolutely essential for conducting adequate operational \n     testing in the future. The test bed is also key to developing \n     operational concepts, techniques, and procedures, while \n     allowing my office to exploit and characterize its inherent \n     defense capability.\n       The Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) element is \n     currently at a maturity level that requires continued \n     developmental testing with oversight and assistance from \n     operational test personnel. Conducting realistic operational \n     testing in the near-term for the GMD element would be \n     premature and not beneficial to the program.\n       My office has unprecedented access to GMD, and I am \n     satisfied with the cooperation between the program office and \n     the test community. I will continue to advise the Secretary \n     of Defense and the Director, MDA, on the BMDS test program. I \n     will also provide my characterization of system capabilities, \n     and my assessment of test program adequacy annually, as \n     required by Congress.\n\n  This is the chief accountability officer. He is responsible to make \nsure everything is ready to move forward. He is satisfied. There is no \ndoubt that he is satisfied with the way things are going.\n  In order to meet some of Senator Reed's concerns, the Warner \namendment allows that. We address some of his concerns. Now we need to \nadopt the Warner amendment so we can still have the flexibility we need \nto deal with changing technology and perhaps\n\n[[Page S6938]]\n\nsome unexpected events as we move forward.\n  I don't think anyone who has watched the development of military \nsystems ever figures we have it right the first time. We come awfully \nclose. With each passing year, new technology evolves and new ideas \nevolve and there are things we can do to improve the system. That is \nwhat spiral development is all about.\n  Again, Dr. Christie indicates that he is satisfied with his role and \nthe role his office plays in the Missile Defense Program. He states \nthat his office has ``unprecedented access'' to the ground-based \nmidcourse effort and that cooperation is very good between the program \noffice and his office.\n  He testified that he makes recommendations related to the \ndevelopmental test program and his office has the ability to bring \ninput into and influence the GMD test program.\n  Again, to quote Dr. Christie:\n\n       My staff and I remain involved on a daily basis with the \n     Missile Defense System and the BMDS element program offices \n     in order to ensure that operational tests are addressed in \n     their testing.\n       We have over 100 operational test agents involved in the \n     missile defense test program. A considerable amount of \n     resources are being put forward to make sure we have \n     accountability.\n\n  He goes on and indicates again that he is clearly satisfied with \nemphasis on operational test goals in the BMD system test plan. I will \nquote directly:\n\n       The GMD [Ground-based Midcourse] program combined test \n     force effectively integrated the operational testers into the \n     program development activities and the test design and \n     planning efforts.\n\n  He approved the operational test goals for the last three integrated \nflight tests.\n  He recently testified as follows:\n\n       While I am very encouraged by the improved testing \n     environment and capability that the BMDS test bed will \n     provide, I am even more pleased with the increased emphasis \n     on system integration and user involvement that I have seen \n     over the past year.\n\n  We go on and on about his testimony as to how he has testified. The \nfact is, it is working. We are ready to put it in the ground this fall. \nWe all recognize there are going to be improvements as we move along, \nbut we are in a position to make those improvements.\n  I think the commonsense approach is to support the Warner amendment. \nI support it and encourage my colleagues to support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, how much time does the Senator from Rhode \nIsland have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 20 minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask the Senator if he will yield me 8 minutes.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the amendment of the Senator from Rhode \nIsland simply says that the usual rules will apply in this case, that \nwe are not going to change the rules because some people believe \nstrongly this is an important weapons system. We have lots of important \nweapons systems of which we apply the rules that you must have \noperational testing at some point.\n  Now, there have been a couple of instances where operational testing \nhas been delayed until after there has been some deployment, but there \nhas been operational testing then. There have been plans for \noperational testing. The two examples which are used frequently are \nJSTARS and an unmanned aerial vehicle called Predator. Those are the \ntwo examples that have been used where a system has been deployed or \npartially deployed, and then the operational testing has occurred after \nthat deployment.\n  But in those two cases--this is the critical issue which the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island addresses--as in all other cases, operational testing \nhas occurred; and it has been designed by and implemented by the \nindependent Office of Test and Evaluation.\n  The difference between the amendment offered by the Senator from \nRhode Island and the second-degree amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom Virginia is that the Senator from Rhode Island preserves the rule, \nwhich as far as I can tell has never been violated, that the Office of \nTest and Evaluation does the testing. That is an independent test \noffice.\n  Too often these days we see rules being ignored in order to meet some \nparticular goal: We are not going to apply the Constitution here \nbecause we have needs over here. We are not going to apply the usual \nrules as to how we treat captives and how we treat prisoners because we \nhave other needs over here. We are going to bend rules. We are going to \nignore rules because of some particular goal that exists.\n  In this case, there is a proposal made that we ignore the rule, which \nhas been in place for I don't know how many years, with a very \nimportant purpose behind it: that we have independent testing of \nweapons systems before or during or at some point after deployment by \nan independent test office--not by the Department of Defense in \nconsultation with the test office but by that test office itself. It is \nthe way we have protected our men and women in the military, to make \nsure that weapons systems work. It is the way we have protected this \nNation, by making sure that weapons systems work.\n  We should not make an exception for it here. No matter how strongly \npeople feel national missile defense will contribute to our national \nsecurity, it will only contribute to our security if it works. To make \nsure it works, you need an independent testing office to do the testing \nand to lay out the criteria--not to consult, not to have a voice, but \nto do what they do with all other weapons systems that we deploy, which \nis to do the testing themselves.\n\n  This amendment does not prevent the administration from deploying \nmissile defenses prior to operational testing. That was the amendment \nwhich was just defeated. This amendment allows that deployment but says \nyou have to have operational testing sometime, at some point, and--this \nis the difference between the first-degree and the second-degree \namendment--in the case of the first-degree amendment, that testing has \nto be done by that independent Office of Test and Evaluation, as all \nother testing of all other weapons systems that we have been able to \nresearch. You have to have plans. You have to make a decision: Yes, we \nare going to test this, and we are going to have our independent Office \nof Test and Evaluation do it.\n  Now, as I said, some defense programs have been deployed before \noperational testing was completed, and among them is the Predator, \nwhich was deployed in Kosovo in 1999, prior to the initial operational \ntest and evaluation. But the operational testing for the Predator was \nplanned for long before the Kosovo deployment, and it was completed in \nthe next year after that deployment. The testing was done by that \nindependent office, not by people who are out there in the field \narguing for a system, but independently by the independent test office.\n  The JSTARS surveillance aircraft is another example of a military \nsystem which was deployed prior to operational testing. There was a \ngreat need. It was decided they could do the operational testing after \nthe deployment. So two JSTARS aircraft were deployed during Desert \nStorm in 1991.\n  Interestingly enough, following that deployment, the Senate Armed \nServices Committee wanted to accelerate the program, but the Air Force \nthought the effort in the gulf war had not alleviated the need for \noperational testing. Indeed, it illuminated areas that needed more \nattention in development. So operational testing was performed on \nJSTARS in 1995, and the operational tests revealed some significant \nproblems. Some of those problems in JSTARS, which independent \noperational testing--and the word ``independent'' is just as important \nas the word ``operational'' and just as important as the word \n``testing''--those independent operational tests revealed some \nsignificant problems, including the inability to operate at the \nrequired altitude, inadequate tactics and procedures, and inadequate \nmission reliability and time-on-station.\n  What this amendment would do is to insist that the usual rules about \noperational testing by an independent test office apply here, not \nbefore deployment--that approach was defeated when the Boxer amendment \nwas defeated--but at least sometime, and sometime is critically \nimportant, and just as critical is that those tests be done not just in \nconsultation with but by the Office of Test and Evaluation.\n\n[[Page S6939]]\n\n  If you do not like the rules, change the rules, change the law about \nOT, the Office of Test and Evaluation, change the law, but do not \nsimply say we are going to ignore the law here because that law has an \nimportant purpose. That law requiring independent test and evaluation \nis a law which every Member of this body ought to defend. We fought a \nlong time to put it in place. It has had some wonderful results. Our \nweapons systems have worked better because we have an independent \noffice that does the testing.\n  So it is not good enough, as the second-degree amendment says: Well, \nwe will have some consultation with that independent office. That does \nnot give them the critical decision as to whether a weapons system is \neffective or is not effective. To put billions of dollars into systems \nwhich are not shown to be effective at some point, which are not \noperationally tested at some point by an independent office, is to \nincrease the likelihood that billions of dollars will be wasted.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Six minutes?\n  Mr. REED. Six minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, first, I share a name with the sponsor of \nthis amendment. I have, once in a while, given him some advice. When it \ncomes to military matters, there is no one who I have greater \nconfidence in than the Senator from Rhode Island. He is the only Member \nof the Senate who is a graduate of the United States Military Academy \nat West Point. He is someone who has taught at that fine school. He is \nsomeone who has maintained his military contacts. And he is a student \nof what has been going on in the military since his retirement from the \nmilitary. So I feel very confident and comfortable that the Senator--\nbeing a member of this most important committee, the Armed Services \nCommittee, and having offered this amendment--is trying to do what he \nbelieves is the right thing for this country.\n  I express my appreciation to him for his studious efforts in offering \nthis amendment and for often answering my questions about the military. \nHe is such a valuable person to have in the Senate.\n  As I told the majority leader a few weeks ago, when I get up in the \nmorning, the first thing I read is the sports page. I do that because \nthere is always some good news in it. The rest of the newspaper you \nhave to search hard for the good news. But after I finish the sports \npage, I reluctantly go to the first section of the paper.\n  This morning I went to the Washington Post. On the front page is a \nstory. We have all seen the headlines about the 9/11 Commission, that \naccording to available evidence, Iraq and Saddam Hussein had nothing to \ndo with the terrorist attacks of 9/11. Another front-page story dealt \nwith Abu Ghraib prison and some of the abuses that took place there.\n  On page 3 there is a feature story about a soldier that has been laid \nto rest in Arlington Cemetery. Page 4, there is some discussion about \nwhat we did yesterday dealing with the Leahy amendment.\n  The reason I mention these items very briefly is, you have to go all \nthe way to page A19--I was stunned when I read this--the fourth \nparagraph, to read:\n\n       Three U.S. soldiers were also killed Wednesday. . . .\n\n  It is like a throwaway.\n\n       Three U.S. soldiers were also killed Wednesday. . . .\n\n  Three more deaths didn't warrant anything better than a throwaway \nline in the fourth paragraph on the 19th page of this newspaper.\n  We know these soldiers who have been killed--more than 800--are \nfathers, sons, neighbors, loved ones, all different categories. The \nfamilies of these men and some women who have lost their lives since \nthe war are paying a terrible price. I am stunned that we have come to \nthe point in this war where we now say:\n\n       Three U.S. soldiers were also killed Wednesday. . . .\n\n  I don't know how to describe how I felt when I read that. These three \nsoldiers deserved more than that.\n  I hope we are not at a point where the death of American soldiers in \ncombat is considered so routine that it is barely mentioned, and \ninstead of meritorious placement in a newspaper, it is buried. We need \nto do better than that.\n  Hopefully, one of the things this bill will do is focus attention on \nthe sacrifices being made by the men and women in Iraq. I hope the \nfamilies of these three men get more attention than page A19 in the \nfuture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Alabama is here. I \nappreciate Senator Sessions serving on the Strategic Subcommittee with \nme and serving on the Armed Services Committee. He works very hard on \nthat committee. The defense of this country is important. He agrees \nwith that. He brings a stroke of common sense to our deliberations \nwhich I, for one, truly appreciate. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Allard for his \nleadership and his expertise. He is becoming perhaps the most \nauthoritative Member of the Senate on this issue. He has worked on \nnational missile defense since he has been in the Senate. It is great \nto work with him.\n  We do need to do the right thing. We have committed as a country to \ndeploy a national missile defense system. We voted to deploy that \nsystem as soon as technologically feasible. That was back in the 1990s, \nand President Clinton signed the statute we passed. I believe it got \n90-plus votes in the Senate. Although there were a lot of people who \nwere opposed to it until the very end, in the end everybody realized \nthat we needed to defend America, and we had the capability of doing \nso.\n  There has been a cottage industry of skeptics out there that has made \nfun of President Reagan. They called his vision for national missile \ndefense Star Wars. Then when President Reagan said no to Gorbachev's \nproposal in Reykjavik, which accepted so many of the things President \nReagan wanted so badly but told President Reagan he would have to stop \nnational missile defense, he thought about that very hard on the eve of \nthe reelection campaign. He knew he would be criticized, but he said, \nno; national missile defense is important to America. It was important \nto peace in the world because, instead of worrying about how many of \nthe enemy we could kill, we could begin focusing on how to protect our \npeople from being killed by missile attacks. It was a defining moment \nin the cold war. One expert recently said that was the moment that \nsignaled the end of the Soviet Union.\n  We debated it here in the late 1990s. Senator Thad Cochran and Joe \nLieberman proposed the deploying amendment to go from research and talk \nto actual deploying and setting a goal for it. We had a bipartisan \nnational commission that unanimously voted that the threat to the \nUnited States from missile attack was real, more imminent than \nintelligence agencies had previously said, and that we needed to move \nforward to deploy a system.\n  Under General Kadish, we have achieved a magnificent result. General \nKadish--history will record--has been a tremendous leader, a man of \nsubstance and honesty and stability and good judgment, under all kinds \nof pressure. He has been beaten.\n  Senator Levin, the ranking member on our committee, is such a fine \nSenator. He and Senator Reed have been critics of the program. They \nhave raised questions about the program. I don't think it has hurt the \nprogram. It has probably helped the program. I know they have never \nbeen big fans of it. We made that decision.\n  We are going forward today. The amendment Senator Reed has proposed, \nI am afraid, would cost us in the long run and provide little benefit. \nThe provisions for cost, schedule, and performance baselines that he \nmandates have essentially been adopted now by the Department of \nDefense. It was part of a General Accounting Office study, and the \nDepartment of Defense has gone along with that study.\n  The provision for conducting operationally realistic tests for each \nblock configuration is not unreasonable. Each test we conduct today, \nhowever, has developmental objectives. And\n\n[[Page S6940]]\n\nsince this statute would prohibit the agency from approving \ndevelopmental tests, we would have a real problem there. Those tests \nmay be a problem. Each test would have developmental capabilities. It \nwould require a significant replanning of the test program, slow the \ndevelopment, and increase costs in the long run.\n  We made a commitment to a new type of strategy for developing this \nunprecedented system. It is called spiral development. We said to the \nmilitary, you develop this system. We are not going to put you in a \nstraitjacket. We are going to allow you to move forward. And as you \nbring on new science and new capabilities, you decide and make \nrecommendations to us as to how you would deploy it.\n  Maybe we decided it would be unwise for us to mandate exactly how \nthis system should come out. I think that is what I would have as my \nbiggest complaint with Senator Reed's well-meaning amendment. I think \nit puts too much restraint on the freedom and initiative of the leaders \nin the Department of Defense to be creative in making the system and \nutilizing the money we put into the system effectively to come up with \nthe best results.\n  I have been extremely proud of what has been accomplished so far. In \nSeptember, we will deploy a missile in Alaska--the spot in the world \nthat allows us to protect all of our States. It can knock down missiles \nthat might be produced by the North Koreans, who have acted bizarrely \nmany times in recent years. It would also allow us to knock down a \nmissile launched by mistake, which could happen at any time. It would \nnot be a complete system yet, and we will begin to test from that \nplatform. In other words, to have a national missile defense system, \nyou have to have a headquarters, radar, a communications system, Aegis-\ndeployed radar to pick up missiles as soon as possible after launch.\n  This system has to work together as a coherent whole, and you need to \nhave the ability to identify early an incoming missile and knock it \ndown. We have proven hit-to-kill technology, bullet hitting bullet, \nthat has been proven in quite a number of tests, and we continue to try \nto make it even better. I think the best way to test the system is to \ngo forward with the plan we have today, get it in the ground so we can \ntest it in the harsh Alaskan winters, and in the summer, when the \nhumidity is up and maybe there is condensation in the tubes, and we can \nsee how the radar works, and we can make sure we can have communication \nwith our ships and see how the command structure works in order to make \na decision. That is the way we need to test.\n  General Kadish and his team have accomplished a technological feat \nthat many people in this country believe is second only to putting a \nman on the Moon. It is incredible. They have proven that they love \nAmerica, that they are willing to advance rapidly toward a goal but at \nthe same time be honest and prudent with the taxpayers' money.\n  I would not favor an amendment that would constrict them too much. \nThat is what I am afraid this amendment does. That is why I am \nsupportive of Chairman Warner's proposal, which I think would \naccomplish much of what Senator Reed would favor, without adverse \nconsequences.\n  I thank the Chair and yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, how much time remains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island has 7 minutes \nremaining. The Senator from Colorado has 29 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Does the Senator from Rhode Island wish to draw this to a \nclose and move to a vote?\n  Mr. REED. I think I will speak for about 5 minutes, and at that point \nwe can call for a vote.\n  Mr. ALLARD. And I will make just a brief closing comment for about a \nminute or two. Why don't we go ahead. The Senator can make his \nstatement, then I will make my brief statement, and we will move \nforward to a vote. I think we may have to go into a quorum call briefly \nbefore the vote and get things in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, first, I want to emphasize, again, that this \namendment does not affect the deployment decisions that have been made \nwith respect to the missile system. Again, also, we have all talked \nabout operational testing, its importance, and that you have to do it. \nI would be much more confident if, in fact, there was at least a plan \ntoday for operational testing. Mr. Christie and the Department of \nDefense could have developed that over the last year or two. His letter \nsaid this system is so immature that I cannot even begin to think about \noperational testing.\n  Once again, let me raise the obvious. If it is that immature, then \nwhat do we have up in Alaska? Is it going to be a deployed missile \nsystem or a test bed? Or is it going to be both? That is the real core \nof my amendment. The real core is that sometimes, unrelated to \ndeployment, we have to have operational testing.\n  I argue that my amendment provides even more flexibility to the \nDepartment of Defense because it doesn't set a date certain of October \n1, 2005, when this test must be conducted. I don't think we can make \nthat date, frankly. I think we will find ourselves back here on the \nnext Defense authorization bill striking that, extending it, or pushing \nit out because, to me, that is an unrealistic, inflexible deadline.\n  For that reason alone, I urge my colleagues to think particularly \nabout the Warner amendment. There is a suggestion I would unduly hobble \ndevelopment. As I read Senator Warner's language, he directs the \nSecretary of Defense to ensure that each block configuration of the \nballistic missile system is consistent with the operational scheme, \nwhich is precisely what I am saying. But I am not dictating a specific \ntime to do that. The real key difference between Senator Warner's \nproposal and mine is that he is reversing the customary and prudent way \nto do independent operational testing. He is taking away the \nindependence.\n\n  The independence, institutionally, is found in Mr. Christie's office, \nthe Office of Operational Test and Evaluation, not in the Office of the \nSecretary of Defense. Everybody here has to recognize that there is no \nmore political, ideological issue than missile defense in terms of the \nnational security debate. It has been that way for 20 years.\n  To suggest that the Secretary of Defense and members of the Cabinet \nare going to be as independent as someone whose job and career it has \nbeen to render objective judgments about weapons systems and \ndeployability and effectiveness is, I think, defying logic. This is not \nrocket science, it is human behavior. Why are we going to build into \nthe system all those objective judgments and objective pressures that \nany Secretary, regardless of party, regardless of administration, must \nfeel when something this big is before him to decide?\n  That is why we created a system 20 years ago where there is an \nindependent Office of Operational Test and Evaluation, with a director \nappointed by the President and who is not directly subject to political \nwhims, the whims of contractors, or the needs of contractors to make \nsure the funds keep flowing. That is the big distinction between our \namendments. We want operational testing, but we want it to be \nindependent. That is the GAO recommendation--independent, realistic \noperational testing.\n  We are not specifying to do it next week. We are not saying you \ncannot deploy until you test. In fact, I am removing myself from the \ntiming. As I said before, I think it is unrealistic to assume that \nthere can be an accurate operational test by October 1 of next year. It \nis not going to slow down the deployment or development; I don't think \nso. It is going to make sure we learn from each step, each mistake, and \neach achievement. That is what good operational testing does.\n  I feel very strongly that the Warner amendment is trying to talk \nabout operational testing, but the heart of it is not. It is subjective \nevaluation that has been going on now for years with respect to this \nmissile program. I think we have to get back to independent evaluation. \nWe can do it with my amendment, and we can also ensure that we get \nbaseline information about how much is being spent, and the MDA cannot, \nin 1 year, decide that they are a billion dollars off in the cost \nestimate so they change the cost estimate.\n\n[[Page S6941]]\n\nThat is another example documented by GAO of the temptation to funding \nprograms when you are the tester and the testee. That is what the \nWarner amendment would do.\n  So I hope, sincerely, that the Warner amendment can be defeated and \nthat we can move on and adopt the Reed amendment. In the spirit of our \nprior comments, I will yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute. I want to make a \nvery brief comment, and that is this: The key argument is that the \nPentagon's chief tester says the operational test is premature. The \nWarner second-degree amendment requires the definition of ``realistic \ntesting,'' and it requires a test according to these criteria next \nyear. That means we will get realistic testing years sooner than with \nthe Reed amendment.\n  The Warner second-degree amendment provides a formal and appropriate \nrole for the Director of the Office of Test and Evaluation in a \ndevelopmental program. That is an unusual step and actually enhances \nhis role in the ballistic missile test program. It does all this \nwithout incurring the cost and delay of the Reed amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time and ask my \ncolleagues to vote in support of the Warner amendment.\n  Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request that I need to \npropound.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the vote in \nrelation to the pending Warner second-degree amendment, the Senate \nproceed to executive session and consecutive votes on the confirmation \nof the following nominations: James L. Robart, Roger Benitez, and Jane \nBoyle. I further ask unanimous consent that prior to each of the judge \nvotes there be 4 minutes equally divided for debate on the nominations; \nprovided further, that following the votes, the President be notified \nof the Senate's action, and the Senate then resume legislative session.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I, first, ask the distinguished acting \nmanager to modify his request to have the votes following the Warner \nsecond-degree amendment vote to be 10-minute votes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I agree to modify the request to 10-minute votes on the \ntwo following the initial vote--or does the Senator want all three of \nthem?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. On all three of them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Further, Mr. President, under the order, as I understand \nit, prior to voting on the judges, the Senator from Rhode Island has a \nright to offer an amendment to his amendment, if the Warner amendment \nis adopted. The order was he would have the right to offer an \namendment; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the previous order.\n  Mr. REID. So it is my understanding the Senator from Rhode Island \nwill not offer that amendment now. I ask unanimous consent also, Mr. \nPresident--and I think this is in keeping with what Senator Warner \nwanted--that following the disposition of these judges, we return to \nthe Defense bill and that the Senator from Rhode Island be recognized \nto offer another amendment that has already been indicated--I do not \nknow the number of it. It is his second missile defense amendment.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Missile defense is OK.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I understand we may need to ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays on the Warner amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered on the \npending second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. ALLARD. We are ready to proceed to the vote, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Warner \namendment No. 3453. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

The Senate will now go into executive session \nto consider nominations.\n  The clerk will report the first nomination.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of James L. Robart, of \nWashington, to be United States District Judge for the Western District \nof Washington.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, could I inquire of the Presiding Officer, \nare these three votes 10 minutes each?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  There is 4 minutes of debate equally divided.\n  Who yields time?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, this afternoon it is my privilege to \nintroduce you to the incredibly talented nominee for a vacancy on the \nDistrict Court for the Western District of Washington, James Robart.\n  In one sense, today's confirmation vote is a homecoming for Mr. \nRobart. Early in his career, he served as an aide to Senator Scoop \nJackson. I am sure that he would be proud of his accomplishments during \na long and productive legal career, and would whole-heartedly endorse \nhis confirmation.\n  Following his public service as a staff member in both Houses, Mr. \nRobart returned to Washington State, where he has worked as an attorney \nfor the past three decades. During his considerable years of practice \nin Federal court, he has earned a reputation for fairness and \nintegrity.\n  Mr. Robart's nomination is the result of a bipartisan selection \nprocess that has worked very well for Washington State. Members of \nWashington State's legal community, the White House, and my colleague \nSenator Patty Murray and I worked together to review a group of \napplicants. This cooperative approach has produced a number of highly \nqualified judicial nominees, and\n\n[[Page S6942]]\n\nI believe it is a sound model for other States.\n  I am confident that James Robart will make an outstanding Federal \njudge, and that the people of the Western District of Washington will \nbe well-served by his presence on the bench.\n  I am pleased to offer Mr. Robart my full support, and I urge my \ncolleagues to approve his nomination.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Senate considers the nomination \nof James Robart, to be a United States District Judge for the Western \nDistrict of Washington. He is a graduate of Whitman College and the \nGeorgetown University Law Center. Mr. Robart is currently managing \npartner at the law firm of Lane Powell Spears Lubersky, LLP, a firm he \nhas worked at for over 30 years. He has handled complex commercial \nlitigation matters including class actions, securities, and employment \ncases, and has also been involved in counseling clients in the areas of \nantitrust compliance, employment law, and intellectual property.\n  Mr. Robart's nomination is the product of a bipartisan judicial \nnominating commission maintained with the White House by Senators \nMurray and Cantwell. The State of Washington is well-served by its \nbipartisan judicial nominating commission which recommends qualified, \nmoderate nominees on whom members of both parties can agree. It is \ndifficult to understand why President Bush has opposed similar \nbipartisan selections commissions and why this one was so hard to \nestablish. They allow Republicans and Democrats to work together to \nstaff an independent judiciary. I thank Senators Murray and Cantwell \nfor their steadfast efforts in maintaining the commission. The Senate \njust recently confirmed another well-qualified nominee to the District \nCourt for the Western District of Washington, Judge Martinez, and, with \ntoday's vote, the Senate will have confirmed four nominees--all the \nproduct of the bipartisan commission--to the district courts in \nWashington. With this confirmation, there will be no further vacancies \nin the district courts in Washington.\n  I would note that, in proceeding to a vote on Mr. Robart, the \nRepublican leadership has again decided to depart from the order of the \nExecutive Calendar and to skip over the nomination of a non-\ncontroversial and well-qualified Hispanic nominee to the U.S. District \nCourt for the Eastern District in Pennsylvania, Juan Ramon Sanchez. \nThat is their choice. I do not want to see the Democrats blamed for any \ndelay in confirmation votes for Hispanics when Republicans have \ncontrolled the agenda.\n  With this confirmation we will have confirmed more judges this year \nthan in all of the 1996 session, the last time a President was seeking \nreelection.\n  With this confirmation and two more today, the Senate will have \nconfirmed a total of 89 judges this Congress and 189 of this \nPresident's judicial nominees overall. With 89 judicial confirmations \nin just a little more than 17 months, the Senate has confirmed more \nFederal judges than were confirmed during the two full years of 1995 \nand 1996, when Republicans first controlled the Senate and President \nClinton was in the White House. It also exceeds the 2-year total at the \nend of the Clinton administration, when Republicans held the Senate \nmajority in 1999 and 2000.\n  With 189 total confirmations for President Bush, the Senate has \nconfirmed more lifetime appointees for this President than were allowed \nto be confirmed in President Clinton's entire second term, the most \nrecent four-year presidential term and more than were confirmed in \nPresident Reagan's term from 1981 through 1984. Of course President \nReagan is acknowledged as the all-time champ for having appointed more \nfederal judges than any other President in history.\n  I congratulate Mr. Robart and his family on his confirmation.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased today to speak in support of \nJames Robart, who has been nominated to the U.S. District Court for the \nWestern District of Washington.\n  Mr. Robart has exceptional qualifications for the Federal bench. \nAfter graduating from Georgetown University Law Center in 1973 where he \nwas the administrative editor of the Georgetown University Law Review, \nhe joined the law firm of Lane, Powell, Moss & Miller, which is now \nknown as Lane Powell Spears Lubersky LLP.\n  Mr. Robart became a partner in that firm in 1980, and subsequently \nbecame the comanaging partner and later the sole managing partner--a \nposition that he holds today. During his time at the firm, Mr. Robart \nhas specialized in complex commercial litigation with an emphasis on \nclass actions, securities, and employment law.\n  He brings a wealth of trial experience to the Federal bench after \ntrying in excess of 50 cases to verdict or judgment as sole or lead \ncounsel, and he has been active in the representation of the \ndisadvantaged through his work with Evergreen Legal Services and the \nindependent representation of Southeast Asian refugees.\n  Mr. Robart's impressive credentials are reflected in his unanimous \nAmerican Bar Association rating of Well Qualified. I am confident that \nhe will be a fine addition to the bench and urge my colleagues to join \nme in supporting his confirmation.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this side is willing to yield all remaining \ntime on all three judges.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the \nconfirmation of the nomination of James L.

BENITEZ TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR \n                  THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the next nomination.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Roger T. \nBenitez, of California, to be United States District Judge for the \nSouthern District of California.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Senate considers the nomination \nof Roger Benitez to the Southern District of California. Judge Benitez \nis being considered for the last of 5 new seats in the Southern \nDistrict of California that were created by statute on November 2, \n2002, as part of a package of judgeships created for border districts \nthat have a massive caseload and that needed more Federal judges. I \nworked hard with Senator Feinstein to help create these new positions \nunder Democratic Senate leadership. By doing so, we did what the \nRepublican majority refused to do in the years 1995 through 2000 when \nthere was a Democratic President. We did so under Senate Democratic \nleadership knowing\n\n[[Page S6943]]\n\nthat the appointments would be made by a Republican.\n  Unlike many other nominees who have come before this Committee, Roger \nBenitez comes before us with judicial qualifications, having had \nexperience serving as a judge both in State and Federal courts. He \nserved for 4 years as a California Superior Court Judge for Imperial \nCounty and 3 years as a U.S. Magistrate Judge for the Southern District \nfor California.\n  However, like many nominees of this President, concerns have been \nraised about this nominee's fitness to serve. Judge Benitez is one of \n28 of President Bush's nominees who have received a partial or majority \nrating of ``Not Qualified'' from the ABA Committee that conducts a peer \nevaluation of judicial nominees. Of those, 18 have already been \nconfirmed and another has been recess appointed.\n  Before President Bush ejected the ABA from the process of providing \nan informal rating prior to a nomination, temperament or ethics \nconcerns would have been raised at the early stage of a nominee's \nconsideration and in time for the White House to make a decision \nwhether to proceed with that nominee, with knowledge of such \ndeterminations and the opportunity to conduct follow-up inquiry. The \nchange in the role of the ABA has led to ABA ratings being less \nhelpful. In Judge Benitez's case, based on interviews with 23 judges \nand 44 attorneys, more than 10 members of the ABA committee concluded \nthat, based on his temperament, he is not qualified to serve a lifetime \nappointment on the Federal bench.\n  Despite these concerns, Judge Benitez is supported by both of his \nhome-State Senators and is the product of the bipartisan commission \nthat Senators Feinstein and Boxer have worked so hard to maintain. I \nwill honor their support of this nominee and support him, as well. With \nthis confirmation, the Senate will have confirmed 14 nominees to the \ndistrict courts in California.\n  Judge Benitez is the 17th Latino confirmed to the Federal courts in \nthe past three years. With the exception of Mr. Estrada, who failed to \nanswer many questions and provide the Senate with his writings and \nviews, we have pressed forward to confirm all of the other Latinos \nwhose nominations have been reported to the floor. Democrats will now \nhave supported the swift confirmation of 17 of President Bush's 21 \nLatino nominees. Unfortunately, Republicans have been delaying Senate \nconsideration of a number of Hispanic nominees and passed over several \nof the numbers would be even better.\n  While President Clinton nominated 11 Latino nominees to Circuit Court \npositions, 3 of those 11 were blocked by the Republican Senate and \nnever given a vote. President Bush has only nominated 4 Latino nominees \nto Circuit Court positions, three of whom have been confirmed with \nDemocratic support. President Bush's 21 Latino nominees constitute less \nthan 10 percent of his nominees, even though Latinos make up a larger \npercentage of the U.S. population. It is revealing that this President \nhas nominated more people associated with the Federalist Society than \nHispanics, African Americans and Asian Pacific Americans, combined. \nWhile President Clinton cared deeply about diversity on the Federal \nbench, this President is more interested in narrow and slanted judicial \nideology.\n  I congratulate Judge Benitez and his family on his confirmation.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my unqualified \nsupport for the nomination of Robert Benitez to the District Court for \nthe Southern District of California and to urge my colleagues to \nconfirm this fine nominee.\n  Born in Havana, Cuba, Judge Benitez's life embodies the spirit and \nstrength of this Nation. After coming to this country, he obtained a \nlaw degree from the Western State University College of Law in 1978, \nand then distinguished himself in a diverse and successful law \npractice. The people of California recognized his obvious ability and \nappointed him to the Superior Court in 1997. He was re-elected to that \ncourt in 1998, and served with distinction until 2001. Since that time, \nJudge Benitez has served as a Federal magistrate judge in the Southern \nDistrict of California.\n  Mr. Benitez is an exceptional nominee. I fully expect him to serve \nwith distinction on the Federal bench in California.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I oppose the nomination of Roger T. \nBenitez to be a United States District Judge for the Southern District \nof California because this nominee received a rating by the American \nBar Association of ``substantial majority Not Qualified.'' More than 10 \nmembers of the 15-member ABA evaluation committee agreed that \nMagistrate Judge Benitez is unqualified for this position. The ABA \nconducts thorough background investigations of all of the President's \nArticle III judicial nominees.\n  At the February 25, 2004 nomination hearing of Judge Benitez, ABA \nofficials made the following statements on the record:\n\n       Judge Benitez is ``arrogant, pompous, condescending, \n     impatient, short-tempered, rude, insulting, bullying, \n     unnecessarily mean, and altogether lacking in people \n     skills.''\n       Judge Benitez ``would often become irrationally upset and \n     outraged if an attorney who had been appointed to represent a \n     defendant had a scheduling conflict and asked another equally \n     competent and prepared attorney to appear before the \n     nominee.''\n       Interviewees had ``grave doubts about Judge Benitez' \n     ability to competently handle the more demanding docket \n     caseload of a Federal district judge and efficiently manage a \n     district courtroom, based on their perception of his very \n     slow and rigid manner of handling his current court \n     calendar.''\n       ``Based on their exposure to the nominee's mode of relating \n     professionally to others in his official capacity as a judge, \n     interviewees expressed doubt over Judge Benitez's ability to \n     become an accommodating and collegial member of the Federal \n     district court.''\n       ``[T]he nominee's temperament problems are compounded by \n     the fact that Judge Benitez fails to appreciate the depth of \n     concern by the bench and bar regarding his temperament and \n     has not demonstrated that he is willing or able to address \n     those concerns.''\n       ``Our committee members, after reviewing my report on the \n     nominee, were particularly concerned about the clear, \n     consistent pattern to the criticisms that emerged from the \n     interview.''\n\n  These statements are highly troubling, and they strongly suggest that \nJudge Benitez is not prepared for this important lifetime position.\n  I am also concerned about the ABA's discovery that Judge Benitez has \na practice of limiting the number of guilty pleas that he accepts on a \ngiven day. The ABA said that this practice was ``highly unusual \ncompared to most other Federal judges, who will typically hear several \nmatters in a day of the kind Judge Benitez has on his docket.''\n  The ABA did not make these allegations or reach the rating of Not \nQualified lightly. The ABA investigator, Richard M. Macias, conducted \ninterviews with 23 judges and 44 attorneys, and two-thirds of those \ninterviewed raised concerns, including a majority of both judges and \nlawyers. The comments were based on first-hand knowledge or \nobservation. The ABA reports that ``[t]he negative comments about Judge \nBenitez' temperament reflected a consistent pattern over the years up \nto the present time.''\n  Mr. Macias, a respected member of the legal profession and an \nexperienced ABA investigator, said that he has never received so many \nnegative comments about a judicial nominee in the 10 years he has been \nconducting background investigations. Mr. Macias was supported in his \ntestimony by Thomas Z. Hayward, Jr., a respected Chicago attorney and \nchair of the ABA's Standing Committee on Federal Judiciary.\n  When he took office, President George W. Bush abolished the historic \npractice--dating back to President Eisenhower--of seeking the views of \nthe ABA, the Nation's largest association of attorneys, before making \nan Article III judicial nomination. One of the main reasons that \npresidents waited for the ABA evaluation was to avoid nominating \nunqualified nominees and prevent situations like the one we face today \nwith Judge Benitez. Past Presidents often decided not to nominate \nindividuals who received ABA ratings of Not Qualified. President Bush \nwould be wise to reinstate the ABA's traditional role in the judicial \nnomination process.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Roger T. Benitez, of California, to be \nUnited States District Judge for the Southern District of California?\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

BOYLE TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE \n                       NORTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the next nomination.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Jane J. Boyle, of Texas, \nto be United States District Judge for the Northern District of Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wonder if Senator Reid and Senator Warner \nare here. I want to clarify the length of time which the next amendment \nwill take. My understanding is that Senator Reed's amendment might take \nas little as 10 minutes; in which case, it would make sense to stack \nhis vote with the vote on the Biden amendment which would then be 2 \nhours later. However, if there is objection to that, I think people \nshould be informed there could be another vote after this final vote on \njudges in about 10 or 15 minutes.\n  I am wondering if Senator Warner is here.\n  Mr. WARNER. He is right here.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is Senator Reid here?\n  Mr. REED. I am here.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Senator Harry Reid, too.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, for the convenience of the Senate, \nstacking the two votes is quite acceptable.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Should I make a unanimous consent request? I think Senator \nHatch----\n  Mr. WARNER. I discussed it with him, and it is fine.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after this \nvote, there then be a period of time to debate the Senator Jack Reed \namendment, which we expect would be short. We would immediately go to \nthe Biden amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we were going to intersperse a Sessions \namendment for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will amend that to ask that immediately after Jack \nReed's amendment, there be a Sessions amendment for 30 minutes equally \ndivided, and that we then go to a Biden amendment for perhaps as much \nas 2 hours, and there be three votes stacked at that point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Excuse me. Do we have a copy of the Sessions amendment? Is \nSenator Sessions here?\n  Mr. WARNER. He is not here.\n  Mr. LEVIN. So there will be no time agreement on the Sessions \namendment until we know which amendment it is.\n  Mr. WARNER. We must check with our Finance Committee regarding the \ntime on the Biden amendment. We are trying to work toward putting the \nvotes in one batch.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I revise that unanimous consent request to \nask that immediately after the debate on Senator Reed's amendment, it \nbe laid aside and we proceed to a debate on the Sessions amendment; \nthat it then be laid aside and we then go to the Biden amendment, and \nwe will hopefully have three votes at that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Ms. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, the nominee we are going to vote on, \nJane Boyle, has served our country in so many positions: U.S. \nmagistrate, where she had an outstanding record, as our U.S. Attorney, \nwhere she had an equally outstanding record. She has shown fairness, a \njudicial temperament, and great leadership in every position she has \nheld.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to have recommended her nomination along \nwith my colleague, Senator Cornyn, and before that, Senator Gramm. We \nhave never been disappointed in Jane Boyle's performance, and know she \nwill be an outstanding judge.\n  I urge a vote for her nomination.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I also support the nomination of Jane J. \nBoyle.\n  Mr. President, Ms. Boyle is currently the United States Attorney for \nthis district. She comes to the Senate with extensive litigation and \njudicial experience. Before serving as the Northern District's U.S. \nAttorney, Ms. Boyle served for over a decade as a United States \nMagistrate and she served for years as a Federal and city prosecutor. I \nsupport Ms. Boyle's nomination.\n  With the three judicial confirmation votes today, the Senate will now \nhave confirmed 20 judicial nominees this year alone. Only 17 judges \nwere confirmed under Republican leadership in the entire 1996 session \nand no circuit court nominees were confirmed that entire time. That was \nthe last year in which a President was seeking reelection. The Senate \nhas now exceeded the number of total judges confirmed and the number of \ncircuit court judges confirmed.\n  With these three confirmations today, the Senate will have confirmed \na total of 89 judges this Congress and 189 of this President's judicial \nnominees overall. With 89 judicial confirmations in just a little more \nthan 17 months, the Senate has confirmed more Federal judges than were \nconfirmed during the two full years of 1995 and 1996, when Republicans \nfirst controlled the Senate and President Clinton was in the White \nHouse. It also exceeds the two-year total at the end of the Clinton \nadministration, when Republicans held the Senate majority in 1999 and \n2000. It is not quite as many as the 100 judges nominated by President \nBush that a Democratic-led Senate confirmed in our 17 months in the \nmajority in 2001 and 2002.\n  With 189 total confirmations for President Bush, the Senate has \nconfirmed more lifetime appointees for this President than were allowed \nto be confirmed in the most recent four-year presidential term that of \nPresident Clinton from 1997 through 2000. It is more than a Republican \nmajority confirmed in President Reagan's entire term from 1981 through \n1984. Of course, President Reagan is recognized as the all-time champ \nin terms of judicial appointments having appointed more than any other \nPresident in our history.\n  I congratulate Ms. Boyle on her confirmation.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in support of the confirmation of \nJane J. Boyle to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of \nTexas. I have had the pleasure to review Ms. Boyle's distinguished \ncareer and I am confident that she will make a fine Federal judge.\n  Jane J. Boyle is an extremely experienced attorney who has tried over \n180 cases to a verdict during her impressive career as an assistant \ndistrict attorney, an assistant U.S. attorney, and as the U.S. attorney \nfor the Northern District of Texas. She has also served with \ndistinction as a magistrate judge in the same district. Ms. Boyle \nbrings a wealth of experience to the Federal\n\n[[Page S6945]]\n\nbench and she will make an excellent addition to the Northern District \nof Texas.\n  I am not alone in believing that Ms. Boyle will make an outstanding \nFederal district judge. The Texas Employment Lawyers Association, TELA, \ncalls Ms. Boyle ``considerate, concerned, and well-read,'' in addition \nto possessing ``a great deal of knowledge about employment law'' and an \nexcellent judicial demeanor that is reflected in her ``even-handed and \nfair'' approach to adjudication. Ms. Boyle also has strong bipartisan \nsupport. The current chair of the Dallas County Democratic Party has \nwritten a letter expressing her ``enthusiastic support of the \nnomination of Jane J. Boyle,'' and a former chair of the same \norganization wrote a letter stating that ``in the case of this nominee, \npartisan considerations are unwise and should evaporate.''\n  Ms. Boyle's experience both as a U.S. attorney and as a Federal \nmagistrate judge will serve her well on the Federal district court. I \nurge my colleagues to join me in strong support of Ms. Boyle's \nnomination.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I am proud today to cast my vote in the \naffirmative for Jane J. Boyle who has been nominated to the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Northern District of Texas. She presently serves \nas United States Attorney for the Northern District of Texas. Judge \nBoyle has a long and distinguished career of public service and is well \nqualified to return to the bench having served as United States \nMagistrate Judge for the Northern District of Texas from 1990 to 2002.\n  In addition, she served a previous term as United States Attorney, \nNorthern District of Texas from 1987 to 1990, and was an Assistant \nDistrict Attorney in the Dallas County District Attorney's Office from \n1981 to 1987.\n  Judge Boyle is imminently well qualified, as the ABA has rated her. \nMore importantly, there is bipartisan consensus of those who know her \nand work with her. Moreover, she has garnered the respect of her \ncolleagues and those who work for her. Most notably, she has gained the \nrespect of the Dallas community, including folks from the entire \npolitical spectrum.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have a related article printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 (For immediate release, June 17, 2004)\n\n                Senate Confirms Jane Boyle for Judgeship\n\n\n      will fill vacant seat in Northern District, based in Dallas\n\n       Washington.--The U.S. Senate on Thursday unanimously \n     approved the federal judicial nomination of current U.S. \n     Attorney Jane Boyle to be the U.S. District Judge for the \n     Northern District of Texas. Boyle, 49, will be based in \n     Dallas, and replaces retired Judge Jerry L. Buchmeyer. The \n     Northern District's jurisdiction includes 100 counties.\n       ``Jane Boyle has remarkable experience and knowledge of the \n     law. She has done an outstanding job as U.S. Attorney in \n     Dallas, and I'm confident that she will continue to serve \n     Texas and the nation with excellence,'' Cornyn said. ``She \n     has garnered the respect of her colleagues, those who work \n     for her, and most notably, she has gained the respect of \n     folks from across the political spectrum.''\n       U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Judiciary Committee, \n     along with Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, recommended Boyle to \n     President Bush on September 9, 2003. The President nominated \n     Boyle on November 24, 2003, and she was confirmed by the \n     Judiciary Committee on April 1, 2004.\n       Boyle was appointed by President George W. Bush in 2002 to \n     be U.S. Attorney for the Northern District after a long and \n     distinguished legal career in Texas. Prior to that selection, \n     she served as U.S. Magistrate Judge for the Northern District \n     for twelve years, earning significant judicial experience in \n     the region.\n       Boyle also worked for a number of years as an Assistant \n     U.S. Attorney and an Assistant District Attorney for Dallas \n     County. She earned a J.D. degree from Southern Methodist \n     University School of Law in 1981 and graduated with honors \n     from The University of Texas at Austin in 1977. She has been \n     published in numerous legal periodicals, including the Texas \n     Bar Journal.\n       Sen. Cornyn chairs the subcommittee on the Constitution, \n     Civil Rights & Property Rights, and is the only former judge \n     on the committee. He also serves on the Armed Services, \n     Environment and Public Works, and Budget Committees. He \n     served previously as Texas Attorney General, Texas Supreme \n     Court Justice, and Bexar County District Judge.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nnomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas, Mr. Cornyn, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, in the interest of time, I will not \nbelabor the point. I wanted to add my voice to that of Senator \nHutchison commending this fine nominee, Jane Boyle, to the U.S. Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Shall the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Jane J. Boyle, of Texas, to be United \nStates District Judge for the Northern District of Texas?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that Senator Warner \nand Senator Reed have worked out an arrangement whereby the missile \ndefense amendment will not be offered, but the end strength amendment \nwill be offered at this time.\n  The chairman has arrived. What I have said is that the chairman and \nSenator Reed have agreed that his missile defense amendment will be \noffered at a subsequent time and that now the end strength amendment \nthat has been around for several days would be debated at this time and \nvoted upon.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, that was a suggestion I made to the \nSenator from Rhode Island. I think he will perhaps reflect on the need \nto go forward with his second missile defense amendment, and he had \nasked for that need to be reconsidered. Therefore, in its place we can \nput the end strength amendment, which would be a matter of convenience \nand great interest to our membership on this side, given it is a \nbipartisan amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Following that, the amendment of Senator Sessions will be \noffered, and following that the amendment of Senator Biden will be \noffered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Could we put time agreements on this now?\n  Mr. REID. We certainly should be able to.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S6946]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the distinguished leadership on the other \nside and myself and the leadership on this side have worked out the \nfollowing time agreements: On the amendment from the Senator from Rhode \nIsland, which has a second degree from the Senator from Virginia, Mr. \nWarner--\n  Mr. REID. No. 3352.\n  Mr. WARNER. Correct--we would need 40 minutes equally divided on \nthose amendments.\n  Mr. REID. A total of 40 minutes?\n  Mr. WARNER. A total of 40 minutes equally divided. We would then \nproceed to lay that aside and proceed to an amendment by the Senator \nfrom Alabama.\n  Mr. REID. No. 3371.\n  Mr. WARNER. Correct. That will take 20 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Twenty minutes equally divided?\n  Mr. WARNER. Fifteen on this side, and I think the other side only \nneeded 5 on that amendment.\n  Mr. REID. We will take the 15 and probably would not use it.\n  Mr. WARNER. Then 30 minutes equally divided. That amendment will not \nrequire other than a voice vote which we will do. We will then \nimmediately proceed to the Biden amendment.\n  Mr. REID. No. 3379.\n  Mr. WARNER. Correct. At the moment, that would require 2 hours \nequally divided, with the expectation that can be reduced in time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent, as the chairman has indicated, \nthat on amendment No. 3352 there be 40 minutes equally divided, with no \nsecond-degree amendments in order except for the one that Senator \nWarner has indicated that he will offer, and Senator Reed knows about \nthat; No. 3371, there be no second-degree amendments in order; and No. \n3379, there be no second-degree amendments in order, with the time as \nstated previously. There would be no second-degree amendments then \nprior to the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. As indicated, 40 minutes, 30 minutes, and 2 hours.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. I concur in the request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3450 To Amendment No. 3352\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask for regular order for No. 3352.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That amendment is now pending.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I understand that Senator Warner has a \nsecond-degree amendment which I will accept.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct, and I seek now to modify it, and I will \nsend a modification to the desk and add to the modified amendment.\n  It is a very minor modification. I simply strike one word, and it is \nthe word ``the.'' I send the modification to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 3450), as modified, is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide for funding the increased number of Army active-\n      duty personnel out of fiscal year 2005 supplemental funding)\n\n       Strike line 2 and insert the following:\n     ``502,400, subject to the condition that costs of active duty \n     personnel of the Army in excess of 482,400 shall be paid out \n     of funds authorized to be appropriated for fiscal year 2005 \n     for a contingent emergency reserve fund or as an emergency \n     supplemental appropriation''.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I am ready to indicate to my colleague we have worked on \nthis amendment in the second degree. It is my understanding that the \nSenator from Rhode Island is prepared to take the Warner amendment as \nmodified.\n  Mr. REED. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine.\n  Mr. REED. I want to thank the chairman for his instructive work on \nthis amendment. He recognizes, as I recognize, along with my colleagues \nand principal cosponsors Senators Hagel, McCain, Corzine, Akaka, and \nBiden, that our Army is stretched very thin across the globe with \nnumerous missions, and in order to fulfill these missions we have to \nraise the end strength of the Army.\n  The amendment before us today would put within the authorized end \nstrength a 20,000 increase in the number of soldiers in the U.S. Army. \nThese are the number of troops the Army has indicated that they can \nabsorb this year, and that they can train and utilize this year. It \nrepresents the recognition that we cannot simply depend upon emergency \npowers through supplementals to increase the end strength of the Army. \nWe have to, as we do in this amendment, put in the actual end strength \nnumber to reflect a larger Army and also to reflect the fact that this \nis not a temporary occurrence.\n  Our commitments in Iraq, Afghanistan, and around the globe are going \nto require a substantially larger Army for an indefinite period of \ntime.\n  As a result, working together with the chairman, we have placed in \nthe Defense authorization bill the precise number of soldiers, this \nprecise increase of 20,000 troops.\n  What the chairman has added, though, is the fact that these troops \nhave to be paid for. There is a strong argument that we should pay for \nthem in terms of regular budget authority, but he has suggested that we \nagain go the emergency supplemental route to pay for these troops, \nwhich are now fully authorized in law. What I wanted to accomplish in \nthe amendment first is to make sure we do incorporate a suitable end \nstrength number. That has been accomplished.\n  Second, I wanted to avoid a situation where the Army had to go within \nits existing programs to search high and low for dollars to pay for \nthese extra troops. That has been accomplished by the chairman's \nsuggestion that we move some funds already identified in the emergency \nsupplemental and designate those to pay for these additional troops.\n  So we have avoided a situation where the Army this year is going to \nbe forced to come up with funds by going through and ransacking their \nexisting programs, and we have set it in the authorization bill, the \nappropriate forum for such a decision. We have set in the precise \nnumber of end strength that is appropriate this year for the U.S. Army.\n  The question still arises, What happens in succeeding years? The \nargument myself, Senator McCain, Senator Hagel, and others have made is \nwe cannot continue to depend upon supplemental and emergency funding. \nThis is not an emergency. This is a fact of life in the world today. We \nneed a larger Army.\n  We are accomplishing our objectives today for this fiscal year in \nthis authorization, but I think the chairman and we all recognize we \nwill eventually confront a situation where we have to raise the bottom \nline of the Army in terms of the funds they have. We do not want to see \na situation a year from now or 2 years from now when the supplementals \nare inadequate but the needs of these troops are still persistent.\n  Senator Levin has language in this authorization bill that indicates \nin succeeding years, after this fiscal year and after this \nauthorization bill, any increase in end strength will have to be put in \nthe Army budget. I think that is an appropriate response. I think the \nReed amendment as modified by Senator Warner will, in effect, \naccomplish that.\n  This is the thrust of the amendment. I have had an opportunity to \nexplain it. At this point I reserve the remainder of my time to allow \nthe Senator from Virginia to comment.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague. This is one of those situations. \nSenator Reed is a very valued member of the committee and the amendment \nhas strong cosponsorship; namely, Senators McCain and Hagel and others \non our side. I think all along the committee has recognized the need to \nwork with the Department of Defense, most specifically the Department \nof Army, to resolve this situation. I thought it necessary to second \ndegree the amendment which would authorize the Department of Defense to \npay the cost of the additional Active-Duty soldiers for fiscal year \n2005 from supplemental or\n\n[[Page S6947]]\n\ncontingent emergency reserve funds because the sponsors of the \namendment had not identified the considerable sum, some $2 billion \nplus, that their amendment would generate in the need for the Army \nbudget.\n  The Army needs this Active-Duty strength. I think we are in agreement \non this point.\n  Senator, I indicate now I am going to urge my colleagues to accept \nthe amendment.\n  I note that in the bill we are considering there is a specific \nauthorization which the committee worked out in section 402 for \ntemporary increases of up to 30,000 active duty soldiers above the \ncurrently authorized level. This goes 10,000 active-duty soldiers \nbeyond the end strength level proposed in Senators Reed and Hagel's \namendment.\n  My second degree amendment, however, addresses the real issue \nstemming from these increases--how to pay for them. The Reed/Hagel \namendment provides no offsets for the $2.4 billion cost of these extra \ntroops. I submit that this is not a cost for the Department to take \n``out of hide,'' or that the Department of the Army should absorb out \nof the FY 2005 budget.\n  The approach in my second degree amendment reflects the \nrecommendation of the Army Chief of Staff, General Schoomaker, who \ntestified that using supplemental appropriations gives necessary \nflexibility and is, in fact, essential to preserve the Army's ability \nto plan for operational readiness in the present and modernization for \nthe future.\n  The Reed/Hagel amendment would have the effect of directing the Army \nto increase its end strength by 20,000 in FY 2005 at a cost of $2.4 \nbillion. The amendment identifies no offset, it identifies no means to \npay for these additional troops. Consider the potential effect of that \nproposal on the Army. The $2.4 billion represents a 15 percent \nreduction of funding for direct costs of operating forces for home \nstation training, exercises and operations; in other words--fuel, spare \nparts, maintenance, food, and other consumables. Alternatively, this \nreduction would eliminate almost all funding for Army individual and \nunit training--such as basic training, flight training, and combat \ntraining center rotations. The $2.4 billion represents a 42 percent \nreduction of funding for Army command and control, logistics, weapons \nand ammunition transportation and storage. It could reduce resources to \nkey readiness and modernization accounts, as indicated above, and \ndivert money needed to train and retain more experienced personnel \nbecause of the imperative to satisfy an end strength number.\n  My amendment would afford the Army the opportunity to flexibly \nexecute its budget while increasing its manpower. I would ask you to \nkeep this in mind and also keep in mind that the conferees will have \nthe task of finding $2.4 billion in offsets if this amendment becomes a \nlaw.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague Senator \nJack Reed in introducing an amendment to the fiscal year 2005 Defense \nauthorization bill to increase the size of the United States Army by \n20,000 additional troops.\n  Over the last year the Congress has expressed grave concern that our \nArmed Forces are too small to meet the extraordinary demands being \nplaced on them today. These demands will be with us well into the \nfuture.\n  Senator Reed and I are proposing this amendment to formally increase \nthe size of the United States Army by 20,000 troops in the coming year.\n  The additional troops are urgently required to give the Chief of \nStaff of the U.S. Army the tools he needs to fight the war on \nterrorism, stabilize Iraq and Afghanistan, and meet the global demands \nbeing placed on the total force today.\n  Under emergency authority, the U.S. Army has already exceeded its \nauthorized end strength by around 15,000 soldiers. This amendment \nprovides straightforward congressional approval for these additional \ntroops. It also puts the future funding of these troops on the record, \nnot masked in the emergency supplemental appropriations process.\n  The size and cost of the Army must be transparent to the American \npeople, our allies, and to those that would oppose us in the war on \nterrorism.\n  This amendment gives General Schoomaker, the Chief of Staff of the \nUnited States Army, the additional manpower he has told us he needs to \ntransform the total force . . . the active duty Army, the Army Reserve, \nand the Army National Guard.\n  The amendment recognizes the fact that the Army needs 20,000 more \ntroops now. In the future the Army must also be authorized to add \n10,000 more soldiers.\n  The amendment increases the approved Army end strength personnel \nfloor from 482,400 to 502,400 troops. It tells the soldiers in the Army \nthat we strongly support increasing the size of the Army to meet the \nincreased demands being placed on the service.\n  I commend Chairman Warner and ranking member Levin for their \noutstanding work on this Defense authorization bill. Members of our \nArmed Forces are currently engaged in combat operations in Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  Hundreds of thousands of American men and women in uniform are \nserving around the world defending the freedoms we hold dear.\n  Chairman Warner and ranking member Levin are tireless supporters of \nour men and women in these dangerous times. Our Nation owes them both, \nand their staffs, a debt of gratitude for their service.\n  I also appreciate the Chairman's contribution to this effort with his \nsecond degree amendment.\n  And finally, I wish the U.S. Army a happy 229th birthday.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am very pleased to be a cosponsor of this \namendment with Senators Reed, McCain, Hagel, Corzine, and Akaka.\n  I understand that we have accepted the Senator from Virginia's \namendment paying for these additional 20,000 soldiers in the \nsupplemental.\n  While I think the Army would be better served by an end strength \nincrease that is not subject to repeated supplementals, I am pleased \nthat we are all in agreement that we need more troops today.\n  I think it is very simple. Soldiers provide stability. Without \nadequate numbers of boots on the ground, you can't get security and \nstability.\n  That is true in Iraq, Afghanistan, Korea, and the Balkans.\n  As Senator McCain and I have both said repeatedly, we need more \ntroops in Iraq to achieve stability. If we had put more troops into \nIraq after major combat operations, the situation might be very \ndifferent. I don't believe it is too late. I still think that \nadditional troops are needed.\n  I also believe that it is my obligation to back that up with some \nrelief for those soldiers serving today. We shouldn't have to keep \nissuing ``stop-loss'' orders, forcing soldiers to stay in the Army.\n  Let's give the Army what it needs.\n  What my colleagues and I hoped to accomplish was to reassure today's \nsoldiers and their families that they will not have to keep looking at \nextended deployments and stop-loss orders. Instead, we want them to \nknow that we are committed to making the Army large enough to do the \nmissions America is asking it to do.\n  Some of our colleagues believe that the need for additional soldiers \nis temporary. I disagree.\n  It is true that the Army is planning a major restructuring. This may \nmean future efficiencies, but we don't know that yet. Like any other \nmajor change, more resources are needed during the change. In this \ncase, more soldiers are needed as the Army moves to a more capable \nbrigade structure.\n  I would rather plan for the clear needs of the next decade in the \nregular budget. I don't think we should be relying on supplementals to \nprovide the right sized Army.\n  If I and my colleagues are wrong, then we can revisit these numbers \nand cut end strength like we did in the beginning of the last decade. I \nwould rather take the cautious approach and err on the side of our \nsoldiers and their families.\n  I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment which takes us closer to \nthat goal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, with the series of votes that we have, first \non Reed and then on Biden--we have received word there may be a couple \nof other Senators who may want to speak on this amendment. I ask \nunanimous\n\n[[Page S6948]]\n\nconsent of the Chair, in the form of a unanimous consent request, that \nprior to the Reed amendment being voted on, as amended by Warner, there \nbe 10 minutes set aside to talk about that prior to this vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. I think that is an accommodating gesture. In fact, the \namount of time I reserved on this side, portions of it perhaps could be \nyielded back, and then absorbed by the proposal of the distinguished \nleader.\n  Mr. REID. The time may not be necessary.\n  Mr. WARNER. It may not be necessary. But so many of our colleagues \nare doing a lot of work all over the system right now. They didn't \nrecognize that this would be brought up at this time. We want to \naccommodate them.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that prior to the \nvote on the Reed amendment, Senator Reed control 10 minutes, Senator \nReed of Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I yield such time as remained.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, would the distinguished Democratic leader \nallow the time to be managed on this side by either Senators Hagel or \nMcCain, the time we have on this side? That would sort of divide it \nbetween yourself and the two colleagues on this side?\n  Mr. REID. That would be appropriate because those were the two \nSenators we were worried about.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the chairman for his constructive participation in \nthis process and also to emphasize what he has emphasized and that is \nthe extraordinary stress our Army is withstanding at this point. They \nare doing it magnificently, performing with great skill and \nprofessionalism.\n  We have 126,000 soldiers in Iraq; we have 13,000 soldiers in \nAfghanistan; we have soldiers still in the Balkans, 2,500; we have \nforces in Kuwait, about 17,000; we still have our mission in the Sinai; \nwe have 1,700 soldiers in Guantanamo maintaining the detention \nfacilities there; we have 16,000 soldiers, Noble Eagle, which is the \nheart of our defense of our homeland; we have soldiers in the \nPhilippines; 31,600 soldiers in South Korea. We have them all over the \nworld doing an extraordinary task and job for our company. Frankly, \nthey need more help and that is the heart of the Reed amendment.\n  In addition to that, we have seen troubling signs that this \noperational tempo is putting great stress and duress on our soldiers. \nRecently, there was a stop-loss order announced by the G-1 of the U.S. \nArmy that said essentially any soldier who is scheduled to depart \nwithin 90 days for deployment cannot leave the service, even if that \nsoldier's time in service has expired. Essentially what they have said \nis: You can't get out of the service. The Volunteer Army is no longer \ncompletely volunteer. That is just one example.\n  We are withdrawing troops from Korea at a time when there is a huge \ncrisis on the peninsula. The North Koreans indicated they have \nplutonium; they are intending to process it. They may have already \nconstructed eight nuclear devices. We don't know for sure. Yet at this \ntime when we need maximum military force to complement our diplomacy, \nwe are withdrawing troops, which is perhaps sending a signal to the \nNorth Koreans that they can wait us out or that we are not able or \nready to match our diplomacy appropriately with military force.\n  That is another prime example, I believe. In fact, frankly, I think \nthat if North Korea 2 or 3 years ago brazenly declared they had nuclear \nweapons, our response would not have been to withdraw troops. The calls \nin this Chamber would have been for more troops in Korea. But now \nbecause of Iraq that is difficult; we are pulling them out to send them \nto Iraq.\n  Then we have a situation in our training centers, the infrastructure \nof the Army. This is one of the major reasons why we have such \nextraordinarily skilled soldiers.\n  First, they are men and women of courage and character, but second \nthey received the greatest, most realistic training in the world. They \nare individuals who can and will do any job, but they do that so well \nbecause they are the best trained.\n  We are taking soldiers from our training centers--those trainers who \nare preparing the troops to go overseas--and we are deploying them.\n  As a result, these are indications that we have a military force \nwhich is significantly stretched. That is why it is so important to \nraise the number of troops that we have entering the Army.\n  Today, the Army has 495,374 soldiers serving on active duty. The end \nstrength has to increase. The Reed amendment increases it by 20,000 \ntroops.\n  There are those who have predicted we would get in this predicament. \nGeneral Shalikashvili's predictions and other predictions are coming \ntrue. Our responsibility is now to give the military, particularly the \nArmy, sufficient resources and sufficient personnel to do the job which \nwe are asking them to do.\n  Last December, in 2003, the Army's Strategic Studies Institute \npublished a report which stated that the ground force requirements in \nIraq have forced the U.S. Army to the breaking point.\n  We have to prevent that breaking point from being reached, and that \nmeans putting more troops into the force structure.\n  Last year, during the appropriations debate, Senator Hagel and I \nsponsored an amendment that would have raised the end strength by \n10,000 in the supplemental appropriations. It passed the Senate. I \nthank my colleagues on both sides who were very supportive of that. \nBut, unfortunately, at that point the administration thought it was \nunnecessary and they were able to successfully defeat that proposal in \nconference. At least now they recognize the need for additional troops. \nBut what they are still adhering to is this notion that the emergency \nis temporary.\n  I hope by putting the actual number of the end strength increase in \nthis bill we are sending a signal to everyone that we will, in fact, \nstay the course--not just rhetorically but with actual resources and \nactual troops.\n  Senator Warner explained the funding mechanism was one where some of \nus would have preferred, frankly, if we could have, to increase just \nthe bottom line of the Army. But given these other demands on resources \nand this authorization bill, it was his suggestion that we, once again, \nuse emergency funding to fund this now authorized end strength. That \ngets us through this year. But the concern I have and the concern \nothers have is that we will reach a point within a year or two where \nthe Army is going to have these troops in uniform but their baseline is \nnot going to be sufficient if a supplemental or emergency funding is \nnot made readily available. That is a real crisis and we have to start \nthinking about that now.\n  Senator Levin has been very thoughtful on this topic. He has language \nin the bill that says any increases in the next fiscal year of the end \nstrength have to be budgeted through regular budget processes. Again, I \nhope that takes place. But that means giving more resources to our \nArmy, and we will work--I think I can speak for Senator Warner--to make \nsure the Army has those resources.\n  I am very pleased we are able to make this adjustment--overdue \nadjustment--in the end strength of the U.S. Army.\n  I retain the remainder of my time, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  If no one yields time, time will be charged equally to both sides.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, in regard to the Reed amendment--and \nthat discussion has been had so far--I am pleased that the chairman and \nSenator Reed have worked out an agreement. I hope that will be \nsatisfactory.\n  I haven't had time to fully study the details of it, but I expect to \nbe supportive of the agreement which they have reached. We know the \nArmy is stretched today. We definitely need to consider what we can do \nto alleviate that.\n  I would like to add a few thoughts in general on the subject of the \nArmy, its restructuring which is ongoing, and how we best can deal with \nit and what our policy about it should be.\n\n[[Page S6949]]\n\n  We are in the process of a major restructuring within all of the \nDepartment of Defense, but particularly the Army. In dealing with that, \nthey are in the middle of it right now.\n  General Schoomaker, who spent his career as a combat officer and a \nspecial forces officer, is a man of decisive leadership skills. He is \nworking very hard to determine how to get the Army in the posture we \nwant it to be.\n  With Guard and Reserve, we have over 2 million personnel in uniform, \nbut we are finding it extremely difficult to maintain 150,000 or less \nsoldiers in Iraq.\n  General Schoomaker has a story which he tells. It is about a rain \nbarrel. He says the way he sees the military, the Army's rain barrel \nhas a spigot and the spigot is about two-thirds of the way up. Whenever \nwe have a demand, we draw down the water, but we are only drawing the \ntop third of the barrel. In large part, the barrel is not accessible \nand readily deployable for purposes that we are likely to face in the \nfuture. He believes we can work on that.\n  He knows something we all know--that we have a finite defense budget. \nI am as strong a person as there is in this Senate on expanding \nspending for defense and making our defense capabilities second to \nnone. We are that today. We have the greatest army the world has ever \nknown. The professional soldiers who serve us so well are doing \nincredible things. We are proud of them. People just say that. I say to \nyou that every military in the world knows the American military is \nunsurpassed. They respect us. That is why they want to train with us. \nThey want to learn our tactics. They want to see what equipment we are \nusing. It is something in which we should take pride. He is working \nwith that and how to better utilize our resources.\n  There was an article recently which a radio reporter in Alabama asked \nme about. People are transferring from the Air Force to the Army. I \nsaid I didn't know that. I did some checking on it.\n  The Air Force has concluded they are 17,000 above their needs, that \nthese 17,000 soldiers are excess for the mission they have. So they are \ngiving an opportunity to change their MOS, or transfer to the Army, \nwhich needs more.\n  The Navy has discovered it has 7,000 excess.\n  I chaired an Armed Services Committee, the Sea Powers Subcommittee, \nand all the new ships that we are building today are using half--maybe \nless than half--the number of sailors to operate them as we used to use \nbecause of technology, better equipment, and science. We can operate a \ncombat warship with half the people he used to have.\n  So the Navy is downsizing. They do not want to spend any more money \nthan they have to for personnel who aren't critical for their mission \nbecause they have technological advances they would like, and new ships \nthey need to bring on. The Air Force is thinking the same way.\n\n  The Army, of course, is more personnel driven. Although it is quite \ntechnologically advanced today, all of our soldiers have to be highly \ntrained to be able to utilize the technology they have.\n  We are already at an increased end strength posture for the Army. The \nnumbers I have are around 19,000 above the authorized end strength, but \nthat is flexible.\n  General Schoomaker says he is not asking for legislation that \nmandates a permanent increase in his end strength. He stated in \ncommittee, in answers to questions as part of his formal testimony, he \nwould prefer not to be mandated to have this end strength increase, but \nbecause we are in combat today he has done it and can maintain it. He \nwould like to be able to utilize funding from the supplemental to \nmaintain that strength. He has said he would prefer we allow him to \ncontinue to work on his restructuring and see if we cannot create more \ncombat brigades that are ready to be deployed, fully equipped, and \nhighly trained.\n  Frankly, in years past, we have had more soldiers than we have had \nequipment and training. The Europeans are being criticized by the \nUnited States, and in their own self-evaluations, for bringing on large \nnumbers of draftees and others who stay just for a short period of \ntime. They are not highly trained and not highly equipped and are \nspending a lot of money, but the soldiers are not deployable to serious \ncombat situations. Their ability to deploy and actively participate in \ncombat is far less than it should be.\n  If we think about the rain barrel analogy of General Schoomaker, we \nthink about the ability to move personnel numbers from the other \nservices, which can be an important part of our restructuring and \nimprovement in our defense forces, we may find that we can make more \nprogress than we think. That is certainly my goal.\n  Our Guard and Reserve are performing exceedingly well. I visited them \nin Iraq. I know some military police and the Guard unit have been \ncriticized for unacceptable behavior in the Abu Ghraib prison. I \nvisited an Alabama National Guard MP unit in Baghdad. Every day our \nsoldiers were going to a local MP unit. They were working with the \nlocal Iraqis. They told me they bonded with them. They walked out on \npatrol with them. They taught them how to investigate crimes. They \ntaught them all they knew about law enforcement. Forty percent of those \nguardsmen--many of them 40 years of age--were State troopers and police \nofficers in Alabama. They are well trained in how to handle people, how \nto deal with crowds, how to maintain order, how to handle traffic \ntickets, and investigate crimes.\n  Our Guard and Reserve are important. They can absolutely supplement \nour Active-Duty forces, and should. We should not create a system or \nexpect we have to do all our work with only Active-Duty soldiers. They \ncertainly can do that. I don't think anyone is suggesting to the \ncontrary.\n  So we have one national defense system. We have one Army, Guard, and \nReserve today. We need to continue to transform and restructure that \nentity so we have a structure that is sufficient to meet the demands. \nBut we also are lean and well paid and well trained. It does no good to \nadd a bunch of soldiers to the military if we are not going to add \ntraining capability, if we are not going to add equipment, if they are \nnot trained on the best helicopters, if they are not trained with the \nbest missiles, or trained with the best computer systems and do not \nknow how to access our global hawk and other satellite systems that \nprovide intelligence. If we do not do that, we are not as successful as \nwe should be.\n\n  At a NATO conference not long ago, a year or so ago after the Iraq \nwar, a French rapporteur reported on it. He said the conclusion that \none would draw from the war in Iraq is that a smaller, technologically \nadvanced, well-trained military can defeat a much larger military not \nwell-trained and not technologically advanced.\n  As we work to make sure we do everything possible for our Army, \neverything possible for our Guard and Reserve, we must make sure they \nhave the best pay possible, make sure they have the best benefits \npossible. I will offer an amendment in a few minutes on that. We must \nmake sure they are trained with the best equipment possible, so when \nthey are on the battlefield, they have the ability to inflict the \ngreatest military force on the enemy and be as protected as is \npossible.\n  That is where we are. Hopefully, on this amendment, we have reached \nan accord we can all live with. Many people want to do something for \nour Army because they are so proud of them and they know how tough the \nduty is in Iraq. They have seen their neighbors go off in the Guard and \nReserve to serve in Iraq or Afghanistan. They want to do something for \nthem. It does sound like maybe one of the best things we could do is \nincrease the numbers. I am not sure we ought to rush too fast. We need \nto be thoughtful and cautious as we go that way. We need to listen to \nGeneral Schoomaker. He has not asked for permanent increases in end \nstrength, although he is up now pushing 20,000, as I understand it, \nabove the authorized end strength.\n  If we do all that is necessary to bring efficiency to bear and we \nreward our soldiers for their terrific performance, we will have met \nour challenge.\n  I see Senator Reed, a West Point graduate. He understands the \nmilitary. It is a pleasure to serve with him on the Armed Services \nCommittee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n[[Page S6950]]\n\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Senator from Alabama for his kind words also.\n  We are all in agreement that there is tremendous stress on our Army. \nLet me suggest this chart shows the deployments in Operations Iraqi \nFreedom and Enduring Freedom projected not just over the next several \nmonths but actually into 2007. The dark green demonstrates the actual \nplanned deployment today, the projection of February 2004. On July 19, \n2003, last year, these are the force projected, brigades equivalents.\n  It was projected for July of 2004 we would be roughly at about 8 \nbrigade equivalents. Today in Iraq and Afghanistan there are 18 \nbrigades, more than twice as many soldiers, or about 130,000-plus \nsoldiers in these two operations.\n  This is not just a spike. This is, as you can see on the chart, a \nplateau. We are expected, under the projections today, to have 17 \nbrigades all the way out to the end of 2005, the beginning of January \nof 2006. They come down a little bit if things stabilize a bit in March \nof 2006, to around 13 or 14 brigades.\n  This is a long way out to project. So far, if we look at the \nprojections, we have ended up with more troops needed than what we \nthought we could entertain.\n  My point is that this is not a temporary spike in requirements for \nsoldiers in the U.S. Army. This stretches out to 2007, 3 years from \nnow. It is entirely appropriate we put this number into the Defense \nbill, that we do not simply give some emergency powers to the Secretary \nof Defense.\n  The challenge we have going forward--we have met the challenge this \nyear by tapping into that emergency fund, but the challenge going \nforward is giving the Army the resources in succeeding budgets in their \nown bottom line so they can continue to field these forces. That is \nwhat we are projecting today. It is not as if in 6 months we will be \nfine, Iraq will be resolved, Afghanistan will be resolved, we will be \nback to a low level of participation.\n  Our planners' best thoughts today are for 17 brigades for a long \ntime. So that is what is at the heart of the amendment I have proposed, \nalong with Senator McCain, Senator Hagel, Senator Corzine, Senator \nAkaka, and Senator Biden. I believe we are taking a very important step \nby putting the end strength number in our authorization bill, not as an \nemergency but as a reality, as a near- and medium-term reality. That is \nwhat this chart says. Three years from now we are going to have to \nstill find troops to put in about 14 or 15 brigades in these 2 \noperations.\n  But the issue that is still outstanding--not this year because we \nhave bridged it with the emergency funding--is, how do we build up the \nresources within the Army budget to carry these soldiers forward 2 and \n3 years hence? We will be working on that, obviously, over the next few \nweeks into conference and beyond.\n  I know there are other colleagues--Senator McCain, Senator Hagel, and \nothers--who might want to talk. We have made arrangements prior to the \nvote for 10 minutes, which I would gladly offer to them for their \ncomments.\n  Mr. President, may I inquire how much time I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes 38 seconds.\n  Mr. REED. Thank you, Mr. President. I reserve the remainder of my \ntime and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, how much time remains on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Three minutes.\n  Mr. President, I would just share for our colleagues some other \nthings that are happening. There is a serious effort to restructure our \nforces that also includes looking at our troop strength deployed abroad \nin a number of different areas. I think we have 37,000 soldiers in \nSouth Korea. I believe that number is larger than it needs to be. The \nmilitary is looking at what they can do to reorganize those forces \nthere and bring some of them home.\n  I believe, having visited 12 military installations in Europe just \nwithin the last 2 months, we can bring home substantial numbers of our \ntroops from there. In fact, I think it would be a mistake if we do not \nbring home two divisions. Probably 40,000 Army soldiers and their \ndependents could be brought home from Europe. It is not necessary to \nmaintain that kind of strength abroad.\n  So there are a lot of things we can do to make life easier for our \nsoldiers. General Schoomaker would like to see a soldier be able to go \nto a military base with his family and stay there 7 years, and be \npromoted and stay with a unit and improve his technical skills and his \nunit cohesion before being moved again. Those are goals we need to seek \nso we will be even better in capability, and it will also be good for \nthe soldiers and their families.\n  I reserve the remainder of the time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Reed \namendment. Yesterday, in USA Today: ``Army division sees its war tour \nextended and its casualties rise,'' a very interesting front-page story \nin USA Today, entitled: ``13 months on the ground in Iraq.'' It says: \n``After more than a year of combat, soldiers of the 1st Armored \nDivision wonder when they'll go home.''\n  There are some interesting comments in this article from individuals:\n\n       ``The option left to the nation, the Army, was to keep 1st \n     Armored here or pretty much concede defeat,'' says Lt. Col. \n     T.C. Williams, the battalion commander. Soldiers were \n     disappointed, he says, but they also knew that after a year \n     in Iraq, they were prepared for anything. ``Nobody does this \n     better than we do,'' he says.\n\n  I am sure he is correct.\n  There are other quotes:\n\n       ``We still have a mission we have to accomplish, for the \n     good of the Iraqi people and the future,'' says Staff Sgt. \n     Brad Watson. . . .\n       But these soldiers don't hide their concern that their \n     extension has been violent, hard on their families, and left \n     them wondering how things could have been.\n       ``Gosh, we could have got out of here in 12 months with \n     little or no casualties, and all of a sudden 17 people in \n     your platoon become a casualty?'' Watson says, ``It's \n     something I never dreamed could happen.''\n\n  The point of the story is there are some very brave young Americans \nwho have had to remain in Iraq. There are also stories about the so-\ncalled stop-loss rule, which has been imposed, which prohibits people \nfrom leaving the military at the time when they are supposed to, which \nI think some could argue is some form of conscription, of a draft.\n  What we are doing is we are stopping men and women in the Army and in \nthe Marine Corps from leaving the service at the time of the expiration \nof their contract. So we are involuntarily keeping people in the \nmilitary. And instead of the draft applying to all Americans--\nconscription--we are basically penalizing those people who volunteered \nto serve, which, in my view, is the worst of all worlds.\n  The reason why we are in trouble in Iraq and in as much trouble as we \nare in today and having the difficulties we are having today is because \nafter the conclusion of the combat phase of the war we had too few \nboots on the ground in Iraq. Anyone outside of the Pentagon, with rare \nexception--any retired general will tell you that we did not have \nenough people on the ground to pacify the situation, stop the looting, \nstop the resurrection of the Baathists, stop the beginning of an \ninsurgency. We had a window of opportunity to do so. We did not have \nenough people on the ground. And now we are paying a very heavy price \nfor that incredible mistake on the part of the civilian leadership in \nthe Pentagon.\n  And why were they so reluctant to send additional troops? The dirty \nlittle secret is, they did not have them. Do you think we are taking \ntroops out of Korea to deploy to Iraq because the situation has gotten \nbetter in Korea? The last time I checked, the North Koreans posed an \neven greater threat and are acting in a more intransigent fashion than \never before. But we are having to take thousands of people out of \ndeployment in Korea and move them to Iraq.\n\n  Meanwhile, we see people who are guardsmen and reservists who are \ngoing back and back and back. Now, I have had the opportunity of \nmeeting and talking to many. In fact, 40 percent or 55,000 of the \nsoldiers currently serving in Iraq and Afghanistan are guardsmen and \nreservists. They are wonderful. They are magnificent people. But they \ndid not join the Guard\n\n[[Page S6951]]\n\nand Reserves to be deployed every other year to Afghanistan or Iraq.\n  When we look at the training of the soldiers who were assigned to the \nprison in Abu Ghraib, they were people who were involuntarily extended \nand had no real training in carrying out the functions they were \nsupposed to at that prison--again, a very heavy price, a very heavy \nprice.\n  Mistakes happen in conflicts. That is why we try to avoid them. But a \nfundamental error that is still not corrected--still not corrected--is \nthe shortage of the military on the ground with the kinds of \nspecialties and skills that are so badly needed: special forces, \nmilitary police, linguists, civil affairs, and others who simply are \nnot there today. And we see in some cases a chaotic situation in some \nparts around Baghdad and in the Sunni Triangle.\n  So I regret that we are here on the floor of the Senate having to \nforce an increase in the size of the Army on the Department of Defense. \nAs I say, literally every retired military officer I have talked to has \nsaid--and every military expert says--you do not have a large enough \nArmy. I recently talked to one retired general who said: I have a fear \nof not enough people in Iraq and that we are not able to do the job.\n  But my far greater fear and nightmare is that we have something in \nKorea, something between China and Taiwan, something in our own \nhemisphere like significant unrest in Venezuela or a significant \ncommitment we might have to make on the continent of Africa. We don't \nhave the people to do it.\n  I hope we will support the Reed amendment. I hope the Pentagon and \nthe civilian leadership there will come to their senses and recognize \nthat there are not enough men and women in the military today. They are \nmagnificent, but there are not enough of them. They are stretched too \nthin. They are badly overworked, and we have paid a very heavy price \nfor these failings from the beginning of the Iraqi conflict.\n  I still believe we can win and must win, but long ago we should have \nrepaired this deficiency in the size of the Army and the Marine Corps.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). All time has expired.\n  Mr. WARNER. Have we pretty well resolved this? The Senator from \nArizona and the Senator from Alabama, have we taken adequate time over \nhere for our colleagues who have been in strong support? I think we \nhave reached a conclusion on this matter. We will not need that extra \ntranche of time.\n  Mr. REED. If the Senator will yield, I believe we were waiting for \nSenator Hagel, another cosponsor.\n  Mr. WARNER. I think we should allow some time for Senator Hagel. We \nwill make that time available.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 10 minutes available prior to the \nvote.\n  Mr. WARNER. Then let's hope Mr. Hagel can make it.\n  Mr. REID. Under the order, the Sessions amendment is now in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BIDEN. May I have 10 seconds on the Reed amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I can't think of a more important amendment \nwe are going to vote on than the Reed amendment. I am a principal \ncosponsor. I believe it is overdue. I hope to the Lord we go ahead and \ndo the right thing here and support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order the Senator from \nAlabama is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, after the amendment is reported, I wonder if \nI could speak first. I am going to use 15 minutes on another subject. \nIt will take a few minutes. I would like to go do something else.\n  Mr. WARNER. Absolutely, Mr. President.\n  Mr. REID. Is that OK with Senator Sessions?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. It is all right with me. I know Senator Chambliss \nwanted to speak also.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I think this might be an appropriate time \nthat I would like to urge adoption of my amendment in the second degree \nto the Reed amendment.\n  Mr. REID. I think that is totally appropriate.\n  Mr. WARNER. Let's have that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the second-\ndegree amendment No. 3450, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 3450) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to reconsider the vote and to lay that motion on \nthe table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. This amendment has the strong support of the Senator from \nVirginia.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3371\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, does the Senator from Nevada want 15 \nminutes right now?\n  Mr. REID. I am going to use 15 minutes. It has nothing to do with \nyour amendment. We have 15 minutes, but we weren't going to oppose your \namendment anyway. I would like to take my few minutes now.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. All right. So you want the full 15 minutes?\n  Mr. REID. I don't know how much time I will use. I don't think I will \nuse near that amount.\n  Mr. WARNER. If the Senator will yield, I am advised by the \nparliamentarians that we may need to put in on the Reed amendment now \nthat there are no further amendments, second degree or otherwise, in \norder on that amendment. The desk asked me to check that.\n  Mr. REID. That was part of the original order. Would the Chair ask \nthat the Sessions amendment be called up now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Sessions] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3371.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide for increased support of survivors of deceased \n                   members of the uniformed services)\n\n       On page 130, between lines 9 and 10, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 642. DEATH BENEFITS ENHANCEMENT.\n\n       (a) Final Actions on Fiscal Year 2004 Death Benefits \n     Study.--(1) Congress finds that the study of the Federal \n     death benefits for survivors of deceased members of the Armed \n     Forces under section 647 of the National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004 has given Congress \n     sufficient insight to initiate action to provide for the \n     enhancement of the current set of death benefits that are \n     provided under law for the survivors.\n       (2) The Secretary of Defense shall expedite the completion \n     and submission of the final report, which was due on March 1, \n     2004, under section 647 of the National Defense Authorization \n     Act for Fiscal Year 2004.\n       (3) It is the sense of Congress that the President should \n     promptly submit to Congress any recommendation for \n     legislation, together with a request for appropriations, that \n     the President determines necessary to implement the death \n     benefits enhancements that are recommended in the final \n     report under section 647 of the National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004.\n       (b) Fiscal Year 2005 Actions.--At the same time that the \n     President submits to Congress the budget for fiscal year 2006 \n     under section 1105(a) of title 31, United States Code, the \n     President, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, \n     shall submit to Congress a draft of legislation to provide \n     enhanced death benefits for survivors of deceased members of \n     the uniformed services. The draft legislation shall include \n     provisions for the following:\n       (1) Revision of the Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance \n     program to provide for--\n       (A) an increase of the maximum benefit provided under \n     Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance to $350,000, together \n     with an increase, each fiscal year, by the same overall \n     average percentage increase that takes effect during such \n     fiscal year in the rates of basic pay under section 204 of \n     title 37, United States Code; and\n       (B) a minimum benefit of $100,000 at no cost to the insured \n     members of the uniformed services who elect the maximum \n     coverage, together with an increase in such minimum benefit \n     each fiscal year by the same percentage increase as is \n     described in subparagraph (A).\n       (2) An increase, each fiscal year, of the amount of the \n     death gratuity provided under section 1478 of title 10, \n     United States Code, by the same overall average percentage \n     increase that takes effect during such fiscal year in the \n     rates of basic pay under section 204 of title 37, United \n     States Code.\n\n[[Page S6952]]\n\n       (3) An additional set of death benefits for each member of \n     the uniformed services who dies in the line of duty while on \n     active duty that includes, at a minimum, an additional death \n     gratuity in the amount that--\n       (A) in the case of a member not described in subparagraph \n     (B), is equal to the sum of--\n       (i) the total amount of the basic pay to which the deceased \n     member would have been entitled under section 204 of title \n     37, United States Code, if the member had not died and had \n     continued to serve on active duty for an additional year; and\n       (ii) the total amount of all allowances and special pays \n     that the member would have been entitled to receive under \n     title 37, United States Code, over the one-year period \n     beginning on the member's date of death if the member had not \n     died and had continued to serve on active duty for an \n     additional year with the unit to which the member was \n     assigned or detailed on such date; and\n       (B) in the case of a member who dies as a result of an \n     injury caused by or incurred while exposed to hostile action \n     (including any hostile fire or explosion and any hostile \n     action from a terrorist source), is equal to twice the amount \n     calculated under subparagraph (A).\n       (4) Any other new death benefits or enhancement of existing \n     death benefits that the President recommends.\n       (5) Retroactive applicability of the benefits referred to \n     in paragraphs (1) through (4) so as to provide the benefits--\n       (A) for members of the uniformed services who die in line \n     of duty on or after October 7, 2001, of a cause incurred or \n     aggravated while deployed in support of Operation Enduring \n     Freedom; and\n       (B) for members of the uniformed services who die in line \n     of duty on or after March 19, 2003, of a cause incurred or \n     aggravated while deployed in support of Operation Iraqi \n     Freedom.\n       (c) Fiscal Year 2006 Budget Submission.--The budget for \n     fiscal year 2006 that is submitted to Congress under section \n     1105(a) of title 31, United States Code, shall include the \n     following:\n       (1) The amounts that would be necessary for funding the \n     benefits covered by the draft legislation required to be \n     submitted under subsection (b).\n       (2) The amounts that would be necessary for funding the \n     organizational and administrative enhancements, including \n     increased personnel, that are necessary to ensure efficient \n     and effective administration and timely payment of the \n     benefits provided for in the draft legislation.\n       (d) Early Submission of Proposal for Additional Death \n     Benefits.--Congress urges the President to submit the draft \n     of legislation for the additional set of death benefits under \n     paragraph (3) of subsection (b) before the time for \n     submission required under that subsection and as soon as is \n     practicable after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\n\n                             Enron Deja Vu\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate the courtesy of my two friends. \nI have been here all day, and I have to leave the floor for a few \nminutes.\n  ``You have seen that before.'' That is what deja vu means, so I am \ntold. We have seen it before. We in Nevada have the second highest gas \nprices in the whole country. They have soared to record levels. The oil \ncompanies say these price increases are a matter of supply and demand. \nI have heard that before. I remember now that is the same excuse we \nheard 4 years ago during the western electricity crisis when Nevada \nconsumers were being ripped off by one of the most ravenous corporate \nswindlers in history--Enron.\n  While Enron reaped windfall profits, it told consumers the record \nhigh prices were the result of supply and demand. But it turned out \nEnron was rigging the market to rob consumers. Over the last few weeks, \nbit by bit, audiotape recordings of Enron traders have come to light in \nvarious ways, chiefly through CBS News.\n  I am reminded of Senator Jesse Helms. I was a new Senator, and Jesse \nHelms sat back here. He stood and said: I don't want to be here. It was \nthe pornography issue. He said: I hate to talk about this kind of \nstuff, but I have to. And the stuff he proceeded to talk about was \npretty gross, to be honest with you.\n  Well, I hate to point to this chart, this audiotape today that CBS \nplayed last night on the news, but I am going to because it fully \noutlines what Enron did to the people of the State of Nevada and people \nin other parts of the Western United States.\n  Here is a direct quote from one of the Enron traders, one of the \npeople who caused these prices to go up. He worked for Enron:\n\n       I want to see what pain and heartache this is going to \n     cause Nevada Power Company.\n\n  This Enron trader goes on to say:\n\n       I want to . . .\n\n  Everyone can see as well as I can the next word. I am not going to \nrepeat it. It starts with ``f'' and ends with a ``k.''\n\n       I want to . . . with Nevada for a while.\n\n  Second trader says:\n\n       What do you mean?\n\n  And the first trader says:\n\n       I just, I'm still in the mood to screw with people, OK?\n\n  Enron traders had all kinds of ways to cheat customers. They shipped \npower from California to Oregon, masked the original source of the \npower, and then sold it back to California at inflated rates. This \nlittle scheme, this one right here, made Enron a profit of $222,678 in \n3 hours. Enron traders also boast on the tapes that Enron CEO Ken Lay \nwill wield a lot of influence in the Bush administration. They were \nright about that.\n  A few weeks ago the Washington Post reported on the influence of the \npeople who raised large amounts of money for the President's campaign. \nOne of those big fundraisers was Ken Lay--the President gave him a \nnickname of Kenny Boy--who served on the administration's Energy \nDepartment transition team, if you can believe that, and recommended \ntwo of the members of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, known \nas FERC.\n  After Enron gouged western consumers, utilities in Nevada and other \nStates turned to FERC for help. Remember, two of them came from Kenny \nBoy. But FERC ruled in favor of Enron and against providing relief to \nNevada utilities and taxpayers.\n  Adding injury to insult, last fall the bankruptcy court ruled that \nNevada taxpayers owe Enron an additional $330 million for power Enron \nnever even delivered. Our utilities have asked FERC to hear the case. \nSenator Ensign and I have submitted a brief in support of their \ncomplaint. Now I am also joining with western Senators and requesting \nthat FERC vacate the exorbitant contracts that were signed during the \nmanipulated energy crisis.\n  The parallel between the western electricity crisis and today's \ngasoline market is troubling, to say the least. The big oil companies \nare making record profits of up to 75 cents a gallon for a fill-up of a \ncar in Nevada. For 10 gallons, that is a profit of $7.50. The big oil \ncompanies are making these record profits, which come out of the \npockets of working families in Nevada.\n  I am afraid I am not the only one feeling, as we stated earlier, that \nI have seen this before, deja vu. Nevada consumers know they are \ngetting gouged again and it is not a good feeling.\n  I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator from Georgia and the Senator \nfrom Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I yield time to the Senator from \nGeorgia, who chairs the Subcommittee on Personnel of the Armed Services \nCommittee, on which the Presiding Officer also serves. I value his \njudgment on this issue and appreciate his support for this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from our \nneighboring State of Alabama for his terrific interest in our brave men \nand women who serve in every branch of our military. At this time, when \nwe have so many men and women in harm's way, it is very appropriate \nthat leadership come from this body. Senator Sessions has provided the \nkind of leadership that our men and women have come to expect.\n  Today, I rise in support of the amendment Senator Sessions has \nproposed. This amendment will provide a much needed revision of the \nDepartment of Defense's current policies related to providing benefits \nto the families of service members who make the ultimate sacrifice for \ntheir country.\n  The DOD's current death benefit policies have been in place, without \nany substantial revision, for some time now. These benefits have not \nkept pace with the times and, in particular, the needs of military \nfamilies in the event the primary provider dies in the line of duty.\n  Obviously, these events are extremely difficult for any family. They \nare painful times for military families. I agree that we need to expand \nthe benefits these families receive under those circumstances.\n  Specifically, this amendment directs the administration to expedite \nthe\n\n[[Page S6953]]\n\nfinal death benefits study that is currently working its way through \nthe DOD. This study was due to Congress on March 1 of this year but has \nstill not been delivered.\n  The amendment also indexes increases in the current death gratuity \nbenefit of $12,000 to the same rate as the basic pay increase, which is \n3.5 percent, beginning in fiscal year 2005. Beginning in fiscal year \n2006, the amendment increases the maximum coverage under the \nServiceman's Group Life Insurance program by $100,000, from $250,000 to \n$350,000, and indexing future indexes in the SGLI at the same rate as \nthe basic pay increase; and it provides that the Government shall pay \nthe premium on the first $100,000 of this life insurance.\n  The amendment creates two new benefits, which I believe are much \ndeserved. First, it allows for the payment of one year's salary and \nbenefits to soldiers who die while on active duty, 2 year's pay in \nsalary and benefits to soldiers killed in action or in a hostile or \nterrorist event.\n  The amendment, as drafted, does not violate any budget points of \norder and allows the Department of Defense necessary time to \nincorporate the costs and implementation of this program in the fiscal \nyear 2006 budget.\n  We have just had a thorough discussion by Senator Reed and Senator \nSessions regarding the increase of troop strength. I am so respectful \nto folks such as Senator Reed, Senator McCain, as well as Senator \nSessions on that particular issue. I agree with them on that issue. We \ndo need to increase the size of the force structure. We need to be able \nto continue to do that under the current all-volunteer system that we \nhave. If we are going to have that all-volunteer system compete with \nforces in the outside world, we are going to have to continue to look \nat the benefits we provide to our brave men and women. This amendment \ndoes that.\n  It adds an additional benefit to our men and women that they don't \nhave today, and it certainly will be of help to our recruiters from the \nstandpoint of continuing to allow them to recruit our finest men and \nwomen in America into the military.\n  Secondly, we will be able to retain the men and women that we invest \nso much money in, from the standpoint of making sure they have the \nequipment and training necessary to continue to defend freedom and \ndemocracy around the world.\n  So I commend very highly my friend from Alabama, and I thank him for \nhis great leadership. I am pleased to join in this amendment. I ask my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia and \nalso my cosponsors, Senators Joe Lieberman and Jim Inhofe.\n  When we ask American soldiers to leave our shores to go abroad in a \ncombat environment to execute the policies of the people of the United \nStates of America, we need them to know, and Americans want them to \nknow, that if their life is lost in that effort, their families are \ngoing to be well taken care of. We have a lot of private groups that \nwork at this, but it is most important that the Federal Government have \nin place policies that would allow their loved ones to be fully and \nadequately compensated.\n  Last year we increased the basic death gratuity from $6,000 to \n$12,000. That was an improvement. It doubled. It is important that we \nhave indexed that to inflation, and it is still not nearly enough for a \nfamily today. So we looked at the Serviceman's Group Life Insurance \npolicy, which is somewhat subsidized by the Government, but it is paid \nfor by the soldiers. They take out up to $250,000 in life insurance. \nMany young soldiers don't like that $16 a month or so that comes out of \ntheir paycheck. They sometimes don't choose to take it out. We want to \nencourage more people to take on that benefit--take out the maximum \nlife insurance so the military will now, under this amendment, if \napproved, have an additional $100,000 in life insurance fully paid for \nby the Government, if the soldier takes out his life insurance part. I \nthink that will encourage more people to sign up and provide a much \nlarger benefit package for them. Those are some of the issues that we \nwere concerned about.\n  Years ago, soldiers got a year's salary if they lost their life. That \nwas changed as part of the life insurance package a number of years \nago. I think the Senate believed that we needed to guarantee a person's \nsalary for the year they worked if they are hurt during an Active-Duty \naccident--not in combat. For 1 year, they will get their salary and \nbenefits paid. Those killed in combat, because they were serving their \ncountry in a hostile environment, would have 2 years of salary paid for \nthem.\n  Those are the kinds of things that can make a real difference in the \nlife of a family. Families will not need to worry about where their \nnext meal is going to come from if they have enough money to take on \nnew housing and move, and maybe for expenses in putting children in \nschool, and all those things that go with the tragic loss of a loved \none. We need to make sure they are fully taken care of in that regard, \nand this amendment would do that.\n  I cannot say again how strongly I believe we should do the right \nthing by those soldiers who give their lives for their country. In my \nState of Alabama, I have talked to over 20 families who have lost a \nloved one since the war on terrorism began. I have talked to husbands, \nwives, fathers, and mothers. We have talked to them about the loved \nones they have lost--their children. I have been to funerals. Those are \nthings that are very meaningful to anybody who has had that experience.\n  I feel a special responsibility, as I think every Senator does, to \nthose soldiers who went because we voted to send them there; we asked \nthem to go for us.\n  I think this is a good first step toward achieving the compensation \nthat families need. There are other compensation benefits they receive, \nsuch as benefits for children, income for spouses that are in law, but \nthis is a lump sum that can help a family adjust and establish a life \nunder new and different circumstances and help them get through the \ntragic period of pain and loss they inevitably will have to go through.\n  We asked that the Defense Department do a study for us on their ideas \nand evaluate the current system for fairness and workability. They did \nnot complete that report. We have seen a draft of that report. It was \nsupposed to have come in March. It has not officially been completed.\n  I will say this: I think it is quite likely that after we evaluate \nthat report, we may want to come back again next year to do some other \nthings to bring more fairness and more support to the families who lost \na loved one in the service of their country. There is no higher service \nthat one can render than to give their life for their country.\n  We have lost a good number of soldiers. We have lost them in the \npast, and we are losing them in this war on terrorism. I feel strongly \nthat our obligation includes making sure those families left behind are \nwell taken care of.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? If no one yields time, time \nwill be charged equally to both sides.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, there is one point I want to make clear. \nThe act provides for retroactivity of the salary benefits. With regard \nto soldiers who lost their life in combat since the beginning of the \nAfghan war or in terrorist acts, their families will receive 2-year's \nsalary and benefits retroactive to the loss, as well as being a part of \nfuture benefits for those soldiers who lose their lives in the future.\n  To reiterate, I ask my colleagues in the Senate to consider that we \nhave before us an opportunity to correct what has been for many a \nlongstanding inequity for our military, the paucity of our death \nbenefits programs for our soldiers killed in combat.\n  We began to make a difference when in the fiscal year 2004 Defense \nAuthorization Act, this Senate offered and the Congress passed the \nprovision to improve the death gratuity from $6,000 to $12,000. This \nwas an important improvement, but more can be and needs to be done. To \nthat end, I offer this amendment that begins the process of enhancing \nour death benefits program\n\n[[Page S6954]]\n\nto bring it more in line with the significance I believe we all attach \nto the sacrifices made by our military and their families.\n  This amendment asks the President and the Secretary of Defense, \nworking with the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, to submit enhanced \ndeath benefits for our military and their families as part of the \nfiscal year 2006 budget request. We expect the next budget in just 8 \nmonths. This will give the Department time to deliver the final report \non the death benefits from the study we directed in the fiscal year \n2004 Authorization Act.\n  There are specific areas where the death benefits provisions are in \nneed of improvement. The Veterans Administration reached similar \nconclusions in a 2001 study, and I am confident that the compensation \nteams working on these issues in the Defense Department are equally \nconvinced that we need changes.\n  Among the changes is an increase to the Servicemen's Group Life \nInsurance maximum benefit to $350,000. The Department of Defense would \nalso provide a minimum floor of Servicemen's Group Life Insurance of \n$100,000 for every servicemember at no cost provided that members \nselected the maximum amount of $350,000.\n  I felt great anguish that some of our troops were not selecting the \ninsurance due to the cost or perhaps a lack of understanding about the \nrisks of serving in our military and or the benefits of this program. \nIt may seem hard to believe, but saving $16.25 per month, the current \nfee to receive the current maximum $250,000 benefit, may appear to be \nan important financial decision for some, especially our more junior \ntroops. This change makes the insurance a more attractive option.\n  The amendment will direct in fiscal year 2005 indexing the current \ndeath gratuity to the same rate as the basic pay increase. It further \nasks the Defense Department, beginning in fiscal year 2006, to index \nServicemen's Group Life Insurance to the same percentages to which \nbasic pay increases. This is important to ensuring that the benefit \ndoes not erode over time like the death gratuity benefit clearly did.\n  Further, this amendment makes possible for the first time a benefit \nto ease the transition as well as to clearly recognize the sacrifice of \nmilitary members killed due to hostile or terrorist actions. For the \nfamily left behind, there is no greater tragedy than loved ones lost in \ncombat.\n  It is clear that service aboard our ships, in our aircraft and around \nour mechanized equipment is a hazardous vocation. Our troops work with \nlive ammunition and in environments so very different and inherently \ndangerous when compared to many other occupations. When troops are lost \nin training accidents or in service-connected events, we should \nrecognize that risk and provide benefits accordingly. The amendment \nwould authorize one full year of salary and benefits to those lost in \nthe service of their country to recognize the hazardous nature of the \nwork performed by the military.\n  Similar in intent to procedures in other militaries, such as Canada \nand the UK, and in many U.S. States and cities, this amendment provides \nan increased benefit for members killed in hostile acts. I have \nrecommended 2 years salary and allowances for those lost in hostile \nsituations. The Defense Department, by a DoD instruction, already makes \na determination if a casualty resulted from hostile actions for every \nmember of the military who is lost on active duty.\n  By comparison, the surviving dependents of a police officer or \nfirefighter killed in the line of duty receive $267,494 under the \nPublic Safety Officers Benefits Act. This benefit has been indexed to \ncorrect for inflation and sends a clear signal to our Nation about the \nvalue of these leaders of our citizenry. The military is no less valued \nand this benefit, along with the other provisions in existence and the \nenhancements in this amendment reflect our Nation's appreciation.\n  These provisions are similar in intent to the Public Safety Officers \nBenefits Act of 1976 which acknowledges the risks faced by our police \nofficers and firemen. This amendment acknowledges the risks of military \nservice and helps those left behind with transition assistance.\n  Anyone who witnessed the bravery of our police and fire personnel on \n9/11 and who saw the memorable pictures from that day was profoundly \nstruck by how wonderful these heroes were and how willing they were to \ngo into harm's way. Our soldiers are no less brave. I have visited our \nwounded heroes at Walter Reed Hospital recently and, like our police \nand fire personnel, our military is extraordinary for their bravery. \nThis is especially the case for those who pay the ultimate price and \ndie in the service of their country.\n  I would add that in 1908, the 60th Congress saw fit to authorize 6 \nmonths of pay as a death gratuity, and in 1917, the 65th Congress \nrepealed this law in favor of a Government life insurance program. In \nretrospect, I think the 60th Congress had it correct.\n  A key feature of this amendment is that the recognition benefits--the \none year or two year salary compensation--are to be retroactive for \nthose who were lost in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and Operation Enduring \nFreedom. We owe this recognition to those troops who went abroad to \ndefend our freedoms.\n  This amendment also provides an opportunity for the President to \nrecommend any other benefits he deems appropriate. The amendment does \nnot impact the plan for fiscal year 2005, except for beginning to index \nthe $12,000 death gratuity. This will, I believe, give the Defense \nDepartment some time to finalize its approach to these changes. The \nintent of this legislation is to ensure that as part of the fiscal year \n2006 budget request, which is due to us in 8 months, that the budget \nrequest we receive will incorporate these measures. This gives the \nadministration time to expedite the final report, gather the \nappropriate accounts together, and to provide to the Congress the \nlegislative initiatives and supporting regulations to substantially \nimprove our death benefits programs. We owe our brave men and women no \nless.\n  I yield the floor. Mr. President, I believe no one else is seeking to \nspeak on this subject, so I yield back all the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3371.\n  The amendment (No. 3371) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BIDEN.

Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President. Is the Biden \namendment in order at this moment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is.\n  Mr. BIDEN.

Mr. President, I ask that we proceed to amendment No. \n3379.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Biden] for himself, Mrs. \n     Clinton, Mr. Carper, Mr. Corzine, and Mrs. Feinstein, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3379.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide funds for the security and stabilization of Iraq \nby suspending a portion of the reduction in the highest income tax rate \n                       for individual taxpayers)\n\n       At the end of subtitle A of title X, add the following:\n       Sec. __.

Mr. President, with regard to amendment No. 3379, I ask \nunanimous consent that Senators Carper, Clinton, Corzine, and Feinstein \nbe listed as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, my amendment is quite simple and \nstraightforward. It is no different in its intent than the amendment I \noffered when the President some months ago requested $87 billion for \nthe reconstruction of Iraq, as well as the support of American forces.\n  The bottom line is it says we should stop borrowing to cover the cost \nof our mission in Iraq and Afghanistan. If this mission is as important \nas the President says it is--and I believe it is--then we should pay \nfor it. We should not make my kids pay for it. We should not make my \ngrandchildren pay for it. We should pay for it.\n  Before I get into the details of the amendment, because it relates to \nmy finding the money to pay for the $25 billion asked for in this \nauthorization by the President, let me remind people what the state of \nthe Tax Code is now relative to the highest bracket.\n  In the year 2001, the highest bracket of individual taxpayers was \n39.6 percent.\n  With President Bush's tax cut that was passed, that bracket, along \nwith others, was reduced from 39.6 percent to what it will be and what \nit is in 2004, 35 percent. So it has come down from 39.6 percent to 35 \npercent.\n  The way the Bush tax cut proposal works, when it became law--and I \nsee the chairman of the Finance Committee here who, as the old joke \ngoes, has forgotten more about the Tax Code than I am going to know--is \nthat top bracket will stay at 35 percent in 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, \n2009, and 2010. In the taxable year of 2011, under the present status \nof the Tax Code, it will go back to 39.6 percent.\n  I realize there is a move in the House and among many here to ``make \nthe tax cut permanent'' so the 35-percent tax bracket would remain in \n2011, 2012, 2015, 2018, and so on, but right now, unless it is made \npermanent in the taxable year 2011, it will go back to what it was in \n2001, 39.6 percent.\n  One other statistic, to be in this top tax bracket, the people in the \n35-percent tax bracket, which used to be 39.6, have on average a \ntaxable income of a million dollars a year. Now, obviously, there are \npeople in there making a billion dollars a year, but no one is in that \nbracket unless their taxable income is $319,000.\n  That means after all of the deductions are taken, after all of the \nthings one is able under the law to deduct, so one is likely to have an \nincome of closer to $450,000 or $500,000, they end up with a taxable \nincome of $319,000. OK? So it is taxable income.\n  That is after one deducts for medical costs they are able to deduct, \ndeduct for their children, for all the things one is entitled to \ndeduct, and people in that category can deduct for a lot of things that \naverage folks do not get to deduct.\n  So what does my amendment do? How do we have $25 billion so that \nthese bright young pages--and I am not being solicitous; I am not \njoking--sitting down at the base of the podium there, whose average age \nis probably 16 or 17 years old, how do we act responsibly enough to say \nthat they should not be paying for this war, that those of us who voted \nfor it, my generation, those who are paying taxes now, should pay for \nit?\n  What happens with this $25 billion? It is essentially paid for by the \ndeficit. This all goes to the deficit. This is going to be paid for. It \nis going to be added. I predict before the year is over--and I do not \nclaim to be an expert on our budget, but I have been around long enough \nthat I think I am pretty knowledgeable--this year's deficit will end up \nbeing closer to $600 billion than $500 billion. Everybody knows it is \ngoing to be over $500 billion. So why are we going to ask them, why are \nwe going to ask my granddaughters, who range from age 3 to 10, to pay \nfor this war, when we are fully capable of doing it?\n  One might say: OK, Biden, how are you going to pay for this war? Are \nyou going to take money away from education? Are you going to take \nmoney away from things that affect these kids? No.\n  I am going to ask my colleagues shortly to do what I think every \npatriotic American is fully prepared to do. At the United Way they talk \nabout, this guy gave at the office, but what do we give at the office \nin this war? What are any of you people, and what am I, giving at the \noffice?\n  None of us are in Iraq. We are not in the military. We are not \ngetting shot at. We are not away from our families. We are not that \nNational Guardsman or Guardswoman who is taking a pay cut of 30, 40, \nsometimes 50 percent to serve their country right now.\n\n  I mean, this is never a healthy thing for a nation. We are in the \nmidst of a war when the bulk of America is not asked to do anything \nabout it. There are very few people sacrificing for this war. Like our \ngrandparents or our parents, no one has asked us to put tape over our \nheadlights when we drive at night or use ration cards or have to pay \nhigher taxes to support the war. There is no draft.\n  So what happens? Well, there are a lot of patriotic, young women and \nmen--and some not so young, meaning in their thirties and forties--who \nare over in Iraq right now. What are we doing?\n  The idea that if we ask the wealthiest Americans among us to \ncontribute to the war effort, that they are unwilling to do that is \npreposterous.\n  I sometimes get mad at some in my party--not those on the Senate \nfloor but some in my party--and some liberal commentators. What \nfrustrates me sometimes is they assume that only poor, middle-class \npeople are patriotic; that they are the only ones willing to make \nsacrifices for their country. I am here to say that wealthy Americans, \nthe wealthiest among us, the wealthiest 1 percent, are as patriotic as \nthe lowest 1 percent.\n  In the last time out, when I tried to do this--and I will get to the \ndetail in a minute--to pay for the $87 million, I happened to be with a \ngroup at an exclusive country club in Wilmington, DE. We are a wealthy \nlittle State. We have some very wealthy people in our State. All States \ndo, but as a percentage we have some very wealthy people. I happened to \nbe with a group of them for an outing. We got to the time that we had \nthe buffet, and it was outside. A couple started asking me about the \nwar. The next thing I know, as every Senator knows and as every staffer \nhas observed their Senators being engaged, all of a sudden it was like \na roving press conference. It went from 1 press person to 2, to 5 to 10 \nto 15, and all of a sudden there was a group of people standing around. \nBefore I knew it, literally, standing outside on this beautiful \nevening, on this patio of this magnificent club, there were no fewer \nthan 40, mostly men, who are among the wealthiest--not literally the \nwealthiest, but some were probably in the top 20 or so in my State--\nsome of the wealthiest people in my State, and they are asking about \nthe war.\n\n[[Page S6956]]\n\n  I said: Let me ask you all a question--and in fairness I want to \nacknowledge, maybe they were intimidated because no one wanted to be \nthe one to say, no, do not count me in, but I said I am going to go \ndown to the Senate, and I am going to offer an amendment that would \nrequire you people right here on this outside patio to give up 1 year \nof the 10 years of your tax cut to pay for this war. Does anybody here \nthink that is unfair?\n  I give my word, my honor as Biden, not one person raised their hand. \nThen people started to chime in. They said, no, it is fair. They \nstarted talking about what other people are doing.\n  When have we ever gone to war when we simultaneously have suggested, \nas we have gone, to say this is going to be a long, tortuous \nundertaking to fight terror, and at the same time any President in the \npast, some 200-plus years, has said: And by the way, as we go, I am \ngoing to give you the biggest tax cut in the history of the United \nStates of America?\n  Now, again, try to be objective about this. Let's assume--I do not, \nbut let us assume for the sake of argument that we badly needed this \ntax cut in order to spur on the economy. Let me accept that as a given \nfor the sake of this debate.\n  I asked these people: Does anyone here think if the top 1 percent of \nthe people paying taxes in America were to forego 1 year of the tax cut \nthat, in fact, that would slow the economy? The economy would stall? \nSputter? Assuming they were the reason it was growing. I didn't hear \nanybody tell me that. I have not heard any reputable economists tell me \nthat.\n\n  So here I am, back on the floor again, finding it fascinating, \nabsolutely fascinating--and I expect this will be voted on party lines \nagain--why the overwhelming number of my colleagues, for whom most of \nthese wealthy people likely vote, are unwilling to do what the \nwealthiest among us are fully willing to do.\n  This time around what I am suggesting is even less ``painful.'' In \norder to come up with $25 billion to pay for this piece of the war in \nIraq and in Afghanistan, you know the only thing you have to do? You \nhave to say: In the year 2005, the tax cut for the wealthiest 1 percent \nof Americans, who in fact cannot have a taxable income less than \n$319,000, will go back up from 35 percent to 36 percent. The 1-percent \nsolution.\n  I can't fathom any wealthy person in America, even at the low end--\nand, by the way, the average income of this top 1 percent is over $1 \nmillion. I can't fathom a single one of these people not having enough \npatriotic instinct to say: No, no, no, no, I am unwilling. I am \nunwilling to pay, in the year 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010, 1 \npercent more than I would otherwise have to pay.\n  What does that mean? Does it mean 1 percent less investment in their \nportfolio? Does it mean they buy a Lexus instead of a Mercedes? What \ndoes it mean? What does it mean?\n  While we are now saying, as I think the President probably has no \nchoice, to the people who signed up volunteering in the military: No, \nno, you are staying another year because your patriotic responsibility \nis we need you. The President is probably right about that.\n  Or he is saying to what will be approaching 40 percent of the forces \non the ground being shot at or subjected to car bombs in Iraq and \nAfghanistan who are reservists and National Guard: You have to go \ntwice.\n  He is saying to the physician who is in the Guard, whose income may \nhave been $150,000 or $200,000 whose pay as a colonel may be $80,000 \nbut he still has the same mortgage payment, the same tuition payment, \nthe same ``nut'' to pay, as they say: It's your patriotic \nresponsibility.\n  How can we in this country at this moment say we can ask that of \nthose people and we can't say to people whose average income is $1 \nmillion: Do us a favor, pay 1 percent more to pay for this installment \non the war?\n  What have we become? Can you imagine that being said in 1943? No, no, \nno, no, don't ask it of them.\n  Can you imagine that being said if the income tax had been in place \nin 1915 or 1916?\n  Can you imagine that being the case in the Korean war? Can you \nimagine that?\n  What is the second logical argument as to why this is a bad idea? If \nyou all agree with me that these Americans are as patriotic as anyone \nelse and that it could not possibly hurt them in any material way, then \nyou have to say: Here is the deal. This will slow economic recovery. \nThis is bad for the economy.\n  I got a letter from the Chamber of Commerce saying this is going to \nhurt small business.\n  My friend from Iowa is here, the chairman of the committee. As the \nold thing goes--in this case, it is true--he is my friend.\n\n  The Chamber of Commerce says it is going to hurt small business. What \nthey mean by that is there are some small businesses that pay their \ntaxes as if they were individual taxpayers. Do you know how many of \nthem pay at the top 1 percent? Of all the small businesses in America? \nFor every 100 small businesspersons in America who claim and pay as \nindividuals, 2 percent--t-w-o percent--of them are in this category \nwhere they would be affected.\n  I am sure the Senator will be able to tell me--I suspect he is here \nto engage in debate--how taking 1 percent of the American individual \ntaxpayers and asking them to pay 1 percent more in the next 5 years, \nand taking 2 percent of the small businesspersons in America and asking \nthem to pay 1 percent more for the next 5 years, when each of them fall \nin a category where they have a taxable income of at least $319,000 a \nyear--how this is going to slow the economy.\n  I have said this to the President and I have said it publicly--\nSenator McCain was on the floor earlier--what I am about to say. \nSenator McCain was on the floor earlier talking about the end strength \namendment of Senator Reed. He said we need this. He said mistakes \nhappen in war. That is why--and he went on from there.\n  I believe, and I am confident, this President has made some very \nserious mistakes in the conduct of this war. I am also confident were I \nPresident I would have made mistakes. I am confident, had it been \nPresident Gore, he would have made mistakes. I am confident that \nSenator Kerry will make some mistakes if he is President. I don't think \nthis President will be judged harshly for the mistakes he has made.\n  But I do think history will judge him fairly harshly for the \nopportunities he has squandered. One of the opportunities squandered \nhere is the ability to have united this Nation in common purpose after \n9/11.\n  Let me ask a rhetorical question. Can you imagine if immediately \nafter 9/11, when the President had that big economic summit down in \nCrawford, TX, or near Crawford, with some of the most prominent, \nsignificant, and patriotic businessmen in America, and some of the most \nwealthy men and women in America--what do you think would have \nhappened, as that broke up, if he said: By the way, I want to ask the \nfollowing of all of you. I would ask each one of you in the spirit of \nunity and harmony in this country, when you leave this room after \nhearing me speak, I strongly urge you--I ask you to take out your cell \nphone and call your accountant at home and ask him to go out and find \nfour of the most worthy young women and men, eligible for college, who \nare unable to pay for college for 4 years, and commit to pay their \ntuitions.\n  Would any of my colleagues on the Senate floor think there would have \nbeen a single solitary man or woman in that room who would not have \nwalked out, dialed up their cell phone, and said to their accountants, \nfind those people? I mean it sincerely. I am not joking about this. I \ncan't fathom that group of women and men not responding to the call for \nunity--not just to deal with the war on terror but to deal with healing \nand uniting this country. Nothing has been asked of these people, not \nbecause they have refused, not because they are unwilling, but because \nof an ideological disposition that somehow in any way to alter the tax \nstructure beyond what we have just done is ipso facto wrong, bad, \ncounterproductive. We are a slave to ideology on this floor.\n  There is not a single person in here who can say this $25 billion \nbecause it is all fungible is not going to be added to the deficit. Why \ndon't we pay for it\n\n[[Page S6957]]\n\nfairly, honestly, and straightforwardly? When have we ever succeeded in \nthe great noble causes of this country without engaging all segments of \nsociety?\n  I would make the rhetorical point--I suspect you will not do this, \nbut I will make you a bet. If you were to call your State's 10 wealthy \npeople who fall into this category and ask them whether they would \nsupport having to pay at a 36-percent rate rather than a 35-percent \nrate to pay for the war, I am willing to bet you that 8 out of 10 or \nmore of them will say, I am willing. I am betting--and I trust all of \nmy colleagues would--if you do that, you will come and tell me you \nfound in your State more than 2 out of 10 said they wouldn't do that, I \nwill buy you dinner anywhere you want to go to dinner. It is on me. My \nfinancial disclosure statement shows, unfortunately, that I am one of \nthe least well positioned in this body to pay for dinner.\n  There is something wrong, there is something not sensible about \nfailing to be more responsible. How can it be called responsible to say \nwe are going to make these pages, these kids, pay the $25 billion? I \ndon't get this. Every one of us, Democrats and Republicans, comes to \nthe floor of the Senate and talks about the need for a culture of \nresponsibility. I truly don't get it, other than ideology.\n  I respectfully suggest that if, in fact, we do this to set a \nprecedent that engages more people in the outcome of this war on \nterror--I am not making a populist argument--the group that is in the \ntop 1 percent will get, out of the total tax cut of $1.8 trillion, \n$88.9 billion.\n  Again, I am not making a populist argument. That may be arguably \njustified on the merits. But it is the idea that 1 percent can't give \nup 1 percent of $688.19 billion. It is not even 1 percent; it is \nactually $688.19 billion over 10 years--that they will not give up 1 \npercent for 5 of those years. It is the equivalent of asking them to \ngive up one-half of 1 percent of that number when 99 percent of the \nAmerican people pay--not all 99 percent; some don't pay taxes--but 99 \npercent of the American people get a tax cut of about $1.1 billion \ndollars.\n  A couple of my Republican colleagues have said it is unfair to pick \non the wealthy. It is not picking on anybody. I am trying to find the \nmost equitable way to do this. What I am trying to do is make sure we \nare in a position to act responsibly, and it is not responsible to pile \nthe debt upon our children for an endeavor we chose to undertake when \nit is fully within our power to pay for it without in any way being \nunfair to any single group of taxpayers and without having any rational \nargument that it will, in fact, negatively impact on the economy.\n\n  Were I in my 27-year-old populist mode, I would say it is greed. But \nI have learned a lot in my 32 years here. It is that we have not asked. \nFor every wealthy group of businessmen and businesswomen in my State \nthat I have approached, I have yet to have one tell me there is \nsomething unfair or unequitable about this.\n  I urge my colleagues. I will conclude this portion by saying I urge \nmy colleagues to let us be responsible, what I define as responsible. \nIt doesn't mean if you disagree you are irresponsible, but let us be \nresponsible here. Let us pay for something we can easily pay for and \nnot pile more debt for an elective judgment we made in this body--and I \nmade it as well--to take on the dictatorship and the maniacal \nleadership of Saddam Hussein, to take down the Taliban, and to seek al-\nQaida in its hovel.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set this \namendment aside temporarily. I further ask unanimous consent that the \ntime not be charged against either side on this amendment for the \npurpose of resolving an amendment discussed earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I am told by \nleadership staff that we have not been able to clear that at this \nmoment on the Senate floor. So I would suggest the Senator withhold \nbriefly until I find out why there is some doubt. I object, and I say \nto my friend from Missouri that I will find out why in a moment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I guess that is objection to the unanimous \nconsent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, do I have 20 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 60 minutes allotted to the \nSenator. Out of fairness, I yield myself 20 minutes because there are \nother Members who want to speak.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 20 minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. There is a big problem with Senator Biden's amendment. \nBefore I go into the problem with Senator Biden's amendment, let me say \nI agree with his concerns about the size of future Iraq funding \npackages. I am concerned about the Federal deficit we are facing on the \nhorizon.\n  But we also have to realize we are in war. You do not go to war \nunless you go to war to win. If you go to war, you go to war to win. \nYou put all the resources behind the men and women that it takes to win \nthat war. You do not put their life in danger on the battlefield. It \nmay sound like we do not care about future generations, but you don't \nworry about deficits.\n  If we worried about deficits in World War II, Hitler would have been \nin New York City. The Japanese would have been in California. They \nwould not have stopped at Pearl Harbor. We decided we were going to win \nthat war, and we put all the resources behind it.\n  For only the first time since Pearl Harbor, we have been attacked. On \nSeptember 11, 3,000 Americans died. We decided we were going to defend \nAmerica. We decided we were going to fight not on American soil, we \nwere going to fight on the soil of the people who harbor the terrorists \nwho attacked America on September 11. We are going to go to war to win. \nWe are going to put the resources behind our men and women. We are not \ngoing to take any chances.\n  I don't find any fault with anyone who talks about deficits. Only if \nthey are so concerned about deficits that they do not care if we win \nthe war and protect Americans, and the Constitution gives our \nGovernment that responsibility.\n  We also found, as a result of the war, being attacked in America, \nthat the economy went into the tank. Out of 2.5 million jobs supposedly \nlost in this recession, 1 million of those jobs were lost 3 months \nafter September 11, 2001; not because of the economy but because of war \nand the public not being certain what would happen in the future.\n  So we had tax cuts to revive the economy. We have a strong economy. A \nstrong economy produces more resources so we can fight the war and win \nthe war. The economy is growing. Federal revenues, as a result of these \ntax cuts, returned to their average levels, where they have been for 50 \nyears, 18 to 19 percent of gross domestic product. We fought the \nVietnam war and the Persian Gulf war during that period of time. So 18 \nto 19 percent of GDP for Federal taxes seems to be a level that does \nnot hurt the economy.\n  In fact, the economy grows, and it is a level of taxation that people \nhave accepted. It is producing the results we need to bring in more \nrevenue to close the gap so that we do not have big budget deficits in \nthe future.\n  On the point of taxes and the point of the budget gap, I note that \nSenator Biden's amendment contains no dedication of the revenue from \nraising taxes to any kind of fund that is oriented toward the war. In \nother words, the amendment simply raises taxes for more spending. The \nimplication is on a Defense bill it will go to defense efforts.\n  When we hear about sacrifice, I am not sure I hear sacrifice. Let's \nspend less for domestic programs so we can give more to support our men \nand women in uniform. In World War II there were efforts to curtail \ndomestic expenditures. We put all of our efforts behind our men and \nwomen but not, raise taxes, more spending, bread and butter at the same \ntime.\n\n  I also point out there are two sides to the Federal ledger. One is \nthe revenue side. That is what we take in from the people who work in \nour factories, our\n\n[[Page S6958]]\n\noffices, and our farms across America. The other side of the ledger is \nthe spending side.\n  My friends on the other side focus exclusively, as my good friend \nfrom Delaware has, on the tax side. They look only to taxpayers to put \nour fiscal house in order.\n  I agree with the goals of reducing the deficit, but I don't intend to \nhurt the economy through higher taxes and put a damper on the economy. \nI want the economy to grow. The economy is growing. What sort of a \nsignal would raising taxes send? Lower taxes one year, raise them the \nnext year. How do you get investment that way?\n  I disagree that it is all right to look only at the tax side of the \nledger. Indeed, the Senate approved a bill a little over a month ago \nthat included $170 billion in revenue offsets. Republicans, working \nwith like-minded Democrats, have been willing to exercise fiscal \ndiscipline, especially when it comes to closing corporate loopholes and \ncurtailing tax shelters.\n  I digress for a moment on the subject of offsets. I notice with some \namusement a story in Congress Daily A.M. dated last month, May 18. The \nstory noted the special alchemy in the Finance Committee work in \nformulating offsets. The article went on to quote anonymous lobbyists \nwho were frustrated with the Finance Committee production of offsets.\n  As a matter of fact, the tax staff at the Finance Committee happens \nto be the only committee personnel putting in work to generate offsets \nto raise revenues, and doing it in a fair way for corporations taking \nthe advice of big tax firms, big investment bankers, big accounting \nfirms, working together, to think of some miraculous tax loophole that \nis not legal to avoid taxation. That is cheating.\n  We are going after the cheaters and bringing in that revenue.\n  The record is clear. We found plenty of revenue raisers. I ask the \nfull Senate, who was the last Democrat to propose any savings on this \nspending side? All we have to do is look at Senator Santorum's \n``spendometer,'' that thermometer he has of red ink that adds up every \nDemocrat amendment being offered on budgets and otherwise. We know \nwhere the pressure to spend is.\n  How can we in good conscience propose those billions and billions of \ndollars of expenditures--mostly for domestic programs, not to win the \nwar in Iraq--and then complain about budget deficits?\n  Not a single spending cut is being proposed by those on the other \nside. Maybe back in the mid-1990s, but we have to go back many years. \nAll I see is spending increases.\n  So if those on the other side want to claim to be fiscal \ndisciplinarians, let's see entries on the spending side of the ledger. \nTo have credibility, you cannot just go to the American people and ask \nfor more money. You know, if I could ever get a reasonable tax \nincrease, and have people on the other side of the aisle tell me how \nhigh taxes had to go to satisfy their appetite to spend money, I might \njust scratch my head and say: Well, maybe we ought to do it if we could \nget a consensus that is as high as taxes are going to go, and we don't \nhave to worry about them going any higher. But I have never seen that \nyou could raise taxes high enough to satisfy some people in this body \nwho want to spend money.\n  I am also concerned about the degree to which taxpayers finance \nreconstruction in Iraq on a blank-check basis. I first raised this \nconcern almost a year ago. We ought to be very careful about the \nstructure of future aid packages.\n  Now I will speak specifically about Senator Biden's amendment. He \nsays he is seeking to offset the President's war-funding request with a \ntax increase. As I noted above, the text of the amendment simply raises \ntaxes for more spending. There is no connection between taxes raised \nand Iraq funding.\n  Let's take a look at the tax increase. For 2001, the top rate was \nreduced to 38.6 percent. In the 2003 tax bill, we reduced the top rate \nto 35 percent. Senator Biden's amendment would raise that top rate back \nto 36 percent. The premise of the Biden amendment seems to be that \ntaxpayers in the top bracket are solely Park Avenue millionaires. They \nclip coupons, bring in the money, get out their cigars, lean back in \ntheir chairs, and enjoy life. Well, the facts are somewhat different.\n  According to the Treasury Department, about 80 percent of the \nbenefits of the top rate go to taxpayers with small business ownership. \nNow, we have had some debates about the definition of ``small \nbusiness.'' Some on the other side define ``small business'' as only \nthose businesses with taxable income below, say, $320,000.\n  To those folks, a local chain of shoestores, if it makes over \n$320,000--no matter how many folks it employs--is the same, in their \ncategory, as the Nordstroms or the J.C. Penneys.\n  Those of us from the heartland know that the definition of ``small \nbusiness'' does not cut off at, say, $320,000. It depends upon whether \nthe business is locally owned. It depends on whether the business \nfinances its growth from its own earnings.\n  Conversely, to folks from small towns, like me, big businesses are \ngenerally the companies that finance themselves through big, massive \nbond borrowing or through the stock market.\n  The reason the distinction is important for public policy issues, \nsuch as the level of taxation, is that we value local or regionally \nbased businesses. The folks who own those businesses are from that \ncommunity. They go to the local church. They support the local Little \nLeague. Small business, as I see it, is a stabilizing yet very dynamic \nsocial force in these communities and makes America what it is today.\n  So when I talk about small business, I am not going to use any \nartificially low level of taxable income. I am going to use a \ncommonsense definition of what small business is. There is too much at \nstake to demagog the definition.\n\n  When we are considering tax policy, and specifically the tax rate \napplicable to business, we have really two categories. The first \ncategory is the regular big corporation. Virtually all big businesses, \nthat is, publicly traded companies, are taxed under the regular \ncorporate rate schedule.\n  Small business income is generally taxed at the individual or \npersonal level. In most cases, the owner of the small business puts the \nincome of the small business on his or her personal tax return.\n  As a practical matter, then, the individual tax rate is the rate paid \nby that small business. The corporate tax rate, with some exceptions in \nthe case of some older, smaller corporations, generally applies to big \nbusiness. The relationship between the top individual rate and the top \ncorporate rate has a bearing on our policy toward small business. If \nthe top individual marginal rate is higher than the top corporate \nmarginal rate, then we as a society are sending a very bad and negative \nsignal about small business, and even to small businesses that exist.\n  Before 2001, the top marginal rate for small business was 39.6 \npercent. Guess what. If you were a big corporation, the top rate was 35 \npercent. We had a penalty against small business. When you look at the \ndifference, it was a 15-percent penalty against small business--before \nwe changed the tax law last year. So it was a 15-percent small business \npenalty. That was the law. That was our Federal tax policy bias against \nsmall business.\n  In 2001, a bipartisan majority of this Senate, including almost one-\nfourth of the Democrats voting with us, voted to gradually equalize the \ntop marginal rate between small business and big business, recognizing \nthat penalty as being unfair, being anti-entrepreneurial.\n  Starting last year, for the first time in many years, the top rate, \n35 percent, is the same for Fortune 500s as it is for successful small \nbusinesses. Senator Biden's amendment would take the first step to \nrestore and perhaps even enhance the 15-percent penalty on small \nbusiness. With all the appetite for taxing and spending around here, \nrest assured, small business would be facing even higher taxes in the \nfuture because, as I said, you cannot raise taxes high enough on the \nother side of the aisle to satisfy the appetite to spend money.\n  I do not quarrel with the notion that taxpayers in the top bracket \nmake incomes starting in the range that has been stated of $320,000. A \nlot of these successful small business owners make figures like that. \nBut keep in mind, that figure represents the total net income of those \nsmall businesses. Successful small businesses are those that\n\n[[Page S6959]]\n\npurchase the equipment and hire the new workers.\n  I would ask my friends on the other side, those friends who are so \neager to raise taxes--and not all are--why they are all so reluctant to \ncut spending and eager to increase spending, to focus on the effects of \ntheir policy on small business, the effects of their policy on \nentrepreneurship in America, because small business creates 80 percent \nof the jobs in this country. Why, at this time, with a recovering job \nmarket--1.2 million jobs created this year--would we want to put a \ndamper on the economic recovery by raising taxes on the very people, \nthe very businesses, the very small businesses, that create 80 percent \nof the new jobs?\n  Last month, the Senate, by a vote of 92 to 5, approved a bill \ndesigned to cut the top marginal tax rate for small business \nmanufacturers yet again to 32 percent. Senator Biden's amendment would \ngo the other way and hammer our small business manufacturers.\n  Anyone voting for Senator Biden's amendment is, in effect, saying \nthey support raising taxes on small business manufacturers. A vote for \nthe Biden amendment is a vote to raise the top marginal tax rate on \nsmall business manufacturing from the 32 percent in the JOBS bill that \nwe just passed to 36 percent. That is a tax increase on small business \nof 13 percent--13 percent. Is that the direction we want to go in a \nrecovering economy, in a job-creating economy? Is there something wrong \nwith the economy that is growing now, with 1.2 million jobs in the last \n6 months? Why would you want to dampen that?\n  Finally, I do not want you to take my word for this. I am just a \npublic official. I would like to have you listen to what small business \nfolks are saying.\n  I would like to have you take a look at this chart. The chart is a \ncopy of a letter from the three principal small business grassroots \norganizations. The first organization is the National Federation of \nIndependent Business or NFIB. The second one is the Small Business \nLegislative Council, and the third organization is the Small Business \nSurvival Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). The Senator has used 20 minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent for 3 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I am going to read the second paragraph of this letter.\n\n       Accelerating income tax relief: Approximately 85 percent of \n     small businesses file their tax returns as individuals. An \n     increase in tax refunds means small firms will have more \n     resources and more capital to put back into growing their \n     businesses. A series of studies by four top tax economists \n     examined the effect of tax rate cuts on sole proprietors. \n     Their results indicate that a 5 percent point cut in rates \n     would increase capital investment by about 10 percent. And, \n     they found that dropping the top tax rate from 39.6 percent--\n     --\n\n  Where it was up until the year 2001----\n\n     to 33.2 percent would increase hiring by 12.1 percent.\n\n  What these small business groups said was their tax policy priorities \nincluded a reduction in the top marginal rate. It is right there in \ntheir letter.\n  Now let's think about this. As the small business folks say in their \nletter, there is a link between tax relief, economic growth, and jobs. \nWe have seen the evidence of that linkage over the last year or so. \nCheck out the economic statistics. The tax relief kicked in, the \neconomy started growing, and jobs started coming back--1.2 million jobs \nin the last 5 or 6 months.\n  Why would we want to reverse the course? Some would speculate that \nfor the minority party, it is good politics for the economy to go into \nthe tank. Raise taxes as the economy is coming back, and you stifle \neconomic growth. If economic growth is stifled, then jobs disappear. If \njobs disappear, then voters will throw out the President and his party.\n  I am not that cynical. I don't believe some of the opposition would \nwant to put short-term political advantages over the economic well-\nbeing of their constituents. But it does make you wonder.\n  To sum up, a vote for the Biden amendment is, clearly and simply, a \ntax increase. How high do taxes have to go to satisfy the appetite on \nthe other side of the aisle to spend money? I don't know. But this is a \nstart. It is a tax increase during an economic recovery. It is a tax \nincrease on the folks who create the jobs in America, our hard-working \nsmall business owners.\n  For those reasons, I obviously ask Members to reject the Biden \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment my friend and colleague, \nSenator Grassley, for his remarks. I join in those remarks. I \ncompliment him for his leadership as chairman of the Finance Committee. \nUnder his leadership of the Finance Committee, we have passed two very \nsignificant tax cuts: The tax cut in 2001, and we accelerated or \ncompleted that tax cut in 2003. As a result of those tax cuts, the \neconomy is growing. As a result of the tax cuts, the maximum tax rate \nis 35 percent. Again, this has made a difference. The economy is \ngrowing.\n  Senator Grassley mentioned there have been over 1 million jobs \ncreated in the last few months. He is correct. The stock market has \nrebounded substantially--the stock market is up 25 percent, if you are \nlooking at the Dow Jones; 40 percent, if you are looking at the \nNASDAQ--from the time we took up that bill last year.\n  Some people want to undo that. They say: We want to pay for the war; \nwe don't want to add more debt to our children and grandchildren. I \nappreciate that, but what about other spending? This is $25 billion. \nThey say: We will increase the rate 1 percent on the upper income \npeople to pay for that.\n  Let me just look at a couple of other facts. As recently as May 12, 3 \nor 4 weeks ago, we had an amendment on the floor of the Senate that was \nvoted on that would have increased spending $86 billion. It wasn't paid \nfor. We made a budget point of order against it. We defeated it, I \nthink, by one vote. But no one was saying: We want to increase taxes to \npay for that. I guess on this one, you would have to increase the \nmaximum rate by 3 or 4 points to pay for it. On the same day there was \na motion to increase spending by $9 billion. We defeated that with a \nbudget point of order; again, I believe, by one vote. That was $9 \nbillion.\n  On May 4, there was another spending increase. This was trade \nadjustment assistance, $5 billion. We defeated that by a vote or two.\n  Many of the people who are saying they want to pay for this $25 \nbillion, they want to pay for the war, they didn't want to pay for this \nadditional spending or they didn't offer that. So I find it \ninteresting, for the ones who are acting as if, in many cases, they \nwant to balance the budget, I have a total of about 68 votes where \nbudget points of order were made, and in most cases, mostly Democrats--\nwith the exception of my very good friend, Zell Miller from Georgia--\nvoted to waive the budget every time. In other words, they voted for \nmore spending.\n  The three amendments I just alluded to in May of last year were over \n$100 billion of new spending. So there are lots of attempts to increase \nspending over and above what we are doing anyway, mostly by our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle. That is one of the points I \nwanted to make.\n  Let me echo a couple of other things my friend from Iowa said. Why \nwould you want to have an individual rate higher than corporations? I \nused to be in manufacturing. I used to have my own business. Why should \nan individual be taxed more than Exxon? The corporate rate is 35 \npercent. There is an effort to make manufacturers at 32 percent. Yet we \nare going to tell self-employed people, S corp people, that they should \npay 36 percent. That doesn't make a lot of sense.\n  There is one other comment. This happens to be about the \nConstitution. Are people trying to kill this bill? You put this on this \nbill and the House is going to, what we call, blue-slip it. It is going \nto stop the bill. Why? Because there is something called the \nConstitution. The Constitution says in article I of the Constitution, \nsection 7:\n\n       All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House \n     of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with \n     Amendments as on other Bills.\n\n  It says all revenue measures, all tax measures have to originate in \nthe House of Representatives. This is the U.S. Senate. So if we do \nthat, the tradition is, the House will say: Thank you\n\n[[Page S6960]]\n\nvery much, but we are not going to let you preempt our constitutional \nprerogative. So they blue-slip it. In other words, they kill the bill.\n  This is a Department of Defense authorization bill. I have great \nrespect for Senator Warner and Senator Levin, but they are not supposed \nto rewrite the tax bill. That is for the Finance Committee. That is \nunder the jurisdiction and leadership of Senators Grassley and Baucus. \nTax amendments don't belong on this bill. Maybe it sounds good \nrhetorically: We will just ask the upper 1 percent.\n  I think that is bad policy: We want the upper 1 percent to pay for \nthe war. Nobody else has to pay for it, just the upper 1 percent.\n  That doesn't make sense. We don't do that for education. We don't do \nthat for other spending. I don't think it makes sense. I happen to \nthink the income-tax code is already so progressive, the upper 5 \npercent pay over half; the upper 1 percent pay over 20 percent. Yet \nsome people want to make it more and more progressive.\n  It wasn't too long ago we were celebrating Ronald Reagan's legacy and \nhis great contributions to this country and the free world during his \nterm of office. At the conclusion of his term of office, the maximum \ntax rate was 28 percent. I know under President Clinton it went all the \nway up to 39.6. That is a pretty significant increase. Now we have it \nat 35 percent. Yet some people say: Let's make it more progressive.\n  I guess you could take this same amendment and put it on every one of \nthese spending amendments. And I haven't totaled it. It is about $1.4 \ntrillion worth of additional spending that most of our colleagues on \nthe Democratic side of the aisle have proposed, and we have stopped \nusing budget points of order. For those who ask, Do we need budget \npoints of order? Yes, we do.\n  They have been effective in curtailing the growth of spending. I said \n$1.4 billion, but it is actually $1.2 trillion, not since the budget \nwas adopted last year. Real money, a lot of money. I think the figure \nis well over $140 billion just in 2004 or 2005 alone.\n  Constitutionally, those of us who have the pleasure of serving this \ngreat body, the Senate, stand before the President of the Senate and \nput our hand--most of us--on the Bible and swear allegiance to the \nConstitution of the United States. The Constitution of the United \nStates says all revenue measures shall originate in the House. If you \ndon't like that, try to amend the Constitution. That is in the \nConstitution. We have over 200 years of history and tradition of the \nSenate of following the Constitution. All revenue measures shall \noriginate in the House. So to try to circumvent that and say we are \ngoing to stick a little tax bill into a Defense authorization bill is \nnot the way the Senate is supposed to work. It hasn't worked that way.\n  I have only been here 24 years, which is not quite as long as my \ncolleague from Delaware. But the Senate doesn't originate tax bills. It \nhasn't for hundreds of years, and it should not today. I ask my \ncolleagues to, at the appropriate time, vote against the amendment by \nour friend and colleague from Delaware.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Oklahoma, he doth \nprotest too loudly. I am not taking it out of the tax bill. This is \ngood stuff on the Constitution, but I think my friend voted for the \nJOBS bill and just violated the Constitution, by his definition, \nbecause we had a revenue measure in there. It didn't get blue-slipped, \nand he apparently violated his oath, by his definition. I don't think \nhe violated his oath at all.\n  But the truth is this: In the JOBS bill, what did we do? We changed \nthe Tax Code. So this is great rhetoric, and my friend from Iowa went \nthrough this whole thing about--\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield for a clarification?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Yes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. For my colleague's information, we have not yet passed \nthe JOBS bill. What we are going to do is take a House bill, strike \nthat House bill, and insert that bill into an H.R. So it will be a \nHouse revenue measure before it goes to conference. We have not gone to \nconference. The bill before us is a Senate bill. There is a difference.\n  Mr. BIDEN. The Senator did vote for the Senate bill, correct?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Yes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. He would be able to do the same thing with this bill if he \nused his ingenuity, would he not?\n  Mr. NICKLES. To clarify, this is a Senate bill, and it will stay that \nwhen it goes to conference.\n  Mr. BIDEN. But it doesn't have to any more than the last Senate bill \nhad to stay a Senate bill. I have been here 32 years. I may not be in \nthe No. 2 position in my party, as my friend was, but I don't need an \neducation on how we do this. This is malarkey, as they say--this \nargument being made about the Constitution. Let me move on, if I may.\n  My friend references President Reagan, and I might note that I voted \nfor the Roth-Kemp tax cut. Then I watched President Reagan and voted \nwith him when he raised taxes three times after that because he was a \nresponsible fellow. He raised taxes three times after that out of \nnecessity. I also was here--and we talked about World War II. The \nPresident says this is the equivalent of World War II. My friends talk \nabout World War II. We raised taxes through the ceiling in World War \nII. I don't know whether they didn't teach the same history in Oklahoma \nand Iowa as they did in Delaware, but we raised taxes in World War II.\n  Also, this notion about all these other programs--the Senator, \nbecause he is so busy and has extensive responsibilities on his side of \nthe aisle, did not have an opportunity--he didn't miss much--to hear my \nspeech on the front end.\n  There are two purposes in my doing this: One is to unite this Nation, \nfor everybody to get in on the deal. Many other people are being asked \nto sacrifice. You know, this is a war. People are dying. Some people \nare sacrificing. People are having their incomes radically changed--\nthose in the National Guard and Reserves. They are contributing at the \noffice.\n  The other part is--I will say this again, and I said it last time--\nwould any wealthy American--and I hope every one of my kids becomes a \nwealthy American. By most people's standards, based on my salary, most \npeople think I am wealthy. I don't have stocks, bonds, debentures, and \nsavings accounts. I am not bragging about that, but that is a fact. \nMost Americans think I am wealthy based on the salary I get paid. But I \nsay to the top 1 percent out there, call me, give me your name, and \ntell me you are not willing to pay 1 percent higher for the next 5 \nyears in order to make sure these kids sitting here don't pay.\n  War is different than education. Part of the purpose of a leader, \nwhen you go to war, is to unite the Nation, share the responsibility, \nengage in the sacrifice.\n  The other point I will make is that my friend from Iowa talks about \nthe fact that this tax cut generated economic growth. I don't disagree \nwith that. But the real question is, is taking one-tenth of 1 percent \nof the total tax cut going to stop economic growth? Is the Senator \nmaking that argument? Well, if he is right, this is a bad idea. One-\ntenth of 1 percent is the total cost of the total tax cut of this \namendment--$25 billion, one-tenth of 1 percent. That is going to bring \nthis economic growth to a screeching halt? Give me a break.\n  Let's talk about the small business people. I didn't make the \nassertion that all small business people are sitting back clipping \ncoupons. I am not saying that. I just tell you what the facts are. The \nfacts are, as the Senator knows, that small business owners have to be \nin the top 1 percent of wage earners to fall into this bracket. Only 2 \npercent of all the small business owners in America fall into this \nbracket. That does include some people with passive incomes \nparticipating in investment and small businesses. This is not the \nhands-on, mom-and-pop business owners by any stretch of the \nimagination. If you look at only sole proprietor returns, those with \nhands-on owners, they are less than 2 percent. So I can understand my \nfriend disagreeing with me. That is a logical position he takes. He may \nbelieve that it is unfair to have them pay 1 percent more and not ask \npeople making $100,000 to pay 1 percent more. I can understand that. \nThat is just an honest disagreement.\n\n[[Page S6961]]\n\n  I can understand my friend from Oklahoma in his argument on why are \nwe taxing corporations more. That makes sense, too. We can do that. If \nhe wants to go that route, I will help him.\n  There are other ways to do this. I tried to pick the most painless, \nunifying mechanism I could find to do a responsible thing: make sure \nthese kids in the blue suits don't pay for this war. They are still \ngoing to pay for the war, by the way. We have already spent over $200 \nbillion on this war. I am not complaining about that. I am arguing that \nwe need more troops.\n  My Lord, all these specious arguments: My God, the mom-and-pop \ngrocery store owners are going to be put in jeopardy by this amendment; \nthis is going to slow down economic growth; this is unfair.\n  Then the irony is that my friend from Iowa, who always says he is not \na lawyer--as I pointed out to him, he is smarter than any lawyer on \nthat committee. Be careful of this good old boy from Iowa, who says: \nGolly, gee whiz, I am not a lawyer. He knows more hard case law than \nanybody I know on the Senate floor. Yet he stands up there straight \nfaced and says: You know what, this $25 billion tax increase--and it \nis--paid for by the top 1 percent is bad for the economy, but I, Chuck \nGrassley, am out there making sure corporations pay more. I am finding \nloopholes and closing them.\n\n  I congratulate him. Guess what it means. It means you are going to \nhave more people pay more taxes. Is that going to slow down the \neconomy? When my friend takes out of the tax stream or adds to the tax \nstream by shutting loopholes that do not belong in the law, guess what. \nMore money is coming to the Government. More money than $25 billion I \nam talking about.\n  He is a very bright guy. So let's be logical. Let's set up a little \nsyllogism here. If his thesis is my $25 billion is going to slow down \nthe economy, $25 billion now is in the hands of people out there, or \nwill be over the next 5 years out in the hands to be spent by \nAmericans, what about the $25 billion, $35 billion, $100 billion he is \nlooking to take out of the economy over the next 5 years that will be \nspent by corporations, being spent by, maybe unfairly, but being \nspent--that is not going to slow down the economy, but my $25 billion \nis?\n  Again, to use the expression of my granddaughter, give me a break. I \nmay not be the brightest candle on the table, but I am a relatively \nlogical guy. There is no logic in the argument.\n  So, look, there are three good reasons to be against Biden: One, you \nideologically think this is a bad idea because somehow you think--and I \nam being a little facetious--that the top 1 percent of the American \npublic pays too much of a burden and is put upon, and to add anything \nelse on them is just unfair to the rest of the American public. OK. Got \nit. It is a straightforward argument, logical.\n  The second logical argument is, if there is any merit to it: You \nought to spread this out, Biden. If, in fact, you are going to add to \nthe deficit by paying for Medicare or the prescription drug bill--which \nI voted against and which a lot of you voted for; it cost a lot more \nthan you promised it was going to cost, raising the deficit, spending \nthat I did not vote for--it is better to say unless you are going to \npay for this spending, you should not pay for it with revenues. OK. I \ngot it. It is a straightforward argument.\n  Or lastly, one might argue: Psychologically this is dangerous because \nafter cutting taxes, to now raise them for 5 years by 1 percent for 1 \npercent of the population, it is going to inject some uncertainty. I \ndon't know what that means. That could be an argument one could make.\n  With all due respect, you cannot make the argument mom and pop are \ngoing under; mom and pop are slowing down; that the loss of revenue is \ngoing to stifle economic growth; that this portion of the population is \nput upon; that this is no different than education or health care or \nhighways, because it is. It is war.\n  By the way, when I introduced this proposal on a larger measure--$87 \nbillion--a while ago, according to the national polls, 56 percent of \nthe Americans polled on the last version of this amendment said pay for \nthe war from the tax cut.\n  This is all about values. This is about value differences. And the \nvalue that I am espousing--and I am not being so moralistic to suggest \nthat I know it is superior to the value my friends are proposing, but \nit is a different value. I value the necessity of a greater sense of \nnational unity and a greater contribution from all sectors of the \neconomy in winning this war. I value the notion that when we are \nclearly able, without doing any harm to the economy or being unfair to \nany one segment, that we should pay, when we can, rather than make our \nchildren and grandchildren pay.\n\n  The difference between war and education is on education we made a \njudgment that we should have an educational system, and we do not \ncontrol the population. So as children are born, the responsibility to \nkeep a commitment we made exists. It is not elective. War, in this \ncase, was elective. I elected to go to war. That is not a societal \nresponsibility that rests with a generation that has not even come of \nage yet; it is a responsibility of ours, just as World War II was the \nresponsibility of the greatest generation in the history of mankind, \nthe World War II generation. They did not say: Make my son, Joe, make \nmy daughter, Valerie, make my son, Jim or Frank, pay for this war. They \nvalued responsibility. They stepped up to the ball. As to the idea that \nthis even calls for any serious sacrifice, if that is the case, my \nLord, we have lost our bearings.\n  I have seen not one scintilla of evidence that this will slow \neconomic recovery; that this is a burden upon a group of people who \nstrongly resist taking on the burden; that this is, per se, unfair. \nThis is something I believe--and I cannot prove it because I have not \nconducted any national poll--that if the people who will be affected by \nthis, again, whose average income is $1 million a year, who have to \nhave a taxable income of $320,000 a year even to get in the game, and \nif they are small business, 98 percent of them will be not affected one \nsingle little way by this, my guess is, if they know it is really going \nto pay for the $25 billion needed next year for the war, they would pay \nit, proudly pay it, and rightfully should pay.\n  My dad, who passed away long ago, used to have an expression. My dad \nwas, I guess, probably like the mom or dad of Senator Grassley and \nSenator Nickles and others, a generation that had a different view. My \ndad's table was a place where you had dinner, you sat down, and two \nthings were demanded. One, you had to have good table manners, and the \nother was you had to engage in conversation. Our table was a table \nwhere you sat down and had conversation and incidentally ate, rather \nthan sat down, ate, and had incidental conversation. It was the one \nplace the family got together with certainty every night, and friends \nwere always included.\n  I will never forget my father in a discussion with my uncle, Bill \nScheen, talking about a particular tax. My dad looked at him and said: \nBill, there is no price too high to pay to live in this great country.\n  I am not asking for a big price. I am just asking for people to do \nwhat in their heart they know is right.\n  I understand my friends, what they have not said--and I may be wrong, \nbut I suspect part of their concern about this amendment, because at \nleast four Members on that side have come up to me and said: I would \nlike to vote for this, Joe, but here is my fear--I give my word this is \ntrue--this is my fear: My fear is this would be a foot in the door. If \nyou make this argument and it has catches, I am paying for the war, \nthen your guys are going to come back and say: Look, we ought to raise \ntaxes on the wealthiest corporations to pay for health care, or to pay \nfor whatever. I think that is a legitimate concern on the part of my \nRepublican friends. I understand that. Maybe that is the reason why, \nnot the people who have spoken but some of the people who have spoken \nto me, who share my concern about not passing this on to these kids are \nnot going to vote with me. I think it is a shame. I just cannot think \nof how we are able to communicate to the American people that we are in \nmortal combat for what will be an extended period of time with an enemy \nthat does not wear a uniform but has the capacity to do overwhelming \nharm to us but that there is no need to rally the entire Nation to \ncontribute a little bit at the office in order to win that war.\n\n[[Page S6962]]\n\n  Again, the example I gave of what if the President had said go out \nand pay the tuition of two or four people in your neighborhood, for \nthose of you who can afford it, that is not going to help the war. If \nanyone thinks that is what I meant, they missed the whole point.\n  The point is, we should use this time of crisis to unite the country, \nto talk about the things where we can help one another, where it is not \npaid for, where it is not unfair. That is the point I am trying to \nmake, and I guess I am not being articulate enough because I do not \nthink a lot of my friends get it.\n  It is probably my fault because maybe I am not explaining it well \nenough, but just to make sure everybody understands, how does one \nconvince people that this is as tough a deal as it is if, in fact, we \nhave this incredibly large tax cut? How does that square? It is like my \nsaying to my kids, when they ask me can they go to a summer camp, and \nmy saying I cannot afford to do that, and I drive up the driveway the \nnext day in a brand new Lexus; it is tough times, kids, I cannot afford \nto send you to that college, you are going to go to the State \nuniversity, and we buy a summer house. I mean, how does one do that?\n  By the way, this war is going to cost us a couple hundred billion \ndollars more before this is over.\n  Well, I have said all I want to say. I wish I could have said it \nbetter but I think this is fair. I think it is equitable. I think it is \nnecessary, and I hope my colleagues will see it that way. I understand \nif they do not.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time, and I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I join Senator Biden in support of \nthis amendment to pay for the President's request for an additional $25 \nbillion to fund the war in Iraq.\n  This amendment will temporarily roll back the acceleration of the \nPresident's May 2003 tax cuts for those making more than $319,000 per \nyear by raising the income tax rate from 35 percent to 36 percent for 5 \nyears, 2005-2009.\n  Assuming passage of this supplemental funding request, the Iraq war \nwill have cost the American people more than $175 billion. And without \nthis amendment, every penny of this $25 billion supplemental request \nwill be borrowed, becoming another debt we will leave to our children \nand grandchildren.\n  This amendment, however, offers a very reasonable way to pay for this \nstage of the war on terror.\n  By rolling back the acceleration of the May 2003 tax cut just enough \nto fund the $25 billion request before us, we will reduce the already \nserious debt burden on our Nation.\n  We are offering this amendment because it is essential that we begin \npaying for the programs that we propose.\n  It is important for the public to know that they--along with our \nsoldiers--must also sacrifice during this war on terror.\n  Except to tell us that we should visit our shopping malls more \nfrequently, the President has shown little leadership in asking \ncitizens to give to this war effort.\n  This amendment sends a different message--one that says that it is \nimportant that those who have the capacity to pay for this war effort \nmust step forward.\n  It is time for sacrifice. Deficits, interest costs and the debt are \ngrowing again.\n  Net interest payments on Federal debt are set to increase sharply \nfrom approximately $170 billion in 2003 to more than $300 billion by \n2012.\n  And we are facing these daunting fiscal realities as we try to meet a \nhost of new challenges: the war on terror, the war in Iraq, the threat \nof North Korea, and, of course, securing our homeland.\n  The Congressional Budget Office predicts that the Federal deficit for \nfiscal year 2004 will top $470 billion--the largest deficit in our \nhistory.\n  A portion of every dollar we spend from this day until the end of \nSeptember 2004, will be borrowed money--money our children and \ngrandchildren will have to repay.\n  After this year's deficit, it is estimated that we will accumulate \nalmost $1.5 trillion in debt during the next 5 years and a total of $2 \ntrillion during the next decade\n  To help us understand the fiscal track we are on, one must understand \nthat this year's deficit is larger than the amount the President \nrequested for defense in his Fiscal Year 2005 budget request, 447 \nbillion, and larger than the combined non-defense discretionary budget \nfor this year, 459 billion.\n  Further, the budget projections we are now using do not include the \ncost of military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. So add another $25 \nbillion to $80 billion to the deficit.\n  Nor do they include long-term costs associated with correcting a \ngrowing problem with the Alternative Minimum Tax, AMT. This will cost \n$660 billion over the next 10 years.\n  The current budget picture also hides the full impact of extending \nthe President's tax cuts to just the next 5 years. Beyond this 5-year \nwindow, the costs escalate dramatically. The total 10-year cost of \nthose cost: $1.6 trillion.\n  And the budget uses $1.1 trillion of revenue from the Social Security \nand Medicare trust funds over the next 5 years.\n  Overall, our Federal debt is expected to rise from $6.8 trillion \ntoday to $15.1 trillion in 2014.\n  Why do Deficits Matter? They matter, as the Brookings Institution \npoints out, because they slow economic growth. By 2014, the average \nfamily's income will be an estimated $1,800 lower because of the slower \nincome growth that results when government competes with the private \nsector for a limited pool of savings or borrows more from abroad.\n  They increase household borrowing costs by driving up interest rates: \nA family with a $250,000, 30-year-mortgage, for example, will pay an \nadditional $2,500 in interest for a one-percent hike in interest rates.\n  They increase indebtedness to foreign creditors. Japan holds $526 \nbillion of our debt. China holds $144 billion. The United Kingdom holds \n$112 billion. Caribbean Banking Centers hold $62 billion.\n  They require that a growing proportion of revenues be devoted to \npaying interest on the national debt: By 2014, this increased borrowing \nwill cost the average household $3,000 in added interest on debt alone.\n  They impose enormous burdens on future generations. Today's young \npeople will have to pay more because our generation has increased the \ndebt so tremendously. And there will be added pressure to cut spending \non health care, education, and other critical services.\n  Additionally, deficits will prevent us from addressing looming crises \nin both Social Security and Medicare when the baby boomers retire.\n  In 2003, we spent $1.2 trillion on these programs and other \nentitlements--54 percent of the Federal budget. This includes Social \nSecurity, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, unemployment compensation.\n  By 2009, we will be spending $1.6 trillion for these entitlements--57 \npercent of the Federal budget.\n  By 2014, we will be spending $2.1 trillion--59 percent of the budget.\n  These programs are in serious danger if we continue down this path of \ndeficit spending.\n  In January of last year during his State of the Union Address, the \nPresident said the following:\n\n       This country has many challenges. We will not deny, we will \n     not ignore, we will not pass along our problems to other \n     Congresses, to other Presidents, and to other generations. We \n     will confront them with focus and clarity and courage.\n  Well, this is one challenge we are passing on to other Congresses and \nto other generations.\n  Today we have a chance to meet this challenge and demonstrate fiscal \nresponsibility by temporarily rolling back a small portion of the \naccelerated tax cut for the wealthiest Americans.\n  Everyone who is affected by this amendment makes more than $319,000 a \nyear in taxable income, which typically means that they are making more \nthan $430,000 a year in gross income.\n  This amendment does not revoke the 2001 or 2003 reductions in the top \nincome tax rate, nor would it affect any other element of the 2001 or \n2003 tax packages. It would merely temporarily raise the marginal \nincome tax rate on the richest in our society.\n  By scaling back a small portion of the accelerated cut in the May \n2003 tax package, we will be taking a first step toward putting our \nfiscal house in order and asking citizens to sacrifice for the war on \nterror.\n\n[[Page S6963]]\n\n  Passing this amendment is the responsible thing to do. I urge your \nsupport.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I assure my colleague from the State of \nDelaware, for whom I have a tremendous amount of respect, that his \ninability to persuade us has nothing to do with his lack of passion or \neloquence. He has an abundance of both, and a lot of good faith and \nfriendliness thrown in to boot. The problem is, he is wrong. That is \nthe only problem.\n  I would like to try to explain why I think that is so, with all good \nfaith, to my friend. He started out by saying that the purpose of his \namendment is to unite the Nation and then proceeded to offer an \namendment which chose a very small minority of taxpayers on whom to \nraise taxes, and that is supposed to unite the Nation.\n  With all due respect to my friend, I do not think that unites the \nNation. That hearkens back to the old class warfare concept that there \nare some people who are so rich that we have to soak them a little bit \nmore in order to be fair.\n  In fact, that is implicit in the argument. We have a lot of people \noverseas sacrificing. These rich people must not be sacrificing enough \nso let us extract more money from them in the form of income taxes. \nThat is the implicit argument. That is not a uniting argument.\n  The interesting thing is that when it comes to the Tax Code of the \nUnited States, Americans are very egalitarian. Middle-income taxpayers \nsupport repeal of the death tax, for example, even though they know it \nwould never help them. They support the retention of the tax cuts on \nthe highest tax brackets, on the middle tax brackets. We all support it \nfor the lower tax brackets. In fact, a lot of people would like to be \nin the next higher bracket. That may be one reason they do not want to \nsoak the rich, because they would like to be in that next bracket maybe \nin a few years.\n  The reality is, most people are perfectly happy, even where they are, \nsupporting fair taxes. Polls have been taken, and the question asked \nis, What do you think is the fair percentage of taxes to extract from \nAmericans? The answer, uniformly, year after year, is about one-third, \nand that applies to all tax brackets. So most Americans believe that \nthe fair tax would be about a third of what one makes, regardless of \nhow rich they are.\n  What are the real facts about the sacrifice that Americans make \nfinancially, the sacrifice, that is to say in the amount of taxes that \nthey pay to fund things such as the war effort? Let me give the exact \nstatistics, because I think this makes the point that there is already \na lot of sacrifice--and, by the way, it is a willing sacrifice.\n  When it comes to war, I think we are all willing to do more because \nwe are asking some young men and women to sacrifice an awful lot, but \nlet's get the exact facts.\n  How much do the top 1 percent--and that is the people we are talking \nabout--pay in taxes in this country? The top 1 percent obviously pay \nmore than 1 percent, maybe 5 percent or 10 percent, maybe 20 percent, \n30 percent? Do my colleagues know how much the top 1 percent pay? They \npay almost a third of the taxes of this country. So the folks we are \ntalking about, the 1 percent pay, to be exact, 32.3 percent of the \ntaxes. Almost exactly a third of the taxes are paid by the top 1 \npercent.\n  That is more than fair. That is a pretty progressive tax system.\n  How about the top 5 percent? They pay over half of all taxes. Just \nthe top 5 percent pay 52.8 percent of the taxes.\n  How about the top 10 percent? We always like to talk about the top 10 \npercent of the class, and that is a pretty elite group. The top 10 \npercent pay almost two-thirds of all of the taxes--64.8 percent, to be \nexact. What do the bottom half percent of our taxpayers pay? There is \nthe top half and the bottom half. How much do my colleagues think the \nbottom half pay? Less than 4 percent of the taxes are paid by the \nbottom half--36 percent, to be exact.\n  One could say the wealthier people in this country are paying their \nfair share. One could say they are making a sacrifice. I would not put \nit that way because, frankly, I think most of them can afford to do it. \nI do not think it is something they resent doing. So I think it is a \nsacrifice they are very willing to take on, but I do not think we \nshould contend that we are uniting America by picking a very small \nminority of taxpayers, who are already paying a third of all of the \ntaxes in the country, and saying now they are going to have to pay some \nmore or else they are not sacrificing enough.\n  The interesting thing is that the tax cuts President Bush proposed \nand we passed into law actually increased the percentage of taxes paid \nby those in the higher brackets. It did not decrease it. So it added to \nthe sacrifice, if one wants to put it that way.\n  In every one of these brackets, if we want to take the top 1 percent, \nthe top 5 percent, the top 10 percent, the percentage of taxes paid by \nthat group of people is higher today than it was before the tax \ncuts. And the percentage paid by the lower 50 percent is actually less. \nIt used to be 4.1 percent. Now it is down to 3.6 percent.\n\n  So it is a specious argument to suggest that somehow these people are \nnot paying their fair share, that the only way to be fair is to make \nthem sacrifice some more. I don't think we should look at the war \neffort this way, let alone fund our Government this way. I don't think \nit is the way to unite the country. If anything, it further tends to \ndivide the country.\n  I would like to move to the second point. I think most people now \nrecognize that the tax reductions had a great deal to do with the \nstimulation of the economy. Why was that so? Primarily because there \nwas more capital available. People were able to keep more of their own \nmoney, and they did one of three things with it: They either spent it, \nwhich helped some businesses because they now had more revenue; or they \ninvested it, then there was more capital to be invested in businesses \nto create more jobs, for example; or they saved it, and savings amounts \nto investment because whatever institution you put it in then invests \nthe money.\n  So in all three situations there was more money infused into the \neconomy; more capital, which created more jobs; and those jobs, the \njobs that have been created and the capital infused in the economy, \nhave created an extraordinarily strong economy.\n  One of the results of that has been to begin to reduce the budget \ndeficit by providing more income to the Federal Government because more \nmoney is being paid by people and by businesses. That wealth is what is \ngoing to be able to help us win the war as well as fund the other \nthings we have to fund.\n  The argument of my colleague from Delaware is: But this is a very \nsmall amount of money. One-tenth of 1 percent, I believe, is the \nnumber. That may be. One-tenth of 1 percent of what we are talking \nabout is a heck of a lot of money--$25 billion to be exact, as I \nunderstand it. So we are not talking peanuts. That is $25 billion that \nwould not be helping to create new jobs, to stimulate the economy, to \ncreate additional wealth, which could be used to pay for the war as \nwell as the other things on which we need to spend it.\n  It is an especially important part of the economy. Phil Gramm, our \nformer colleague from Texas, used to talk about one of his constituents \nwho said he had a lot of jobs in his life. He worked for a lot of \nemployers, and he said, the funny thing was they all had more money \nthan he did.\n  There are employers and there are employees. Thank God for both. But \nyou have to have enough capital, enough wealth, to create jobs to pay \npeople to do work for you in order for the rest of us to have a job. It \nis those people in these tax brackets who have that capital that they \nare able to invest in a business, so-called disposable income, money \nthat they can invest in a stock or some other equity to help create a \njob in this country. That money has more effect in the economic \nrecovery than a lot of the other money that is paid in taxes. \nTherefore, this is not an insignificant proposition that we are talking \nabout, only talking about one-tenth of 1 percent, and therefore what \ndifference and does it matter? It could make a great deal of difference \nin the economic health of our country.\n  It is wrong to raise taxes at this point when we know the reduction \nin taxes, especially the marginal rates, have produced such a strong \neffect on the economy.\n\n[[Page S6964]]\n\n  We could get into an argument about small businesses. There is an \nentire report that I could get into that talks about the effect on \nsmall businesses. We know many of the people in this tax bracket are \nsmall business owners. These are where most of the jobs are created, 7 \nout of 10 jobs, if you want to get into the statistics, are created by \nsmall businesses. There are 8 million small businesses in America that \nemploy over half the workers, and this tax rate is the rate many pay \nbecause they are a passthrough entity, like the subchapter S \ncorporations and partnerships and so on. We don't need to get into all \nthat.\n  The point is, this hurts small businesses just as much as it hurts \nbig businesses. In any event, it hurts those who create jobs, and it \ndoesn't unite America. It doesn't unite us as a nation, as my colleague \nwould suggest. It tends to divide us and hurt us. That is one of the \nreasons we oppose it.\n  There are very few people on the other side of the aisle for whom I \nhave greater respect than the Senator from Delaware. I understand the \nmotivation behind his proposal. I simply think it is the wrong \napproach. It is in that spirit that I oppose his amendment and urge my \ncolleagues to keep the tax cuts that we put in place. They have done a \nlot of good. Let's keep them. We do not need to hurt somebody in order \nto unite the country. We have enough revenue to pay for the increased \nneeds of our country. Of course, the amendment doesn't even apply that \nmoney to the war in Iraq. There is an assumption that it would be used \nfor that purpose, and I will grant that assumption. But the bottom line \nis we don't have to do this in order to win the war in Iraq, in order \nto supply our troops, and it would have very negative effects on the \neconomy of the country, as well as being very unfair.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote against the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Delaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might \nconsume.\n  When the author of this amendment finished, he spoke about my being \ninconsistent; that I want to close tax loopholes. He says that takes \nmoney out of the economy, so it is inconsistent when I say that it is \nwrong for him to take money out of the economy.\n  I think the thing for him to remember about closing these tax \nloopholes, we are taking in money from dishonest taxpayers, whereas he \nis taking money away from honest taxpayers by raising the marginal tax \nrate. He would say I am inconsistent in complaining about his taking \nmoney out of the economy and running it through Government, whereas I \nam taking money out of the economy by closing the tax loopholes of \ndishonest taxpayers.\n  When I close those loopholes, have dishonest taxpayers pay taxes they \nought to be paying anyway--except for the fact that they buy tax \nshelters put together by big corporate lawyers, big accounting firms, \nand big investment bankers--I am getting money from dishonest \ntaxpayers. But in the bill that I referred to, the JOBS bill, we reduce \ntaxes in America so that companies that do manufacture in the United \nStates will pay less corporate tax as an incentive to create jobs in \nAmerica.\n  We are taking money from dishonest taxpayers, but we are putting it \nright back into the economy in the private sector by reduced taxes for \npeople who do manufacturing in America to create jobs. So I think I am \ntotally consistent. I think having dishonest taxpayers pay what they \nwould otherwise pay if they hadn't been buying these tax shelters is \nthe right policy.\n  I think the Biden amendment reducing marginal tax rates and hurting \nsmall business is the wrong policy. It is the right policy to have \ndishonest taxpayers who use tax shelters pay their taxes, and I think \nit is all right to give tax relief to companies that manufacture in \nAmerica--not those that manufacture overseas but create jobs in \nAmerica. That bill passed 92 to 5, and I presume with the support of \nthe Senator from Delaware.\n  I believe we are doing the right thing. I believe he is doing the \nwrong thing. I believe we encourage job creation and entrepreneurship, \nparticularly among small business. I believe his amendment will \nactually discourage it.\n  I believe his amendment is the first step towards what Senator Kerry \nis campaigning for in his campaign for the Presidency--that, if he is \nelected, he made it very clear he is going to raise the top marginal \ntax rate not just to 36 percent as the Senator from Delaware would, but \nraise it to 39.6 percent.\n  Do you think that is the end? There is not enough money there to do \nall the things Senator Kerry is campaigning on. Pretty soon it is not \njust 39.6. Pretty soon it is taking away deductions so that the top \nmarginal tax rate might say 39.6, but it is effectively 42, or, in the \ncase of subchapter S, 45 as it used to be. Pretty soon there is not \nenough money there. Pretty soon you are taxing middle-income people to \na greater extent. Who knows where that all ends?\n  I think sometime there has to be a decision made that the Government \nwill only take so much out of the economy; that 535 Members of Congress \nwill only spend so much money. That amount of money is not satisfactory \nto people on the other side of the aisle, but I decided that where it \nhas been for 50 years--17 to 19 percent of GNP--is where it ought to \nbe, and the tax reductions we passed in 2001 and in 2003 to stimulate \nthe economy, to get us out of the recession, out of the joblessness \nthat came as a result of the September 11 attack on America by \nterrorism, and to revive the economy, is about right. These tax bills \nwere at their highest level since World War II. We ought to bring it \nback to where it was for 50 years--17 to 19 percent--for two reasons.\n  No. 1: The economy has grown at that level of taxation very well over \nthat 50 years. It hasn't done any harm to the economy.\n  No. 2: It is a level of taxation that is accepted by the people of \nthis country.\n  There is a basic philosophical difference between that side of the \naisle and this side of the aisle. They believe we should bring the \nmoney into Washington and let 535 Members of Congress decide how to \ndivide up the goods and services of this country. There is a philosophy \nwe have on this side of the aisle that it is better to leave the money \nin the pockets of the taxpayers because having 130 million people \ndecide how the goods and services of this country ought to be expended \nor invested results in a more dynamic economy than if 535 Members \nelected to the Congress of the United States make that decision for 270 \nmillion Americans.\n  When we enacted the individual tax cuts in 2001, the Treasury \nDepartment estimated that roughly three out of four taxpayers affected \nby the 35 percent bracket filed returns with small business activity \ninvolving a sole proprietorship, S-corporation, partnership, or a farm.\n  Advocates of tax increases now claim that only 2 percent of small \nbusinesses are impacted by the top rates.\n  I would like to address their criticism that a very small percentage \nof all small businesses are affected by the top brackets.\n  This statistic merely states the obvious. Only about 2 percent of all \ntaxpayers have incomes above $200,000 per year, so it is not surprising \nthat the distribution of small business owners follows roughly the same \npattern.\n  Let's consider the impact of this tax increase on small business.\n  A soon-to-be-released study by the Tax Foundation concludes that most \nhigh-income taxpayers are active business owners rather than \n``passive'' investors.\n  The Tax Foundation study combines IRS data with demographic Census \ndata, and finds that high-income taxpayers are mostly in ``active'' \nbusiness occupations--such as construction, manufacturing, and retail \ntrade--rather than in passive occupations such as banking, finance, and \nsecurities.\n  What is significant about the Tax Foundation report is that, overall, \nabout 74 percent of those hit by the highest marginal rate have active \nbusiness activity.\n  This business activity comes in three basic forms: Schedule C, for \nsole proprietorships; Schedule E, for S-corporations, royalties, and \npartnerships; and Schedule F, farm income. The most common of these are \nSchedule E.\n  Of those taxpayers hit by the 35 percent rate, nearly two-thirds--\n62.7 percent--have Schedule E income from an S-corporation, royalty, or \npartnership.\n\n[[Page S6965]]\n\n  It is likely that most of these taxpayers are shareholders in S-\ncorporations.\n  The Tax Foundation data shows that these high-income taxpayers \nreceive about 37 percent of their overall income from salaries and \nwages which, when combined with their Schedule C, E, and F income, \nwould bring their total amount of business income to 65 percent of \ntheir total adjusted gross income.\n  This figure does not include other ways in which a business owner may \ntake profits out of the firm.\n  For example, an entrepreneur who capitalized his business with a \nloan, may receive regular interest in return.\n  Taxable interest and dividends account for roughly 9 percent of the \noverall income for high-income taxpayers.\n  While most of this interest and dividend income is likely from \ntraditional investments, a portion could be ``business income'' taken \nas interest or dividends from their small business.\n  The Tax Foundation was able to isolate the occupations and industries \nthat these high-income individuals are engaged in. They did this by \ncombining IRS data with demographic Census data.\n  They found that high-income taxpayers are engaged in a wide variety \nof active business industries and occupations throughout the economy.\n  The largest single category of 31.5 percent is ``executive, \nadministration & managerial''--the most likely category that the \npresident or CEO of a firm would choose.\n  By contrast, physicians, lawyers, and judges comprise just 11.4 \npercent of these individuals.\n  Another analysis shows that high-income taxpayers are engaged across \nall industries.\n  The one category in which passive investors would most likely be \nfound is within the ``securities, brokerage, and investment \ncompanies.'' But only about 4 percent of high-income taxpayers are \nfound in this industry.\n  By contrast, 4.9 percent of these taxpayers are found in the \nconstruction industry, 8.1 percent are in manufacture durable goods, 5 \npercent are in retail trades, and 6 percent are in business services \nsuch as computers and data processing.\n  High-income taxpayers engaged in legal services comprise just 3.2 \npercent of these high-income taxpayers.\n  The data clearly shows that a very large proportion of high-income \ntaxpayers are engaged in some form of active business operation--not \nclipping coupons and resting back in their rocking chairs smoking their \ncigars, the image of a lot of rich people.\n  The only conclusion from these findings is that raising taxes on \nthese high-income taxpayers would ripple through every industry, not \njust passive investors.\n  And as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce says in their letter, it will \nkill job growth in small businesses.\n  The 1997 economic census--the most recent available--shows that S-\ncorps, proprietorships, and partnerships employed over 30 million \npeople that year.\n  It seems unlikely that 30 million jobs cold be created by ``shell'' \ncompanies owned by passive investors.\n  The stakes of this debate are high because there has been an \nexplosion of individual-owned businesses over the past two decades.\n  Between 1980 and 2000, for example, the total number of sole \nproprietorships, partnerships, and S-corporations more than doubled, \nfrom 10.8 million in 1980 to 22.8 million in 2000.\n  S-corps alone grew 424 percent, from 545,389 in 1980, to 2.86 million \nin 2000, and now far exceed the number of conventional C-corporations.\n  This year, the IRS estimates that nearly 58 percent of all corporate \ntax returns will be S corporation returns. If you are prepared to vote \nfor a tax increase on small business job growth, then Members should \nvote for the amendment before the Senate by the Senator from Delaware. \nIf Members care about sustaining the job growth that we have \nexperienced over the past several months, I urge Members not to vote \nagainst that growth by increasing taxes on the important small business \nsector.\n  There is also another problem with the bill. Senator Biden would have \nMembers believe the world is filled with wealthy, passive investors. \nThe truth is, however, that people continually move in and out of high \ntax rate categories, most likely because they have sold a business or a \nmajor asset.\n  The IRS recently released a study of 400 of the highest individual \nincome tax returns for the years 1990 through 2000. That study shows \nless than 25 percent of those returns appeared in the top 400 more than \nonce and less than 13 percent appeared more than twice, which shows \nhigh-income people are not high income through their livee.\n  I could add that low-income people are not always low income \nthroughout their lives because we have a dynamic society, a dynamic \neconomy. Some people improve their lot and some people do not improve \ntheir lot. Some people end up in a lower level.\n  What does this mean? The top taxpayers are not a fixed group of \npeople. People move in and out of this group according to economic \nfluctuations or maybe because of major events. So we are probably \nlooking at a large number of business owners who are selling their \nbusinesses or selling their farm. If members think they are voting for \na tax increase on a class of idle rich, think again. These are not \ncoupon-clipping people who get their money, smoke their cigars, and \nlean back in their rocking chairs. These are people that create jobs, \nprobably never retire, keeping that small business going by reinvesting \ntheir earnings.\n  If Members vote for this amendment, I am not sure they will know \nwhose taxes they are increasing.\n  How much time remains on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time in opposition is expired.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 6 minutes 18 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. REID.

We have been \nin discussions with the Democratic leadership and the chairman and the \nranking member as to how we can complete action on the bill. I think we \nare underway, although we have a number of amendments pending, a lot of \namendments planned for tomorrow and Monday. After discussion with the \nDemocratic leadership, we are prepared to vitiate cloture in large part \nbecause of the progress we made yesterday and today, and we will \ncontinue to make tomorrow and Monday.\n  Members have talked to the managers of the bill about amendments \ntomorrow as well as Monday. They have a good outline. We would, \ntherefore, not vote tomorrow. We have one more vote tonight. So we \nwould not vote tomorrow.\n  Monday has to be a very productive day and, in all likelihood, we \nwould have a series of votes beginning late Monday afternoon, sometime \nafter 5 o'clock. We can talk about the specific time. But there are \nlikely to be four or five or even six rollcall votes on Monday, \nstarting after 5 o'clock, probably 5:30 or so. The exact time will be \nannounced tomorrow.\n  We will have a busy day Tuesday as well, as we consider the remaining \namendments. It is my personal hope--as long as we continue working \ntogether very aggressively--to complete the bill on Tuesday, \nunderstanding we have a lot of work to do. Thus, the proposal would be \nto have one more rollcall vote, which will be shortly, no more rollcall \nvotes tonight, no votes tomorrow, and starting at about 5 or 5:30 on \nMonday, a series of rollcall votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The managers, together with our distinguished colleague \nfrom Nevada, would like to do the following to accommodate Senators on \nboth sides: The Senator from Missouri would introduce an amendment, lay \nit down, and speak maybe 1 minute to it. We then would turn to the \nother side. The Senator from New York wishes to address the Senate for \nseveral minutes and then we will come back over to Senator Talent, who \nwishes to speak with Senator Clinton. They will each have a couple of \nminutes. Then Senator Brownback will lay an amendment down and Senator \nDorgan may or may not speak to it, but there will be no more votes, of \ncourse, tonight.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Then we will clear those amendments after all of that?\n  Mr. WARNER. No, we might stop midway and clear the amendments.

Mr. President, I have a question for the manager of the \nbill. I will have a second-degree amendment to the Brownback amendment \nwhich I will also lay down after his.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is fine. I am not seeking unanimous consent. I am \njust trying, in a gentlemanly way, to organize this.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Nevada wishes to speak?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, can we just do this one step at a time, \nbefore we agree to any amendment? If there is going to be a second-\ndegree amendment as part of a unanimous consent, I think we better \nwithhold that piece. We didn't realize there was going to be a second-\ndegree amendment. Is it to the Brownback amendment? If this is in the \nform of a unanimous consent request, we can't at this moment agree to \nit.\n  Mr. WARNER. It is not in the form of a unanimous consent.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could address remarks to the Chair? We \nhave a number of Senators who have been waiting. The two managers have \ncleared 18 amendments, or something like that. It would take just a \nmatter of a minute or two to do that, but they are not yet ready.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the leader.

and\n       (B) the Institute has virtually no personal monitoring data \n     for Mallinkrodt workers prior to 1948.\n       (7) The National Institute of Occupational Safety and \n     Health has informed claimants and their survivors at those 3 \n     Mallinkrodt sites that if they are not interviewed as a part \n     of the dose reconstruction process, it--\n       (A) would hinder the ability of the Institute to conduct \n     dose reconstruction for the claimant; and\n       (B) may result in a dose reconstruction that incompletely \n     or inaccurately estimates the radiation dose to which the \n     energy employee named in the claim had been exposed.\n       (8) Energy workers at the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant (also \n     known as the Burlington Atomic Energy Commission Plant and \n     the Iowa Ordnance Plant) between 1947 and 1975 were exposed \n     to levels of radionuclides and radioactive material, \n     including enriched uranium, plutonium, tritium, and depleted \n     uranium, in addition to beryllium and photon radiation, that \n     are greater than the current maximum Federal standards for \n     exposure.\n       (9) According to the National Institute of Occupational \n     Safety and Health--\n       (A) between 1947 and 1975, no records, including bioassays \n     or air samples, have been located that indicate any \n     monitoring occurred of internal doses of radiation to which \n     workers described in paragraph (8) were exposed;\n       (B) between 1947 and 1955, no records, including dosimetry \n     badges, have been located to indicate that any monitoring \n     occurred of the external doses of radiation to which such \n     workers were exposed;\n       (C) between 1955 and 1962, records indicate that only 8 to \n     23 workers in a workforce of over 1,000 were monitored for \n     external radiation doses; and\n       (D) between 1970 and 1975, the high point of screening at \n     the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant, only 25 percent of the \n     workforce was screened for exposure to external radiation.\n       (10) The Department of Health and Human Services published \n     the first notice of proposed rulemaking concerning the \n     Special Exposure Cohort on June 25, 2002, and as of May 13, \n     2004, the rule has yet to be finalized.\n       (11) Many of those former workers have died while waiting \n     for the proposed rule to be finalized, including some \n     claimants who were waiting for dose reconstruction to be \n     completed.\n       (12) Because of the aforementioned reasons, including the \n     serious lack of records and the death of many potential \n     claimants, it is not feasible to conduct valid dose \n     reconstructions for the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant facility \n     or the Mallinkrodt facilities.\n       (b) Inclusion of Certain Former Workers in Cohort.--Section \n     3621(14) of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness \n     Compensation Program Act of 2000 (title XXXVI of the Floyd D. \n     Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n     2001 (as enacted into law by Public Law 106-398);

and\n       (B) the Institute has virtually no personal monitoring data \n     for Mallinkrodt workers prior to 1948.\n       (7) The National Institute of Occupational Safety and \n     Health has informed claimants and their survivors at those 3 \n     Mallinkrodt sites that if they are not interviewed as a part \n     of the dose reconstruction process, it--\n       (A) would hinder the ability of the Institute to conduct \n     dose reconstruction for the claimant; and\n       (B) may result in a dose reconstruction that incompletely \n     or inaccurately estimates the radiation dose to which the \n     energy employee named in the claim had been exposed.\n       (8) Energy workers at the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant (also \n     known as the Burlington Atomic Energy Commission Plant and \n     the Iowa Ordnance Plant) between 1947 and 1975 were exposed \n     to levels of radionuclides and radioactive material, \n     including enriched uranium, plutonium, tritium, and depleted \n     uranium, in addition to beryllium and photon radiation, that \n     are greater than the current maximum Federal standards for \n     exposure.\n       (9) According to the National Institute of Occupational \n     Safety and Health--\n       (A) between 1947 and 1975, no records, including bioassays \n     or air samples, have been located that indicate any \n     monitoring occurred of internal doses of radiation to which \n     workers described in paragraph (8) were exposed;\n       (B) between 1947 and 1955, no records, including dosimetry \n     badges, have been located to indicate that any monitoring \n     occurred of the external doses of radiation to which such \n     workers were exposed;\n       (C) between 1955 and 1962, records indicate that only 8 to \n     23 workers in a workforce of over 1,000 were monitored for \n     external radiation doses; and\n       (D) between 1970 and 1975, the high point of screening at \n     the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant, only 25 percent of the \n     workforce was screened for exposure to external radiation.\n       (10) The Department of Health and Human Services published \n     the first notice of proposed rulemaking concerning the \n     Special Exposure Cohort on June 25, 2002, and the final rule \n     published on May 26, 2004.\n       (11) Many of those former workers have died while waiting \n     for the proposed rule to be finalized, including some \n     claimants who were waiting for dose reconstruction to be \n     completed.\n       (12) Because of the aforementioned reasons, including the \n     serious lack of records and the death of many potential \n     claimants, it is not feasible to conduct valid dose \n     reconstructions for the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant facility \n     or the Mallinkrodt facilities.\n       (b) Inclusion of Certain Former Workers in Cohort.--Section \n     3621(14) of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness \n     Compensation Program Act of 2000 (title XXXVI of the Floyd D. \n     Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n     2001 (as enacted into law by Public Law 106-398);

The \nchairman and ranking member of the Armed Services Committee have done a \nsuperb job in moving this bill forward, and as I commented a couple of \nhours ago on the floor, we made real progress over the last 48 hours. \nWe will maintain that momentum and that effort over the course of \ntomorrow's session.\n  As I stated, I vitiated the scheduled cloture vote in anticipation of \nfurther cooperation and with the view of finishing the bill on Tuesday. \nI also stated earlier that we would not have rollcall votes tomorrow, \nalthough a number of Senators have expressed an interest in offering \ntheir amendments, and a number have said they still want to offer an \namendment. If that is the case, I ask that they contact the managers so \nthat we can proceed in that fashion tomorrow.\n  The next votes will occur Monday at approximately 5:30, and there \nwill likely be a number of votes after 5:30 on Monday night, given that \nwe will be voting on some of the amendments considered tomorrow as well \nas Monday during the day.\n  Finally, as a reminder, the resolution we just adopted moments ago \nprovides for the official photograph of the Senate to occur on Tuesday, \nJune 22. Members are asked to be at their desk at 2:15 sharp that day \nfor this photograph.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/17/senate-section/article/S6969-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6969]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S6969]]\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.

The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. I promise I will speak very briefly. We discussed this \namendment at great length today. This is an amendment designed to take \ncare of and put in a special employee cohort, workers in some very \ndirty nuclear bomb plants in Iowa and Missouri, back in the 1940s and \n1950s. At the request of the managers, we added a number of conditions \nto it. We worked through the authorizations, and the funding of it is \nby authorization. I believe we have worked that out.\n  I think the amendment will be set aside. If anybody is really \ninterested in it we will be happy to refer them to the Congressional \nRecord, and at the appropriate time we will come back and restate why \nthis is so important. It is relatively inexpensive--$180 million over \n10 years.

Mr. President, I rise to address amendment No. \n3279 to the pending bill. This amendment asks the administration to \nreport on any relationships between foreign governments or groups \noperating within their territories and foreign terrorist organizations \nin Colombia. It also asks the administration to describe United States \npolicies that are designed to address such relationships.\n  This amendment, tragically, is extremely timely in light of today's \nnews. This morning's Miami Herald reported that in Little River, \nColombia, in the province of Norte de Santander, over 30 peasants were \nmurdered in cold blood. Terrorists entered their residencies and shot \nthem to death with automatic weapons. The FARC is suspected to have \ncommitted this crime. While Colombia, with tremendous support of the \nU.S., has made great strides in fighting narcoterrorism under President \nUribe, there is still much work to be done, as is underscored by \nyesterday's events.\n  The FARC and the ELN, Colombia's two main rebel groups, both of which \nhave been designated by the United States as foreign terrorist \norganizations, continue to conduct terrorist attacks against civilians \nin their campaign against the Colombian government. These groups are \nalso heavily involved in the drug trade that does so\n\n[[Page S6978]]\n\nmuch harm to Colombia and to our own country. At a time when Colombia \nis making slow but steady gains in its long struggle against the FARC, \nthe last thing it needs is to have neighboring countries providing \nassistance to these brutal adversaries.\n  To be perfectly blunt, my primary concern is with Venezuela. On my \nvisit to Colombia and Venezuela in April, I heard some disturbing \naccounts from various U.S. officials of instances in which the FARC had \nbeen able to cross the line into Venezuela and conduct operations from \nthat side of the border from virtual safe havens. Colombian authorities \nare also suspicious that the Chavez government has been willing to, at \na minimum, look the other way while FARC elements operate in Venezuela, \nif not actually permitting some level of coordination.\n  Threatening to compound the ``safe haven'' problem for the United \nStates and Colombia is the fact that Venezuela also harbors a potent \nmarket in false documentation, such as passports and other identity \ncards. I am increasingly concerned at the ease with which, simply by \nbuying off officials for $800 or $900, one can acquire fully \nlegitimate, yet false, documents in Venezuela--everything from a \npassport to a driver's license. I am certainly concerned that \ninternational terrorist groups will discover their ability to acquire \nand make use of forged Venezuela documents to conduct terrorist \nattacks, and I raised these important issues with Venezuelan officials \nduring my visit.\n  Naturallly, the Venezuelan government disputes these serious \nallegations. What this amendment would do is help us establish the \nfacts. If groups in Colombia that our government has designated as \nforeign terrorist organizations are receiving support or assistance \nfrom Venezuela, or any of Colombia's other neighbors, or any other \nstate for that matter, we need to know about it and adjust our policies \naccordingly.\n  Right now, Colombia needs all the help it can get from its neighbors. \nIn asking the administration to report on whether terrorist groups may \nhave relationships with or be operating in neighboring countries such \nas Venezuela, perhaps we can address this problem in a more regional \ncontext and better understand what Colombia is up against.\n  I thank the chairman and ranking member and their staffs for their \nsupport.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3401\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it is my understanding that Senate amendment \nNo. 3401 is acceptable to both the chair and ranking member. This \namendment would reauthorize the Assistance to Firefighters Grant \nProgram, or the FIRE Act, for the next 6 years.\n  It is based on bipartisan legislation introduced by Senator DeWine \nand myself on May 11, 2004. The bill, S. 2411, currently has 39 co-\nsponsors, including the distinguished Chairman and Ranking Member of \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee.\n  As many of our colleagues know, the Senate approved by unanimous \nconsent the original FIRE Act as part of the Defense Authorization bill \n4 years ago. There is some precedent, then, for this amendment to the \ncurrent Defense Authorization bill, despite the fact that the \nlegislation falls under the jurisdiction of the Senate Commerce \nCommittee.\n  Unless Congress quickly reauthorizes the FIRE Act grant program, it \nwill expire at the end of the current fiscal year on September 30, \n2004. If this legislation is not quickly enacted, fire departments \nthroughout the Nation will not receive the assistance they need to \nfight fires, save lives, and protect their own.\n  I have consulted with the distinguished Chairman of the Senate \nCommerce Committee about the urgency of reauthorizing the FIRE Act \nbefore the fiscal year ends. He is fully aware of the fact that we have \nprecious few legislative days left on the Senate Calendar. Accordingly, \nhe has indicated to me his intention to hold a hearing on the \nreauthorization bill on July 8, with a markup to follow before the \nAugust recess.\n  Assuming that this schedule holds firm, my expectation is that \nlegislation passed by the Commerce Committee would take the place of \namendment No. 3401. In the event that work on the Defense Authorization \nAct is not completed this year, I am also prepared to move the FIRE Act \nreauthorization as a free-standing bill. Alternatively, should the \nCommerce Committee not act on this legislation, the Senate will have at \nleast acted to reauthorize the FIRE Act adopting amendment No. 3401.\n\n  In closing, I thank Senator McCain for his leadership on this issue, \nand his unwavering commitment over the years to advancing the cause of \nfirefighters. I also commend Chairman Warner and Senator Levin for \ntheir willingness to help the Nation's fire services on the Defense \nAuthorization bill both today and 4 years ago. Finally, I would like to \nexpress my appreciation to Senator Hollings for his wise counsel and \nstrong support for the FIRE Act initiative.\n  I yield to the distinguished Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President. I thank the Senator from Connecticut. I am \nprepared to accept this amendment based on the understanding he has \nreached with the distinguished Chairman of the Commerce Committee.\n  As Senator Dodd indicated, the Commerce Committee plans to hold a \nhearing on the FIRE Act on July 8, with a markup expected shortly \nthereafter. I look forward to working with Senators McCain, Dodd, and \nDeWine to ensure that this important legislation to help our Nation's \nfire departments is enacted into law this year.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the distinguished Chairman of the Armed Services \nand my friend from Connecticut for the opportunity to work with them to \nreauthorize this important program.\n  As Chairman of the committee of jurisdiction over the Assistance to \nFirefighters Grant Program, I am familiar with this program's success. \nThis program provides grants to local fire departments using a \ncompetitive, merit-based review process. I agree with my colleagues \nthat this program is an example of a well-run government program that \nshould be reauthorized, and am proud to be a cosponsor of S. 2411.\n  I have consented to allow Senator Dodd's amendment be added to this \nimportant legislation as a placeholder. The Senate Commerce Committee \nintends to hold a hearing on S. 2411 on July 8, 2004, and then we \nexpect to report the bill out of Committee by the August recess. It is \nmy intention that this reported version of S. 2411 be used to replace \nthe placeholder during the conference for S. 2400.\n  I thank Senators Dodd, Warner, and DeWine for their leadership on \nthis issue, and look forward to working with them to pass this \nlegislation this year.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Before the Senator from New York speaks, I wonder if I \nmight get the attention of the distinguished whip?\n  If we can have assurance, as the managers depart the floor, to do \nsome other work, that this will be the final action on this bill \ntonight?\n  Mr. REID. I will indicate, as both managers know, tomorrow Senator \nLautenberg is going to offer two amendments, Senator Durbin is going to \noffer two amendments, Senator Reed is going to offer his amendment, if \nhe so chooses, on missile defense, and I am going to offer my amendment \non current receipts.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Nevada went \nover that with me, and that strikes me as a very good day. If a \nRepublican Senator desires an amendment, we will work him or her into \nthe queue as the case may be.\n  Mr. REID. Absolutely.\n  Mr. WARNER. Then we might mention also the schedule for Monday?\n  Mr. REID. On Monday, we have Senator Levin, Senator Dayton, Senator \nByrd, and Senator Bingaman, and there may be others as the day \nprogresses.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct. These are the amendments that have been \nforthcoming on the other side of the aisle.\n  I am prepared to assist my colleagues on this side if they have \nmatters, but we are really working toward what the majority leader, in \nconsultation with\n\n[[Page S6979]]\n\nthe distinguished Democratic leader, indicates. We are going to \nconclude this bill on Tuesday.\n  Mr. REID. We will do our very best--Tuesday night or Wednesday \nmorning. But we are doing quite well.\n  Mr. WARNER. It is largely due to the tremendous cooperation on both \nsides. So we have the assurance that this will be the completion of the \nwork tonight?\n  Mr. REID. Absolutely.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the distinguished leader.\n  Mr. REID. There will be no more votes. The Chair already announced \nthat. Can the Senator from New York be recognized for 5 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from New York \nis recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. And the Senator from Missouri wishes to speak for how \nmany minutes?\n  Mr. TALENT. I would like 5, but I probably will not use them.\n  Mr. WARNER. Five minutes to follow the Senator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield for a unanimous consent, I ask \nunanimous consent the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Conrad, be added \nas a cosponsor to amendment No. 3432, which has already been agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3163, as modified\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise to thank the chairman and ranking \nmember for the work they and their staffs have done, along with the \nSenator from Missouri and myself and our staffs, to accept an amendment \nthat addresses two issues critical to our men and women in uniform. \nFirst, through this amendment we are attempting to develop better \npolicies and information in order to track the health of soldiers and \nothers in uniform after a deployment overseas.\n  Second, we are seeking to improve the medical and dental readiness of \nour National Guard members and reservists.\n  Last month, Senator Talent and I introduced the Armed Forces \nPersonnel Medical Readiness and Tracking Act of 2004. I am delighted \nthat many of the ideas we have advocated are included in this \nlegislation because of our amendment.\n  It has been a pleasure working with my colleague on the Armed \nServices Committee, Senator Talent, and with his staff.\n  When I was First Lady, I worked to bring attention to the problems \nand symptoms that many of our veterans returning from the 1991 gulf war \nexperienced. This constellation of symptoms came to be known as the \nGulf War Syndrome.\n  During Senate Armed Services Committee hearings in February 2003, \nbefore the current Iraq war, I asked the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, \nGeneral Myers, and each of the Service Chiefs, whether they would be \nmonitoring and tracking the health of our soldiers who are deployed in \nthe gulf.\n  They assured me they would. But I am afraid that based on reports \nfrom soldiers returning from this deployment, we have not done all we \nshould to screen and track the health of our soldiers. Indeed, several \nweeks ago we had several soldiers from the 442 MP unit out of \nOrangeburg, NY, who are being treated at Fort Dix for injuries and \nsymptoms they incurred in Iraq, including headache, sleeplessness, and \nmany others.\n  We know very well our enemy stops at nothing. The use of Sarin in an \nartillery shell in Iraq last month demonstrates more than ever the need \nto have adequate information about the health of our young men and \nwomen.\n  The legislation we have championed that is being adopted seeks to \nestablish procedures to ensure that the information is systematically \ncollected so that, if soldiers return exhibiting certain symptoms, \nthere will be a base of information on which we can determine what \ncould have caused that.\n  The amendment requires the Department of Defense to develop a \ncomprehensive plan to improve medical readiness and tracking before, \nduring, and after deployment. It establishes a Joint Medical Readiness \nOversight Committee to advise the Secretary of Defense on the medical \nreadiness and health status of members of the active Reserve \ncomponents.\n  It requires compliance of the Armed Forces with medical readiness and \ntracking policies. It requires that we develop and implement the annual \nreadiness plan.\n  The committee will include DOD officials and experts in the military \nservice organizations, veterans service organizations, and civilians.\n  Finally, current law requires the information about the health of \nsoldiers returning from deployment to be collected, but it appears \nthese provisions are not being enforced. So we require audits of blood \nserum collection programs, as well as the predeployment and \npostdeployment health assessment database that DOD is supposed to \nmaintain.\n  These problems have come to light because of our many Guard and \nReserve members who have been deployed, and we are finding too many \nexamples where they don't have the requisite medical readiness and \nwhere they are not sufficiently tracked.\n  This is an effort to do what we should do--the right thing to treat \nour young men and women in uniform. I am hoping it provides a good base \nfor us to learn more about what they are supposed to do during their \ndeployment in the gulf and elsewhere around the world.\n  I thank my colleague from Missouri as well as the chairman and \nranking member for working with us and I look forward to seeing this \nimplemented to further the health of our young men and women.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I wish to say a few words on our \namendment, but before I do that, let me take a minute to compliment \nagain Senator Bond, who laid down the amendment and Senator Harkin for \ncosponsoring it, to assist former employees in Iowa and Missouri who \nwere affected because they worked in plants that produced the atomic \nmaterials from which we made the atom bombs which won the war and then \nkept us safe.\n  Because of their exposure to the radiation, they have become ill and \nthey deserve compensation. They are not getting it because of the \nconvoluted procedures that are currently in place. We simply want to \nallow them to be treated separately as already occurs with employees in \nthe four States.\n  I admire the way Senator Bond has fought like a tiger for those \nemployees. I have joined him in doing that.\n  I appreciate the work of the managers of the bill in trying to figure \nout a way to accept that amendment. I hope we can, indeed, do that. It \nis just a matter of justice for these employees.\n  I also wish to speak for a moment about the amendment which Senator \nClinton and I offered based on the legislation which we sponsored \ntogether some weeks ago. I want to return her kind words and say it has \nbeen a pleasure to work with her and her staff on a strong bipartisan \nbasis to make these changes which we think are necessary to protect the \nhealth of our men and women in the military, and also to make certain \nthey are ready to be deployed when they need to be deployed. Those are \nthe two things we are trying to do.\n  Before employees, service men and women are deployed to combat \ntheaters, we require that a blood sample be drawn from them, and after \nthey return that another blood sample be drawn from them.\n\n  The point is, it has happened too often in the past where service men \nand women coming back from active duty show signs and symptoms of \nillness, and we can't figure out what is wrong. We need baseline blood \ntests so we can tell the extent to which their blood is deviate and \ntheir health symptoms are deviating from what they were before \ndeployment. This will give us a clue as to what is wrong with them so \nwe can avoid another gulf war syndrome episode.\n  I have had vets from Missouri over several years talking to me about \nthis issue. We allow the military to do it today, particularly with \nregard to reservists and guardsmen because it is often not done because \nlocal commanders want to get them deployed and into the theater.\n  This is very important and now it will be the law. I am grateful to \nthe managers of the amendment for accepting that part of the amendment.\n\n[[Page S6980]]\n\n  The other point is to simply improve the health of our Active and \nReserve component service men and women. We put in place a joint \ncommittee to oversee the medical tracking system that is supposed to be \nin place but isn't implemented as well as it should be.\n  We require that reservists receive detailed health assessments at \nleast every 2 years. Right now they only get exams every 5 years.\n  We require routine health baselines for all our recruits entering the \narmed services so we will know the health status of people when they \nenter the military.\n  There are a number of other good measures as well.\n  I only have 5 minutes. I imagine I have used most of that.\n  Let us say it has been a pleasure to work with the Senator from New \nYork and her staff. We are jointly grateful to the Senator from \nVirginia and the Senator from Michigan for their openness on this \namendment, and we are pleased that it was agreed to and look forward to \nholding it through the rest of the process.\n  I yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3235\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Brownback] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3235.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To increase the penalties for violations by television and \nradio broadcasters of the prohibitions against transmission of obscene, \n                    indecent, and profane language)\n\n       On page 280, after line 22, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. BROADCAST DECENCY ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2004.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the \n     ``Broadcast Decency Enforcement Act of 2004''.\n       (b) Increase in Penalties for Obscene, Indecent, and \n     Profane Broadcasts.--Section 503(b)(2) of the Communications \n     Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 503(b)(2)) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating subparagraphs (C) and (D) as \n     subparagraphs (D) and (E), respectively;\n       (2) by inserting after subparagraph (B) the following new \n     subparagraph:\n       ``(C) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), if the violator \n     is--\n       ``(i)(I) a broadcast station licensee or permittee; or\n       ``(II) an applicant for any broadcast license, permit, \n     certificate, or other instrument or authorization issued by \n     the Commission; and\n       ``(ii) determined by the Commission under paragraph (1) to \n     have broadcast obscene, indecent, or profane language, the \n     amount of any forfeiture penalty determined under this \n     subsection shall not exceed $275,000 for each violation or \n     each day of a continuing violation, except that the amount \n     assessed for any continuing violation shall not exceed a \n     total of $3,000,000 for any single act or failure to act.''; \n     and\n       (3) in subparagraph (D), as redesignated by paragraph (1), \n     by striking ``subparagraph (A) or (B)'' and inserting \n     ``subparagraph (A), (B), or (C)''.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, on this amendment, I am being joined by \nSenator Lieberman and Senator Zell Miller.\n  It is a simple issue. I want to take a few minutes to explain it. I \nam hopeful we will get strong support in this body as in the House. A \nsimilar bill came up earlier in the House and it passed that body 391 \nto 22. The same issue passed the Commerce Committee in the Senate 14 to \n0 on a recorded vote.\n  It is an issue of fines and decency on over-the-air broadcasts--\nwhether it be radio or television.\n  I think it is important to put my comments in context today by \nexplaining the policy history of this issue; that is, decency on over-\nthe-air public airwaves.\n  At the invention of television, our Nation established a public \npolicy of providing citizens with free over-the-air television. It gave \nbroadcasters wishing to provide that service with the use of valuable \nspectrum. Not everyone can broadcast over the Nation's public airwaves. \nThese are airwaves owned by the public. That is why the statute \nrequires the Federal Communications Commission to evaluate not just the \nability but the character of an entity to operate.\n  When handing out a broadcast license, in return for a license, each \nbroadcaster agrees not to air indecent or obscene content between the \nhours of 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. The broadcaster gets a valuable piece of \nspectrum, which is public property. The broadcaster gets the right to \nuse that. In exchange, one of the requirements is they not broadcast \nindecent or obscene content between the hours of 6 a.m. and 10 p.m.\n  Fines and license revocations have always been the discipline tool \navailable to the FCC to help enforce America's longstanding commitment \nto broadcast decency.\n  This is an issue about license. It is an issue about the use of \npublic property, and some modest limitation of that.\n  We live in a nation where we hold the first amendment in high regard, \nas well we should. In an effort to maintain the free exchange of \ninformation, thoughts, and opinions, we strive to avoid government \ninvolvement in communications content.\n  At the same time, as a nation, we strive to project decency and \njustice for all. As a nation raising children, we do the same. With the \nturning of a tuning knob, or the click of a remote, minors all across \nAmerica are presented with the content of the public airwaves.\n  Broadcasters have a legal and a moral duty to ensure that American \ntaxpayers--and especially children--are not assaulted by explicit \nmaterial.\n  For years, we have been asking and waiting for the broadcasters to \npolice themselves in this effort. Unfortunately, instead of fulfilling \nthe public interest duty, they have allowed the content to grow \nsteadily worse and worse.\n  Meanwhile, the companies that own the broadcast stations have grown \nsteadily larger--and not surprisingly. Some of these broadcasters' \nprofit margins have made them immune to the FCC's current fine \nstructure. Let me give you an example.\n  Today's maximum fine for an indecent broadcast is $27,500. That seems \nlike a lot of money--and it is to some. But it isn't to others. Compare \nthat fact to a 30-second commercial during the 2004 Super Bowl which \ncost advertisers an average of $2.3 million for a 30-second ad.\n\n  In the words of the FCC Commissioner, Michael Powell, these fines are \npeanuts to the big media conglomerates. That is why we are here to \nincrease the fine structure for indecency and obscene broadcasts. The \nthreat of these fines will be taken seriously and force broadcasters to \nprotect their consumers from explicit content.\n  Nothing in this amendment forges any new ground in broadcast decency \nlaw. The intent is simple: To increase the fines for indecent \nbroadcasts to mask the realities of today's media markets. This \namendment would increase the maximum fines tenfold, from $27,500 to \n$270,000, with a maximum $3 million cap per incident per day.\n  Why do we need to do this? We need this amendment to end the growing \nvolume of graphic content on free over-the-air broadcasts. Remember, \nbroadcasters profit from exclusive and free use of the public airwaves \nwhich gives them unique access to all Americans, particularly America's \nyouth. With that access to our country's intellectual, moral, and \nsocial development comes a set of moral and social responsibilities and \nobligations that are agreed to in the licensing process.\n  I am very disappointed by the apparent confusion the broadcasters are \nhaving between the right to do something and the right thing to do when \nit comes to the public airwaves.\n  Recently, FOX and VIACOM announced they were going to appeal the FCC \nBono ruling so they can use the ``F'' word on broadcast television. \nThis is their response in spite of the fact that the FCC overturned the \noriginal rule in response to a fierce public outcry.\n  This hostile response the public is getting from broadcasters is \ninexcusable. We see time and again media leaders defending their \nprofit-driven\n\n[[Page S6981]]\n\nmotives by airing explicit content and then falsely hiding behind their \nso-called first amendment rights. Broadcasters have joined the shock \njocks of the country to shout down those who publicly question harmful \ncontent as an anti-first-amendment censor. In abandoning their duty to \nadhere to decency standards, broadcasters point to the absence of \ndecency regulations on cable television. This is just a red herring. We \nare talking about public airwaves and a public right to air decent \nmaterial.\n  The broadcasters argue they have a right to air indecent, obscene, \nand profane material. But that is a disgraceful abuse of the first \namendment. I support the first amendment and its guarantees of free \nspeech. It is the basis of much of the freedoms we enjoy in our great \ndemocracy. But there are limits, and particularly here, where we are \ndealing with a public license and the use of public property where the \nlicensee has agreed to not broadcast indecent material.\n  This principle has been affirmed by the Supreme Court of the United \nStates in the famous Pacifica case where it was upheld that the \nGovernment had the right to protect the public airwaves. This case came \nto the Court in the early 1970s when George Carlin's famous ``filthy \nwords monologue'' was broadcast during the middle of the day on a New \nYork radio station owned by Pacifica Foundation. A father driving with \nhis son heard the broadcast and complained to the FCC. The FCC said \nthat if those kinds of words were used again, the radio station airing \nthem would be fined. Just like today, the broadcasters challenged the \nruling and the case went all the way to the Supreme Court. The Court \nupheld the FCC action and added that it could continue to fine \nbroadcasters in the future because broadcasters had to take special \ncare not to air material that would offend or shock children.\n\n  The majority opinion stressed that of all the forms of communication, \nbroadcasting has the most limited first amendment protection because it \nextends into the privacy of the home and is uniquely accessible to \nchildren.\n  The FCC has been too lax for too long enforcing the law on \nbroadcasters. A recent public outcry has been a wake-up call for the \nFCC. The Commission told us they do not have all the tools they need \nfor effective enforcement. That is why we are here today.\n  Passing this legislation will tell the broadcasters that we are \nserious about protecting our airwaves and we will give the FCC updated \ntools to get the job done. I don't know if I need to remind my \ncolleagues that this came to the forefront at this year's Super Bowl, \nan event families across the country watch together. At the halftime \nshow, the incident between Justin Timberlake and Janet Jackson set off \na firestorm that had been brewing for a long period of time.\n  Finally people said: Look, I have had enough; I don't want to see \nthis any more, particularly when I am watching TV with my family. That \nis what launched this forward.\n  We have been waiting for years for the broadcasters to voluntarily \ntake care of this growing problem. They have failed. Instead, they are \nfighting tooth and nail for the availability to air graphic material so \nthey can increase their profit margins.\n  America deserves better. That is why we need to make the consequences \nof broadcasting indecency punitive so the standards are no longer \nignored.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment. Increasing the fines \nwill help clean up our Nation's free, over-the-air television and radio \nby holding accountable broadcasters who use the public airwaves and \nindividuals who use the opportunity of a live performance to gain \nnotoriety through indecent acts.\n  As I noted previously, this has been considered by the Senate \nCommerce Committee and it has passed unanimously in that committee. It \nhas been considered previously by the House of Representatives, which \nhas voted 391 in favor with only 22 against increasing these fines. \nThey actually have some teeth in today's marketplace. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote for this amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays when we vote on this Monday. I further \nask unanimous consent that when we go back to this amendment on Monday \nthat I be recognized first to speak if there are any further amendments \nthat are proposed to this that are to be considered on Monday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator has requested the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I have been informed that we need \ncolleagues on the other side to respond to yeas and nays and I will not \nask for that until we do get that agreement from my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I send to the desk a second-degree \namendment to the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Burns], for himself and Mr. \n     Ensign, proposes an amendment numbered 3457 to amendment No. \n     3235.\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the end of the amendment, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . ADDITIONAL FACTORS IN INDECENCY PENALTIES; \n                   EXCEPTION.\n\n       Section 503(b)(2) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 \n     U.S.C. 503(b)(2)), as amended by section 102 of this Act, is \n     further amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(F) In the case of a violation in which the violator is \n     determined by the Commission under paragraph (1) to have \n     uttered obscene, indecent, or profane material, the \n     Commission shall take into account, in addition to the \n     matters described in subparagraph (E), the following factors \n     with respect to the degree of culpability of the violator:\n       ``(i) Whether the material uttered by the violator was live \n     or recorded, scripted or unscripted.\n       ``(ii) Whether the violator had a reasonable opportunity to \n     review recorded or scripted programming or had a reasonable \n     basis to believe live or unscripted programming would contain \n     obscene, indecent, or profane material.\n       ``(iii) If the violator originated live or unscripted \n     programming, whether a time delay blocking mechanism was \n     implemented for the programming.\n       ``(iv) The size of the viewing or listening audience of the \n     programming.\n       ``(v) The size of the market.\n       ``(vi) Whether the violation occurred during a children's \n     television program (as such term is used in the Children's \n     Television Programming Policy referenced in section \n     73.4050(c) of the Commission's regulations (47 C.F.R. \n     73.4050(c)) or during a television program rated TVY, TVY7, \n     TVY7FV, or TVG under the TV Parental Guidelines as such \n     ratings were approved by the Commission in implementation of \n     section 551 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Video \n     Programming Ratings, Report and Order, (CS Docket No. 97-55, \n     13 F.C.C.

This is a friendly second-degree amendment. We have talked \nabout and, of course, we know that the bill that has been voted out of \nthe committee and is waiting for floor action moves this along.\n  We were all shocked and dismayed over the spectacle at the Super Bowl \nthis year. Those responsible should be severely punished for such a \nvulgar display of tastelessness.\n  That being said, this high-profile, well-publicized incident could \nprompt\n\n[[Page S6982]]\n\nCongress to go too far. In some areas of this bill, we did go too far. \nThis second-degree amendment fixes that.\n  While I fully support the underlying Brownback legislation, I am \noffering this second-degree amendment to protect the interests of small \nbroadcasters that should not be punished for the events outside of \ntheir control.\n  I am sorry I did not see the halftime show during the Super Bowl. I \nsaw who it was going to be. It was put on by MTV, which I never watch, \nfor very good reason. It ought to be a pay channel. I moved over to the \npoker tournament on ESPN, so I missed the whole spectacle. But, \nnonetheless, lots of families did not.\n\n  In the case of the Super Bowl, for example, many affiliates were \nfurious their viewership was exposed to such a spectacle. The amendment \nI offer simply calls on the FCC to consider the size and revenues of \nthe stations in question, as well as whether they had anything to do \nwith producing the offensive content in question. In other words, we \nhave small market television stations that have no control on content \nbut may find themselves in a lawsuit for indecent content that might be \nbroadcast.\n  Finally, I believe, as we approach these issues, we must take a hard \nlook at the declining standards across all media. I understand there \nhave been industry efforts to develop indecency guidelines that will \napply fairly and evenly across all media platforms that distribute \ncontent. I think this approach could prove enormously beneficial in \nsetting unified standards so individual broadcasters understand what is \nexpected of them. Additional clarity in terms of content standards \nwould also eliminate excuses among those who choose to push the \nenvelope, the limits of vulgarity for commercial gain.\n  Nothing in the broadcast industry has been talked about so much as \nthe halftime at this year's Super Bowl. It has absolutely been on the \nminds of broadcasters across this country.\n  The American people clearly expect Congress to act on the indecency \nissue. So I call on my colleagues to adopt this second-degree amendment \nI have offered, which will help to produce real solutions without \nunduly penalizing small broadcasters.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, in speaking to the Burns second-degree \namendment, this is an amendment that was considered in the Commerce \nCommittee and added to the base bill at that time. What he is proposing \nto do makes a lot of sense. I do not see a problem with that at all, so \nI would be supportive of doing that.\n  Overall, we want to get this to move it forward. The House has moved \non this action. The FCC is seeking this authority. So we really want to \ntry to get this to move on through the process, if at all possible. We \nare not having further rollcall votes until Monday, so we will proceed \nat that time, and I will ask for a rollcall vote then.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, earlier today the Senate adopted the Murray \namendment No. 3427, to facilitate the availability of childcare for the \nchildren of members of the Armed Forces on active duty in connection \nwith Operation Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom.\n  I support that amendment but wanted to additionally acknowledge \nefforts that are already underway in the private sector to help support \nthose who are risking their lives to keep us safe.\n  I would like to speak about the American spirit. We are a people who \ncan do great things when united. We have witnessed this in recent \nmonths with dozens of home-front stories of the many great deeds of \nAmericans in support of our troops and our Nation's efforts abroad in \nthe war on terror.\n  There is Spirit of America, a private group which set out to raise \n$100,000 to build TV stations in Iraq. Americans responded with \nthousands of donations totaling $1.52 million. Federal Express donated \nthe domestic shipping costs of the equipment for this gift to the \ncountry of Iraq. Those stations are being built now and will offer the \nIraqi people a national and independent news source that is not Al-\nJazeera. This is great.\n  This American spirit is also responsible for the gift of 10,000 \nschool supply kits, 3 tons of medical supplies, and 2 tons of \n`friendship' Frisbees to the Iraqi people, all paid for and donated by \nAmericans.\n  You hear about American students donating books to Iraqi schools and \nsending letters to Iraqi children.\n  And now, thousands of childcare providers have united across the \ncountry to donate childcare services to National Guard and Reserve \nmembers home on 2 week R leave from Iraq and Afghanistan to allow \nthem to carry out personal business, take their spouses out on a date, \nor enjoy other recreational activities while they are home.\n  Operation Childcare is an effort of the Nation's network of childcare \nresource and referral, NACCRRA, their local agencies, and thousands of \nchildcare providers across the country to give back to those men and \nwomen who are fighting to keep us safe. This program was designed for \nthose members of the military who do not live near military bases and \ntherefore do not have access to family support programs provided to \nActive-Duty personnel.\n\n  So far, over 4,700 centers and individual providers have signed on to \nOperation Childcare. In my home State of New Hampshire there are 35 \nproviders who are donating childcare to our guardsmen and reservists. \nThese numbers continue to grow, as more people hear about the program.\n  Childcare providers who volunteer their time for Operation Childcare \nwill receive official recognition, but I suspect many would agree with \none childcare provider in Tennessee who said:\n\n       You don't have to recognize me--I am just thrilled and \n     honored to be able to do something to help our troops.\n\n  NACCRRA should be applauded for their efforts in organizing this \nservice for our service members.\n  This is but a snapshot of the home-front efforts being carried out by \nthousands of Americans across this country. The American people are \ntruly united behind our men and women in uniform. This is the American \nspirit that continues to inspire.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I am pleased to put my full support behind \nan agreement made between Senators Dodd, McCain, Warner, Levin, and \nHollings to attach the Assistance to Firefighters Act of 2004, as \namendment No. 3309, to the pending Department of Defense Authorization \nbill.\n  Each day, we entrust our lives and the safety of our families, \nfriends, and neighbors to the capable hands of the brave men and women \nin our local police departments. These individuals are willing to risk \ntheir lives and safety out of a dedication to their citizens and their \ncommitment to public service.\n  We ask local firefighters to risk no less than their lives, as well, \nevery time they respond to an emergency fire alarm, a chemical spill, \nor as we saw on September 11--terrorist attacks. We ask them to risk \ntheir lives responding to the nearly 2 million reports of fire that \nthey receive on an annual basis. Every 18 seconds while responding to \nfires, we expect them to be willing to give their lives in exchange for \nthe lives of our families, neighbors, and friends. One hundred \nfirefighters lost their lives in 2002 in the line of duty, and nearly \n450 lost their lives in 2001. The unyielding commitment these \nindividuals have made to public safety surely deserves an equally \nstrong commitment from the Federal Government.\n  In 2000, Congress affirmed the value of having a properly trained, \nequipped, and staffed fire service by passing the Firefighter \nInvestment and Response Enhancement, FIRE, Act--legislation that \nSenator Dodd and I introduced, along with Congressmen Pascrell, Weldon, \nand many others, on the House side. In the 4 years since the FIRE Act \nbecame law, fire departments have made significant progress in terms of \nfilling the substantial needs outlined in the National Fire Protection \nAssociation's ``needs assessment.''\n  To date, Congress has appropriated nearly $2 billion dollars for the \nFIRE Act program. Virtually every penny of\n\n[[Page S6983]]\n\nthat amount has gone directly to local fire departments through FIRE \ngrants to provide firefighter personal protective equipment, training \nto ensure more effective firefighting practices, breathing apparatus, \nnew firefighting vehicles, emergency medical services supplies, fire \nprevention programs, and other important uses.\n  The direct nature of the FIRE Act grant program--funds literally go \nstraight from the Federal Government to local fire departments--is an \nextremely important aspect of the law, particularly in light of the \ndifficulties we are seeing with other homeland security grant programs \ngetting money to flow directly to the intended recipients.\n  FIRE Act grants are awarded based on a competitive, peer-review \nprocess that helps ensure that the most important needs are filled \nfirst and that funding will be used in an effective manner. I am proud \nto note that 86 of Ohio's 88 counties have received FIRE Act funding up \nto this point and that the fire service in my home state is much better \nprepared to respond to emergencies as a result. The bottom line is \nthis: The FIRE Act program has proven to be an extremely valuable tool \nfor fire-based first responders.\n  The time has come to reauthorize this important legislation--to build \nupon the successes of the original FIRE Act and to refine the program \nwhere improvements can be made. Amendment No. 3309, which I am offering \nalong with Senator Dodd, accomplishes just that.\n  Our amendment focuses on four central themes. First, we take steps to \nmake the grant program more accessible for fire departments serving \nsmall, rural communities and to eliminate barriers to participation \nfaced by departments serving heavily populated jurisdictions. Second, \nwe codify changes made in program administration since its transfer to \nthe recently created Department of Homeland Security. Third, the \namendment increases the emphasis within the program on life-saving \nEmergency Medical Services and technologies. And fourth, we evaluate \nthe program through a series of reports to help ensure that resources \nare targeted to the areas of greatest need. These priorities have been \ndeveloped jointly with the fire service, and represent a means to \nstrengthen the FIRE Act program for years to come.\n  Our amendment would help the FIRE Act program more accessible for \nfire departments serving the very largest and smallest jurisdictions in \nAmerica. Our experience over the past four years has been that a number \nof features in the program make participation difficult for departments \nserving these populations. Career fire departments, most of which serve \npopulations well in excess of 50,000, have been receiving only a small \npercentage of the total grants thus far. After consulting with the fire \nservice organizations, fire chiefs in my home State of Ohio, and \nofficials administering the program at the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, we have found that there are two main reasons why this has \nbeen the case.\n  First, matching requirements for large departments, currently fixed \nat 30 percent, have been particularly difficult to meet. Second, \ncurrent law dictates that departments--whether they serve a large city, \nsuch as Cleveland and have numerous fire stations, or a small town, \nsuch as Cedarville, OH, and have only one station--are eligible for the \nexact same level of funding each year: $750,000. These two elements of \nthe current program have caused a number of large fire departments to \nforgo applying for FIRE grants. With respect to smaller, often \nvolunteer-based departments serving populations of 20,000 or less, \nbudgets are often so limited that meeting the current match is simply \nnot possible. Many of these departments struggle with even the most \nbasic needs, such as having an adequate number of staff available to \nrespond to a structure fire.\n\n  Our legislation addresses each of these problems in a simple and \nstraightforward fashion. Specifically, the amendment would reduce \nmatching requirements by one third for departments serving communities \nof 50,000, and by one half for departments serving 20,000 or fewer \nresidents in order to encourage increased participation by these \ndepartments. The amendment also would re-structure caps on grant \namounts to reflect population served, with up to $2,250,000 for \ndepartments serving one million or more, $1,500,000 for departments \nserving between 500,000 and one million, and $1,000,000 for departments \nserving fewer than 500,000 residents. Together, these two changes would \ngo a long way toward increasing the accessibility of the program for \nthe very largest and smallest departments in the United States.\n  The second major component of our legislation has to do with the \ntransfer of the FIRE Act Administration from the Federal Emergency \nManagement Administration, FEMA, to the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, DHS. When FEMA's functions were transferred into the DHS, the \nFIRE grant program, along with the U.S. Fire Administration, also were \ntransferred to DHS. As a part of that transfer, formal administration \nof the FIRE grant program has been delegated to the Department to the \nOffice of Domestic Preparedness, ODP, which oversees all DHS grant \nprograms. While the U.S. Fire Administration--the real fire experts \nwithin the Federal Government--remains involved, we need to take steps \nto formalize the management of the program following the transfer to \nDHS.\n  There are a number of reasons for solidifying program administration \nin law, chief among them being the ability of fire departments across \nour Nation to plan for the future, and the ability to ensure an ongoing \nrole for fire experts in the process. First, our amendment gives the \nSecretary of Homeland Security overall authority for the program. This \njust makes sense given the Secretary's current home within ODP. \nAdditionally, the amendment would codify in law practices currently in \nuse by ODP--peer review by experts from national fire service \norganizations, a formal role for the U.S. Fire Administration, and \ncollaborative meetings to recommend grant criteria.\n  These steps would benefit the program for years to come and would \nhelp bring stability to the increasingly mature FIRE grant program. \nPerhaps more importantly, formalizing the role of the U.S. Fire \nAdministrator and national fire service organizations would help \nresolve a fundamental tension between the mission of the FIRE Act \nprogram, to improve firefighting and EMS resources nationwide for all \nhazards, and the mission of its caretaker, ODP, to focus on terrorism \nprevention and response.\n  It makes sense for ODP, as the central clearinghouse for grant \nprograms within DHS, to manage the FIRE grant program. Equally so, it \nmakes sense to build features into the program which would help ensure \nthat the FIRE grant program will remain dedicated solely to the fire \nand Emergency Medical Services, EMS, communities and will not be \ndiluted over time into a generic terrorism-prevention program. Our \namendment carefully strikes this balance.\n  The third major focus of this amendment is on finding ways to improve \nsafety and to save lives. We do this in a number of ways. First, we \nhave teamed up with national fire service organizations to incorporate \nfirefighter safety research into the fire prevention and safety set-\naside program. This new research, supported by a 20 percent increase in \nfunds for the prevention and safety set-aside, would help reduce the \nnumber of firefighter fatalities each year and would dramatically \nimprove the health and welfare of firefighters nationwide.\n  Second, we place an increased emphasis on Emergency Medical Services. \nIn most communities, the fire department is the chief provider for all \nemergency services, including EMS. To illustrate this point, a 2002 \nNational Fire Protection Association study indicates that fire \ndepartments received more than seven times as many calls for EMS \nassistance as they did for fires. When our family members, neighbors, \nand friends need immediate medical help, we turn to EMS providers, and \nwe rely on this help to be as effective and timely as possible. It is \nour duty in structuring the FIRE grant program, then, to do everything \nwe can to give EMS squads the assistance they need to carry out this \nimportant mission.\n  Despite the overwhelming ratio of EMS calls to fire calls, the FIRE \ngrant program has not adequately reflected the importance of EMS over \nthe past few years, with about 1 percent of all grants going \nspecifically for EMS purposes. While there is no question that a\n\n[[Page S6984]]\n\nnumber of other grants have indirectly benefited EMS and that \ndepartments do invest their own money into this service, more can and \nshould be done through the FIRE Act to boost our EMS capabilities \nnationwide. To accomplish this goal, we do a number of things in the \namendment, including specifically including fire-based EMS \nprofessionals in the peer review process and allowing EMS grant \nrequests to be combined with those for equipment and training. We have \nalready seen evidence that new, combined structure is making excellent \nprogress this year in shifting a greater emphasis to EMS within the \nprogram.\n\n  Additionally, we include language to incorporate independent, \nnonprofit EMS squads into the FIRE grant program for the first time. \nWhile our work with national fire service organizations on this \nparticular provision has been productive and is ongoing, its intent is \nclear--and that is to try to bring the emphasis within the FIRE grant \nprogram on EMS closer to the level of demand in the field for this \nlife-saving service. I am pleased that we have this language in the \namendment and believe that through markup in the Commerce Committee \nnext month, and perhaps later during conference consideration of the \nunderlying bill, we can find an even better solution for increasing \nsupport for EMS.\n  Third, we create a new incentive program within the FIRE Act that \nencourages departments to invest in life-saving Automated External \nDefibrillator, AED, devices. These devices are capable of dramatically \nreducing the number one cause of firefighter death in the line of \nduty--heart attacks. Our incentive program essentially says to fire \ndepartments that if you equip each of your firefighting vehicles with a \ndefibrillator unit, we will give you a one-time discount on your \nmatching requirement. Congress has expressed, time and again, strong \nsupport for getting these devices out to communities through various \ngrant programs. It is our hope that we can maintain that commitment by \nextending support for lifesaving defibrillator technologies to fire \ndepartments across the country.\n  Fourth, we eliminate a burdensome and unintended matching requirement \nfor fire prevention grants. These grants generally go to non-profit \norganizations, such as National SAFE KIDS, to provide for fire safety \nawareness campaigns, smoke detector installations in low-income \nhousing, and other important prevention efforts. Though no match was \nrequired in the first few years of the program, a recent legal opinion \nfrom the Office of Domestic Preparedness has reversed course and \ninstituted a 10 percent match for grantees. This unanticipated \nrequirement, which is extremely difficult for nonprofits with limited \ncapital, has had a debilitating effect on the prevention program and \nneeds to be eliminated. Our legislation does just that.\n  Together, these commonsense features of our amendment would \ndramatically improve the safety of our communities, as well as the \nfirefighters who bravely serve them.\n  The fourth section of this amendment centers on a comprehensive \nreview of the FIRE grant program. This review, to be conducted in part \nby the National Fire Protection Association, and in part by the General \nAccounting Office, GAO, seeks to evaluate the program with an eye \ntoward ensuring that resources are targeted to the areas of greatest \nneed. A similar study by the National Fire Protection Association \nconducted shortly after passage of the initial FIRE Act was extremely \nhelpful as far as identifying the nature of the fire service needs. \nUltimately, this part of the amendment is about making sure that the \nbillions of taxpayer dollars authorized by this legislation are used in \nthe most responsible and effective manner possible.\n  Our amendment is a good amendment. It is comprehensive and \ncollaboratively drafted with input from fire and emergency services \nexperts from across the country. The National Safe Kids Campaign, the \nInternational Association of Fire Fighters, the International \nAssociation of Fire Chiefs, the National Volunteer Fire Council, the \nInternational Association of Arson Investigators, the International \nSociety of Fire Service Instructors, and the National Fire Protection \nAssociation, among others, all support our legislation.\n  Furthermore, the process agreed upon between Senators Dodd, McCain, \nand Warner for consideration of our amendment is a good process. \nSenator McCain, in his capacity as chairman of the Committee of \njurisdiction--the Commerce Committee--has graciously agreed to allow \nour amendment to be attached to the underlying bill, with the \nexpectation that language reported out of his committee next month will \nbe inserted in its place during conference negotiations. This \narrangement gives our legislation the best possible opportunity to pass \nthe Senate, with the added benefit of thorough deliberative \nconsideration through the committee structure. I appreciate Chairman \nMcCain's, and ranking member Hollings' willingness to take this \napproach, Senator Dodd's hard work to reach a positive resolution to \nthe matter, and Senators Warner and Levin's willingness to facilitate \nthis agreement by accepting the amendment at this time. The efforts of \nall three Senators deserve the praise of the firefighting community.\n  As was the case in 2000, the Department of Defense authorization bill \nhas become the vehicle of choice for the FIRE Act legislation. I am \noptimistic that the final result this year will be the same as it was \nthen, concluding with passage of our amendment into law. I am proud to \nintroduce this amendment with my friend and colleague from Connecticut \nand look forward to working to ensure that the Federal Government \nincreases its commitment to the men and women who make up our local \nfire departments. We owe them and their service and dedication nothing \nless than our full support.\n\n\n                  science & technology funding levels\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to engage the distinguished \nSenator from New Mexico, Senator Jeff Bingaman, concerning the \nDepartment of Defense Science and Technology--S Senator \nBingaman and I are both former members of the Senate's Committee on \nArmed Services and have a deep appreciation for the importance of the \nDepartment of Defense's S program in meeting current and future \ndefense needs.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. The Senator from Pennsylvania is correct in noting our \nstrong support for the Department's S programs. During the 106th \nCongress, I introduced an amendment--SA 199--cosponsored by Senators \nSantorum, Kennedy, and Lieberman, to S. Con. Res. 20, the Senate's \nBudget Resolution for Fiscal Year 2002, that was designed to ensure the \nlong-term national security of the United States through a robust \nDepartment of Defense S program. Additionally, during the 105th \nCongress, I introduced an amendment--SA 2999--cosponsored by Senators \nSantorum and Lieberman, to S. 2057, the Fiscal Year 1999 National \nDefense Authorization Act, articulating a sense of the Senate on the \nideal level of funding for our Department of Defense's S program.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The Senator from New Mexico is correct. He has been a \nstrong advocate for our Department of Defense S program for many \nyears. It is worth noting that together, we have succeeded in raising \nthe profile of these budget accounts and helped to influence the levels \nrequested for the S program in the annual budget request submitted by \nthis and other administrations. I also want to thank Senator Bingaman \nfor his support for my amendment--SA 182--to H. Con. Res. 83, the \nSenate's Budget Resolution for Fiscal Year 2002, which sought to \nincrease funding devoted to the Department of Defense's Basic \nResearch--6.1--account. It is by investing in these budget accounts \nthat we will reap the technology benefits that will sustain our \nmilitary edge over our adversaries.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. We also agree that by funding these vital programs at \nover 3 percent of the total Defense Department budget, we will be \ndemonstrating a commitment and leadership in an area critical to U.S. \nnational security. Past research carried out with S program funding \nhas provided the foundation for protecting U.S. military personnel and \nensuring U.S. technological superiority on the battlefield. Hand-held \ntranslators, unmanned systems, thermobaric bombs, and laser-guided and \nglobal positioning systems are just a few examples of the many \ntechnologies resulting from S investments that are used today to \nremove personnel from harm's way, enhance\n\n[[Page S6985]]\n\nbattlespace awareness, and address new threats.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Additionally, we are united in advocating continued \nsupport for these critical programs so we can meet our national \nsecurity needs of tomorrow. The Department of Defense's S program \nprovides a unique contribution to the job of equipping and protecting \nour men and women in uniform and defending America. S funding \nsupports education and training for future scientists and engineers--\nleading to technological advancements that shape defense technologies, \nincluding engineering, mathematics, and physical, computer and \nbehavorial sciences. Throughout the decades of the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s \nand 1980s, the Department of Defense and other federal agencies \nsustained their commitments to these investments in American \nuniversities. This investment can be measured by the number of systems \nrelied upon by America today to project power and maintain our \ninterests around the globe.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Furthermore, American universities offer the Department \nof Defense the laboratories and knowledge base necessary to \nsuccessfully complete this transformation objective. The Department of \nDefense has historically played a major federal role in funding basic \nresearch and has been a significant sponsor of engineering research and \ntechnology development conducted in American universities.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Senator Bingaman is correct. For over 50 years, \nDepartment of Defense investment in university research has been a \ndominant element of the Nation's research and development \ninfrastructure and an essential component of the United States capacity \nfor technological innovation.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank Senator Santorum for his observations on the \nimportance of robust Department of Defense S program funding, and I \nurge that we continue to advocate funding the S program at a level of \nat least at 3 percent of the total Department of Defense appropriation.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The Senator is correct in his statement and I too \nsupport the 3 percent S program funding goal.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to thank all \nof the dedicated Members of the Senate family who poured their hearts \ninto making President Reagan's final journey to the Nation's Capitol a \ndignified and fitting tribute.\n  Lawmakers and dignitaries from all corners of the globe, Supreme \nCourt justices, Federal officials and hundreds of thousands of citizens \nmade their way to the Rotunda last week to pay their final respects to \nour 40th President.\n  It was a solemn and stately event. Each moment radiated a sense of \nhistory. I would like to thank some of the Senate individuals whose \nhard work made last week possible: 1. Sergeant at Arms Bill Pickle; his \ndeputy, Keith Kennedy; protocol officer, Becky Daugherty; Capitol \ninformation officer, Laura Parker; and the Sergeant at Arms staff; 2. \nAlan Hantman, the architect of the Capitol, and the Capitol \nSuperintendent, Carlos Elias; 3. Terry Gainer and the Capitol Police \nwho, under extraordinary pressure, maintained security with discretion \nand consideration; 4. Emily Reynolds the Secretary of the Senate; her \ndeputy, Mary Suit Jones; and their hard working staff; 5. The Senate \nChaplain Pastor Barry C. Black whose sonorous and reflective tributes \ncaptured the public's love for President Reagan; 6. All of the \nvolunteers who handed out bereavement cards to the public, manned the \ncondolence booths, and handed out water to the thousands of visitors \nwaiting patiently to see the President; and 7. The Capitol Guide \nservice which worked round the clock.\n  My sincere thanks also go to Chairman Lott and Senator Dodd. Their \nsteady leadership over the proceedings was crucial.\n  Likewise, the President of the Senate and the President Pro Tempore \npresided over the Senate on this momentous occasion with dignity and \ndistinction.\n  I also wish to extend my thanks to my colleagues in the House of \nRepresentatives. Throughout, both chambers worked closely and patiently \nto carry out a tribute that I think all would agree properly reflected \nand celebrated President Reagan's extraordinary legacy.\n  I specifically thank: 1. The Speaker and his dedicated staff; 2. The \nHouse Sergeant at Arms and doorkeeper, Bill Livingood; 3. The House \nchief administrative officer, Jay Eagen; 4. The Clerk of the House, \nJeff Trandahl; and 5. The House Chaplain, Reverend Daniel P. Coughlin. \nHis stirring remarks are now a part of America's history.\n  Finally, to the Reagan family: Through a bleak and solemn week-long \nprocession, their love and respect for Ronald Reagan was a beacon to us \nall. The Reagan family showed an uncommon dignity and grace that raised \nus up and touched our hearts.\n  We will never forget their love. And we will never forget how Ronnie \nloved his Nancy, and how hard it was for her, even at the very last, to \nlet him go.\n  Thank you to the Reagan family. And thank you to the man who led us \nso well and loved his country so deeply--Ronald Wilson Reagan, 40th \nPresident of the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/17/senate-section/article/S6985-3", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6985]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO THE CAPITOL POLICE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today I want to take a moment to both thank \nand commend our U.S. Capitol Police for their outstanding actions \nduring the evacuation of the Capitol complex last week.\n  As we now know, the decision to evacuate was made on a moment's \nnotice when a private airplane flew into restricted airspace and could \nnot be contacted. Our Capitol Police put the lives of the people who \nwork in Congress ahead of their own. The Capitol and surrounding \nbuildings were vacated within minutes.\n  In addition to thousands of employees and Members of Congress, \nhundreds of dignitaries from around the world had come to the Capitol \nlast Wednesday to pay their respects to President Ronald Reagan. The \nCapitol Police executed the evacuation with efficiency and \nprofessionalism.\n  Fortunately, the threat proved to be a false alarm, and it was again \nthe Capitol Police who screened and helped each individual as they \nreentered the buildings.\n  Only a few weeks ago I had the honor of speaking at the re-dedication \nceremony of the Capitol Police headquarters. This would be an honor for \nany Senator, but it is especially so for me, because I served as a U.S. \nCapitol Policeman years ago.\n  The Capitol Police force has changed quite a bit over the years. It \nwas founded in 1828 with three nonuniformed watchmen. Before that, only \none guard protected the Capitol.\n  Today, more than 1,300 professionally trained men and women serve as \nCapitol Police officers. Their challenges have obviously become more \nformidable, but their main focus still lies in protecting life \nthroughout the complex of congressional buildings, parks, and streets.\n  I would like to take a moment to recognize 3 Capitol Police officers \nwho have been killed in the line of duty: Sgt. Christopher Eney was \nkilled on August 24, 1984, during a training exercise; Jacob ``J.J.'' \nChestnut was killed on July 24, 1998, while guarding his post at the \nCapitol; and John Gibson was killed on July 24, 1998, while protecting \nthe lives of visitors, staff, and the Office of the House Majority \nWhip.\n  The police headquarters building is now named in honor of these 3 \nfallen heroes. A few weeks ago, at the rededication ceremony, I had the \nopportunity to meet some of the children of these men, now grown. \nSpeaking with them reminded me of the sacrifice that these officers and \ntheir families had made.\n  Likewise, the events of last week reminded me that our U.S. Capitol \nPolice officers put their lives on the line every day, to protect all \nof us. For that we can never thank them enough.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/17/senate-section/article/S6986-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6986]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S6986]]\n                      RUSSIA'S FALTERING DEMOCRACY\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today, regretfully, to discuss the \nfaltering state of democracy in Russia. I say ``regretfully,'' because \nduring my more than 31 years in the U.S. Senate, I have consistently \nstriven to improve relations between our country and Russia.\n  For example, a few years ago, despite severe U.S. budgetary \nconstraints and significant foreign policy differences with Moscow, I \nintroduced legislation that when enacted substantially increased \nfunding for Muskie Fellowships for graduate students from Russia.\n  During my time in the Senate--which has spanned the last decade of \nBrezhnev, the brief ruling periods of Andropov and Chernenko in the \nearly 1980s, the lengthier and stormy tenures of Gorbachev and Yeltsin, \nand since 2000 the era of Vladimir Putin--I have always believed that a \nconstructive relationship with Russia is in the best interest of that \ngreat country, and is a vital national interest of the United States.\n  During the Soviet period our ties were based overwhelmingly on \nstrategic considerations. Moscow and Washington had huge, redundant \nnuclear arsenals that, if ever used, would have ``made the rubble \nbounce''--that is, would have gone a long way toward destroying life on \nthis earth as we know it.\n  The focus of our diplomacy, particularly of our arms control \nnegotiations, was to make that ultimate horror scenario impossible.\n  But we had no illusions about making the Soviet Union a genuine \npartner in anything more than in that narrow strategic sense. Whether \nor not one fully concurred with President Reagan's memorable \ndescription of the U.S.S.R. as an ``evil empire,'' no one could have \nasserted that it in any way resembled a democracy, anchored by the rule \nof law, with civil liberties and human rights for all its citizens.\n  In fact, after the signing of the Helsinki Final Act in 1975, the \nUnited States effectively utilized the so-called ``Basket Three'' of \nthat document to publicly hold the Soviet Union accountable for its \nviolations of human rights and civil liberties.\n  Great hopes for change accompanied the collapse of the Soviet Union \nat the end of 1991 and Boris Yeltsin's successor government in the \nRussian Federation. Although the lid did come off of the worst of state \nrepression, Yeltsin's tenure was marred by widespread corruption, which \ndiscredited democratic reform in the eyes of many Russians.\n  Yet Yeltsin, for all his failings, did successfully make the \ndifficult personal transition from communist to democrat. Given time, \nRussia's political system held--and still holds--the promise of \nevolving into a genuine democracy.\n  That potential, unfortunately, has not only not been utilized, it has \nbeen systematically stifled by Yeltsin's hand-picked successor, \nVladimir Putin.\n  In his 4\\1/2\\ years in power, Mr. Putin, an intelligent and street-\nsmart former agent of the KGB, has developed a system known as \n``managed democracy.'' Aside from the unintended irony of this \noxymoronic construct, in practice it is long on ``managed'' and short \non ``democracy.'' In essence, Russians are witnessing a rollback of the \ncivil liberties they enjoyed during the 1990s.\n  Both the 2003 parliamentary elections and the March 2004 presidential \nelection were described as seriously flawed by international observers.\n  The Putin government has selectively and ruthlessly utilized its \nprosecutorial powers to silence incipient rivals and thereby intimidate \nother potential opponents. The most celebrated case is that of Mikhail \nKhodorkovsky, former head of Yukos Oil, Russia's most modern, Western-\nlike private company. Mr. Khodorkovsky's principal sin appears to have \nbeen his belief that a wealthy man had the right to engage in Russian \npolitical life as a potential alternative to Putin by funding \nindependent, non-governmental organizations.\n  The imprisonment and legal proceedings against Khodorkovsky have \nviolated virtually every canon of fairness and legality. His trial on \ntax evasion charges, which opened on Wednesday in Moscow, was scheduled \nto be held in a cramped courtroom in a blatant move to restrict access \nto outside observers.\n  In a speech late in May, President Putin delivered an ominous warning \nto Russian organizations that defend democracy and human rights for \nallegedly serving ``dubious'' interests and receiving financial support \nfrom the West.\n  Putin has also used financial gimmicks to eliminate the major, \nindependent national television stations in Russia, leaving only a \nhandful with local audiences. Earlier this month the most popular and \noutspoken surviving Russian television journalist was fired.\n  As a result of this repressive media policy, Russian viewers have \nlong since been denied objective coverage of world events, especially \nof the brutal war being waged by their army in Chechnya.\n  In that context, President Bush's answer last week to a question at a \nG-8 press conference in Sea Island, GA, is disturbing. The President \nsaid that the G-8 leaders were ``united by common values.'' He went on \nto explain: ``We do agree on a free press. We don't necessarily agree \nwith everything the free press writes, but we agree on a free press.''\n  The ancient Greeks used irony as a rhetorical device by attributing a \npositive characteristic to negative reality. The Black Sea was called \n``the peaceful sea'' precisely because, in actuality, it was so stormy. \nWe moderns might call it ``the power of wishful thinking.''\n  I hope that is what President Bush was doing--subtly pushing Putin \ninto behaving like a member of the G-8 club, to which Russia now \nbelongs despite its mid-size economy, which, absent extraneous \npolitical criteria, would not qualify it for membership.\n  For although the Russian newspaper scene is still vibrant, as I have \njust described, its electronic media are anything but free. And, as in \nthe majority of other countries, most citizens of the Russian \nFederation get their news from television, not from newspapers.\n  Some observers fear a crackdown on the print medium and perhaps even \non foreign broadcaster journalists based in Russia.\n  As for supposed overall ``common values,'' the most recent report on \nRussia in ``Nations in Transit 2004,'' published by Freedom House, \nshows Russia slipping from poor to very poor during calendar year 2003 \nin 5 of 6 categories: electoral process; civil society; independent \nmedia; governance; and constitutional, legislative, and judicial \nframework. The only category in which it did not fall was corruption, \nand there it remained mired at an extremely poor level.\n  I hope, therefore, that Putin will not misconstrue President Bush's \noff-the-cuff answer in Sea Island as license to continue his own \nundemocratic domestic policies.\n  As several American commentators and newspaper editorials have \ndiscussed, Russia's inclusion in the G-8 since the late 1990s is not \nirreversible. Its economy certainly does not qualify it for membership, \nand if it persists in violating the ``common values'' to which it pays \nlip service, the United States and its democratic allies may decide to \nreturn to the G-7 format.\n  I hope it does not come to that.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/17/senate-section/article/S6986-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6986-S6987]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE CASE\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I would like to applaud the decision by \nthe Supreme Court yesterday dismissing the Pledge of Allegiance Case \nand affirming a student's right to say the pledge with the phrase ``One \nNation Under God.'' The majority decision concluded that the Court \nlacked jurisdiction over Mr. Newdow's claim of injury since Mr. Newdow \nis merely a noncustodial parent with no decision-making authority over \nhis daughter's education.\n  The Court, of course, chose to sidestep the larger issue presented by \nthe case. If you recall, Mr. President, the Ninth Circuit's stunning \ndecision was deeply troubling to many Americans when it was first \nannounced in 2000. The Ninth Circuit, unable to legally address the \nissue of relationship between the father and the daughter, simply \ndecided that Mr. Newdow had a fundamental right to have his child \nshielded in public school from religious views that differ from his \nown.\n  Never mind that such a right has not been articulated before, and \ncertainly not within the context of a noncustodial relationship, but \nmore importantly, a right of such magnitude has\n\n[[Page S6987]]\n\nbreathtaking implications for the future relationship between the \nFederal judiciary and public education. For one thing, any disenchanted \nparent similarly offended by what their children are taught in public \nschools could run to the Federal courts and clog the system with \nlitigation. Mr. Newdow's objection to the Pledge of Allegiance is that \nit supports the historical fact that this Nation was founded on a \nbelief in monotheism; the Pledge of Allegiance simply reflects that \nsingular and important fact about this Nation and about us. As a matter \nof law, injury of the kind alleged by Mr. Newdow must be direct and \npalpable. Having an unorthodox interpretation of historical fact \ncertainly does not rise to a level which would confer article III \nstanding.\n  But even if we assume that Mr. Newdow had standing, the merits of \nNewdow's case are nonexistent as Chief Justice Rhenquist, O'Connor, and \nThomas argues in their minority opinion. Recitation of the Pledge of \nallegiance in public schools is fully consistent with and appropriate \nwithin the context of the establishment clause of the first amendment \nto the United States Constitution. The words of the pledge simply \nconvey the conviction held by the Founders of this Nation that our \nfreedoms come from God. Congress inserted the phrase ``One Nation Under \nGod'' in the Pledge of Allegiance for the express purpose of \nreaffirming America's unique understanding of this truth, and to \ndistinguish America from atheistic nations who recognize no higher \nauthority than the State. The Ninth Circuit's decision was problematic \non several fronts.\n  Let me point out a few specifics. First, the court ignored the \ndistinction that the Supreme Court historically has drawn between \nreligious exercises in public schools and patriotic exercises with \nreligious references. The Court repeatedly has said that the latter are \nconsistent with the establishment clause. The voluntary recitation of \nthe Pledge of allegiance is not a coerced religious act, and the Ninth \nCircuit's conclusion to the contrary is insupportable.\n  Second, the Ninth Circuit ignored the numerous pronouncements by past \nand present members of the Court that the phrase ``under God'' in the \nPledge of Allegiance poses no Establishment Clause problems. It is one \nthing to identify isolated dicta with no precedential weight; it is \nsomething quite different to ignore, as the Ninth Circuit did, \nconsistent and numerous statements from the Court's opinions all \npointing to a single conclusion. The Ninth Circuit's refusal to heed \nthe Court's previous statements about the pledge is simply inexcusable \nand is a glaring and continuing example of judicial activism run amok.\n  A decision to affirm the Ninth Circuit could have had ramifications \nextending far beyond the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance in \npublic schools. There is no principled means of distinguishing between \nrecitation of the pledge, and recitation of passages from other \nhistorical documents reflecting the same truth. The Declaration of \nIndependence and the Gettysburg Address that every student in this \nNation is familiar with contain the same recognition that the Nation \nwas founded upon a belief in God.\n\n  Should we, in a recitation of those seminal speeches, similarly \ndelete any references to God? In fact, had the Ninth Circuit's decision \nbeen allowed to stand, it could have cast doubt about whether a public \nschool teacher could require students to memorize portions of either \none.\n  Additionally, much in the world of choral music would become \nconstitutionally suspect, if it is performed by public school students. \nIf the optional recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance violates the \nestablishment clause, what would be the basis by which music teachers \ncan have students perform any classical choral pieces with a religious \nmessage? The phrase ``under God'' in the Pledge of Allegiance is \ndescriptive only. In contrast, much in classical choral music is \nexplicitly religious. They would, under the Ninth Circuit's decision \nhave a greater chance of being rejected.\n  In ruling that Michael Newdow could not sue to ban the Pledge of \nAllegiance from his daughter's school and others because he did not \nhave legal authority to speak for her, the Court avoided the larger \nquestion of whether or not recitation of the pledge in a public school \nis an unconstitutional violation of the First Amendment proscription \nagainst the establishment of religion.\n  However, restrictions on religious freedom in the guise of preventing \nthe establishment of religion have been eroding our freedoms and \nadversely affecting our culture. This began in 1962 in the Engel v. \nVitale case, when 39 million students were forbidden to do what they \nand students had been doing since the founding of our Nation, and only \na year later in the School District of Abington Township v. Schempp, \nthe Court held that Bible readings in public schools also violated the \nfirst amendment's establishment clause. Then 1992, Lee v. Weisman \nremoved prayer from graduation exercises, and the 2000 ruling in Santa \nFe Independent School District v. Doe, prohibited student-initiated, \nstudent-led prayer at high school football games.\n  No legislative body affirmatively adopted any of these restrictions. \nIn fact, the people's representatives--at both the Federal and State \nlevel--did precisely the opposite. For example, when Congress added the \nphase ``under God'' in 1954 to the Pledge of Allegiance, it did so with \nthe explicit intention of fostering patriotism and piety. It was done \nto reflect the values of the American people.\n  Those values, Mr. President, have not changed. And the Court's ruling \nyesterday simply confirms what the American people have always known: \nacknowledging God in the public square is patriotic, wise, and good. It \nis not in conflict with our founding principles, or with our \nConstitution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/17/senate-section/article/S6987-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6987-S6988]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          COMBAT CASUALTY CARE\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the courageous \nmen and women of military medicine, whose efforts to preserve life on \nthe battlefield must not go unnoticed. Since World War II, I have \nfollowed the advances in personal protection and combat casualty care \nwhich have changed the fate of thousands of our military men and women.\n  The improvements in battlefield protection have given our military \nthe lowest levels of combat deaths in history. While there is still \nregrettable loss of life in Iraq and Afghanistan, the fact that we are \nsavings hundreds of lives which could not have been saved in past \noperations is proof that these advances are paying off.\n  Historically, 20 percent of all war casualties resulted in death. \nToday, that rate has been cut in half. Additionally, the rate of total \nbattlefield casualties has also declined by half.\n  Many advances have led to these decreases. Improved body armor, the \nplacement of forward surgical teams, improved medical training and \nevacuations, in theatre assessments of unforeseen medical \ncomplications, and superior medical technology are just a few of the \nchanges I want to address.\n  As we read about casualties in the press, one might not realize that \nmuch has changed. We read about injury or death by mortar or improvised \nexplosive device. And, as in the past, when soldiers are injured, the \nfirst person they call out for is not their mother, not their \nsweetheart, or even God, but for a medic. But circumstances are \ndifferent when that medic arrives today. Training of our medics has \nimproved drastically. Today every medic is certified as an emergency \nmedical technician. They are provided with improved medical kits with \nstate-of-the-art medical equipment. The military unit on the ground has \nthese additional capabilities and life saving techniques to improve \ncombat care from the moment of injury.\n  A second major development in treating battlefield injuries is the \nplacement of forward surgical teams closer to the front lines. These \nteams target the 15-20 percent of wounded who, without care within the \nfirst hour after wounding, would die before seeing the inside of a \ncombat support hospital. Uncontrollable hemorrhage has been a major \ncause of death in previous wars. Today, the forward surgical teams are \nwell equipped to identify and stop bleeding using a hand held \nultrasound machine to identify internal bleeding. Advances in \nhemorrhage control dressings have also had a substantial impact on \nsaving lives.\n  Circumstances were definitely a little different when I served during\n\n[[Page S6988]]\n\nWorld War II. After I was injured, it took 9 hours to get to a field \nhospital where they performed military trauma surgery and over 3 months \nbefore I made it back to the United States. I spent 11 months in a \nhospital that was essentially a converted hotel in Atlantic City \nwaiting for my final surgery and another 9 months in a rehabilitation \nfacility in Battle Creek, MI. All told, it was almost 2 years from the \ntime I was injured until I was able to return home to Hawaii.\n  Today, military personnel injured on the battlefield can be \ntransported from theatre to a military hospital in Europe in a matter \nof hours. Depending on the extent of the wounds, they can be flown back \nto the United States within days. The rapid, sophisticated treatment on \nthe battlefield and expedited transfer to safety are two of the most \nstriking differences between military medicine today and World War II.\n  The story of Private Jessica Lynch is an excellent example. Following \nher rescue from the Iraqi hospital, Army medics, Air Force aeromedical \nevacuation troops and Special Operations forces transported her \nthousands of miles, used three different aircraft, and provided care \nduring her entire journey, until she reached the safety of an Army \nhospital in Landstuhl, Germany. This was all accomplished in fewer than \n15 hours. This same approach has saved the lives of many other \ncourageous, young heroes.\n  What remains a mystery is how to treat the unexpected. Many deaths \nare the result of disease or non-battle injuries. In March 2004, there \nwere 595 evacuations from Iraq for disease or other non-battlefield \ninjuries. The Army Medical Department has deployed special teams with \nexpertise in areas such as leishmaniasis, pneumonia, mental health and \nenvironmental surveillance to respond to these types of injuries. \nHaving their critical assessments and recommendations while our troops \nare still in theatre will hopefully enable the command to decrease \nthese illnesses.\n  The good news is that we have already improved our rates on this \nfront. In the Civil War, twice as many people died of disease than of \nbattle wounds. In World War I, about 56,000 U.S. soldiers died of \ndisease, 14,000 during World War II, but only 930 during the Vietnam \nWar. And we continue to make progress.\n  Press reports have highlighted the suicide rates of our troops \nserving overseas, but little acknowledgement has surfaced on how the \nmilitary is addressing this concern. In July 2003, the Army sent a team \nof mental health experts to study the issues facing our troops in Iraq. \nThis team was assembled to assess the increase in suicides in Operation \nIraqi Freedom, evaluate the patient flow of mental health patients from \ntheater, and analyze the stress-related issues Soldiers experience in \ncombat.\n  This was the first time a mental health assessment was ever conducted \nwith soldiers in combat. I cannot stress the importance of the \ncollection and analysis of this data and its potential to help the \nmilitary address these issues at the earliest stages.\n  We have also learned a great deal about providing better protection \nto our forces. We are now experiencing less than half of the theatre \nevacuations for chest and abdomen wounds than was seen during World War \nII, Korea, and Vietnam because of body armor.\n  The 1991 Gulf War was the first major conflict in which all U.S. \ntroops were provided body armor. At that time, the vests were made of \nKevlar. They were capable of stopping shell and grenade fragments, but \nwere a heavy 25 pounds to carry. The lighter interceptor body armor now \nused in Afghanistan and Iraq weighs only sixteen pounds and stops \ngrenade fragments, 9mm slugs, and some rifle ammunition. The efforts \nplaced in these advancements have paid off and should continue with \nrenewed commitment.\n  But while these advances have drastically improved our casualty \nrates, injuries to the limbs are increasing. Historically, 3 percent of \nthose wounded in action required some amputation. Today that rate has \njumped to 6 percent in Iraq. This requires our attention. We must focus \non technology to reverse this trend.\n  These are just a few of the advances in medical technology and \ntreatment that are responsible for saving the lives of our military.\n  As we think about today's improvements, we should remember the men \nand women that served before this conflict. Nearly half a million men \nwere permanently disabled by wounds during the Civil War. Their \nsacrifices led others to develop improvements in orthopedic surgery and \nthe design of prosthetic limbs. It is important that we recognize these \nsacrifices and contributions and continue our commitment to further \nadvances.\n  It is said that my generation was the greatest generation. But I have \nspent a great deal of time visiting our military personnel and must say \nthat this generation is surpassing us by far. These men and women in \nuniform display the courage, strength, and devotion of our armed \nforces.\n  I thank the Chair for allowing me to recognize the men and women of \nour military and to pay particular attention to lesser known positive \ndata coming from the Global War on Terrorism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/17/senate-section/article/S6988-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6988-S6989]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CONFIRMATION OF PAUL STEVEN DIAMOND AND LAWRENCE F.

Mr. President, I am pleased to submit this statement \nrelated to the Senate's unanimous confirmation of the nominations \nyesterday of Paul Steven Diamond and Lawrence F. Stengel as United \nStates District Judges for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania after \nonly a brief opportunity to speak on their behalf. First, I want to \nthank the President for their nominations and congratulate them and \ntheir families and to thank them for their willingness to serve \nPennsylvania and our country.\n  Paul Diamond attended Hunter College-City University of New York and \nColumbia University where he graduated Magna Cum Laude in 1974. He \nreceived his J.D. from the University of Pennsylvania Law School in \n1977. He served as an Assistant District Attorney in the Philadelphia \nDistrict Attorney's Office from 1977-1980. Paul Diamond then served as \na law clerk on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to former Justice Bruce \nW. Kauffman, who now serves as a Federal judge on the United States \nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. He returned to \nthe Philadelphia District Attorney's Office until 1983. From 1983 until \n1991 he was an associate and then a partner at Dilworth, Paxson, Kalish \n& Kauffmann in Philadelphia. Paul Diamond was an Adjunct Professor at \nTemple University School of Law from 1990-1992. From 1992 until the \npresent he has been a partner at Obermayer Rebmann Maxmann & Hippel in \nPhiladelphia.\n  Paul Diamond has written a book, Federal Grand Jury Practice and \nProcedure, and several articles on issues related to grand juries. He \nhas extensive experience in general civil and criminal law practice \nareas and will be an excellent addition to the Federal bench.\n  I also want to extend my congratulations to Judge Lawrence F. Stengel \nwho has served as a Common Pleas Judge in Lancaster County since 1990. \nJudge Stengel received a B.A. from St. Joseph's College and his J.D. \nfrom the University of Pittsburgh School of Law. His service on the \nCourt was preceded by 10 years of legal practice, where he focused \nprimarily on civil litigation matters as an associate at Dickie, \nMcCamey & Chilcote, PC, and in private practice as a sole practitioner. \nHe has also served as an adjunct professor at Franklin & Marshall \nCollege and Millersville University.\n  He has also served his community prior to legal practice as an \nEnglish and Social Studies teacher at Lancaster Catholic High School. \nJudge Stengel was also a board member of Leadership Lancaster which \nassists young leaders with getting connected with community \norganizations. He has also served as a Guardian Ad-litem for abused \nchildren. As President of the Lancaster Bar Association, Judge Stengel \nformed a diversity task force to investigate ways to increase the \nnumber of minority attorneys practicing in Lancaster County and \nappointed a committee for the creation of the Lancaster Bar Association \nFoundation--a foundation whose primary purpose is to raise funds for \nenhancing the\n\n[[Page S6989]]\n\ndelivery of services to underprivileged clients. I am pleased that he \nwill be serving on the Federal bench. I want to thank my colleagues for \ntheir support for these nominations and again congratulate them and \ntheir families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/17/senate-section/article/S6989-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6989]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SADIE BROWER NEAKOK\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, in November of 2003, I was honored to \njoin with the Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins, in speaking on the \nSenate floor about the need for a national museum honoring the \ncontributions of women in American history.\n  Senator Collins and I took turns addressing the accomplishments of \npioneering women from our respective States, who were breaking through \nglass ceilings long before society acknowledged that they even existed.\n  One of the women I discussed was Sadie Brower Neakok, an Inupiaq \nEskimo woman, from Barrow on Alaska's North Slope. Sadie has the \ndistinction of being the first woman to serve as a magistrate in the \nState of Alaska. Four years before the United States passed its \nlandmark civil rights act, an Eskimo woman was sitting on the bench in \nthe State of Alaska.\n  But her life was remarkable in so many other respects. For one thing, \nshe was appointed in 1960, a year after Alaska was admitted to \nstatehood and long before women, not to mention Alaska Native women, \ncame to realize that a career in the law was even an option. She \ncontinued in that role for nearly 2 decades.\n  Second, she was not trained as a lawyer. She was trained as an \neducator at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.\n  Yet when Sadie took the bench everyone knew she meant business. You \nshould know that in the early days, the bench was Sadie's kitchen \ntable.\n  She was tough on offenders, but equally tough on Government officials \nwhen asked to enforce unjust laws and regulations.\n  Ignoring the neutrality and detachment our society expects from its \njudicial officers, Sadie took a great risk when in May, 1961 she \nchallenged an arbitrary game regulation which permitted duck hunting \nonly after the ducks had already flown south.\n  After one subsistence hunter was arrested for violating the law, she \nquietly organized the rest of the community to violate the same law. \nNearly 150 people came forth bearing ducks and demanded to be arrested.\n  The game warden could not keep up with the violators. There was not \nsufficient space in the jail to house them all. Sadie refused to charge \nthem. In response to the community emergency, the regulation was \nchanged.\n  Reflecting on this well known episode of civil disobedience, the \nAlaska Commission on the Status of Women in 1983 noted, ``It was, \nperhaps, judicial activism at an awkward peak, but it brought necessary \nchange for the people of Barrow.''\n  Finally, Sadie was already an accomplished teacher, a public health \nworker and a social worker before taking the bench. She was working on \nher fourth career before many women embarked on their first job outside \nthe home.\n  This is not to say that Sadie ignored the home. She was the mother of \n13 children and cared for numerous foster children. In fact, she is \nregarded as the mother of all Barrow, which today has a population of \nabout 4,500 people. She was a renowned seamstress, capable of making \nvirtually anything from cloth or fur. Her life makes the aspiration \nshared by many women of ``having it all'' seem like a cliche.\n  I have the sad duty of informing the Senate that Sadie Brower Neakok \npassed away last Sunday at the age of 88. When asked once what the best \npart of her work was, Sadie replied, ``gaining the respect of my \npeople.'' Today in Barrow, AK, which remains an Eskimo community where \npeople still speak their Native language, the community will turn out \nto demonstrate the depth of that respect.\n  If there were a National Women's History Museum, young women \neverywhere would know Sadie's name and be able to take inspiration from \nher story. Until then it will take a bit more effort for people to \nlearn more about this remarkable woman.\n  Fortunately, Sadie's story is not lost to history. It is preserved \nfor eternity in recorded oral histories and in the book ``Sadie Brower \nNeakok--An Inupiaq Woman'' by Margaret Blackman.\n  It was a privilege to honor the life of Sadie Brower Neakok on the \nSenate floor last November. Today we extend our sympathy to Sadie's \nfamily and to all of the Inupiaq people of the North Slope on the loss \nof a respected Elder and a great leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/17/senate-section/article/S6989-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6989]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HALT THE ASSAULT BUS TOUR\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this week, the Million Mom March entered \nthe tenth week of its ``Halt the Assault'' bus tour. The bus tour is \ntraveling across America in a pink RV and making stops in nearly every \nmajor metropolitan area in the country. Their message is simple. They \nare asking Congress and President Bush to act now to reauthorize the \nassault weapons ban. They are in Illinois this week and they will be in \nmy home State of Michigan at the beginning of August. I hope folks in \neach State will join them to help convey their important message.\n  In addition to banning 19 specific weapons, the ban makes it illegal \nto ``manufacture, transfer, or possess a semiautomatic'' firearm that \ncan accept a detachable magazine and has more than one of several \nspecific military features, such as folding/telescoping stocks, \nprotruding pistol grips, bayonet mounts, threaded muzzles or flash \nsuppressors, barrel shrouds, or grenade launchers. These weapons are \ndangerous and they should not be on America's streets.\n  The ban was designed to reduce the criminal use of military-style \nsemiautomatic firearms, and it has done just that. According to \nstatistics reported by the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, from \n1990 to 1994, assault weapons named in the ban constituted 4.82 percent \nof guns traced in criminal investigations. However, since the ban's \nenactment, these assault weapons have made up only 1.61 percent of the \ncrime-related guns traced.\n  According to the Brady Campaign, throughout the 1980s, law \nenforcement officials reported that assault weapons were the ``weapons \nof choice'' for drug traffickers, gangs, terrorists, and paramilitary \nextremist groups. In response, our Nation's first responders asked \nCongress and President Bush to limit access to such weapons so that our \nstreets and communities might be safer.\n  In order to keep these deadly, military-style weapons out of our \ncommunities, America's moms are joining gun safety groups and the law \nenforcement community in urging us to extend this critical gun safety \nlaw that is about to expire. Without action, firearms like UZIs, AK-\n47s, and other semiautomatic assault weapons could begin to find their \nway back onto our streets again.\n  Unfortunately, despite Senate passage of a bipartisan amendment that \nwould have reauthorized the ban, it appears that this important gun \nsafety law will be allowed to expire on September 13, 2004. The House \nRepublican leadership opposes reauthorizing the law and President Bush, \nthough he has said he supports it, has done little to help keep the law \nalive. I hope all of my colleagues will join me in thanking America's \nmoms for their efforts in the battle to reauthorize the assault weapon \nban.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/17/senate-section/article/S6989-3", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6989-S6990]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NOMINATION OF JOHN C.

Mr. President, I offer my strong support for John C. \nDanforth's nomination to be Representative of the United States to the \nUnited Nations.\n  Jack Danforth's career in public service dates back to 1969, when he \nbecame Missouri's Attorney General. He served in that position until \n1976. He went on to serve three distinguished terms in the United \nStates Senate, where he was chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee.\n  Since retiring from the Senate in 1995, Presidents of both political \nparties have called upon Jack to tackle complex problems. In 1999, \nthen-Attorney General Janet Reno appointed him as a special counsel to \ninvestigate the 1993 deaths of 80 Branch Davidians in Waco, Texas. In \n2001, President Bush appointed him as a special envoy to Sudan to help \nachieve peace between long-warring factions in that country.

Mr. President, I wish to take this opportunity to \nreport back to my colleagues on some observations during my recent \nvisit to the nation of Uganda. The Congressional Coalition on Adoption \nis a bipartisan, bicameral caucus that enjoys the support of nearly 200 \nmembers of Congress. I am fortunate to cochair this organization with \nmy friend and colleague, the Senior Senator from Idaho. Every year, we \nhave been taking a delegation of members and staff to a nation which \nplays, or could play, a leading role in assuring every child a loving \nfamily. In recent years, we have lead delegations to Romania, Russia, \nChina, and Guatemala. However, this month, we traveled to a spot that \nis truly special in the world--Uganda.\n  I am sad to say that if Americans know anything about Uganda, they \nknow its tragic history. Since independence from Britain, Uganda has \nmoved from tragedy to tragedy. Famously called the ``Pearl of Africa'' \nby Sir Winston Churchill, decades of misrule and grisly dictatorship \nleft Uganda destitute and denied her proper role in the family of \nnations.\n  Yet, the spirit of the people of Uganda seems indomitable. Despite \nAmin, despite Obote, despite HIV/AIDS, despite brutal terrorists in the \nnorth, Ugandans continue with a joy of life that is almost impossible \nto accept in our own terms. The people there have an amazing capacity \nto look past their personal tragedies and continue to strive for a \nbetter life for their children.\n  Perhaps no man better captures the spirit of the people of Uganda \nthan their current President, Yoweri Museveni. When Idi Amin staged his \ncoup in 1971, now-President Museveni went into exile and began a \nhistory of resistance to dictatorship and misrule that has earned him \ncomparisons with our own George Washington. Since his National \nResistance Movement took power in 1986, Uganda has enjoyed the first \nsustained period of growth and stability that it has known since \nindependence. As is often mentioned, President Museveni also exerted \npersonal and farsighted leadership in the struggle against AIDS. The \ndifference between this kind of personal leadership and its absence can \nbe found by comparing the AIDS infection rates in Uganda with those of \nthe rest of sub-Saharan Africa.\n  Thus, Uganda is a country with capable and proven leadership, with an \nindustrious people who are eager for more contact with the United \nStates, and with an amazing natural beauty that is unparalleled in my \nown experience. However, Uganda faces two enormous challenges, and that \nis what drew the Congressional Coalition on Adoption to the country. \nSadly, both of these challenges have contributed to the creation of \norphans. They are the epidemic of HIV/AIDS and the ongoing terrorism by \nthe Lord's Resistance Army in northern Uganda.\n  Uganda has a population of 25 million people, and estimates suggest \nthat nearly 10 percent of Uganda's population are orphaned. The good \nnews is that Uganda has tackled one of the great orphan-generating \ndisasters by acknowledging AIDS as a threat that can shake a country to \nits core. AIDS infection rates in some sections of Uganda were greater \nthan 50 percent. From that devastating past, and with the good work of \nPresident Museveni and the First Lady, Janet Museveni, they have \nbrought infection rates in Uganda to less than 6 percent.\n  However, we must continue our support for the President's ``ABC'' \nprogram that endorses abstinence, being faithful, and condoms in that \npriority. The three pronged approach has been very successful, and we \nmust ensure that ideological differences do not undermine our support \nfor a program with such an amazing success rate.\n  Additionally, we observed some very important clinical work with the \ndrug Nevirapine. It is one of those small miracles that should do \nwonders in theory, but as a practical matter, the results are somewhat \nmore troubling. Nevirapine has been shown to reduce mother-to-child HIV \ntransmission rates by 50 percent. German pharmaceutical companies are \nproviding the drug for free in Uganda. Nevertheless, because the \nhealthcare infrastructure is so fragile and, in much of Uganda, \nnonexistent, Nevirapine has been subject to something called the \n``cascade effect.'' Effectively, this means that since Nevirapine \ntreatment requires a number of steps, at each stage we lose \nparticipation of mothers. So, when 6,000 women enter a clinic's door \nseeking treatment, we end up saving about four babies at a cost of \n$5,000 for each child. It is not that those children are not worth \nsaving, we should do everything we can to save every child. However, \nwhen we tackle an enormous problem with finite resources, we must \ndevote our efforts to the most effective treatments available.\n  As the administration unrolls its funding strategy for the global \neffort against AIDS, I think we must examine this question of mother-\nto-child transmission carefully. In addition to the cascade effect, we \nmust be careful not to ``create'' orphans with our healthcare funding \nchoices. If all of our efforts go into saving infants, and we do less \nto help the mothers, we have only added to Uganda's difficulties with a \nlarge orphan population.\n  But the real pressure creating new orphans in Uganda also deserves \nAmerican attention. The Lord's Resistance Army, LRA, has been operating \nin Uganda since 1989. Suffice to say that its origins can be found in \nthe delusional preachings of a self-proclaimed priestess, and since \nthat time, it has lost whatever purpose it might have claimed. Fifteen \nyears later, the LRA is lead by Joseph Koney, and his acts of cruelty \ncan only rank with those of Hitler and Stalin. I heard personal \ntestimony from an 11-year-old girl who was forced to kill her own \nmother in front of her siblings.\n  This rag-tag group of brigands, thieves, and terrorists prey on the \nweakness of children. They swell their own meager ranks of 2,000 men by \nabducting children out of their homes. Young children are made to carry \nequipment, frequently starving to death during their treks of hundreds \nof miles to the LRA bases in southern Sudan. Older males are forced to \nfight or be killed. Girls are brutally raped and used as sex slaves for \nyears.\n  Child soldiers are regrettably not unique to Uganda. However, Koney's \npathological desire to have children murder their own families and \ntheir fellow villagers leaves scars that are harder to heal than in \nother parts of the world.\n  Despite this reality, U.S. military assistance to Uganda is a \npittance. It is certainly true that the Ugandan army has a checkered \npast. It is also true that President Museveni has intervened in other \nconflicts, such as Rwanda. Yet, whatever harm might conceivably come \nfrom greater military assistance the United States would provide \nUganda, it is overwhelmed by the horror of the status quo. If there is \na moral obligation to use military force to defeat terrorists anywhere \non Earth, I cannot conceive of a better place for the use of force than \nagainst the LRA.\n\n  East Africa is an unstable and difficult neighborhood. Nearby Somalia \nis a failed state. Sudan has actively harbored terrorists, including \nOsama bin Laden. The Congo is an ongoing battleground. Rwanda \nexperienced the worst genocide since Nazi Germany. This is a place that \nneeds some attention and would benefit from a more robust American \nrole. I am certain that we will need a real partner in this region--a \npartner in our fight against terrorism, an economic partner that \ndemonstrates the success of the African Growth and Opportunity Act, and \na regional model for the combat of AIDS. I believe that Uganda could be \nsuch a partner, and this Senator will pursue those steps available to \nme that would cement this relationship.\n  Finally, let me say a word about intercountry adoption. President \nMuseveni graciously received our delegation, and we had the opportunity \nto explain our position. Namely, the coalition feels that children \nflourish with\n\n[[Page S6991]]\n\nloving families, but suffer in institutions. Of course, Uganda's \ntraditional culture would normally absorb orphaned children in \nprecisely the way we think is most appropriate--first with their \nfamily, secondarily within their community. However, we feel that where \nthese social systems have been overwhelmed, as they have been in \nUganda, a country should consider the option of international adoption. \nWe believe that a nation can have no better ambassador to the United \nStates than a child who has been adopted into a U.S. family and now has \nan active interest in their home country. We have seen it in China, \nKorea, and Russia. The process of intercountry adoption simply connects \nAmericans to another country in a way they otherwise never would be.\n  So with these thoughts in mind, President Museveni has agreed to \nreview our request that Uganda ratify the Hague Convention on \nIntercountry Adoption. International adoption is not going to be a \nsolution to the very important tasks ahead of Uganda. However, in the \nlives of the children who find parents this way, intercountry adoption \nwill be a true blessing.\n  I am also very pleased to announce that President Museveni and his \nwife Janet have kindly accepted my invitation to join us for a \nreception in their honor at my home. This will be an excellent \nopportunity for the Washington community to welcome this distinguished \nleader and build upon the foundations of partnership that have already \nbeen laid. I look forward to seeing many of my colleagues there.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/17/senate-section/article/S6991-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6991-S6992]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE ACT OF 1968\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to support S. 2238, the Flood \nInsurance Reform Act of 2004. I want to thank Senator Sarbanes, my \ncolleague from Maryland and a member of the Banking Committee that \npushed this legislation through. Senator Sarbanes and I worked together \nas ``Team Maryland'' to ensure that this legislation addressed many of \nthe lessons learned in the aftermath of Hurricane Isabel.\n  In September 2003, my State of Maryland was devastated by Hurricane \nIsabel. This was the worst natural disaster in Maryland history. The \npeople who live on the Chesapeake Bay and the many rivers leading into \nthe Bay lost their homes, their possessions, and many lost their \nlivelihoods.\n  The flooded communities have names like Bowleys Quarters and Millers \nIsland, Bayside and North Beach, Kent Islands and Hoopers Island. The \npeople who live in these communities are hard-working people. Many are \nretirees who scrimped and saved to buy these homes. Some are people I \nwent to school with. Many of these communities are still struggling \nwith the legacy of Isabel. Some Marylanders are still living in \ntrailers which are really glorified campers.\n  Right after Hurricane Isabel swept through Maryland, Senator Sarbanes \nand I went with Secretary Tom Ridge and Governor Ehrlich to see the \ndamage, to talk to people, and to find out how we could work together \nwith Marylanders to put their lives back together. When disaster \nstrikes, we are Team Maryland and Team America, Federal and State \nofficials, Democrats and Republicans. We saw houses moved off their \nfoundations in North Beach. We walked the streets of Bowleys Quarters \nwhere children's toys and personal items were pushed into yards by \nthree feet of flood waters. We saw mud more than a foot deep three \nblocks away from the water. We talked to a business owner on Kent \nIsland who lost her restaurant only 6 months after she bought it.\n  I was incredibly moved by what I saw, not only the devastation, but \nthe way these communities were pulling together. I heard about daring \nrescues from our intrepid first responders. Churches opened their doors \nto provide food and shelter. Neighbor was helping neighbor. I promised \nthese communities that their Federal Government would help.\n  Unfortunately, the National Flood Insurance Program wasn't there the \nway it should have been. Today, nearly 9 months after Isabel hit, my \nconstituents are still struggling to get the money that is owed to \nthem. They are frustrated, confused, and frankly, many are just plain \nfed up. They feel like the insurance they paid for wasn't there when \nthey needed it the most.\n  From Calvert County to Baltimore County to Anne Arundel County to \nMaryland's Eastern Shore, people told me they didn't understand what \ntheir flood insurance covered. Though their homes were damaged, they \nthought between homeowners insurance and flood insurance they would be \ncovered. Nothing was explained to them when they bought these policies. \nThey didn't know, for example, that the contents of their home wasn't \ncovered without a separate policy. People thought if they had $200,000 \nworth of coverage on a home they bought for $50,000 that flood \ninsurance would pay to replace the home. But when they put in their \nclaims they found out they would only get a portion of what it costs to \nmake repairs or rebuild.\n  Another serious problem was the way insurance agents handled people's \nindividual claims. When people asked their insurance agents to explain \nthings to them, they couldn't get a straight answer. That's because \nsome of the insurance agents don't really know what these policies \ncover or how they really work. In Southern Maryland, some homeowners \nwere able to get emergency advances on their claims. Others were told \nthere was no way to get advances on their claims. Different agents gave \ndifferent answers. In some cases, the same agent would give a different \nanswer depending on the day. That is unacceptable.\n  When I heard these stories about claims being denied or shortchanged, \nI asked my constituents if they could appeal. They told me they didn't \nknow. When they filed their claims, no one told them how to appeal, or \neven if an appeal was possible. My office became a clearinghouse for \nappeals. We asked the National Flood Insurance Program for instructions \non filing an appeal; there wasn't one. So, I organized community \nmeetings and appeals hearings. I brought FEMA and representatives from \nthe National Flood Insurance Program to Maryland communities to explain \nto people what they needed to do to get a fair hearing.\n  Once Marylanders figured out their policies and filed their \npaperwork, the payments they were getting were not adequate to repair \nthe damage. The flood insurance adjusters weren't using real world \nestimates for what it took to repair damages. In Bowley's Quarters, the \nadjuster gave people real low-ball estimates for their repairs. So the \ncommunity association asked a local contractor to come in for a second \nopinion. When his estimate was significantly higher, the community \nleaders went back to the adjuster. They told the adjuster what was \nneeded to do the job. But people shouldn't have to go through all of \nthis to get a fair appraisal and a fair reimbursement from insurance \nthey paid for.\n\n  These experiences led to four recommendations that I submitted when I \ntestified before the Banking Committee earlier this year. Senator \nSarbanes was instrumental in developing these recommendations and \nworked with the committee to make them part of this legislation. \nHelpful to this process were two reports that outlined the myriad of \nproblems that surfaced after Hurricane Isabel struck Maryland. The \nfirst report was prepared by Maryland's former Insurance Commissioner, \nSteve Larsen, at the request of Baltimore County Executive, Jim Smith. \nThe second report was prepared by Maryland's current Insurance \nCommissioner, Alfred Redmer. Many of the findings in those reports were \nsimilar to what I heard directly from constituents and were helpful in \ndeveloping the following recommendations:\n  One, the National Flood Insurance Program must provide a clear and \nunderstandable outline of policies so policyholders understand what is \ncovered and what is not. Two, the agents who sell flood insurance must \nunderstand what they are selling and how claims are processed so \nconsumers don't get the runaround instead of answers. Three, there must \nbe a clear way for policyholders to appeal their claims awards or \nappraisals of loss. Four, consumers need to know that the insurance \nthey purchase will pay the real world cost of repairing damages or \nreplacing their losses.\n  I support this bill because it addressed four key reforms that I \nbelieve will improve the National Flood Insurance Program. First, the \nbill directs\n\n[[Page S6992]]\n\nFEMA/NFIP to develop supplemental forms to the flood insurance policy. \nThese supplemental forms will explain in simple terms the exact \ncoverages being purchased by a policyholder, any exclusions from \ncoverage that apply to coverages purchased, and an explanation, \nincluding illustrations, of how lost items and damages will be valued \nunder the policy at the time of loss. Second, the bill directs FEMA/\nNFIP, in cooperation with the insurance industry to establish minimum \ntraining and education requirements for all insurance agents who sell \nflood insurance policies, publish these requirements in the Federal \nRegister, and inform insurance companies and agents of the \nrequirements. Third, the bill directs FEMA/NFIP to establish a formal \nappeals process with respect to claims, proofs of loss, and loss \nestimates relating to flood policies. Fourth, the bill directs the \nComptroller General of the United States to conduct a study of the \nadequacy of the scope of coverage provided under flood insurance \npolicies, the adequacy of payments to flood victims under flood \ninsurance policies, and the practices of FEMA/NFIP and insurance \nadjusters in estimating losses incurred during a flood.\n  As the one year anniversary of Hurricane Isabel approaches, I believe \nwe need to take aggressive steps to address the inadequacies of a flood \ninsurance program that clearly wasn't there for people in their \ngreatest time of need. This bill goes a long way in making the flood \ninsurance program fairer, more transparent, and reliable.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/17/senate-section/article/S6992-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6992]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NOMINATION OF ANNE W.

Mr. President, when we dedicated the National World War II \nMemorial and commemorated the 60th anniversary of D-Day, much was made \nof the fact that this Nation loses an average of over 1,000 World War \nII veterans every day. Just last week, we honored the passing of one of \nthe greatest members of that great generation, President Ronald Wilson \nReagan.\n  I want to take this opportunity to recognize the passing of another \ngreat member of that great generation, Thurston Esco Womble. When \nPresident Reagan spoke at the 40th anniversary of D-Day, he memorably \nreferred to the assembled veterans as ``the boys . . ., the heroes who \nhelped end a war.'' Thurston Womble was one of those boys, one of this \nNation's unsung World War II veterans who helped ensure the United \nStates of America maintained its freedom and way of life during a very \ndifficult time in our Nation's history.\n  Mr. Womble's service began prior to Pearl Harbor, when he enlisted in \nthe Navy in March, 1941. By that October, he had gone through the \nMetalworkers School in Norfolk, VA. Womble was soon assigned to duty on \nthe U.S.S. Cincinnati (CL-6), engaged in patrol and convoy duty in the \nwestern Atlantic and Caribbean, blockading occupied French men-of- war, \nand searching for German blockade runners.\n  In November, 1942, Cincinnati assisted in the interception and \ndestruction of the German blockade runner S.S. Annalise Essberger. \nAlthough the German crew scuttled their ship, a boarding party reached \nit in time to take all 63 crew members prisoner before the blockade \nrunner sank. Early in 1944, Cincinnati served as escort flagship for \nthree convoys transporting men and equipment from New York to Belfast \nin preparation for the invasion of Normandy. She subsequently \nparticipated in the assault on Southern France and patrolled South \nAtlantic shipping lanes until the war in Europe ended.\n  But Thurston Womble's naval service did not end there. After the war \nended, he went back to school at the Philadelphia Navy Yard and \ngraduated as a boilerman. He was then assigned to duty aboard U.S.S. \nLake Champlain (CV-39), one of our newly built aircraft carriers \nassigned to so- called ``Magic Carpet'' duty, bringing veterans of the \nEuropean Theater back home. Womble was aboard in November, 1945, when \nLake Champlain crossed the Atlantic in 4 days, 8 hours, 51 minutes, a \nrecord which held until surpassed by the U.S.S. United States in 1952. \nHe was in charge of lighting off the boilers in Lake Champlain's #1 \nFireroom for that historic transit.\n  On February 18, 1950, in Quincy, MA, Womble married Olive Bates \nMerrill. They became the parents of Noreen, who is a high school \nteacher in Inverness, FL, and Eric, who served as my national security \nadviser and military legislative assistant for 7 years.\n  In the years after World War II, through the Korean Conflict, and up \nuntil 1960, Womble served on a veritable parade of U.S. Naval vessels: \nU.S.S. Beverly W. Reid (APD-119), U.S.S. Houston (CL-81), U.S.S. Fargo \n(CL-106), U.S.S. Bataan (CVL-29), U.S.S. San Marcos (LSD-25), U.S.S. \nFort Mandan (LSD-21), U.S.S. Laning (APD-55), and finally, U.S.S. \nSaratoga (CVA-60).\n  Womble rose in rank and responsibility to become a Boiler Technician \nChief Petty Officer and Leading Chief of the Boilers Division aboard \nSaratoga. His commanding officers repeatedly cited, not only his \nmechanical abilities and technical skills, but his energy, enthusiasm, \nand his outstanding and inspirational leadership in performing tasks \n``not previously considered within the capacity of ship's force \npersonnel.'' Truer words were never spoken than in 1960, when his \ncommanding officer wrote, ``The Navy will realize a great loss when \nWomble retires this coming August.'' That was when Womble became a \nfleet reservist and started a second career.\n  Womble's Navy career probably wasn't what his parents, Huey Clayton \nand Thelma Esco expected when he was born in Autauga County, AL, on \nAugust 16, 1922. But the experience of being raised in rural Alabama in \na close knit family taught Thurston the values that carried him through \na long and honorable Naval career.\n  Following his active-duty service, he enrolled in Jones College in \nJacksonville, FL, to study business management and worked 13 years in \nMobile, AL, as the representative for the Royal Insurance Companies, \nspecializing in employee protection and workplace safety. In 1980, he \nbecame Sales Manager and Quality Control Manager for G Industrial \nContractors, also in Mobile, AL. Thurston then served as Director and \nChief Boiler and Pressure Vessel Inspector for my home State of \nMississippi. All in all, it seems clear to me that Womble carried his \nexperience as the son of a carpenter, fisherman and farmer, as well as \nhis devotion to his Navy shipmates, into a career of devoted and humble \nservice to the people and communities in Mississippi and Alabama.\n  During an active and reserve career that spanned 30 years, Thurston \nwas awarded the Navy Occupation Medal; European Clasp, American Defense \nService Medal; American Area Campaign Medal; European-African-Middle \nEastern Campaign Medal; World War II Victory Medal; Korean Service \nMedal;\n\n[[Page S6993]]\n\nNational Defense Service Medal; and six Good Conduct Awards.\n  Thurston Womble's final days where spent with the family and friends \nhe loved so much--and doing what he enjoyed most, golfing and fishing. \nHe is survived by his wife of 54 years, Olive, their children, Noreen \nand Eric, Eric's wife Wendy and grandchildren, Melissa and Matthew. I \nextend my sincere condolences to the entire Womble family on their \nloss. I also want to thank Thurston for his dedicated service to our \ncountry and for setting an example that the rest of us can only hope to \nemulate; our great Nation owes him a debt of gratitude.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/17/senate-section/article/S6993-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6993]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 LIEUTENANT COLONEL MICHAEL J. DELANEY\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Lieutenant Colonel \nMichael J. Delaney of our Army's Office of Legislative Liaison. \nLieutenant Colonel Delaney has distinguished himself as an outstanding \nAmerican soldier from the great State of Virginia and will soon \ncomplete over 23 years of selfless service to the Nation in the United \nStates Army. His dedication to Soldiers, commitment to excellence, and \nperformance of duty has been extraordinary throughout his career and, \nespecially over the past 4 years, has cemented the positive \nrelationship between Congress and the U.S. Army. He will retire on \nAugust 1, 2004.\n  Over his 23 years of selfless service, Lieutenant Colonel Delaney \nserved in a succession of command and staff positions worldwide. As a \njunior officer, he stood at the forefront of freedom during the Cold \nWar in Germany. From the Cold War frontline, Lieutenant Colonel Delaney \nearned his wings as an aviator and qualified on a variety of rotary \nwing and fixed wing aircraft. During Desert Shield and Desert Storm, \nLieutenant Colonel Delaney commanded an aviation unit based at Fort \nBelvoir. Despite the wide dispersion of his unit throughout the combat \ntheater, they were able to successfully accomplish their mission due, \nin no small part, to his exceptional and inspirational leadership. \nLieutenant Colonel Delaney has since served in a variety of positions \nof increasing responsibility.\n  For the past 4 years, Lieutenant Colonel Delaney has served as a \ncongressional liaison for the U.S. Army. Perhaps this assignment was \npre-ordained, as Lieutenant Colonel Delaney's wife, the former Susan \nFanning, served as staff to Senator Paul Laxalt of Nevada. His mother-\nin-law, Shirley Fanning, also has a history with the Senate as she \nserved on the staffs of Senators Everett Dirksen and Strom Thurmond for \n25 years. Lieutenant Colonel Delaney's work as a legislative liaison \nand as the Chief of the Programs Division enabled the Army to provide \nthis Congress the information we need to accomplish our constitutional \nduties. His efforts have been exceptional and noteworthy in working \nwith Congress during a critical time as the Army undertook \ntransformation, in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and \nduring our current efforts with the Global War on Terrorism. Throughout \nthis critical time Lieutenant Colonel Delaney has fostered a personal \nrelationship between Congress and the U.S. Army.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Delaney holds degrees from George Mason \nUniversity, B.A., 1981, and the Naval War College, M.S., 1996. His \nmilitary awards include the Legion of Merit, the Meritorious Service \nMedal, and the Master Aviator Badge.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Delaney represents the epitome of what the Army \nseeks in a congressional liaison and the country expects from our \nofficers. His service to the Nation has been exceptional, and \nLieutenant Colonel Delaney is more than deserving of this recognition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/17/senate-section/article/S6993-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6993-S6994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ROBERT A. RIESMAN\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of Robert \nA. Riesman, who, sadly, passed away on June 2 in Providence, RI.\n  Robert Riesman was a Renaissance man and a prominent Rhode Islander, \nwho succeeded in and devoted himself passionately to all aspects of his \nlife. He was a decorated soldier, a successful businessman, and a \nleader in Rhode Island politics. He was a philanthropist, a dedicated \nman of faith, and a devoted father and husband.\n  But my own words cannot fully convey the value of Bob Riesman's \ncharacter and achievements. This can best be expressed by Mr. Riesman's \nclose friend and my esteemed colleague, Senator Jack Reed, whose \neloquent eulogy of June 6 describes Mr. Riesman in the most human \nterms.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Reed's \neulogy be printed in the Record.\n\n                     In Memory of Robert A. Riesman\n\n       Last Thursday, Richard Licht and I spoke. We quickly \n     concluded that, outside our own families, Bob Riesman was the \n     finest man that we had ever met. Then, we also quickly \n     concluded that we tend to give our families a little extra \n     credit.\n       Bob Riesman was my hero.\n       He lived his life heroically. He lived with honor and with \n     a commitment to high ideals. He pursued wisdom. He cherished \n     family and friends. He set an example of decency and \n     integrity and modesty. He time and time again entered the \n     arena to be part of the great issues that shaped his \n     generation and shaped our lives. But, he never forgot that \n     life is little things, too: acts of kindness, moments of \n     humor, sharing life's joys and disappointments with family \n     and friends.\n       He was an American hero.\n       He joined the Field Artillery at Camp Ethan Allen in \n     Vermont many months before Pearl Harbor. He had just \n     graduated from Harvard. Bob was always very proud of his \n     Harvard diploma, but declared that he was educated at the \n     Boston Latin School.\n       He served with the First Infantry, his beloved ``Big Red \n     One''. He fought through North Africa and Sicily. His \n     soldiers admired his fearlessness and his authenticity. For \n     his courage under fire, he was awarded the Silver Star. For \n     his wounds, he was awarded the Purple Heart. Because of these \n     wounds, he had to leave the First Division and he became an \n     intelligence officer with the First Army. The last days of \n     the war found him as a staff officer in Paris.\n       We always spoke together about the Army. Every conversation \n     in some way or another touched on our youthful and lifetime \n     devotion to the Army. Bob seldom, if ever, talked about the \n     difficult moments. He recalled the camaraderie. He spoke of \n     his admiration and respect for Sergeant Vic Lister and the \n     other American soldiers that he led. He spoke about the \n     leaders that he admired and those he found lacking. We both \n     reveled in those memories of soldiers and soldiering, he \n     knowing far better than I the terrible cost of war.\n       Bob Riesman saw the horror of war but refused to surrender \n     his spirit to its brutality. And having seen that horror and \n     bearing the memory forever of those young soldiers who never \n     returned, Bob's return was not simply an occasion for \n     celebration. It was an opportunity and an obligation to \n     engage in another struggle; the struggle of a committed \n     citizen to build a just and decent society in America and to \n     be a force for peace and justice around the world.\n       And, Bob never wavered from that commitment.\n       Bob Riesman was a man of great faith and great tolerance.\n       His parents taught him to cherish his Jewish faith and act \n     on this faith to serve his neighbors and his community and \n     his country. Bobs faith was more than just a theological \n     exercise. It was for him a summons, not just to reflection, \n     but also to action.\n       Bob Riesman was my friend.\n       To sit by him and to feel the comfort of a kindred spirit, \n     to listen and learn, to trace and retrace the days of our \n     lives, to share good wine and good conversation, to know the \n     feeling of unqualified support and affection was a precious \n     and enduring gift to me.\n       On one memorable evening, we rode together, just the two of \n     us, back from West Point. We had been up for the day to visit \n     the newly dedicated Jewish Chapel at West Point. Bob and I \n     attended services with the Cadets and then had supper with \n     them. It had been a splendid day for the both of us, but a \n     special day for Bob, uniting both his faith and his Army. In \n     the nighttime drive, we spoke of many things. At one point, \n     we began to discuss William Butler Yeats. Bob, as he often \n     did to my amazement, began to recite from memory passages not \n     only from Yeats, but W. H. Auden's famous lines:\n\n     Earth receive a honored guest\n     William Yeats is laid to rest\n\n       Today, earth receives another honored guest.\n       Bob taught me so much and, along with my Father and Mother, \n     set an example of what, on my best day, I might hope to be.\n       His approval meant the world to me. I recall those times \n     when we spoke and he was particularly pleased by something he \n     had read or heard about me. He would say ``my boy, you are a \n     credit to the Regiment.''\n       In a life of extraordinary achievement, Bob's greatest \n     achievement was his marriage to Marcia and their wonderful \n     children and grandchildren. Marcia and Bob were best friends \n     as well as husband and wife. To watch them was all you needed \n     to know about respect and commitment and deep and abiding \n     love.\n       Bobby and Jeanie are their parents' pride. Whenever I asked \n     about either of them, Bob's eyes would light up and his voice \n     would resonate with uncontained joy and pride. This reaction \n     was only exceeded when we spoke about Abe and Clare.\n\n[[Page S6994]]\n\n       At this moment, I know we all wish for one thing, to have a \n     few minutes again with Bob, to be with him before the fire on \n     Freeman Parkway or watching the sun set in Middletown, to \n     feel the comfort of his presence, to know that in a life that \n     can mean there was at least one who was noble. But, that \n     cannot be.\n       And knowing this, our hearts would surely break save for \n     one thing. Bob made us stronger and better by his life. He \n     has given us the example and the ability to carry on. And, we \n     will.\n       Dear friend, I shall miss you.\n       Dear friend, ``you have been a credit to the Regiment.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/17/senate-section/article/S6994-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n            HONORING THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF DANIELLE MILLER\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

This award \nhonors young people in middle level and high school grades for \noutstanding volunteer service to their communities.\n  Danielle Miller founded a service organization called the ``National \nAwareness Committee'' to provide clothing, books, and other needed \nitems to members of the Lakhota Sioux Nation living on a reservation in \nSouth Dakota. Danielle became aware of the Lakhotas needs during a \nschool presentation by the Native American Support Effort--NASD--in the \neighth grade, and became a volunteer. Although she was too young to go \non a mission to the reservation, she realized she could accomplish a \ngreat deal in her community.\n  Danielle Miller planned and organized five collection drives at local \nschools and in nearby communities, and gathered enough clothing, \nblankets, kitchenware, bicycles and books to fill a 52-foot truck. She \nrecruited volunteers to help sort, pack, and load the donations, and \npersonally accompanied the shipment to the Rosebud Reservation in \nsouthern South Dakota. Danielle plans to make a documentary film that \nwill be used to make even more people aware of the Lakhota situation.\n  The citizens of Louisville are fortunate to have a young lady like \nDanielle Miller in their community. Her example of dedication, hard \nwork and compassion should be an inspiration to all throughout the \nentire Commonwealth.\n  She has my most sincere appreciation for this work and I look forward \nto her continued service to Kentucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/17/senate-section/article/S6994-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6994-S6995]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MG EDWARD MECHENBIER\n\n Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I wish to share with my \ncolleagues a story about a wonderful American who I have had the \nprivilege of personally knowing for many years. I am talking about MG \nEd Mechenbier. I have had the honor of knowing him as a friend and as a \ntrue patriot of the American spirit and soul. On June 30, 2004, MG Ed \nMechenbier will celebrate his retirement from the United States Air \nForce Reserve following a brilliant military career that began in 1964 \nwhen then Cadet Mechenbier entered the United States Air Force Academy.\n  My friend Ed Mechenbier is a very humble man, not known for patting \nhimself on the back or openly touting his many accomplishments. But, he \nis a hero in many respects. He is a man who is driven by a sense of \nduty, a sense of honor, and a sense of country.\n  In June 1967, Ed Mechenbier found himself flying an F4C Phantom II \nfighter while assigned to the 390th Fighter Squadron, Da Nang Air Base, \nSouth Vietnam. On June 14, 1967, Ed was assigned a strike mission \nagainst the Vu Chu railroad near Kep, approximately 30 miles northeast \nof Hanoi. This flight was the 80th mission for then 1LT Ed Mechenbier. \nJune 14, 1967, also marks the day that Ed became a Prisoner of War \nafter his aircraft suffered a direct hit from a surface to air missile. \nLittle did he know that when he began his 80th mission that he would \nnot leave the Hoa Lo prison, which is also known as the ``Hanoi \nHilton'' for the next five years, eight months and four days.\n  The stories that our former POWs describe remind us of the tremendous \nfighting spirit and sense of survival that distinguish and define the \nmodern day American warrior. February 12, 1973, became a day of freedom \nfor Ed and many other POWs who were released to return with honor to \nthe hallowed soil of the United States. Upon return home, Captain \nMechenbier was awarded the Silver Star with the Oak Leaf Cluster for \nhis resistance to demands by the North Vietnamese for information, \nconfessions, and propaganda material. In addition, Captain Mechenbier \nwas awarded the Bronze Star with distinction for his efforts to conduct \nhimself strictly in accordance with the Code of Conduct during his \ncapture and imprisonment. The POW credo ``Return with Honor'' is \nexactly what Ed Mechenbier did. Throughout his imprisonment, he did not \nlose his fighting spirit. He did not lose his sense of hope. And, he \ndid not fail to remain anything, but a shining example of a warrior \nwhose duty assignment had been temporarily changed.\n  The irony of this story continues and on that day in February 1973, \nan Air Force C-141 Starlifter had been dispatched to the Gia Lam \nAirport in Hanoi, North Vietnam. To the casual observer, the tail \nnumber of that aircraft, 66-0177 is insignificant. Historically, \nhowever, that identification number is very important because it was \nthe first U.S. aircraft to leave North Vietnam with former POWs as \npassengers. On board that aircraft, which was affectionately dubbed the \n``Hanoi Taxi,'' was former POW Captain Mechenbier. Throughout the \nprocess of returning former POWs to the United States, the ``Hanoi \nTaxi'' was a vital resource as were many other aircraft that were \nneeded to accomplish such an honorable mission. In the years following \nFebruary 1973, the Hanoi Taxi's history and legacy had been temporarily \nforgotten while the aircraft carried out a long and proud period of \nservice within the Air Force fleet. Today, over 30 years later, the \nHanoi Taxi is still flying airlift missions for the 445th Airlift Wing \nat Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, OH.\n  At the same time, the life of Ed Mechenbier has also moved forward. \nFollowing several assignments that include flying with the 4950th Test \nWing and the 162nd Tactical Fighter Squadron, the young Air Force \nAcademy cadet of 1964 is now leaving military service as a major \ngeneral in the United States Air Force Reserve. Through the many \npromotions and the many assignments, Ed never forgot who he was and his \nkeen sense of perspective tends to bring calmness in times of \ndifficulty.\n  Several years ago, as a member of the 445th Airlift Wing, Ed reunited \nwith the Hanoi Taxi in his capacity as a member of the United States \nAir Force Reserve. The historic aircraft and the former POW, who was \nonce a passenger on the aircraft, became one of its pilots. Recently, \nEd Mechenbier made his final flight as a command pilot having \naccumulated more than 3,500 hours flight time in several military \naircraft. The final flight was more than just a trip around the traffic \npattern--the final mission was one that would take him half way around \nthe world to land at the Noi Bai airport in Hanoi. The mission was to \nreturn to American soil the remains of American service members who had \nbeen missing in action during the Vietnam era and recently recovered \nfrom central Vietnam by U.S. military officials. On this mission, the \nHanoi Taxi once again returned to Vietnam and the former passenger, Ed \nMechenbier was at the controls of the aircraft. Once again, the Hanoi \nTaxi returned to freedom the remains of fallen comrades from a war that \nhas not been forgotten.\n  During a repatriation ceremony that was conducted prior to departure \nfor return to the United States, Ed Mechenbier said this to those who \ngathered to honor the fallen comrades: ``For those of us who were \nfortunate enough to come home, I think we owe a little bit to all the \nfamilies--to help them make the closure on that end.'' The last \noperational mission was carried out in the same manner that Ed \nMechenbier has conducted himself since 1964--with honor, with pride, \nand with a tremendous sense of duty.\n  On June 30, 2004, MG Ed Mechenbier and several hundred of his friends \nwill gather to celebrate his retirement. Even though retirement \nsignifies an ending of sorts, his legacy of excellence, commitment, \npatriotism, and\n\n[[Page S6995]]\n\ndedication to ``completing the mission'' will remain long after his \nretirement. The legacy that he leaves behind will inspire generations \nwell into the future.\n  I am proud of Ed Mechenbier. I am proud of his accomplishments, but \nperhaps more importantly, I appreciate his unwavering sense of duty, \nhonor, and country for it is those values that define the warrior \nspirit. I thank him for the many sacrifices he has made for our great \nNation, and I join with all Ohioans and the members of this Chamber in \nwishing MG Ed Mechenbier a happy and successful retirement. May God \nbless him and his family as they enter this new phase in their \nlives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/17/senate-section/article/S6995-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6995]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/17/senate-section/article/S6995-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6995]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/17/senate-section/article/S6995-3", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6995]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:06 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 4513.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. GRAHAM of Florida (for himself and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 2535. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nmodernize the medicare program by ensuring that appropriate preventive \nservices are covered under such program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I am very pleased to introduce \nthe Medicare Preventive Services Coverage Act of 2004, and to be joined \nby Senator Richard Durbin.\n  This legislation would change the basic charter of Medicare to one \nthat not only diagnoses and treats, but also prevents illness.\n  On July 30, 1965, Medicare was created under title 18 of the Social \nSecurity Act to provide health insurance coverage for the elderly.\n  The coverage provided through the program was limited to diagnostic \nand treatment services that were considered reasonable and necessary.\n  There was little demand to cover preventive services under Medicare \nor any other health plan at that time because we were not yet cognizant \nof the vital role of prevention on the health and quality of human \nlife.\n  The basic charter of Medicare reflects this lack of understanding.\n  However, since Medicare's inception, we have learned a lot about the \nenormous burden of chronic disease on our Nation.\n  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, \nmore than 1.7 million Americans die of a chronic disease each year, \naccounting for about 70 percent of all deaths.\n  Not only does chronic disease lead to a majority of deaths and \ndisabilities in America, it also accounts for about 75 percent of \nhealth care costs each year, placing a huge economic demand on our \nNation.\n  Medicare bears a lion's share of this cost. In 2003, Medicare spent \nnearly $7,000 per beneficiary; much of this cost is attributable to \ntreating chronic illnesses.\n  The percentage of the population over age 65 has increased \ndramatically and will continue to do so. This will place an even \ngreater economic burden on Medicare.\n  What is the bottom line? In short, Medicare cannot afford this \nspiraling cost.\n  The good news is that we now have decades of research demonstrating \nthat although chronic diseases are the most common and costly of all \nhealth problems, they are also the most preventable.\n  For example, according to the CDC regular eye exams and timely \ntreatment could prevent up to 90 percent of diabetes related blindness.\n  Eye chart screening for visual acuity is currently recommended by the \nUnited States Preventive Services Task Force, USPSTF, but is not \ncovered by Meidcare.\n  The impact of prevention on chronic disease is well known by the \nPresident's Secretary for Health and Human Services.\n  HHS Secretary Thompson said in September 2003:\n\n       There is clear evidence that the costs of chronic \n     conditions are enormous, as are the potential savings from \n     preventing them, even if there may not always be agreement on \n     the exact amounts of these cost savings.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       . . . the Nation simply cannot afford not to step up \n     efforts to reverse the growing prevalence of chronic \n     disorders. Resources and energy need to be marshaled in all \n     sectors and at all levels of society.\n\n  Partnership for Prevention, a Washington, DC, think tank on health \npolicy takes Thompson's comments one step further. A recent Partnership \nreport makes the following logical assumption:\n\n       As the primary source of health insurance coverage for \n     millions of older Americans and persons with permanent \n     disabilities, Medicare has the potential to have a \n     substantial impact on the health of beneficiaries by \n     promoting and covering cost-effective preventive services.\n\n  Congress has added coverage for some preventive services over the \nlast two decades, including the flu vaccine, mammograms, and cancer \nscreening.\n  As HHS does not have the authority to add preventive services to \nMedicare--despite the growing body of evidence that has proved their \nefficacy--these benefits were only added to Medicare because of \ncongressional action.\n  The benefits that Congress have added are extremely important, and I \nam glad that we have taken the steps to make them available to our \nseniors.\n  However, the congressional process is slow, and subject to political \nwinds and influences that are not always based purely in science.\n  The legislation I am introducing would change the basic charter of \nMedicare from a program focused on diagnosing and treating illnesses to \none that also prevents illnesses by giving the Department of Health and \nHuman Services the authority to make coverage decisions for preventive \nservices.\n  Why change the current system of passing legislation each time we \nwant to add coverage of preventive service to Medicare? There are some \nvery logical reasons.\n  The reliance on Congress to cover preventive services has resulted \nin: Coverage for only half of clinical preventive services that experts \nrecommend for the 65+ age group; coverage that not only fails to keep \nup with changes in scientific evidence but is often in consistent with \nauthoritative recommendations; a confusing array of cost sharing \nrequirements across covered preventive services; and lack of coverage \nof some preventive services that provide great health benefits in favor \nof others that do not meet current evidence standards as a result of \nvocal advocacy groups.\n  Luckily, the fundamental reform of the program that I am proposing \ndoes not require extensive statutory or bureaucratic change.\n  Medicare already has a process in place for the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services to make coverage decisions on diagnostic, treatment, \nand durable medical equipment options.\n  My bill would authorize the Secretary to make coverage decisions on \npreventive services using that same process, based on the \nrecommendations of the federally-convened United States Preventive \nServices Task Force, USPSTF, and other groups.\n  This authorization would not entail dramatic new administrative \nexpenses or a major reorganization of CMS coverage processes and staff.\n  My legislation would put preventive services on an equal footing with \ndiagnostic and treatment services by allowing the Secretary to make \ncoverage decisions for all services needed to prevent, diagnose, and \ntreat illness.\n  Providing beneficiaries with the most cost-effective and current \npreventive services should no longer require an ``Act of Congress.''\n  It should, instead, require the insight of the experts in the field, \nand be based on the same careful process HHS is currently using.\n  Let us untie their hands and improve the lives of our Medicare \nbeneficiaries by building coverage of preventive services into the \ncurrently established coverage decision process.\n  This legislation is supported by the following groups: American \nCollege of Preventive Medicine; HealthPartners; Deafness Research \nFoundation; Partnership for Prevention; American Dietetic Association; \nAmerican Public Health Association; Families USA; American Physical \nTherapy Association; American Academy of Family Physicians; United \nCerebral Palsy Association; National Mental Health Association; \nCampaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, and the Emergency Department Practice \nManagement Association.\n  If Medicare were created today, it would certainly not exclude \ncoverage of preventive services.\n  Today we know how important preventive services are; they save money \nand lives. Let us give Medicare the authority to do its job.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in sponsoring this important piece of \nlegislation.\n\n[[Page S7001]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to print letters of support from the above-\nlisted groups in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   American Public\n\n\n                                           Health Association,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 1, 2004.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: On behalf of the American Public \n     Health Association (APHA), the largest and oldest \n     organization of public health professionals in the country, \n     representing more than 50,000 members from over 50 public \n     health occupations, I write in support of the Medicare \n     Preventive Services Coverage Act of 2004.\n       As outlined in position paper 7633, ``Policy Statement on \n     Prevention,'' APHA has long supported measures to \n     increasingly utilize the fund preventive services in federal \n     health programs. In this vein, the Medicare Preventive \n     Services Coverage Act of 2004 demonstrates a significant \n     commitment to addressing the underlying factors responsible \n     for the underutilization of prevention strategies that \n     optimize the health and independence of the elderly by \n     granting the Secretary the authority to approve Medicare \n     coverage of preventive services based on recommendations of \n     the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and other groups. By \n     allowing decisions about coverage of preventive services to \n     be made in the same timely, evidence-based manner as other \n     services under Medicare, the legislation would enable \n     Medicare to take a vital step towards focusing more on \n     disease prevention, which is cost-effective and has the \n     ability to prevent or delay the occurrence of chronic \n     disease.\n       Since the creation of Medicare, the American Public Health \n     Association has supported measures to protect Medicare \n     beneficiaries against significant financial exposure that \n     imposes barriers to the receipt of needed care. The \n     provisions of the Medicare Preventive Services Act of 2004 \n     that aim to eliminate co-payments and deductibles from all \n     future preventive benefits serve to ensure that Medicare \n     beneficiaries will not be restricted from accessing needed \n     preventive medical care because of financial hardship.\n       Thank you for your attention to and leadership on this \n     important public health issue. We look forward to working \n     with you to move legislation forward this year.\n           Sincerely\n                                    Georges C. Benjamin, MD, FACP,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     June 2, 2004.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: Congratulations on the introduction of \n     your new legislation to provide a permanent solution to \n     Medicare's long-standing failure to cover appropriate \n     preventive health services. Families USA, the health consumer \n     advocacy organization, strongly endorses your effort.\n       Currently, life-saving and life-improving preventive \n     screening services have been covered only by an act of \n     Congress--and usually only after long and difficult debates. \n     Your proposal will place this basic scientific and technical \n     issue in the excellent medical staff of the Centers for \n     Medicare and Medicaid Services, where decisions can be made \n     on a more timely, professional and scientific basis. We \n     believe that this will help ensure that important preventive \n     care services will be implemented in a more timely and \n     rational way. The result will be an improvement in the \n     quality of life of Medicare beneficiaries.\n       Congratulations again on this proposal--one of a long-line \n     of creative and helpful health initiatives that you have \n     championed in your outstanding Senate career.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Ronald F. Pollack,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 American Physical\n\n\n                                          Therapy Association,\n\n                                     Alexandria, VA, June 2, 2004.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: On behalf of the 64,000 members of the \n     American Physical Therapy Association (APTA), I commend you \n     for your efforts to promote the full continuum of health care \n     for our nation's seniors and persons with disabilities served \n     by the Medicare program. APTA appreciates the introduction of \n     your legislation, the Medicare Preventative Services Coverage \n     Act of 2004 and fully supports its enactment by the 108th \n     Congress. Prevention services are an essential part of the \n     health care continuum that needs better integration into the \n     Medicare program, and your legislation goes a long way toward \n     achieving that objective.\n       Physical therapists provide prevention services that \n     forestall or prevent functional decline and the need for more \n     intense care. Through timely and appropriate screening, \n     examination, evaluation, diagnosis, prognosis, and \n     intervention, physical therapists frequently reduce or \n     eliminate the need for more costly forms of care and also may \n     shorten or even eliminate institutional stays. Physical \n     therapists are actively involved in promoting health, \n     wellness and fitness initiatives, including the provision of \n     services and education of patients that stimulate the public \n     to engage in healthy behaviors. An example of physical \n     therapist involvement in preventive services is the use of \n     therapeutic interventions to improve strength, mobility, and \n     balance to reduce falls that often lead to more costly health \n     care and disability under Medicare.\n       Thank you for your commitment to improving the Medicare \n     program. The addition of appropriate preventative services to \n     the Medicare program will help our nations' seniors and \n     persons with disability lead more healthy and productive \n     lives within our communities. Please feel free to contact \n     Justin Moore on APTA's Government Affairs staff at \n     justinmoore@apta.org or 703/706-3162, if you have any \n     questions or need additional information.\n           Sicnerely,\n                                       Ben F. Massey, Jr., PT, MA,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               American Academy of\n\n\n                                            Family Physicians,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 9, 2004.\n     Hon. Robert Graham,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: Thank you for the opportunity to \n     review the draft of your legislation, the Medicare Preventive \n     Services Coverage Act. On behalf of the 93,700 members of the \n     American Academy of Family Physicians, I am pleased to inform \n     you that the AAFP strongly endorses the bill, and we \n     congratulate you for your efforts on behalf of the nation's \n     seniors.\n       This legislation would help make Medicare more responsive \n     to the people that it directly serves. By allowing CMS to \n     cover preventive services that are based on evidence and \n     current science and that have been reviewed and approved by \n     the United States Preventive Services Task Force and other \n     appropriate organizations, the bill helps direct Medicare \n     toward proven health care services that will keep seniors \n     healthier. The AAFP commends your commitment to evidence-\n     based measures that will prevent accidents and illness and \n     provide more effective health care. We believe that sound \n     science should always be the basis of medical decisions.\n       The Academy would urge you and your colleagues in Congress \n     to consider giving CMS the authority to review current \n     preventive services in the light of the U.S. Preventive \n     Services Task Force recommendations and to alter \n     reimbursement accordingly. And we would also suggest that \n     Congress might want to make more explicit the agency's \n     authority to review and revise payments as the evidence of \n     previously approved services changes.\n       Thank you, Senator Graham, for your commitment to the \n     health of Medicare patients and for your leadership in \n     improving this important program that serves them.\n           Sincerely,\n                                       James C. Martin, MD, FAAFP,\n     Board Chair.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               American College of\n\n\n                                          Preventive Medicine,\n\n                                                     June 4, 2004.\n       The American College of Preventive Medicine (ACPM) is very \n     pleased to support Senator Bob Graham's bill granting the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services the authority to \n     approve Medicare coverage of preventive medical services from \n     the recommendations of the United States Preventive Services \n     Task Force (USPSTF) and other appropriate organizations.\n       As the representative organization for preventive medicine \n     physicians, ACPM understands the potential long-term benefits \n     from clinical preventive services supported by evidence to \n     have a beneficial impact on survival and quality of life. As \n     the population of the United States ages, preventive services \n     will become the best strategy to keep people healthy and to \n     conserve medical expenditures.\n       Therefore, the ACPM offers its full support of Senator \n     Graham's proposed legislation to include preventive services \n     under Medicare coverage.\n                                                       Mike Barry,\n     Deputy Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                American Dietetic Association,\n\n                                        Chicago, IL, June 2, 2004.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: The American Dietetic Association \n     (ADA) is the largest organization of food and nutrition \n     professionals in the U.S. We promote optimal nutrition and \n     well being of all people, by relying on evidence-based \n     practices and policies. To that end, ADA is pleased to \n     support the Medicare Preventive Services Coverage Act of \n     2004.\n       Nutrition is a critical element to any comprehensive health \n     care program and in particular preventive services. According \n     to the Department of Health and Human Services, 40 percent of \n     Americans age 40 to 74 suffer from pre-diabetes. The evidence \n     shows that proper nutrition and physical activity can prevent \n     many, if not most of these Americans from developing type II \n     diabetes. In cardiovascular care, the evidence shows that \n     proper preventive nutrition intervention can slow or reverse \n     conditions such as hypertension or dyslipidemia. \n     Unfortunately, Medicare does not recognize the importance of \n     preventive care in general and preventive nutrition therapy \n     specifically.\n       When Congress passed the Medicare Modernization Act last \n     year, it included a new provision for preventive care under \n     Sec. 611,\n\n[[Page S7002]]\n\n     the Initial Preventive Physical Examination. While referral \n     to medical nutrition therapy is specifically mentioned in the \n     bill, CMS is interpreting this new language as limited to \n     only those diseases (diabetes and renal) that are already \n     eligible for MNT. As a result of this interpretation, \n     patients diagnosed during the initial preventive physical \n     exam as having pre-diabetes, must wait until their conditions \n     progress to type II diabetes before Medicare will cover \n     nutrition therapy.\n       Such an approach to preventive care is poor health policy \n     and poor fiscal management of the program. Your Medicare \n     Preventive Services Coverage Act if enacted, will promote \n     preventive care within Medicare to the status it deserves. \n     ADA commends your efforts and foresight.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Ronald E. Smith,\n     Director of Government Relations.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      Campaign for\n\n\n                                            Tobacco-Free Kids,\n\n                                                    June 14, 2004.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     U.S. Senator, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: The Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids is \n     pleased to lend its support to your bill, The Medicare \n     Preventive Services Coverage Act of 2004.\n       This bill will help provide the scientific foundation and \n     evidence-based decisions that are critical for ensuring that \n     the Medicare program provides the most effective preventive \n     services to all Medicare beneficiaries. This bill will help \n     shift the emphasis of the Medicare program from treating \n     illness to one where the focus is more on wellness, health \n     promotion and prevention. With nearly three-quarters of all \n     illnesses in this country related to preventable conditions \n     such as tobacco use, lack of proper nutrition and physical \n     fitness, obesity and diabetes, it makes perfect health and \n     fiscal sense to enact such changes into the Medicare program.\n       With the recent inclusion of prescription drug coverage to \n     the Medicare program, including coverage for prescription \n     tobacco use cessation medications such as nicotine nasal \n     spray and bupropion SR, this bill represents a tremendous \n     opportunity to enhance and compliment this new coverage \n     through the provision of tobacco use cessation counseling \n     services. According to the U.S. Preventive Services Task \n     Force, next to childhood immunizations, tobacco cessation \n     counseling is the most clinically effective preventive \n     service that we have. Furthermore, we know that counseling \n     services double the number of successful quit smoking \n     attempts versus people who try to quit ``cold turkey''. And \n     when combined with medications, there is nearly a four-fold \n     increase in successful quit attempts. With about 10 percent \n     of all Medicare beneficiaries still smoking, about 4.5 \n     million people, such a benefit would have a tremendous impact \n     on the health and quality of life of our nation's seniors.\n       Again, the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids is proud to \n     support this important piece of public health legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Matthew L. Myers,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Partnership For Prevention,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 2, 2004.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     U.S. Senator, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: Thank you for requesting Partnership \n     for Prevention's comments on Medicare policy concerning \n     disease prevention and health promotion.\n       Partnership strongly recommends that Congress modernize \n     Medicare by directing the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \n     Services to make coverage decisions for disease prevention \n     and health promotion services based on evidence-based \n     recommendations such as those of the U.S. Preventive Services \n     Task Force and the Advisory Committee on Immunization \n     Practices. This was one of the principal policy \n     recommendations in Partnership's 2003 report, A Better \n     Medicare for Healthier Seniors: Recommendations to Modernize \n     Medicare's Prevention Policies. We understand that you plan \n     to introduce legislation that would bring about such a policy \n     change.\n       When Congress created Medicare in 1965, it designed the \n     program based on the knowledge of health, medicine and health \n     care at that time. Thus, Medicare focused on hospitalization \n     and visits to doctors' offices to treat or diagnose seniors \n     who were already showing signs of illness. Medicine has made \n     great progress since then, including development of proven \n     ways to prevent disease and promote longer, healthier lives. \n     But Medicare has consistently lagged behind the curve, \n     failing to cover proven disease prevention and health \n     promotion services or providing coverage years later than \n     private insurers.\n       Allowing Medicare coverage decisions for preventive \n     services to be made following a similar process as diagnosis \n     and treatment decisions is an important step in modernizing \n     Medicare. It is also critical that these coverage decisions \n     be informed by systematic reviews of evidence conducted by \n     independent experts, such as the U.S. Preventive Services \n     Task Force. We understand that your bill would address these \n     issues and enable Medicare to keep pace with progress in \n     preventive medicine and health promotion.\n       Partnership's Better Medicare report also noted that use \n     rates for most preventive services that are covered by \n     Medicare fall short of national targets, in part because of a \n     confusing array of cost sharing requirements, such as \n     deductibles and co-payments for these services. We understand \n     that your bill would eliminate these impediments for \n     preventive services covered in the future.\n       Most Americans understand that it is preferable to help \n     people stay healthy instead of waiting to treat them after \n     they become sick. It is in our nation's interest for seniors \n     to be healthy instead of infirm, active instead of \n     hospitalized, productive instead of costly, independent \n     instead of dependent. Cost-saving and cost-effective disease \n     prevention and health promotion are sound investments for our \n     country.\n       Thank you again for requesting our comments on these \n     important facets of Medicare policy.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   John M. Clymer,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 Deafness Research Foundation,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 2, 2004.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: On behalf of the Deafness Research \n     Foundation and World Council on Hearing Health, we fully \n     support the Amendment to Title XVII of the Social Security \n     Act to modernize the Medicare program so as to ensure \n     preventive services be covered under the program.\n       The Deafness Research Foundation and its public education \n     and advocacy arm, called the World Council on Hearing \n     Health's mission is to make a lifetime of hearing possible \n     for all people through quality research, public education and \n     advocacy. We espouse the program platforms of detection, \n     prevention, intervention and research about hearing loss. \n     Therefore, we fully support your draft bill that will allow \n     for the Secretary of Health and Human Services be granted the \n     authority to approve Medicare coverage of preventive services \n     based on recommendations of the U.S. Preventive Services Task \n     Force and other organizations if enacted.\n       Early detection of hearing loss through regular hearing \n     checkups (at least once every two years) from childhood to \n     adulthood is a key to early intervention as needed. For \n     babies and children it is especially important so their \n     educational, emotional and social development is not halted \n     nor compromised. In adults, early detection of hearing loss \n     is the best prevention against further damaging one's hearing \n     not to mention the impact hearing loss can have on one's \n     career and quality of life. In the elderly, the ability to \n     diagnose hearing loss early on is an imperative to combat \n     misdiagnoses of dementia and senility.\n       We commend you on taking the initiative to propose this \n     bill and we will tell the 40,000 donors and members of \n     Deafness Research Foundation to fervently follow its \n     progress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Susan Greco,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     June 3, 2004.\n     Hon. Robert Graham,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: I am writing on behalf of \n     HealthPartners in support of the ``Medicare Preventive \n     Services Coverage Act of 2004''. HealthPartners is a \n     consumer-governed family of nonprofit Minnesota health care \n     organizations focused on improving the health of its members, \n     its patients and the community. HealthPartners and its \n     related organizations provide health care services, insurance \n     and HMO coverage to more than 670,000 members. The key \n     features of this bill would go far in helping to improve the \n     health of Medicare enrollees.\n       This bill would put disease prevention on a level playing \n     field with disease detection and treatment under Medicare. It \n     would also permit preventive service coverage decisions to be \n     based on evidence. We believe strongly that appropriate \n     preventive services should be included in the Medicare \n     benefit set and that those benefits should be evidence-based. \n     Using the United States Preventive Services Task Force (and \n     other appropriate organizations') recommendations as a guide \n     for the addition of preventive services is an excellent step.\n       We encourage the Secretary and Congress to continue to \n     focus benefits in both the Medicare and Medicaid programs on \n     evidence based medicine. Evidence based care provides the \n     structure for the right services to be delivered at the right \n     time in the right location for enrollees of all ages. This, \n     in turn, supports achieving the six aims for care as outlined \n     by the Institute of Medicine: care that is patient-centered, \n     timely, effective, efficient, equitable and safe. We support \n     your efforts to achieve these ends.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                           George Isham, M.D.,\n\n                                              Medical Director and\n     Chief Health Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n             Emergency Department Practice Management Association,\n                                        McLean, VA, June 16, 2004.\n     Hon. Senator Graham,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: Thank you for the opportunity to \n     review your draft legislation, the Medicare Preventive \n     Services Coverage Act. On behalf of the Emergency Department \n     Practice Management Association's members, we congratulate \n     you on your efforts in\n\n[[Page S7003]]\n\n     this area and strongly support this legislation as it \n     reflects sound health policy.\n       EDPMA members work with their hospital partners to provide \n     quality patient care in the emergency departments across the \n     country. As you know, overcrowding in emergency departments \n     is a serious problem. By expanding Medicare's coverage of \n     preventative services, we believe that Medicare patients will \n     have incentives to get treatment in less acute settings.\n       Emergency departments are a key element of the nation's \n     safety net. While we support expansion of Medicare benefits, \n     we believe it is of critical importance that Medicare's \n     physician fee schedule appropriately capture emergency \n     physician's uncompensated care costs. We look forward to \n     working with you to address this problem.\n       Like you, EPDMA is dedicated to providing quality care to \n     Medicare's patients. We join you in support of this \n     legislation and appreciate your on-going leadership in health \n     policy.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Emily R.

Bob Graham,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: On behalf of the National Mental \n     Health Association (NMHA), I am writing to commend you for \n     introducing the Medicare Preventive Services Coverage Act of \n     2004. Prevention and early detection of mental illness are \n     critical components to ensuring overall well-being that have \n     long been overlooked, particularly with regard to Medicare \n     beneficiaries. Your bill represents a major step forward in \n     recognizing that mental illness can be prevented and \n     successfully treated, especially if detected early. \n     Prevention services provided through this legislation will \n     undoubtedly lead to improved access to and utilization of \n     mental health treatment among a population in which mental \n     illness has been severely under-diagnosed.\n       NMHA is the nation's oldest and largest advocacy \n     organization addressing all aspects of mental health and \n     mental illness. With more than 340 affiliates nationwide, we \n     work to improve the mental health of all Americans through \n     advocacy, education, research, and service. Prevention of \n     mental illness is a key element of our mission, and we are \n     heartened by your efforts to ensure that Medicare \n     beneficiaries receive a full complement of preventive \n     services, including mental health services.\n       As you know, mental illness affects a very large segment of \n     the Medicare population, but few receive the treatment they \n     need. According to the Surgeon General's 1999 Report on \n     Mental Health, some 20 percent of those 55 and older \n     experience specific mental disorders that are not part of \n     normal aging, including phobias, obsessive-compulsive \n     disorder, and depression, and 40 percent of those on Medicare \n     because of a disability, face mental illness. Major \n     depression is particularly prevalent among older Americans: \n     in primary care settings, 37 percent of seniors display \n     symptoms of depression.\n       However, all too often seniors and people with disabilities \n     struggle with mental illness alone and without treatment and \n     support. It is estimated that only half of older adults who \n     acknowledge mental health problems actually are treated. A \n     very small percentage of older adults--less than 3 percent--\n     report seeing mental health professionals for treatment. This \n     lack of care has tragic consequences as illustrated by the \n     fact that Americans 65 and older have the highest rate of \n     suicide in the country, accounting for 20 percent of suicide \n     deaths.\n       The President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health \n     found that ``[t]he number of older adults with mental \n     illnesses is expected to double to 15 million in the next 30 \n     years [and that] [m]ental illnesses have a significant impact \n     on the health and functioning of older people and are \n     associated with increased health care use and higher costs.'' \n     New Freedom Commission on Mental Health, Achieving the \n     Promise: Transforming Mental Health Care in America. Final \n     Report, p. 59. The Commission recommended that ``[a]ny effort \n     to strengthen or improve the Medicare and Medicaid programs \n     should offer beneficiaries options to effectively use the \n     most up-to-date [mental health] treatments and services.'' \n     Id., p. 26.\n       Early detection and intervention services are essential for \n     preventing mental health problems from compounding and for \n     lessening long-term disability that can result from mental \n     illness. The President's Commission stated that early \n     assessment and treatment are critical across the life span \n     and found that ``[n]ew understanding of the brain indicates \n     that early identification and intervention can sharply \n     improve outcomes and that longer periods of abnormal thoughts \n     and behavior have cumulative effects and can limit capacity \n     for recovery.'' Id., p. 57. Numerous studies have indicated \n     that prevention and early intervention services for seniors \n     result in improved mental health conditions, positive \n     behavioral changes, and decreased use of inpatient care.\n       Thank you again for introducing the Medicare Preventive \n     Services Coverage Act of 2004. By incorporating preventive \n     mental health services into the Medicare program, this bill \n     will substantially improve access to treatment for a \n     population with tremendous mental health needs.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          Michael M. Faenza, MSSW,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: United Cerebral Palsy would like to \n     lend our wholehearted support to the Medicare Preventive \n     Services Coverage Act of 2004 that would amend the Social \n     Security Act and the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement \n     and Modernization Act of 2003 to make a broad array of \n     preventive health care services a standard part of Medicare. \n     To date, the Congress has added selected preventive services \n     to Medicare but has not included other services that are \n     proven effective; nor has it encouraged Medicare to take a \n     comprehensive approach to disease prevention and health \n     promotion for American seniors and people with disabilities. \n     Passage of this legislation would mean that, for the first \n     time and to the benefit of millions of Americans, prevention \n     would be placed on a level playing field with disease \n     detection, diagnosis and treatment under Medicare.\n       We thank you for recognizing that prevention is a good \n     investment, diminishing disability and discomfort, leading to \n     less time spent in hospitals and in nursing homes and more \n     time spent at home and in the community. In many cases, \n     effective preventive services will generate cost savings for \n     Medicare, as well as providing beneficiaries with more \n     productive years of life.\n       About one in eight of Medicare's 40+ million beneficiaries, \n     about 5 million people, are people with disabilities under \n     age 65, people who have worked and become disabled, or who \n     are the adult dependents or survivors of eligible workers. \n     According to the National Economic Council, these \n     beneficiaries are 35 percent less likely to have any sort of \n     employer-based coverage, compared to elderly beneficiaries \n     who sometimes have coverage through retiree health plans. \n     Thus, access to any prevention benefits outside their \n     Medicare coverage is severely limited.\n       For individuals with disabilities, prevention is truly no \n     less important than medical treatment. A primary disability \n     can often mean that a person is extremely at risk for, or \n     susceptible to, secondary health or disabling conditions. \n     Compounding this fact is the fact that many of these \n     secondary conditions may be low-incidence conditions that \n     affect only a small population and would, therefore, not \n     necessarily be those that come to the attention of Congress \n     when new coverage decisions are made.\n       Additionally, as people with a wide range of disabilities \n     grow older, the impact of their disability may lead to \n     premature occurrence of age-related conditions. Clearly, the \n     Medicare Preventive Services Coverage Acts of 2004 would be \n     of great assistance to these beneficiaries by allowing \n     decisions about coverage of preventive services to be made in \n     the same manner as coverage decisions for other services, \n     making preventive service coverage decisions more timely, \n     individualized and evidence-based.\n       We are also pleased that the bill would eliminate co-\n     payments and deductibles from all future preventive benefits. \n     There is currently a confusing array of cost-sharing \n     requirements across Medicare's covered preventive benefits, \n     and Medicare beneficiaries with disabilities are more likely \n     to have lower incomes. By definition, people receiving \n     disability insurance often are unable to engage in full-time \n     work due to their conditions, and more than three-fourths of \n     these beneficiaries have income below 200 percent of the \n     poverty level, compared to half of elderly beneficiaries.\n       United Cerebral Palsy wishes you the best and offers our \n     support in gaining passage of this critical legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Stephen Bennett,\n\n                            President and Chief Executive Officer,\n                                            United Cerebral Palsy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 2536. A bill to enumerate the responsibilities of the Officer for \nCivil Rights and Civil Liberties of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, to require the Inspector General of the Department of \nHomeland Security to designate a senior official to investigate civil \nrights complaints, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. COLLINS. Mr. President, today Senator Wyden and I are introducing \nthe Homeland Security Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Protection Act \nof 2004. It has been a pleasure to work with my colleague from Oregon \non this legislation to strengthen protections for civil rights and \ncivil liberties. In the wake of the terrorist attacks on September 11, \n2001, during his joint address to Congress, the President called on all \nAmericans to ``uphold the values of America and remember why so many \nhave come here. We're in a fight for our principles, and our first \nresponsibility is to live by them.''\n  In response to the need to safeguard our homeland, Congress enacted \nthe Homeland Security Act of 2002 that\n\n[[Page S7004]]\n\ncreated the Department of Homeland Security, the most significant \ngovernment restructuring in more than 50 years. But in focusing our \nattention on protecting the homeland from future terrorist attacks, we \nalso must ensure that we do not trample on the very values that the \nterrorists seek to destroy. In enacting the Homeland Security Act, \nCongress understood the importance of providing checks and balances to \nprotect civil rights and civil liberties. To this end, Congress created \nwithin the Department three positions devoted wholly or in part to \nensuring respect for civil liberties as the Department carries out its \nmandate to protect our homeland. These positions are the Officer for \nCivil Rights and Civil Liberties, the Privacy Officer, and the \nDepartment's Inspector General. These three officials have crucial \nroles in assessing actions of the Department that may affect personal \nprivacy, civil rights, and civil liberties.\n  The nature of the mission of the Department of Homeland Security \nmakes safeguards especially important. The Department is now our \ncountry's biggest law enforcement agency. It has more Federal officers \nwith arrest and firearm authority than the Department of Justice. In \naddition, DHS law enforcement personnel have contact with thousands of \npeople every day. In this post 9/11 world, DHS law enforcement \npersonnel must be especially sensitive to maintaining civil liberties \nas they work to strengthen security and detect and deter terrorist \nattacks.\n  I am pleased that the leadership of the Department recognizes the \nfundamental importance of protecting the rights of all of us while \nfighting terrorism. Under the leadership of Secretary Ridge, the new \nDepartment of Homeland Security has won praise for its commitment to \nthe protection of our freedoms. Secretary Ridge has provided the \nOfficer for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties and the Privacy Officer \nwith the tools they need to be effective. These officials have \nfunctioned at the senior level, regularly providing advice to the \nSecretary and his deputies. The Officer for Civil Rights and Civil \nLiberties, the Privacy Officer and the Inspector General have met \nregularly with organizations concerned about civil liberties, privacy, \nhuman rights, and immigrant rights and have been responsive to their \nconcerns.\n  It is time for Congress to build on the foundation Secretary Ridge \nhas laid in protecting civil rights and civil liberties. I believe the \nHomeland Security Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Protection Act of \n2004 does exactly that.\n  The bill would write into law the activities of the Officer for Civil \nRights and Civil Liberties. As enacted, the Homeland Security Act did \nnot clearly define the duties of that position. Over the past year, \nhowever, a strong Officer, with the support of the Department's \nleadership, has charted an important course for his office. The Officer \nhas worked closely with the senior leadership of the Department. He has \nassisted in the development of departmental policies to ensure that \ncivil liberties are given due consideration. He has overseen compliance \nwith constitutional and other requirements relating to the rights and \nliberties of individuals affected by the Department's programs. He has \ncoordinated with the Privacy Officer to ensure that overlapping privacy \nand civil rights concerns are addressed in a comprehensive way. And he \nhas investigated alleged abuses of civil rights and civil liberties.\n  None of these activities is expressly addressed in the statutory \nlanguage creating the Department, and there is no assurance in the law \nthat future Officers for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties will work so \nenergetically to carry out these vital duties. It is time for the law \nto catch up with practice, and the Homeland Security Civil Rights and \nCivil Liberties Protection Act ensures that goal.\n  The bill also clarifies that the Officer for Civil Rights and Civil \nLiberties as well as the Privacy Officer should report directly to the \nSecretary, and requires coordination between those officers to ensure \nan integrated and comprehensive approach to the important issues they \naddress.\n  The Homeland Security Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Protection Act \nof 2004 strengthens the ability of the Department's Inspector General \nto safeguard civil rights and civil liberties by requiring the DHS \nInspector General to designate a senior official to coordinate \ninvestigation of abuses, ensure public awareness of complaint \nprocedures, and coordinate his or her work with the Officer for Civil \nRights and Civil Liberties. This position is similar to one Congress \ncreated in the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of \nJustice.\n  Finally, the Homeland Security Civil Rights and Civil Liberties \nProtection Act of 2004 amends the mission statement of the Department \nof Homeland Security to ensure that actions taken by the Department to \nprotect the homeland do not diminish civil liberties and civil rights. \nThis important revision places into the statutory language that the \nprotection of civil rights and civil liberties is crucial in this time \nof heightened security.\n  The battle against terror will last for many years, perhaps decades. \nDuring that long struggle, we must continue to secure our nation \nagainst future attacks, but at the same time protect those American \nvalues that define our free society. The Homeland Security Civil Rights \nand Civil Liberties Protection Act of 2004 will strengthen the \nprotection of civil rights and civil liberties and will help to ensure \nthat that protection will continue in the years to come.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2536\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, the threat of terrorism is an unfortunate \nfact of life today, and it is not going to go away any time soon. \nProtecting American citizens against this threat will continue to be an \nessential and urgent task for the foreseeable future.\n  However, I do not believe that fighting terrorism aggressively \nrequires tossing civil liberties protections into the scrap heap. This \nis not an ``either or'' choice. This country's tradition of high \nstandards of civil rights and civil liberties should not and need not \nbecome the first casualty of the war on terrorism.\n  I have made this point repeatedly in the time since the terrorist \nattacks of 9/11. Still, all too often, we have seen well-meaning \ngovernment agencies take the approach of designing a security system or \nprogram first, and worrying about the civil liberties and privacy \nimplications later.\n  I am convinced that the approach of making civil liberties an \nafterthought doesn't work and isn't acceptable. Civil liberties and \nprivacy considerations need to be built into the DNA of the Homeland \nSecurity Department and its various programs.\n  The legislation that created the Homeland Security Department \nincluded some very positive steps in that regard, by creating an \nOfficer for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties and a Privacy Officer.\n  Today, I am joining Senator Collins in introducing new legislation to \nflesh out the role and stature of these key offices within the \nDepartment.\n  Specifically, the legislation would add a reference to civil \nliberties to the statutory mission statement of the Department of \nHomeland Security. It would provide further detail as to the duties of \nthe Officer for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties. It would specify that \nboth the Officer for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties and the Privacy \nOfficer shall report directly to the Secretary. And it would direct the \nDHS Inspector General to designate a point person within the I.G. \noffice to focus expressly on civil liberties matters.\n  None of these items represents a radical departure from the original \nHomeland Security legislation or the current practice of the \ndepartment. Rather, this new bill codifies much of what is already \ngoing on, giving it a firm statutory basis.\n  I hope my colleagues will join Senator Collins and me in supporting \nthis legislation, and in delivering a strong message that civil \nliberties matters remain a core factor in this country's homeland \nsecurity efforts. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself and Mr. Dodd):\n  S. 2538. A bill to provide a grant program to support the \nestablishment and operation of Teachers Institutes; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, \nalong with my colleague from Connecticut, Mr. Dodd, that will \nstrengthen the content and pedagogy knowledge of our present K-12 \nteacher workforce and thus ultimately raise student achievement.\n  My proposal would establish eight new Teacher Professional \nDevelopment Institutes throughout the Nation each year over the next \nfive years based on the model which has been operating at Yale \nUniversity for over 25 years. Every Teacher Institute would consist of \na partnership between an institution of higher education and the local \npublic school system in which a significant proportion of the students \ncome from low-income households. These Institutes will strengthen the \npresent teacher workforce by giving each participant an opportunity to \ngain more sophisticated content knowledge and a chance to develop \ncurriculum units with other colleagues that can be directly applied in \ntheir classrooms. We know that teachers gain confidence and enthusiasm \nwhen they have a deeper understanding of the subject matter that they \nteach and this translates into higher expectations for their students \nand thus, an increase in student achievement.\n  The Teacher Professional Development Institutes are based on the \nYale-New Haven Teachers Institute model that has been in existence \nsince 1978. For over 25 years, the Institute has offered six or seven \nthirteen-session seminars each year, led by Yale faculty, on topics \nthat teachers have selected to enhance their mastery of the \nspecific subject area that they teach. The subject selection process \nbegins with representatives from the Institutes soliciting ideas from \nteachers throughout the school district for topics on which teachers \nfeel they need to have additional preparation, topics that will assist \nthem in preparing materials they need for their students, or topics \nthat will assist them in addressing the standards that the school \ndistrict requires. As a consensus emerges about desired seminar \nsubjects, the Institute director identifies university faculty members \nwith the appropriate expertise, interest and desire to lead the \nseminar. University faculty members, especially those who have led \nInstitute seminars before, may sometimes suggest seminars they would \nlike to lead, and these ideas are circulated by the representatives as \nwell. The final decisions on which seminar topics are offered are \nultimately made by the teachers who participate. In this way, the \nofferings are designed to respond to what teachers believe is needed \nand useful for both themselves and their students.\n\n  The cooperative nature of the Institute seminar planning process \nensures its success: Institutes offer seminars and relevant materials \non topics teachers have identified and feel are needed for their own \npreparation as well as what they know will motivate and engage their \nstudents. Teachers enthusiastically take part in rigorous seminars they \nhave requested, and as part of the program, practice using the \nmaterials they have obtained and developed. This helps ensure that the \nexperience not only increases their preparation in the subjects they \nare assigned to teach, but also their participation in an Institute \nseminar gives them immediate hands-on active learning materials that \ncan be used in the classroom. In short, by allowing teachers to \ndetermine the seminar subjects and providing them the resources to \ndevelop relevant curricula for their classroom and their students, the \nInstitutes empower teachers. Teachers know their students best and they \nknow what should be done to improve schools and increase student \nlearning. The Teacher Professional Development Institutes promote this \nphilosophy.\n  From 1999-2002, the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute launched a \nNational\n\n[[Page S7006]]\n\nDemonstration Project to create comparable Institutes at four diverse \nsites with large concentrations of disadvantaged students. These \ndemonstration projects are located in Pittsburgh, PA, Houston, TX, \nAlbuquerque, NM, and Santa Ana, CA.\n  Follow-up evaluations have earned very positive results from the \nteacher participants in the Yale-New Haven Institute, as well as the \nfour demonstration sites. The data strongly support the conclusion that \nvirtually all teachers felt substantially strengthened in their mastery \nof content knowledge and they also developed increased expectations for \nwhat their students could achieve. In addition, because of their \ninvolvement in the course selection and curriculum development process, \nteacher participants have found these seminars to be especially \nrelevant and useful in their classroom practices. Ninety-five percent \nof all participating teachers reported that the seminars were useful. \nThese Institutes have also served to foster teacher leadership, to \ndevelop supportive teacher networks, to heighten university faculty \ncommitments to improving K-12 public education, and to foster more \npositive partnerships between school districts and institutions of \nhigher education.\n  By some studies, teacher quality is the single most important school-\nrelated factor in determining student achievement. In support of this, \nthe No Child Left Behind Act requires a ``highly qualified'' teacher to \nbe in every classroom by the end of 2005-2006. Effective teacher \nprofessional development programs that focus on subject and pedagogy \nknowledge are a proven method for enhancing the success of a teacher in \nthe classroom and in helping them meet the highly qualified criteria.\n\n  Though a K-12 teacher shortage is forecast in the near-term and many \nnew teachers will be entering our schools, those teachers who are \npresently on the job will do the majority of teaching in the classrooms \nin the very near future. For this reason, it is imperative to invest in \nmethods to strengthen our present teaching workforce. Like many \nprofessions, the quality of our teachers could diminish if their \nprofessional development is neglected. Research has shown that positive \neducational achievements occur when coursework in a teachers' specific \ncontent area is combined with pedagogy techniques. This is what the \nTeacher Professional Development Institutes Act strives to accomplish.\n  The Yale-New Haven Institutes have already proven to be a successful \nmodel for teacher professional development as demonstrated by the high \ncaliper curriculum unit plans that teacher participants have developed \nand placed on the web and by the evaluations that support the \nconclusion that virtually all the teacher participants felt \nsubstantially strengthened in their mastery of content knowledge and \ntheir teaching skills. My proposal would open this opportunity to many \nmore urban teachers throughout the nation.\n  I urge my colleagues to act favorably on this measure. I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2538\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Tribally Controlled Colleges or \nUniversity Assistance Act and the Higher Education Act to improve \nTribal Colleges and Universities, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce \nlegislation to update and improve the Tribally Controlled Colleges or \nUniversity Assistance Act and amend the Indian sections of the Higher \nEducation Act.\n  Indian tribal colleges were first created about 30 years ago in \nresponse to the higher education needs of Native populations living in \nremote and isolated areas of the country where access to higher \neducation is extremely difficult.\n  There are 33 tribally- or Federally-chartered Indian colleges in the \nNation and they do a superb job despite the many obstacles they face.\n  In recent years the cost of higher education has far exceeded the \nrate of inflation. Tribal colleges face other problems as well: a \ngrowing population and growing demand for services; increased demand \nfor additional facilities; geographical isolation; and difficulty \nattracting quality professors to teach.\n  Tribal colleges not only provide a quality higher education but also \nenhance the cultural knowledge, knowledge depositories, college \npreparatory work, and other important educational needs of Indian \ncommunities.\n  Tribal colleges also enhance the economies of tribes. The national \nunemployment rate in the U.S. today is about 5.6 percent, while the \nrate for Native Americans is many times that and in some parts of \nIndian country hovers above 50 percent.\n  Tribal colleges serve as centers for business incubation and small \nbusiness development in order to encourage private business development \nand job creation.\n  Tribal colleges are also being called on to help Indian communities \nin the often-difficult transition from welfare to work. These \ninstitutions also provide education and training to people ready to \njoin the workforce.\n  To continue the vital work of these colleges, the bill I am \nintroducing will provide additional resources and means to develop \nfacilities, increase quality faculty and improve the overall education \nof Indian people within their reservations.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2539\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n               TITLE I--TRIBAL COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES\n\n     SEC. 101.

A bill to protect educational FM radio stations providing \npublic service broadcasting from commercial encroachment; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I stand today to offer a bill to protect \neducational radio stations.\n  Broadcaster Linda Ellerbee has compared radio to a national campfire: \na place where a variety of voices bring us stories, news, opinion, \nculture and entertainment. But it seems these days that those \nrepresenting the biggest business interests have the best seats at that \ncampfire.\n  Current regulations allow commercial broadcasters to move into the \nspaces of some, lower-powered educational stations.\n  Last year the FCC ordered an educational station at a high school in \nPennsylvania to be closed because a commercial broadcaster wanted to \nmove into that space. That high school station had been serving the \nstudents and the community in Havertown, PA for fifty years. But no \nmore. The high school station's voice was silenced. And that same FCC \norder also closed a radio station operated by a school district in \nPrinceton, NJ. Both stations lost their licenses so a commercial \nbroadcaster could get a frequency closer to the very profitable radio \nmarket in Philadelphia.\n  In my State of Washington, a high school station that has served a \nSeattle community for 35 years is now threatened with closure. That's \nbecause a commercial broadcaster located in another State wants to \nrelocate to a larger city to increase its profits at the expense of the \nstudents of Mercer Island High School and the community the station \nserves. And in this case, the school's station also serves an important \ntool in the lives of those working in the local music community. The \nstation focuses on introducing new and local bands to the airways. \nThese artists are frequently later picked up for airplay by other radio \nstations. Few stations across the U.S. perform this role in the music \nindustry. No other station serves this role so well in the Seattle \nmusic community.\n  If the FCC allows this move, it could be worth millions to the \ncommercial broadcasters. But what is the cost to the local community \nwhen this voice is silenced? What is the educational cost to the \nstudents at this high school? What benefits and experiences will they \nbe losing in the future?\n  This is a classic example of commercial interests trumping the public \nservice interest in preserving local educational broadcasters. These \nsmall public service stations usually don't have\n\n[[Page S7010]]\n\nanyone to stand up for them. Since the 1970's, we have seen more than a \nhundred of these stations disappear, to be replaced by larger, often \nnational broadcasters, with little if any connection to the local \ncommunity.\n  The examples I've given you here today are not the only ones. Radio \nstations run by universities in Pittsburgh and North Carolina are also \nvulnerable to similar attempts.\n  This is why I am introducing the Educational Radio Protection Act.\n  My legislation is very simple: educational stations that are able to \nmeet certain qualifying standards, similar to the requirements for \nprimary, Class A, stations on FM radio, will be given the same \nprotected status that these primary stations receive.\n  This is an important measure to protect community broadcasters. And \nthe bottom line is that commercial broadcasters won't be able to bump \nthese educational stations off the radio dial.\n  I thank you for the time today to discuss an issue that really is a \ncornerstone of democracy. For only in a democracy are the voices of the \nmany heard to bring about a functioning government. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this bill, and yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Brownback, Mrs. Hutchison, and \n        Mr. Allen):\n  S. 2541. A bill to reauthorize and restructure the National \nAeronautics and Space Administration, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by \nSenators Brownback, Hutchison, and Allen in introducing legislation to \nre-authorize the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. This \nlegislation marks the beginning of a new age of exploration, and the \nextension of humanity's quest for knowledge to a manned mission to \nMars.\n  NASA is currently responsible for a number of programs that create \ngreater knowledge about the Earth and the universe around us. As we \nspeak today, the two robots, Spirit and Opportunity, are exploring \ncraters on Mars in search of ancient lake beds. The Hubble telescope \ncontinues to show us new discoveries about the universe. NASA \nsatellites also help us to develop a better scientific understanding of \nthe Earth's atmosphere and its response to natural and human-induced \nchanges. NASA is in the process of developing airplanes with morphing \nwings that will change shape during flight.\n  Despite all of these wondrous achievements, NASA is an agency in \nsearch of a new mission. For many Americans, the Apollo landings remain \na moment of inspiration, but also a fading memory of the past. Many \nspace enthusiasts have complained that the manned space program has \nbeen stuck in low Earth orbit and harnessed to a costly space station \nand aging Space Shuttle infrastructure. Just last year, we again \nwitnessed the inherent danger in manned spaceflight, and some \nquestioned the need for such a risky and expensive program.\n  To his credit, President Bush announced on the day of the Columbia \ntragedy that ``our journey into space will go on.'' In January, the \nPresident offered a bold new space vision and made a firm commitment to \nreturn the Space Shuttle to flight, finish construction of the \nInternational Space Station, and return astronauts to the Moon in \npreparation for a manned mission to Mars. This bill would authorize \nthese activities consistent with the President's overall requested \nbudget amounts, and set the nation firmly on a course for manned \nexploration beyond low Earth orbit.\n  However, we also have learned from the mistakes of the past. \nUnfortunately, NASA's recent history of managing projects, such as the \nX-33 and X-34, has been full of disappointment and failure. Many \nMembers have seen the wisdom of President Reagan's adage to ``trust, \nbut verify,'' when analyzing NASA's budget numbers. With these lessons \nin mind, the bill contains a number of provisions to ensure that NASA \nstays on track.\n  The bill would require the submission of a baseline technical \nrequirements document and life cycle cost estimate, so that Congress \ncan find out exactly what is required to implement the President's \nvision and begin to determine its cost. The bill also would require an \nindustrial assessment of the private sector's ability to support manned \nmissions to the Moon and Mars, and a commercialization plan to identify \nopportunities for the private sector to participate in future missions. \nMost importantly, the bill would require quarterly life cycle reports \non major systems of the new initiative, and include cost-control \nmeasures when the cost overruns of these systems exceed 15 percent and \n25 percent over the total life cycle cost of the system.\n  The bill also would codify many of the recommendations of the \nColumbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB). Admiral Gehman and the \nother board members did an admirable job in thoroughly investigating \nthe causes of this tragic accident. The bill would establish a lessons-\nlearned and best practices program to ensure that NASA does not repeat \nthe mistakes of the past. In addition, the Office of Safety and Mission \nAssurance is given independent funding and direct line authority over \nthe entire Space Shuttle Safety organization. An Independent Technical \nEngineering Authority is established within NASA with its own budgetary \nline to maintain technical standards, be the sole waiver-granting \nauthority for technical standards, and perform other tasks. The bill \nalso would ensure that the Independent Technical Engineering Authority \nwould recertify the Space Shuttle orbiters for operation prior to any \noperations beyond 2010. The bill would include an assessment of NASA's \nculture and organization, and an action plan to fix the cultural and \norganizational problems that the CAIB identified as a major cause of \nthe accident. The men and women of the Columbia gave their lives to \nfurther America's knowledge of the Earth and the stars, and we should \nhonor their memory by ensuring that such an accident never occurs \nagain.\n  In addition, the bill would address the problems concerning the \nHubble Space Telescope. As my colleagues know, NASA has indicated that \nit cannot use the Space Shuttle for another human mission to service \nthis national treasure. Both NASA and the National Academy of Sciences \nare reviewing options for using robots and other means to save the \ntelescope. Sixty days after the National Academy releases its report, \nthe Administrator would be directed to report to Congress on the future \nservicing options for Hubble and how much it will cost.\n  I realize that concerns have been raised regarding some of the cuts \nthat NASA is proposing to pay for the President's exploration vision. \nIn order to pay for this new program, we must realize that there is \nlimited funding and that NASA funding has to be re-allocated. However, \nthis bill should not be construed as supporting each and every proposed \nreduction. Instead, the bill simply would authorize the funding levels \nbuy the major budget accounts.\n  Curiosity and a drive to explore have always been quintessential \nAmerican traits. This has been most evident in the space program, which \ncontinues to show great advances in human knowledge. However, we are \nfully aware of the inherent risks and costs of space exploration, and \nthe need to mitigate them wherever possible. Based on this knowledge, \nlet us now embark upon this great journey into the stars to find \nwhatever may await us.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and look forward to \nworking with them to ensure passage of this bill this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself and Mr. Edwards):\n  S. 2542. A bill to provide for review of determinations on whether \nschools and local educational agencies made adequate yearly progress \nfor the 2002-2003 school year taking into consideration subsequent \nregulations and guidance applicable to those determinations, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it's a privilege to join my colleagues in \nintroducing the No Child Left Behind Fairness Act. Our goal is to \nachieve accurate and fair determinations of accountability in current \nlaw. The bill does not change the accountability provisions of the law, \nbut it does require the Department of Education to play by its own \nrules in considering the progress of each school.\n\n[[Page S7011]]\n\n  The accountability provisions in the No Child Left Behind Act are \ncritical to accomplishing the goal of closing the achievement gap. \nBefore its enactment, many communities ignored the gaps between some \nchildren and others in school, even though some groups of students were \nconsistently falling behind. Communities are now beginning to provide \nthe help those schools need to meet higher standards for all students, \nsuch as better teacher training, better curriculums, and better support \nand attention.\n  It makes sense to identify schools as needing improvement. There's \nnothing wrong with shining a light on areas that need improvement--even \nin the best schools. That doesn't mean they are failures.\n  But for the accountability provisions in the law to be useful, they \nmust be accurate. We need accurate determinations of whether schools \nare making progress.\n  A full two years after passage of the No Child Left Behind Act, the \nDepartment of Education finally issued the regulations and guidance \nthat schools need to accurately calculate accountability under the law. \nThose rules were a step in the right direction. They specifically \naddressed the achievement of children with disabilities and limited \nEnglish proficient children.\n  The Department's rules were effective immediately, but many schools \nhad already made their evaluations for the year as best they could. \nThey shouldn't have had to make these assessments and calculations \nwithout adequate guidance. They certainly shouldn't be penalized for \nthe Department's delay in issuing this guidance.\n  So far, 28,000 schools have been identified by States as failing to \nmake adequate yearly progress. Many of those schools were identified in \nthe 2002-2003 school year, before the new rule were released. A number \nof schools and districts identified as failing to make adequate yearly \nprogress might have succeeded if the new rules had been in effect from \nthe start. The Department's delay in issuing adequate rules and \nguidance has created unnecessary confusion, caused a potential \nmislabeling of schools, and misdirected resources from the schools and \nstudents who actually need them.\n  Some States have asked the Department of Education for permission to \nreview their scores from last year under the new rules, and submit a \nmore accurate calculation of accountability. Many of us in Congress \nhave urged the Secretary of Education to apply the new regulations \nretroactively, so that States, school districts, and schools can review \nlast year's data\n  On accountability and correct it if necessary. The Secretary of \nEducation has refused, stating that he lacks the authority to do so.\n  This bill provides that authority. It enables the new regulations to \nbe applied retroactively, so that schools will be judged on the same \nstandards for the past year as they will be in the future, not by \ndifferent criteria for different years.\n  Schools across the country are struggling to comply with the \nrequirements of the No Child Left Behind Act. If we want schools to be \nheld accountable, we need to make the process fair. I urge my \ncolleagues to pass this legislation s soon as possible. Schools are \nwaiting for our response. They don't deserve an unfair burden in \ncomplying with the act and improving their schools.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2542\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``No Child Left Behind \n     Fairness Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to establish a program and criteria for National \nHeritage Areas in the United States, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. THOMAS: Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``National \nHeritage Partnership Act.'' The first Heritage area was created on \nAugust 24, 1984--the Illinois and Michigan National Heritage Corridor. \nLittle or no growth occurred in this program for the first 10 years. \nHowever, in the last couple of years the Congress has added 23 more \nHeritage areas!\n  The Park Service provides technical assistance and funding but \nHeritage areas are not National Parks. About 30 bills have been \nintroduced this Congress to study or designate new areas. There are no \nFederal guidelines requiring what a heritage bill must contain, the \nprogram has very little requirements and it is out of control.\n  As a result, I have conducted two oversight hearings in the National \nParks Subcommittee. I also had the General Accounting Office conduct a \nreview of Heritage Areas. The following concerns were identified: \nindividual areas are designated with specific legislation, but a \nNational Heritage Area Program does not exist in the National Park \nService; there are no official standards or criteria; existing heritage \nareas range in scope and size from ``Rivers of Steel'' in Pennsylvania \nto the entire State of Tennessee; the potential exists for unlimited \ndesignations which are impacting funding for other Park Service \nprograms; and oversight and accountability of funding is lacking.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation with the Chairman of the Interior \nAppropriations Subcommittee which will establish National Heritage Area \nguidelines and criteria. The bill considers the recommendations from \nthe GAO report about Heritage Areas and raises the standard for \ndesignation and requires specific criteria for national significance \nbefore an area can be designated. In addition, a cap has been placed on \nannual funding for the Heritage Area Program to avoid impacting other \nNational Park Service programs.\n  This program is out of control. We are continuing to put unnecessary \nfiscal and resource demands on the Park Service. We have no established \ncriteria to ensure the recognition of truly nationally significant \nareas. Consequently, we have compromised the integrity of all existing \nand future National Heritage Areas. I am pleased Senator Burns has \njoined me in this effort and I look forward to moving this bill through \nthe Senate in the near future.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2543\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the certification of programs to \nprovide uninsured employees of small businesses access to health \ncoverage, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Health \nCare Access for Small Businesses Act of 2004. I am pleased to be joined \nin this endeavor by my colleagues, Senator Lincoln and Michigan's \nsenior Senator Levin. My bill would help small businesses provide \nhealth coverage for their employees, an important first step in \nproviding access to health care for all Americans.\n  Last month, thousands of Americans participated in the annual Cover \nthe Uninsured week, a discussion about the urgent need to cover the \nuninsured. The sheer breadth of the groups that participated in the \nunprecedented effort demonstrates the urgency of this issue. Labor \nunions were united with business groups, doctors with nurses, and \ncharity health care providers with for-profit hospitals and insurance \ncompanies.\n  And yesterday, the consumer group Families USA and the governors of \nIowa, Kansas, and Maine released even more disturbing news. Using \nCensus Bureau data, they found that approximately 81.8 million \nAmericans--one out of three people under 65 years of age--were \nuninsured at some point of time for the past two years. Almost two-\nthirds were uninsured for six months or more; and over half were \nuninsured for at least nine months.\n  We need to stop having discussions and start finding solutions. Too \nmany hard working Americans are going without health insurance. There \nis a great misconception that uninsured Americans are largely \nunemployed or on welfare. That is simply not the case. More than 80 \npercent of uninsured Americans are part of working families, and almost \nhalf work for small businesses. If we can help small businesses cover \ntheir employees, we will have made great progress in covering the \nuninsured.\n  The bill I am introducing today is aimed at making coverage more \naffordable for employees of small businesses through what is called a \n``three-share'' program. It would not impose any new funding mandates \non state or local governments nor would it create new bureaucracy. It \nis an innovative community-based approach that could work throughout \nthe country.\n  And it's aimed at ensuring primary care services are more available. \nWe know that the primary care model through federally qualified health \ncenters has been a tremendous success. This would build on this success \nby empowering communities--health care providers, small businesses, \nchurches, civic groups--to form their own health care programs.\n\n  The three-share model is an innovative community-based idea that has \nbeen working across the U.S. from California to Arkansas to Maryland \nand, of course, Michigan. The name ``three-share'' stems from the \nprogram's payment structure. Premiums are shared between the employer \nwho pays 30 percent, the employee who pays 30 percent, and the \ncommunity which covers the remaining 40 percent of the cost.\n  In a three share model, a non-profit or local government entity \nserves as the manager of the plan. They design a benefit package by \nnegotiating directly with providers or contracting through an insurance \ncompany. Then, they recruit small businesses that have not offered \ninsurance coverage to their employees for the past year. The average \ncost for coverage is about $1,800 per year, much lower than the \nnational average for commercial insurance, which on average costs about \n$3,400 for a single person and $9,000 for a family, according to the \n2003 Kaiser survey of\n\n[[Page S7015]]\n\nemployer benefits. Of the $1,800, the employer and employee would each \npay approximately $540 and the community would pay about $720.\n  And they have been successful. For example, in Muskegon, Michigan, \nthe three-share program Access Health has been working with about 400 \nsmall businesses to cover some 1,500 uninsured full and part-time \nemployees. Wayne County has operated Health Choice for a decade. \nAlthough it is undergoing some changes, it has nearly 1,300 businesses \nenrolled and covers everyone from cab drivers, nail salon technicians, \nand nursing aides. Kent County, where Grand Rapids is located, began \nenrolling small businesses and employees in their program in 2002 and \nhope to grow to cover 2,500 individuals this year.\n  Different three share plans have received funds for the community \nportion from various places. In Michigan, most of the money has come \nfrom Medicaid funds. A plan in California uses money from the tobacco \nsettlement, while a plan in Arkansas raises funds through church events \nand other community initiatives.\n  Unfortunately, despite the nuances that distinguish three share plans \nfrom one another, they all share a common challenge: they all lack a \nstable and sustainable funding source for the community share. This \nbill will help provide a steady stream of funding and analyze what \nthree shares do right and how communities can develop their own three \nshare model programs.\n  Insuring more working families will also take the pressure off state \nMedicaid budgets. Adequate care for those presently uninsured will also \nhelp slash the billions that is spent on uncompensated care.\n  Providing health care for these families fulfills a moral commitment. \nNo one in America who gets up in the morning and goes to work should go \nto sleep at night fearful that an illness or injury in the family could \nwipe out everything they have worked hard for. This is a great nation, \nand together we can ensure that no American has to go without health \ncare again.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2544\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII and XIX of the Social Security \nAct and title III of the Public Health Service Act to improve access to \ninformation about individual's health care options and legal rights for \ncare near the end of life, to promote advance care planning and \ndecisionmaking so that individuals' wishes are known should they become \nunable to speak for themselves, to engage health care providers in \ndisseminating information about and assisting in the preparation of \nadvance directives, which include living wills and durable powers of \nattorney for health care, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by my \ncolleague and cosponsor Senator Jay Rockefeller as we introduce the \nAdvance Directives Improvement and Education Act of 2004. Senators \nRockefeller and Collins, along with Senator Wyden, sponsored a bill \nwith similar goals in the 107th Congress and have provided invaluable \nsupport and counsel in drafting the bill we introduce today.\n  The Advance Directives Improvement and Education Act of 2004 has a \nsimple purpose: to encourage all adults in America, especially those 65 \nand older, to think about, talk about and write down their wishes for \nmedical care near the end-of-life should they become unable to make \ndecisions for themselves. Advance directives, which include a living \nwill, stating the individual's preferences for care, and a power of \nattorney for health care, are critical documents that each of us should \nhave. The goal is clear, but reaching it requires that we educate the \npublic about the importance of advance directives, offer opportunities \nfor discussion of the issues, and reinforce the requirement that health \ncare providers honor patients' wishes. This bill is designed to do just \nthat.\n  Americans are afraid of death. We don't like to think about it, talk \nabout it, or plan for it. Any yet, we will all face it. Not only our \nown deaths, but our parents, siblings, friends, and sometimes, \ntragically, children. Today, most Americans face death unprepared. \nFamily members frequently end up making critical medical decisions for \nincapacitated patients, yet they, too, are unprepared. Only 15 to 20 \npercent of adults have advance directives. Among this group, many have \nnot discussed the contents of these important documents with their \nfamilies or even the person named as the health care proxy.\n  It is time to bring this discussion into the mainstream. Too much is \nat stake to continue to deny our mortality. You all know about the \ntragic situation going on in Florida with Terri Schiavo. Here is a \nyoung woman in a persistent vegetative state who is the subject of a \ndebate about her treatment between her husband and her parents, a \ndebate that has now become a court case and a legislative quagmire. \nWhy? Because she didn't write down what type of care she would want in \nthe event an accident, illness or other medical condition caused her to \nbe in an incapacitated state. She is young and didn't think about death \nor dying. If she had an advance directive that made her wishes clear \nand named a health care proxy to make decisions for her should she be \nunable to do so for herself, the treatment debate might continue, but \nthere would be no question as to who could decide. The Supreme Court \nhas clearly affirmed that competent adults have the right to refuse \nunwanted medical treatment Washington v. Glucksburg and Vacco v. Quill, \n1997, but it also stressed that advance directives are a means of \nsafeguarding that right should adults become incapable of deciding for \nthemselves.\n  Fortunately, situations like Mrs. Schiavo's are rare. Of the 2.5 \nmillion people who die each year 83 percent are Medicare beneficiaries. \nIn fact, 27 percent of Medicare expenditures cover care in the last \nyear of life. Remember, everyone who enrolls in Medicare will die on \nMedicare. The Advance Directives Improvement and Education Act \nencourages all Medicare beneficiaries to prepare advance directives by \nproviding a free physician office visit for the purpose of discussing \nend-of-life care choices and other issues around medical decision-\nmaking in a time of incapacitation. Physicians will be reimbursed for \nspending time with their patients to help them understand situations in \nwhich an advance directive would be useful, medical options, the \nMedicare hospice benefit and other concerns. The conversation will also \nenable phyisicans to learn about their patients' wishes, fears, \nreligious beliefs, and life experiences that might influence their \nmedical care wishes. These are important aspects of a physician-patient \nrelationship that are too often unaddressed.\n  Another part of our bill will provide funds for the Department of \nHealth and Human Services to conduct a public education campaign to \nraise awareness of the importance of planning for care near the end of \nlife. This campaign would explain what advance directives are, where \nthey are available, what questions need to be asked and answered, and \nwhat to do with the executed documents. HHS, directly or through \ngrants, would also establish an information clearinghouse where \nconsumers could receive state-specific information and consumer-\nfriendly documents and publications.\n  State-specific information is needed because in addition to the \nfederal Patients Self-Determination Act passed in 1990, most states \nalso have enacted advance directive laws. Because the state laws \ndiffer, some states may be reluctant to honor advance directives that \nwere executed in another state. The bill we introduce today contains \nlanguage that would make all advance directives ``portable,'' that is, \nuseful from one state to another. As long as the documents were \nlawfully executed in the state of origin, they must be accepted and \nhonored in the state in which they are presented, unless to do so would \nviolate state law.\n  All of the provisions in the Advance Directives Improvement and \nEducation Act of 2004 are there for one reason: to increase the number \nof people in the United States who have advance directives, who have \ndiscussed their wishes with their physicians and families, and who have \ngiven copies of the directives to their loved ones, health care \nproviders, and legal representatives.\n  Senator Rockefeller and I all believe that as our Medicare population \ngrows and life expectancy lengthens, improving care near the end of \nlife must be a priority. Helping people complete these critical \ndocuments is an essential part of making the final journey as \nmeaningful and peaceful as possible.\n  Over the next decade or two our elderly population will grow. Baby-\nboomers, used to having control of\n\n[[Page S7017]]\n\ntheir lives and demanding the best, will be stunned to discover that \ngood end-of-life care is hard to find. I recommend to all of you a \nreport called Means to a Better End: A Report on Dying in America Today \nthat was published in November 2002 by Last Acts Partnership. In it, \nevery state and the District of Columbia was rated on eight different \ncriteria to assess the state of end-of-life care in this country. Not \none state--not mine, not yours--received a high grade. Some did well in \none or two areas, but none did well in half or more of the measures; \nall were mediocre at best. The researchers found that too many people \nend their days in hospitals and nursing homes, attached to machines, \nalone, in pain. Doctors, not wanting to admit ``failure,'' as many of \nthem see death, urge aggressive treatments such as chemotherapy on \npatients who have little chance of responding to it. Pain medication is \noften underprescribed or withheld for fear that the dying patient--\ndying patient--might become addicted to the drug.\n\n  The good news is that growing numbers of health care providers, \nnonprofit organizations and consumer advocates recognize the need for \nchange. New palliative care programs, pain protocols and hospice \nservices are being instituted in facilities around the country. Another \nLast Acts Partnership publication, On the Road from Theory to Practice \nhighlights the best programs and practices for others to emulate.\n  This body is a legislative institution not a medical one--with the \nexception of the distinguished majority leader, of course. We cannot \nlegislate good medical care or compassion. What we can do, what I hope \nwe will do, is to enact this bill so that the American public can \nparticipate in improving end-of-life care--first, by filling out their \nown advice directives and talking to their families about them; and by \nraising their voices to demand that our health care systems honor their \nwishes and improve the way they care for people who are near the end of \nlife. If we can do that, we will have done a great deal.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  Mr. President, I also ask that a letter of support for this \nlegislation from the Last Acts Partnership also be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2545\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Advance \n     Directives Improvement and Education Act of 2004''.\n       (b) Table of Contents.--The table of contents of this Act \n     is as follows:\n\nSec. 1. Short title; table of contents.\nSec. 2. Findings and purposes.\nSec. 3. Medicare coverage of end-of-life planning consultations.\nSec. 4.

GAO studies and reports on end-of-life planning issues.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Every year 2,500,000 people die in the United States. \n     Eighty percent of those people die in institutions such as \n     hospitals, nursing homes, and other facilities. Chronic \n     illnesses, such as cancer and heart disease, account for 2 \n     out of every 3 deaths.\n       (2) In January 2004, a study published in the Journal of \n     the American Medical Association concluded that many people \n     dying in institutions have unmet medical, psychological, and \n     spiritual needs. Moreover, family members of decedents who \n     received care at home with hospice services were more likely \n     to report a favorable dying experience.\n       (3) In 1997, the Supreme Court of the United States, in its \n     decisions in Washington v. Glucksberg and Vacco v. Quill, \n     reaffirmed the constitutional right of competent adults to \n     refuse unwanted medical treatment. In those cases, the Court \n     stressed the use of advance directives as a means of \n     safeguarding that right should those adults become incapable \n     of deciding for themselves.\n       (4) A study published in 2002 estimated that the overall \n     prevalence of advance directives is between 15 and 20 percent \n     of the general population, despite the passage of the Patient \n     Self-Determination Act in 1990, which requires that health \n     care providers tell patients about advance directives.\n       (5) Competent adults should complete advance care plans \n     stipulating their health care decisions in the event that \n     they become unable to speak for themselves. Through the \n     execution of advance directives, including living wills and \n     durable powers of attorney for health care according to the \n     laws of the State in which they reside, individuals can \n     protect their right to express their wishes and have them \n     respected.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to improve \n     access to information about individuals' health care options \n     and legal rights for care near the end of life, to promote \n     advance care planning and decisionmaking so that individuals' \n     wishes are known should they become unable to speak for \n     themselves, to engage health care providers in disseminating \n     information about and assisting in the preparation of advance \n     directives, which include living wills and durable powers of \n     attorney for health care, and for other purposes.\n\n     SEC. 3.

We applaud your commitment to educating \n     Americans about the need for these critical documents and \n     support the goal of encouraging all Medicare beneficiaries to \n     discuss advance directives with their physicians and \n     families.\n       A life-threatening or terminal illness or a tragic accident \n     takes its toll not only on the patient but on his or her \n     family as well. After more than 60 years of working in the \n     end-of-life care field, Last Acts Partnership (formerly \n     Partnership for Caring and Choice in Dying) knows full well \n     how much worse it is when people are asked to make decisions \n     for a loved one having never discussed his or her wishes for \n     care at the end of life. Advance directives and the necessary \n     conversations that should accompany them are a gift to guide \n     those who find themselves responsible for another's care.\n       Ensuring that each of us receives the kind of care we want \n     if we are incapacitated or approaching death must be a policy \n     priority as we look to the future of health care. The \n     portability provision in your bill is another necessary step \n     toward that goal. Providing an information clearinghouse is \n     also key because too many people, including health care \n     providers, are unaware of options such as hospice and \n     palliative care, home care, spiritual counseling and other \n     resources.\n       Again, Senator, we thank you, your cosponsors, and all of \n     the senators who join in support of this important \n     legislation. Last Acts Partnership looks forward to assisting \n     you and your staff as it moves through the legislative \n     process. Our membership and our collegial organizations will \n     be working to support the passage of the ``Advance Directives \n     Improvement and Education Act of 2004'' and, more \n     importantly, to assure that the health care wishes of our \n     loved ones and ourselves will be honored.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                          Karen Orloff Kaplan,\n\n                                                    MSW, MPH, ScD,\n                                                President and CEO.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN:\n  S. 2546. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \nrequire premarket consultation and approval with respect to genetically \nengineered foods, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwill strengthen consumer confidence in the safety of genetically \nengineered food and genetically engineered animals that may enter the \nfood supply. This bill, known as the Genetically Engineered Food Act \n(GEFA) of 2004, requires the Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) \nto conduct an environmental and safety review of all genetically \nengineered plants and animals that may enter the food supply.\n  Our country has been blessed with one of the safest and most abundant \nfood supplies in the world but we can do better. Genetically engineered \nfoods have become a major portion of the American food supply and \npromise to become a larger part in the future. The next generation of \ngenetically engineered foods will be more complex, will possess more \nnovel genetic variations and will challenge regulatory agencies' \nability to assess and manage their food safety and potential \nenvironmental effects.\n  Currently, the FDA screens genetically engineered foods through a \nvoluntary consultation program. Despite assurances from the FDA for the \npast two years that the proposed and more stringent ``pre-market \nbiotechnology notification'' (PBN) rules governing genetically \nengineered foods were imminent, those rules have yet to appear.\n  The Genetically Engineered Food Act of 2004 will create a transparent \nprocess that promotes public participation as decisions are made \nregarding the safety and environmental impact of genetically engineered \nplants and animals.\n  This bill will make the review process mandatory in place of the \ncurrent voluntary system, which will reduce the chance that a \npotentially harmful product could bypass or receive inadequate \nregulatory oversight. The measure will establish unambiguous and \npredictable pathways for developers of genetically modified foods to \ngain approval to go to market and will ensure consumer confidence in \nthe integrity of the system through a fully transparent review process.\n  An improved regulatory system for genetically engineered foods will \nboost consumer confidence in biotechnology derived foods, give federal \nagencies clear legal authority to deal with new technology and provide \na process to detect problems even after genetically engineered foods \nare approved.\n  The Genetically Engineered Food Act of 2004 will strengthen \ngovernment oversight in several important ways.\n  Mandatory Review: Producers of genetically engineered foods will be \nrequired to receive approval from the FDA before introducing their \nproducts into interstate commerce. The FDA will ensure, based on the \nbest scientific evidence, that genetically engineered foods are just as \nsafe as comparable food products before allowing them on the market.\n  Public Involvement and Transparency: In order for our country to gain \nthe benefits that genetically engineered plants and animals can offer \nas additional sources of food, public confidence must be maintained in \nthe safety of these products. My bill will provide for public \ninvolvement in the approval process by providing information to \nconsumers, and giving them the opportunity to provide comments. Adding \ntransparency will increase the public's understanding and confidence in \nthe safety of these animals as they enter the food supply.\n  Scientific studies and other materials submitted to the FDA as part \nof the mandatory review of genetically engineered foods will be made \navailable for public review and comment. Members of the public will be \nable to submit any new information on genetically engineered foods not \npreviously available to the FDA and request a new review of a \nparticular genetically engineered food product even if that food is \nalready on the market.\n  Testing: The FDA, in conjunction with other Federal agencies, will be \ngiven the authority to conduct scientifically-sound testing to \ndetermine whether genetically engineered foods are inappropriately \nentering the food supply.\n  Communication: The FDA and other Federal agencies will establish a \nregistry of genetically engineered foods for easy access to information \nabout those foods that have been cleared for market. The genetically \nengineered food review process will be fully transparent to give the \npublic access to all non-confidential information.\n  Environmental Review with Respect to Animals: While genetically \nengineered foods such as corn and soybeans are already part of our food \nsupply, genetically engineered animals will also soon be ready for \nmarket approval. These animals hold much promise as an additional \nsource of food for our nation. However, we must ensure not only the \nsafety of these genetically engineered animals as they enter the food \nsupply, but also the impact of these animals as they come in contact \nwith the environment.\n  The provisions of my bill are consistent with the recommendations \nmade in the 2004 National Academy of Sciences report, ``Biological \nConfinement of Genetically Engineered Organisms''; the Pew Initiative \non Food and Biotechnology 2004 report, ``Issues in the Regulation of \nGenetically Engineered Plants and Animals''; and the 2004 report from \nthe Ecological Society of America, ``Genetically Engineered Organisms \nand the Environment''.\n  The FDA has a mandatory review process in place that is used to \nreview the food safety of genetically engineered animals before they \nenter the food supply. However, this bill will provide the FDA with \nadditional oversight authorities to address the potential environmental \nimpact of genetically engineered animals prior to their safety \napproval.\n  Environmental issues have been identified as a major science-based \nconcern associated with genetically engineered animals. Therefore, to \nobtain approval to market a genetically engineered animal, the \ndeveloper must include an environmental assessment that analyzes the \npotential effects of the genetically engineered animal on the \nenvironment. A plan must also be in place to reduce or eliminate any \nnegative effects. If the environmental assessment is not adequate, \napproval will not be granted.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort to strengthen consumer \nconfidence in the safety of genetically engineered foods and \ngenetically engineered animals that may enter the food supply. The \nGenetically Engineered Foods Act of 2004 will help provide the public \nwith the added assurance that\n\n[[Page S7020]]\n\ngenetically engineered foods and animals are safe to produce and \nconsume. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2546\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Genetically Engineered Foods \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) genetically engineered food is rapidly becoming an \n     integral part of domestic and international food supplies;\n       (2) the potential positive effects of genetically \n     engineered foods are enormous;\n       (3) the potential for both anticipated and unanticipated \n     effects exists with genetic engineering of foods;\n       (4) genetically engineered food not approved for human \n     consumption has, in the past, entered the human food supply;\n       (5) environmental issues have been identified as a major \n     science-based concern associated with animal biotechnology;\n       (6) it is essential to maintain--\n       (A) public confidence in--\n       (i) the safety of the food supply; and\n       (ii) the ability of the Federal Government to exercise \n     adequate oversight of genetically engineered foods; and\n       (B) the ability of agricultural producers and other food \n     producers of the United States to market, domestically and \n     internationally, foods that have been genetically engineered;\n       (7) public confidence can best be maintained through \n     careful review and formal determination of the safety of \n     genetically engineered foods, and monitoring of the positive \n     and negative effects of genetically engineered foods as the \n     foods become integrated into the food supply, through a \n     review and monitoring process that--\n       (A) is scientifically sound, open, and transparent;\n       (B) fully involves the general public; and\n       (C) does not subject most genetically engineered foods to \n     the lengthy food additive approval process; and\n       (8) because genetically engineered foods are developed \n     worldwide and imported into the United States, it is \n     imperative that imported genetically engineered food be \n     subject to the same level of oversight as domestic \n     genetically engineered food.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Con. Res. 119\n\n       Whereas suicide is one of the most disruptive and tragic \n     events a family and a community can experience, and it occurs \n     at a national rate of 30,000 suicides annually;\n       Whereas suicide is the fastest growing cause of death among \n     youths and the second leading cause of death among college \n     students;\n       Whereas suicide kills youths 6 to 9 times more often than \n     homicide;\n       Whereas research shows that 95 percent of all suicides are \n     preventable;\n       Whereas research shows that the prevention of suicide must \n     be recognized as a national priority;\n       Whereas community awareness and education will encourage \n     the development of strategies to prevent suicide;\n       Whereas during the 105th Congress, both the Senate and the \n     House of Representatives unanimously agreed to resolutions \n     recognizing suicide as a national problem and declaring \n     suicide prevention programs to be a national priority (Senate \n     Resolution 84, 105th Congress, agreed to May 6, 1997, and \n     House of Representatives Resolution 212, 105th Congress, \n     agreed to October 9, 1998);\n       Whereas the yellow ribbon is rapidly becoming recognized \n     internationally as the symbol for the awareness and \n     prevention of suicide, and it is recognized and used by \n     suicide prevention groups, crisis centers, schools, churches, \n     youth centers, hospitals, counselors, teachers, parents, and \n     especially youth themselves; and\n       Whereas the week beginning September 19, 2004, should be \n     recognized as Yellow Ribbon Suicide Awareness and Prevention \n     Week: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) recognizes that the need to increase awareness about \n     and prevent suicide is a compelling national priority;\n\n[[Page S7024]]\n\n       (2) reaffirms the commitment of Congress to the priorities \n     expressed by the 105th Congress, in Senate Resolution 84 and \n     House Resolution 212, to continue to recognize suicide \n     prevention as a national priority; and\n       (3) encourages Americans, communities, and the Nation to \n     work to increase awareness about and prevent suicide.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am proud to be joined by 5 of my \ncolleagues in submitting a resolution declaring the week of September \n19, 2004, as Yellow Ribbon Suicide Awareness and Prevention Week \ndedicated to raising awareness about suicide and suicide prevention \nprograms.\n  Suicide is a national tragedy that impacts the lives of millions of \nAmerican families. According to the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention (CDC), suicide is the eleventh leading cause of all deaths \nin America, and the third such cause of death for young folks ages 10 \nto 24. And, unfortunately, Colorado has one of the highest suicide \nrates in the Nation.\n  Research shows that 95 percent of all suicides are preventable, and \nat the local, State, and Federal level, suicide prevention programs are \nbecoming an important priority. On the Federal level, for example, the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services recently developed the National \nStrategy for Suicide Prevention.\n  One suicide prevention program, that has saved more than 2,500 lives \nis the Yellow Ribbon Suicide Prevention Program, founded in 1994 by \nColoradans Dale and Dar Emme after their son, Mike, tragically took his \nown life. The program encourages youngsters, parents, and teachers to \ntalk about suicide and emphasizes the use of a ``link'' card which \nyoung folks can carry with them and give to a friend, parent, or \nteacher if they are in need of assistance.\n  With local programs throughout the United States and programs in 47 \ncountries, the Yellow Ribbon Suicide Prevention Program is used by \ncrisis centers, schools, churches, and youth centers. And, the Yellow \nRibbon Suicide Prevention Program has the endorsement of various State \nhealth departments and various State education departments and the \nAmerican Osteopathic Association. And, the yellow ribbon has become the \ninternational symbol for suicide prevention and awareness.\n  I believe that community-based efforts and programs like the Yellow \nRibbon Suicide Prevention Program, as well as attentive parents, \nteachers, and friends can make all the difference to someone who is \ndesperate but does not know how to ask for help or where to turn.\n  Let's work together to make suicide prevention a national priority.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/17/senate-section/article/S7024-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7024]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3453.

Mr. President, in a few moments, we will be closing for \nthe evening after a very productive day, but before doing that, I wish \nto make a few comments on an issue that is very close to my heart, and \nit concerns the wonderful continent of Africa.\n  I have had the opportunity to work for periods of time in Africa as \npart of my former profession--medicine--and as part of medical mission \nwork. Indeed, in the last year, I had the opportunity to travel to \nAfrica, to the Sudan where I have really been able to capture what I \nlove so much in delivering health care. I was in Kenya, Mozambique, \nBotswana, South Africa, and Namibia this past year. So, obviously, I am \nspeaking about a continent that is close to me.\n  As I traveled through Africa, whether doing medical mission work or \nas a Senator on the part of official delegations, I have had the \nopportunity to observe the huge impact legislation that was passed in \nthis Chamber now 4 years ago has had. It is called the African Growth \nand Opportunity Act, which is a critical trade measure that has \nbenefited thousands and thousands of Africans and given them hope and \nan outlet for productive activity which paints a much brighter future. \nIt is a trade measure that helps Africans, it helps the United States, \nand I believe strongly it helps all of humanity.\n  Congress passed the African Growth and Opportunity Act 4 years ago \nwith strong bipartisan support in this body. It was signed into law by \nPresident Clinton. Since that time, it has created about 150,000 new \njobs and maybe even more than that. President Museveni from Uganda was \nin my office 2 days ago, and he believes 150,000 is an underestimate; \nthe real figure may be more like 250,000 or 300,000 jobs.\n  Investors, because of this act, have poured about $340 million in new \nprivate investment into Africa, and because of this investment in \nAfrica, there have been new opportunities for U.S. businesses.\n  The African Growth and Opportunity Act--most people know it as AGOA--\nhas given many countries in the continent--and not all have taken \nadvantage of it, but many have--an opportunity to compete on a more \nlevel playing field with nations throughout the world, such as China.\n  The reason I come to the floor of the Senate tonight to take a few \nminutes is because these gains could be lost if this body does not act \non what we call the AGOA Acceleration Act of 2004. This act has a lot \nof provisions. It has just been introduced in the Senate, but several \nprovisions, if we do not act in this current bill, are set to expire in \nSeptember of this year and, thus, that is why we need to act now, or \nact in the very near future. Hundreds of millions of dollars of \ninvestments in the continent of Africa are at stake, and hundreds of \nthousands of Africans, many of whom are living in the poorest parts of \nthe world, could lose their jobs.\n  So I hope my colleagues--and I have had the opportunity to talk to a \nnumber of them over the course of today and yesterday--will work \ntogether collectively so we can move this very important bill forward. \nThe bill has the strong support of this administration and the strong \nsupport of both sides of the aisle.\n  I spoke with the Democratic leader about the bill, and I know that he \nfeels very strongly about it as well. It was approved by the House of \nRepresentatives last week by voice vote. I encourage my colleagues to \nboth look at and support this important bill. It will make a huge \ndifference in the lives of Africans. I hope we can address that bill in \nthe near future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/17/senate-section/article/S7027-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nimmediately proceed to executive session to consider the following \nnomination on today's Executive Calendar, Alan Greenspan, which was \nreported by the Banking Committee today. I further ask unanimous \nconsent that the nomination be confirmed, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, the President be immediately notified of the \nSenate's action, and the Senate then return to legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The nomination considered and confirmed is as follows:\n\n\n                         federal reserve system\n\n       Alan Greenspan, of New York, to be Chairman of the Board of \n     Governors of the Federal Reserve System for a term of four \n     years.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today the Senate has confirmed the \nnomination of Alan Greenspan to continue for yet another term as \nchairman of the Federal Reserve Board. While I did not force the Senate \nto take a rollcall vote on the matter, I do want to make it clear for \nthe record that had such a vote been taken, I would have opposed Mr. \nGreenspan's confirmation.\n  I hold Chairman Greenspan in high regard as a dedicated public \nservant; however, I am concerned that the economic objectives that Mr. \nGreenspan aims to advance all too often come at the expense of \nAmericans who are too young, too old, or too poor to belong to the \ninvestor class. During earlier years of his tenure, I worried that his \nslow-growth, high-interest manipulation of monetary policy hurt \nAmerican workers. This year, my concerns about his decisions as \nChairman grew to alarm. I was stunned to read that Mr. Greenspan \nsupported the President's tax cuts for the wealthiest people and \ncorporations among us, while at the same time predicting that growing \nFederal budget deficits and the retirement of baby boomers would \nrequire cuts in Social Security and Medicare. It was particularly \nshocking given his enthusiastic support for deficit reduction during \nthe Clinton administration.\n  Our economy is becoming deeply and disturbingly stratefied, and it is \neating away at our country. Our fiscal policy and the monetary policy \nthat Chairman Greenspan has steered have created a gulf separating the \nhaves and have-nots in America, a gulf so wide that it seems like even \na lifetime of dedicated and hard work can no longer guarantee Americans \na ticket into the middle class. I worry that if we do not try to \ncorrect our economic policy and return it to a fairer and more just \ncourse, we will not be holding true to our promise of affording \nopportunity to everyone.\n  I am pleased to see that at last the economy is beginning to show \nsigns of growth and job creation. However, it is essential that we pay \nattention to whether that prosperity is shared by more than just a \nsmall handful of people occupying the top rungs of our economic ladder. \nWe need to make sure that our economic prosperity doesn't come at the \nexpense of elderly people depending on Social Security or young people \ntrying to get a start in the job market. I believe that we need someone \nat the helm of the Federal Reserve who gives these matters the regard \nthat they deserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/17/senate-section/article/S7027-3", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
